<HD>Routine Trip Into Uncharted Waters</HD>
<DH>UCLA's Dr. Jorge Lazareff says sticking to his usual habits
helped him prepare for complex surgery to separate conjoined twins.
The 'unknowns' made the surgery difficult.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of the high-risk surgery to separate 1-year-old conjoined
twins from Guatemala captured the hearts of many around the world
last week.</LD>
<LD>   As of Friday, Maria Teresa and Maria de Jesus Quiej Alvarez, who
shared a skull and several important blood vessels, were faring well.
Doctors say their road to full recovery will be a long one.</LD>
<LD>   During the 22-hour surgery at Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA,
a team of reconstructive and neurosurgeons cut through their skull,
redirected veins and covered their exposed brains with skin.</LD>
<TE>   While the story made international headlines and drew scores of
reporters to UCLA's Westwood campus, Dr. Jorge Lazareff--a pediatric
neurosurgeon who paved the way for the twins to come to the hospital
for the surgery--tried to maintain his usual routine last Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The day before, he had helped his son, a UCLA student, move into
an apartment. The morning of the surgery, he woke at 6:30, drove to
work, checked his mail and looked in on patients. Then, at about 8
a.m., he stepped into the operating room with Dr. Henry Kawamoto Jr.,
a specialist in reconstructive plastic surgery, beginning the twins'
journey toward independence.</TE>
<TE>   Lazareff's role in coordinating the twins' care is not the first
time he has donated his services. As director of pediatric
neurosurgery at Mattel Children's Hospital at UCLA, Lazareff has made
numerous trips to Guatemala and Romania as part of medical teams
performing free surgeries on children with neurological diseases.</TE>
<TE>   The 49-year-old says he is motivated by a desire to draw attention
to the plight of children suffering from treatable disorders such as
cleft palate or pediatric hydrocephalus, a condition that causes the
head to swell. In places where it's a struggle to meet basic medical
needs, treating these nonfatal conditions can be a luxury.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in Argentina, born to a Russian father and Czech
mother. He earned his medical degree from the Universidad Nacional de
Buenos Aires. Before he joined the UCLA staff in 1993, he was chief
of neurosurgery at the Hospital Infantil De Mexico Federico Gomez in
Mexico City. A Dante buff, Lazareff is rereading "The Divine Comedy"
in Spanish. His UCLA Medical Center office is decorated with
snapshots of patients and the Guatemalan children he has treated over
the years.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview a couple days after the twins' surgery, he spoke
with a Times reporter about his inspiration and motivation.</TE>
<TE>   Question: How did you prepare for the physical demands of a
surgery that lasted 22 hours?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Personally, nothing. My son will be a sophomore at UCLA.
He rented an apartment, and I was helping him move. I will stress,
each patient is an individual. The child I'm going to operate on
tomorrow is as important as were the twins.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What was running through your mind right before the surgery
began?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was blank, nothing: Just let's go to the car, let's start
the car, park it in the UCLA lot, walk here, answer the mail, go to
the O.R., check out how things are doing. One step at a time. In that
manner, you start being efficient. [There was] some level of anxiety
and some level of uncertainty, but it was overcome by just doing one
thing at a time. Let's go down to the O.R., let's see where they are
... let's go back to do rounds on the other patients. And then the
procedure already started.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What did you tell the family when you met with them Saturday
before the surgery?</TE>
<TE>   A: I talked to them in Spanish. Although my Spanish may have some
innuendos that are different from theirs, we went precisely to the
point. I told them that we have four possibilities: both of the girls
dying, one of them dying, both of them alive and well, and both of
them alive but severely impaired. I did not do the statistics--10%,
50% or 70%. There were four possibilities. Each one of them, if it
happens, will be 100% for that particular child or for those
children. Shall we go, or shall we wait, shall we postpone, what
shall we do now? And they said, go ahead, because they had faith in
God.... It was a brief, succinct, straight-to-the-point conversation.</TE>
<TE>   Q: From a technical standpoint, how did the surgery on the twin
girls compare to other surgeries you've performed?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's not necessarily the most difficult surgery we've
performed. Certainly, there are surgeries on the brain stem that
involve much more sophistication than the actual separation entails.
I don't want to minimize it. This was a difficult surgery because of
the unknowns, because we were going into uncharted territory.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What kind of life would the children have had if they remained
conjoined?</TE>
<TE>   A: The surgery needed to be done because of quality of life of
those children--those children will not be able to walk. They were
conjoined in such a manner that they were condemned to roll, if they
wanted to roll from one corner of the room to the other. They would
never be able to sit at a table, they would never be able to go to a
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the conjoined twins are conjoined at the chest. The
classical Siamese brothers, everyone knows of them, from the 19th
century, they were able to earn a livelihood, and they were able to
marry and have a family. They were able to ambulate. They were able
to do the most basic human capabilities: walking upright. And the
upright walking provides you a three-dimensional perception of space
and enhances your motor ability to perform a series of tasks.</TE>
<TE>   They come with a normal brain that receives a constant stimulus
from the environment when you are walking upright. And you spread
your hands and you go from one point to another point. Those things
would have been completely denied to those children.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You devote a lot of your time to assisting children from
developing nations. What inspires you to do that?</TE>
<TE>   A: I don't know exactly. Basically, it is similar to why, when you
write, you just try to find the best adverb to remove the dangling
participle, why you put a semicolon instead of a colon. You just try
to improve what you're doing. The same principle that drives you to
do very good work ... the very best that you can.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You have a family. How do you relate to this situation, having
children of your own?</TE>
<TE>   A: My son was born when I was in the last year of my training, and
my perception as a physician changed immediately. To have children
certainly enhances your understanding of the problems of other
parents, particularly when you are going into pediatrics.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean there aren't excellent pediatricians or
pediatric specialists who do not have children. In my case, having
children helped a lot my understanding of the parents of my patients.</TE>

<HD>To Dandruff Scientists, a Problem Itching for a Solution</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Science has sent people to the moon; built an artificial heart;
created genetically engineered, insect-resistant grains --and yet it
finds some nuts hard to crack. Like, what exactly causes dandruff?</LD>
<LD>   It's been a real head-scratcher. Some scientists and doctors have
posited that the unsightly flaking is caused by tiny yeasts that grow
on people's heads. Certainly, such yeasts do grow there. (The French
scientist who first identified some of them more than 100 years ago,
Louis Charles Malassez, has the dubious honor of having the fungi
named after him.)</LD>
<LD>   Others have suggested that dandruff is caused by inflammation of
the scalp--leading to faster division of skin cells and a nice flaky
environment that the yeasts simply love to grow on.</LD>
<TE>   After all these years and who can guess how many billion flakes
cascading down on imprudently selected black jackets, scientists
still don't know for sure--but it's not for want of effort. Dandruff
may not command the dollars thrown at cancer research or AIDS, but
you'll find hundreds of earnest and un-flaky articles on the topic in
the dermatology journals. And there are whole labs dedicated to
dandruff science, generally at companies that make anti-dandruff
shampoos.</TE>
<TE>   "Procter &amp; Gamble has a real commitment to understand the biology
of dandruff," solemnly declares Thomas Dawson Jr., senior scientist
in the Cincinnati company's anti-dandruff laboratory. At any one
time, he says, 30 to 40 scientists will be slaving away on dandruff
studies--recruiting people with dandruff off the streets, taking
swabs of their scalp flakes, washing their heads in this or that
anti-dandruff formulation and carefully measuring changes in flake
production.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere at the company, microbiologists will be carefully
coaxing the fungi found on flakes to grow in nutrients laced with
heavy cream or olive oil (to mimic the oils of the scalp that these
yeasts so adore). They'll be using high-tech DNA methods to identify
the fungi growing on heads and sophisticated lipid chemistry to
pinpoint any changes in scalp oils.</TE>
<TE>   Such single-minded dedication, at Procter &amp; Gamble and elsewhere,
appears to be bearing some fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson's team, for instance, recently reported that the yeast long
suspected to be a dandruff culprit is unlikely to be so. True, you
can take some flakes off someone's head and this yeast--Malassezia
furfur--will grow up nicely on your cream- or oil-laden petri dishes.</TE>
<TE>   But when Dawson's team used DNA analysis to figure out what yeasts
were in dandruff, they found hardly a trace of Malassezia furfur,
while two other species--Malassezia restricta and Malassezia
globosa--were abundant. The only reason that M. furfur shows up so
often is because it can grow on the petri dishes. The other two
yeasts are far too picky to sup on mere cream or olive oil: They want
human grease.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, says Dawson, if you wash flaky scalps with
anti-fungal shampoo, not only does the flaking die down, but these
two fungi go away as well--implying they really are the culprits in
dandruff.</TE>
<TE>   Still, yeast isn't everything. Scalp inflammation is probably
central too. The yeasts, suggests Dawson, first take up residence on
the scalp. They feast merrily on the oils on our heads, chopping them
up into little fatty acids, ingesting the fatty acids they like and
littering our scalps with the ones they can't stand, like so many
discarded banana peels or cheese rinds. One of these fatty
acids--oleic acid--builds up on the scalp.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, inflames the skin and sends it into cells-division
overdrive. And presto! Dandruff results.</TE>
<TE>   Even this can't be the whole story because yeasts live on lots and
lots of scalps and not everyone has dandruff.</TE>
<TE>   Plus there's a huge variation in dandruff severity (scientists
have careful scales, or "scalp scores," to measure degree of
flaking). There must be something about different people's heads that
causes one person to end up with dandruff while another lucky chap's
pate doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   And dandruff waxes and wanes in unpredictable ways, notes Dr.
David Voron, an Arcadia dermatologist and clinical professor of
dermatology at USC's Keck School of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "It can go away for weeks and months--in some patients even for
years," he says. "And then it will just come back."</TE>

<LD>Studies have shown that people with sleep apnea are at risk for a
host of chronic health problems, including cardiovascular disease.
But whether sleep apnea--a temporary disruption of breathing during
sleep--actually leads to the more serious health problem has not been
investigated.</LD>
<LD>   Now Swedish researchers who followed a group of 182 men with the
breathing disorder found that at least one cardiovascular problem
occurred in about a third of them during a seven-year period. The
study also found that the men with sleep apnea--who were otherwise
healthy--were five times more likely to suffer from heart disease
than men without the disorder.</LD>
<LD>   The good news in the study was that when sleep apnea was
effectively treated, the risk of heart disease dropped. Treatment in
this study included use of a breathing device that provides
continuous positive airway pressure, surgery to remove obstructing
tissue or a special mouth appliance to ease breathing.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers at Sahlgrenska University Hospital in Gothenburg
say the results of their study suggest that even mild forms of sleep
apnea should be treated.</TE>
<TE>   The incidence of cardiovascular disease in middle-aged women with
sleep apnea was also high, but because of the small number of women
in the study, the researchers didn't include them in their final
analysis.</TE>

<TE>   Sinus Problems? You May Want to Hum a Few Bars</TE>
<TE>   "Hum a tune and call me in the morning" may one day be a common
prescription for treating sinus problems. New research shows that a
daily humming exercise could turn out to be the best way to prevent
sinus infections. Specialists in Sweden report that airflow between
the nose and a connecting sinus increased 15-fold when 10 healthy men
exhaled while humming compared with when they exhaled silently.</TE>
<TE>   During normal breathing, nitric oxide gas produced in the sinuses
passes through a tiny opening into the nasal passageway, where it is
exhaled. Researchers Eddie Weitzberg and Jon Lundberg, of the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, were investigating a method for
measuring the flow of nitric oxide when they discovered that humming
made a dramatic difference.</TE>
<TE>   One of the major influences in the flow of gas from the sinus
cavity to the nose is the size of the tiny opening between them. When
a person has an infection, swelling of the sinus makes that opening
even smaller, blocking the flow of the gas and accumulated fluid.
Current treatments such as decongestants, irrigations and, sometimes,
surgery encourage drainage of the fluid.</TE>
<TE>   In the Swedish experiments Weitzberg and Lundberg found that
nearly all the gas content of in the maxillary sinuses, those tucked
under the cheekbones, flowed out of the cavity when patients hummed
for five seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers said more study is needed before doctors can recommend
that sinusitis sufferers begin humming for relief.</TE>

<TE>   Fibromyalgia Patients Benefit From Aerobic Exercise</TE>
<TE>   The simplest, least expensive and most effective treatment for
fibromyalgia may be aerobic exercise, according to a new study by
British rheumatologists. After three months of participation in an
exercise program, 35% of men and women with the chronic muscular and
joint pain rated their discomfort as much better. A year later, the
benefits were maintained or improved.</TE>
<TE>   The results of this study are especially important considering
that people with fibromyalgia often are concerned that physical
activity will make their pain worse.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 men and women with fibromyalgia but no other health
problems were randomly assigned to a 12-week program of twice-a-week
group classes of aerobic exercise such as treadmill walking, circuit
training or stationary cycling, or non-aerobic activity such as
relaxation and stretching. The intensity of the aerobic workouts was
gradually increased over time.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies have shown that exercise can benefit people with
fibromyalgia over a matter of weeks or a few months. This is the
first scientifically rigorous study to track results for a year.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers said the exercises done in the study could be
performed at most fitness centers and did not require instruction by
fitness specialists trained to work with sick persons.</TE>
<TE>   People with fibromyalgia should "start low and go slow," says Dr.
Selwyn C.M. Richards, professor of clinical rheumatology at King's
College Hospital in London. People with severe muscle pain might want
to start with water exercises, he said.</TE>

<TE>   Thong Underwear: Just Risque, or Risky Too?</TE>
<TE>   Thong underwear may be sexy, but can it also pose a health risk,
especially to women who are prone to vaginal and urinary tract
infections?</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jill Maura Rabin, chief of uro-gynecology at Long Island
Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., advises patients prone
to such infections to stop wearing thong underwear. That includes
women with diabetes or who have compromised immunity for any reason.
Women with a history of sexually transmitted disease and chronic
bladder infections such as interstitial cystitis are better off with
regular cotton underwear, she says.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1985, said Rabin, there have been various reports in medical
publications that vaginal and urinary tract infections are more
frequent in women who wear tight underwear, pantyhose and tampons.
The thong, she believes, should be added to this list.</TE>
<TE>   Rabin said that when a thong doesn't fit perfectly, it can move
forward just enough to spread bacteria and cause an infection. Having
intercourse while wearing a thong is especially risky in terms of
triggering an infection, she says.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent article in American Medical News, a publication of the
American Medical Assn., Rabin likened the thong's narrow cloth strip
to a little subway car that carries bacteria from one area to
another.</TE>
<TE>   Some women have no problem with thongs, but Rabin advises those
over 40 to leave thongs to younger women. "As estrogen levels drop,"
she says, "the acid balance of the vagina changes, making the area
more hospitable to infection-causing bacteria."</TE>
<TE>   She also advises women not to wear a thong while working out.</TE>

<HD>Blood Thinner Can Be Risky</HD>
<DH>Drugs* Chick Hearn took Coumadin, which reduces stroke odds
but makes bleeding harder to stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE E. ALLEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When 85-year-old Laker sportscaster Chick Hearn fell at home
recently, hitting his head on concrete, he began hemorrhaging.
Surgeons were unable to save him because pooled blood had damaged his
brain.</LD>
<LD>   Like hundreds of thousands of Americans, Hearn took the
blood-thinner Coumadin to protect against a stroke. But Coumadin
makes bleeding hard to stop and, as a result, falls become riskier.</LD>
<LD>   Although brain injury is always a problem--especially for an
elderly person whose blood vessels already are fragile--"certainly it
would be made worse being on anticoagulants," said Dr. Jack
Patterson, Hearn's cardiologist.</LD>
<TE>   Coumadin, the brand name for the oral drug warfarin, interferes
with various chemicals in the blood that make it clot. It's a
big-selling drug, with annual sales of $553 million for Coumadin and
its generic last year, according to IMS Health, a healthcare
information company. No other anticoagulant works in quite the same
way; aspirin, for example, interferes with blood platelets' ability
to stick together.</TE>
<TE>   It's an essential medication for patients at high risk for blood
clots in the heart, legs or lungs, which can eventually lodge in the
brain, causing a stroke. Those include patients like Hearn, who took
the anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation, a rhythm abnormality in
which the heart's upper chambers, or atria, quiver but don't pump
blood, creating the risk that sluggish blood could clump and travel
to the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Coumadin is also prescribed for patients whose faulty heart valves
have been replaced with metallic valves, those with knee or hip
replacements, those who previously had a stroke from a clot (as
opposed to a stroke caused by a hemorrhage), and those who have had
clots in the legs that broke off and lodged in the lungs.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest downside to the blood-thinner is that patients have a
2% to 3% annual risk of serious bleeding, said Dr. Lawrence L.K.
Leung, chief of hematology at Stanford University Medical School. A
fall or head trauma can exacerbate bleeding. But often the patients
who most need Coumadin to prevent strokes and heart attacks are
frail, have existing orthopedic problems or take other medications
that can interfere with balance.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's one medication that I dislike and am always hesitant
in using, it's Coumadin," said Dr. P.K. Shah, chairman of cardiology
at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. "But unfortunately, when it's needed,
there is no substitute, and that is a real problem. The
pharmaceutical industry has not been successful so far in finding a
safer, hassle-free alternative."</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of patients on the medication have nosebleeds, Leung
said. Bleeding can occur in any joint or tissue, and some patients
find blood in the stool, a sign of bleeding in the stomach and
intestines, or in the urine, a sign of spontaneous bleeding in the
kidneys. Only about 0.5% of patients have serious bleeding inside the
skull, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The drug also poses a very small risk of necrosis, a type of
gangrene in skin of the chest and arms.</TE>
<TE>   Patients must have their blood tested frequently to avoid
excessive thinning. Once they're stabilized, they're tested every two
to four weeks to measure how long it takes their blood to clot.
Patients need to be careful about potential interactions with
prescription and over-the-counter medications, as well as some
vitamins. For example, antibiotics, aspirin and some nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs other than ibuprofen and naproxen, can overly
thin their blood. Barbiturates and foods high in Vitamin K, like
broccoli and spinach, can make them less sensitive to Coumadin. If
they must undergo surgery, their doctors stop the drug beforehand,
then carefully resume it after surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Patients taking anticoagulants typically are advised to avoid
activities that put them at risk of major injury--like contact or
competitive sports--and to watch out for slippery floors. But, Shah
said, "you cannot put a shield around your body. You're always taking
a certain amount of risk." He noted that many patients take the
medication without experiencing problems.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Asher Taban, the neurosurgeon who operated on Hearn, said the
sportscaster suffered from small bruises that are typical of patients
on Coumadin and that he reportedly told his wife the morning of his
injury that he wanted to stop taking the drug.</TE>
<TE>   But Patterson, a private cardiologist in the San Fernando Valley
who had treated Hearn for about a decade, said the sportscaster had
never before had any major bleeding problems with Coumadin.</TE>
<TE>   Although patients sometimes express fear about taking it, he said,
those with atrial fibrillation and no other heart disease have a 5%
chance of suffering a stroke each year; Coumadin reduces that risk to
less than 1%.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a shame if people who need Coumadin stopped taking
Coumadin," Patterson said.</TE>

<TE>   Who Needs It</TE>
<TE>   Despite its risks, Coumadin (warfarin) is an essential drug for
four types of patients, doctors say:</TE>
<TE>   * Those who have a heart rhythm problem called atrial
fibrillation. (Laker broadcaster Chick Hearn took it for that
reason.)</TE>
<TE>   * Those who have suffered a stroke caused by clots.</TE>
<TE>   * Those with clots in the legs that traveled to the lung.</TE>
<TE>   * Those who have undergone hip or knee replacement.</TE>

<HD>If You Must Scream for Ice Cream, Scream Wisely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY SQUIRES</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a scorching summer day, and it's time to cool off with something
frozen and delicious. Yet many ice-cold treats come packed with
saturated fat, sugar and calories you don't need.</LD>
<LD>   Happily, there are plenty of smart and nutritious choices among
frozen confections.</LD>
<LD>   Let's start with portion size, where much of the peril lies. For
most frozen desserts, the serving size is half a cup. This is about
one scoop of ice cream--far less than the typical human wants or eats
at a time, whether it's an afternoon snack or an evening dessert.</LD>
<TE>   If you can hold yourself to half a cup of practically anything,
you can't do too much harm. For example, you can choose something as
rich and gooey as Dreyer's Grand Chocolate Caramel Swirl and get just
170 calories and 9 grams of fat, six of them saturated, in a half-cup
serving. But suppose you have three scoops, enough to half-fill that
cereal bowl you're serving it in. Suddenly you're adding 510 calories
and 27 grams of fat to your day.</TE>
<TE>   One trick for serving such treats at home is to use ramekins,
those small circular ceramic dishes. It's a handy way to control
serving size, especially compared with those cereal bowls.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't have 4-ounce ramekins, use small coffee cups.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it does matter what you're putting in that cup--or on
that stick. Fudgsicles, for instance, pack just 90 calories and 1
gram of fat; Smart Ones chocolate mousse bars have about half that.</TE>
<TE>   Following is a guide that will help you navigate some of the more
popular home and in-store frozen indulgences.</TE>
<TE>   * Baskin-Robbins: If the gang is headed to one of these stores,
pick the low-fat ice cream, ices and soft-serve yogurt, which have
just a fraction of the fat and calories of the regular 31 flavors. A
scoop of low-fat espresso 'n cream has 180 calories and just 2.5
grams of fat, only half of it saturated. Peach sorbet is 110
calories, with zero fat. But avoid the shakes, which can contain up
to 750 calories and 43 grams of fat.</TE>
<TE>   * Breyers: This popular home brand has several healthy choices,
including frozen yogurt, which ranges from about 130 to 140 calories
per serving and has less than five grams of fat, including three or
less as saturated fat. Fruit sherbet shaves a few more calories and
has just 1.5 grams of fat per serving. For something extra, try
calcium-rich vanilla ice cream, which supplies as much of this
bone-building mineral as a glass of skim milk, although it packs
seven grams of fat, four of them saturated.</TE>
<TE>   * Dairy Queen: For just 100 calories and no fat, indulge in a
nonfat frozen yogurt cup. Other low-fat choices include: a small
Strawberry Breeze (320 calories, less than 1 gram of fat), a DQ Fudge
Bar (50 calories, no fat), a Lemon DQ Freez'r (80 calories, no fat)
and a medium yogurt cone (260 calories, 1 gram of fat).</TE>
<TE>   * Good Humor: The Sundae Twist provides 160 calories and just 2.5
grams of fat, two of them saturated. Other cool choices: Great White,
a lemon ice with 70 calories and no fat; Hyper Stripe with swirls of
cherry, blue raspberry and lemon ice, 90 calories.</TE>
<TE>   * Haagen-Dazs: Beware the full-fat premium flavors and try the
low-fat yogurts and sorbets. Dulce de Leche has just 2.5 grams of fat
per serving and 190 calories; chocolate sorbet has 120 calories and
no fat.</TE>
<TE>   * McDonald's: Even the Center for Science in the Public Interest
likes some of the fast-food chain's desserts. The fruit and yogurt
parfait (without granola) has just 4 grams of fat, only two of them
saturated, and 280 calories. The reduced-fat ice cream cone clocks in
at 150 calories and just 4.5 grams of fat.</TE>
<TE>   * Popsicle: Sure, it lacks the "mouth-feel" of fat-laden ice
cream, but it definitely says summer. And at just 45 calories and no
fat, it'll hardly put a dent in your eating plan.</TE>
<TE>   Go ahead, have another.</TE>

<DH>More couples are refusing to give up on protracted
fertility treatments despite slim chances of success</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL COSTELLO</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nona Grayson never imagined that having a family would be this
difficult. After a first in-vitro fertilization attempt failed, she
became pregnant on her second try, although serious complications
kept her in the hospital for 10 days and required months of constant
bed rest. She finally gave birth to a healthy son, John. That was two
years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Now she and her husband, Curt, are trying to have a second child.
Two IVF procedures failed in the last year, but the couple plan to
undergo additional procedures in the next year. "We have a huge ache
in our hearts for another child," says Nona, 41, of Aliso Viejo. "We
just have to keep trying."</LD>
<LD>   One of the most agonizing questions for couples having difficulty
getting pregnant is whether and when to give up and begin exploring
other options. Traditionally, that happens after early fertility
treatments fail and a couple has gone through three or four advanced
fertility treatments, like IVF, or other, much less common options.
It is by then that up to 90% of successful procedures are believed to
occur.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, fertility doctors and experts across the country say more
couples like the Graysons are refusing to give up and are pushing the
limits of fertility treatment. It's not unusual, they say, to see
women undergo six, eight or even more IVF cycles now. (One doctor in
San Francisco said he recently helped a women get pregnant on her
23rd cycle.) Although a few women end up successful, the overwhelming
majority do not. And that's causing a debate among doctors and health
experts about if and when it's appropriate to stop trying to help a
couple have a baby and steer them to other options like adoption.
It's an especially delicate dilemma with women older than 40, whose
chance of getting pregnant with fertility treatments is about a
quarter that of younger women, no matter how often they try.</TE>
<TE>   One key concern is that some doctors aren't being candid with
patients over 40 about how low their chances are for getting
pregnant--and how severely the odds diminish after several failed
cycles. Some experts also worry that some physicians are underselling
the emotional, financial and medical risks that may result from
multiple unsuccessful procedures. To help, the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine plans to introduce physician guidelines for
multiple fertility treatments later this year, although officials say
the guidelines are unlikely to include specific recommendations on
the overall number of treatments doctors should provide.</TE>
<TE>   "People are more willing and confident today to spend longer on
the fertility treadmill," says Dr. Paul Zarutskie, a fertility
specialist in Laguna Niguel, who says he rarely allows a patient to
undergo more than four cycles. But "it's not clear if that's a good
thing. At some point, physicians have an ethical responsibility to
help people get off the treadmill and consider other options."</TE>
<TE>   The Demand Is Strong</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the $2-billion-a-year fertility industry is booming, even
in the current down economy. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the number of procedures rose almost 40%
between 1995 and 1999, the last year for which information is
available.</TE>
<TE>   There are three stages of fertility treatment that women can
undergo. The first stage involves a host of different pills and
injections meant to stimulate a woman's ovaries. That includes drugs
like Clomid, Pergonal and Gonal-F and costs $1,000 to $2,000 per try.
The next step, which is more invasive and costs twice as much as the
first stage, includes artificial insemination, where semen is placed
inside the woman's reproductive organs. Finally, when all else fails,
women move on to advanced treatments like IVF or other more invasive
options, in which eggs are retrieved, fertilized with sperm in a lab
and inserted into the uterus after three to five days. In some cases,
one cycle can run as much $15,000. If that doesn't work, the only
other options are to use donated eggs or sperm or adoption, so many
patients keep trying as long as they can emotionally and financially
afford it.</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly what's worrying folks. Although IVF procedures
are commonplace, they are not without downsides or risks. For one,
the emotional toll and daily grind can be brutal. Studies have found
that depression rates among women who fail fertility treatments can
be higher than those with cancer or HIV. Moreover, a life filled with
seemingly endless shots, doctor appointments and failed cycles can
severely strain marriages, some of which don't survive the ordeal.
And considering that most fertility treatments aren't covered by
insurance, many couples experience financial hardship, putting
another strain on a relationship.</TE>
<TE>   There's also relatively little research about the long-term health
effects of ovulation-inducing drugs. Indeed, most women undergoing
IVF procedures can take up to 15 medications and have hormone levels
10 times higher than normal for weeks or months. About a decade ago,
two separate studies at the University of Washington and Stanford
University found that women who stayed on the drugs for only several
months had a significantly higher risk of ovarian cancer. After those
alarming findings, however, several subsequent studies reached
contradictory conclusions. Today many doctors simply tell patients
that the risk is unclear. (One problem is that few of the studies
have looked at women who have undergone multiple fertility treatments
and stayed on fertility drugs for long periods of time.)</TE>
<TE>   Why They Keep Trying</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Gammelgard says she isn't thinking about the long-term
health effects right now. She and her husband, Erik, have been trying
to have a baby for years. She underwent six procedures in five years,
and finally, after the last procedure just a few weeks ago, she got
pregnant. Although she admits it wasn't easy, she says it was worth
it. "I went through hell and back and then back again," says the
31-year-old San Diego human resources executive. But "I still feel
like it's a God-given right to have a child."</TE>
<TE>   While that may explain why so many couples turn to fertility
treatments in the first place, experts say there are a host of
reasons more couples aren't giving up earlier and are willing to
undergo multiple procedures today. For one, improved technology has
led to higher success rates in recent years. According to the latest
annual report from the CDC, 33% of women 35 or younger undergoing
advanced fertility treatments had a baby in 1999, compared with about
25% four years earlier. Women older than 40 also are having more
success, though their odds of conceiving a child--about 10%--are
still comparatively low.</TE>
<TE>   Congress, too, is playing a role. In 1992 it passed a law setting
up a system for nearly 400 clinics nationwide to report annual
success rates and other data. (The data are on the CDC's Web site,
www.cdc.gov.) Not surprisingly, those statistics have become
influential in women's choices about where to seek treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The Role of Doctors</TE>
<TE>   One drawback of the federal reporting system, however, is that
clinics report only an overall success rate--not how many attempts it
took to achieve success. Some fear that's pushing aggressive doctors
to just keep trying. "It's hard not to think some doctors are going a
bit further than they would without [the reporting system]," says
Ruth Fretts, a fertility researcher at Harvard Medical School in
Cambridge, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   And some doctors may be providing a financial incentive for
patients to continue trying. Many clinics now offer "cost
containment" packages, which usually charge a higher fee for the
first IVF treatment but then give steep discounts on the next two
cycles if the first doesn't work. That can save a couple thousand
dollars but may also encourage repeated attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Why some doctors allow patients to continue having procedure after
procedure is difficult to say. Many infertile couples desperately
want a child, and doctors may have difficulty saying no if a patient
insists on continuing. Plus, although some couples may spend more
than $100,000 for repeated IVF treatments, many clinics say that
these patients tend to be financially well-off. "There are definitely
sacrifices," says Dr. Jackson Wu, a UCLA fertility specialist and
professor. But "overall, many couples are happy to keep trying, even
if they don't end up successful."</TE>
<TE>   What's more, there may be some help on the way, at least for those
who are suffering from financial problems as a result of their
treatments, something many fertility advocacy groups say is a growing
problem. In the last several years, 15 states have begun to require
employers or health insurers to offer at least partial coverage of
fertility treatments. More states may follow suit, although prospects
are dimming because of the still-soft economy.</TE>
<TE>   California's legislature has explored mandating employer coverage
of fertility treatment, but current state law only requires insurance
companies to offer the plans to companies. Individual employers are
not required to provide fertility treatment as an employee benefit.
The result is that few California employers cover fertility
treatment. People can buy individual policies that cover at least
part of the procedures, although those plans tend to have high
deductibles. Some advocacy groups are lobbying Congress to force more
insurance coverage nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, the number of multiple treatments is unlikely to slow
down because, for many people, the desire to have a baby is worth any
hardship. "It's a gerbil wheel," Nona Grayson says. "But it's all
we've got."</TE>

<DH>Aging* A leukemia drug can darken some people's gray locks,
but its maker isn't planning to market it that way.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the best-laid plans of researchers and drug companies,
medical science packs exotic surprises and serendipitous results.
Doctors using the drug minoxidil to lower blood pressure noticed that
it also seemed to accelerate hair growth; the drug was soon marketed
as Rogaine to combat thinning hair. Neurologists using a paralyzing
toxin to control facial spasms discovered it also smoothed
wrinkles--leading to Botox injections for more youthful-looking skin.</LD>
<LD>   Now, French scientists report that a new leukemia drug, Gleevec,
not only slows the progression of disease but has a startling
cosmetic upside: It darkens hair color in some people who've gone
gray with age. The drug is not considered a good candidate for
cosmetic use, because it can cause liver and blood problems.</LD>
<LD>   The finding has prompted an investigation into how such recoloring
happens.  In a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine
published last week, doctors from the Victor Segalen University in
Bordeaux describe a trial in 133 leukemia patients, ages 53 to 75.</LD>
<TE>   As expected, the drug was effective in combating leukemia; Gleevec
improves one-year survival rates significantly compared with standard
interferon therapy, according to recent research.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpectedly, though, nine of the 90 or so patients who had gray
hair finished the trial with distinctly darker locks than they had at
the beginning, the doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   The change in color occurred after about five months of taking the
drug, on average, and in roughly 10% of the patients with gray or
white hair, said Dr. Francois-Xavier Mahon, the lead author.</TE>
<TE>   "But the proportion is difficult to evaluate because many of them,
and particularly the women, have colored [dyed] hair at this age," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Though anecdotal reports of this hair coloring effect had surfaced
before, Novartis Corp. of East Hanover, N.J., the drug's
manufacturer, has no plans to test or market Gleevec for hair
coloring, said Gloria Stone, a spokeswoman for the company. The drug
comes in capsule form and belongs to a new class of anti-cancer
agents that destroy malignant cells without damaging healthy cells.
Other anti-cancer drugs harm malignant and healthy cells and aren't
as well-tolerated by the body, doctors say.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors had expected Gleevec to accelerate the graying of hair, if
it affected pigment at all, because it interferes with the action of
an enzyme thought to assist the pigmentation process, said Dr.
Michael Heinrich, an associate professor at the Oregon Health &amp;
Science University in Portland and a member of the team that helped
develop the drug.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that this finding provides interesting insight into what
controls pigmentation in humans and might provide insight into
treatments for graying hair," he said. "Maybe we'll even find a
topical treatment that works. Obviously it has a lot of interest ...
I'm going gray myself."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A recent Health Matters column on antibiotics in poultry
("Antibiotics and the Chicken Connection," July 15) mistakenly
suggests that if one chicken caught pneumonia, the disease could
spread quickly and that giving low doses of a fluoroquinolone
antibiotic in the birds' drinking water would prevent illness in the
rest of the flock. In fact, such treatment is not begun simply on the
basis of a single bird's illness, but on the veterinarian's
assessment of an array of information, including cost. Moreover,
flocks are not treated with low doses over an undefined period, but
with therapeutic doses of fluoroquinolone over five days.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to the author's assertions, the FDA does not intend to
ban the use of all antimicrobial drugs in poultry. Rather, the FDA
will continue to review and approve new antimicrobial drugs for
poultry as long as they meet our rigorous standards for safety.</LD>
<LD>   Scientific tools available today allow the FDA to look with an
ever-increasing level of precision at the effects of using
antibiotics in food-producing animals. Therefore, we do not have to
prohibit access to an entire class of drugs because some of them may
pose a threat to human health.</LD>

<LD>I read with interest and some dismay the article "Step Out of the
Shade for a Healthy Dose of Vitamin D" (July 8). While the single
definitive beneficial effect of ultraviolet radiation on the skin is
the production of vitamin D, we needn't promote tanning or
unprotected sun exposure. Most of us receive adequate sun exposure
even with sunscreen use to synthesize vitamin D or have enough in our
diet to meet the normal daily requirement.</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, the risk of overexposure to ultraviolet light
has definite risks, most notably skin cancer. We shouldn't encourage
people to "step out of the shade" when the greater risk is skin
cancer.</LD>

<HD>The Power of Creatine: It's Real but Subtle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY GOWER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For years, scientists and doctors insisted there were no safe
shortcuts when it came to building muscle. Illegal anabolic steroids
may provide a boost but they also increase the risk of acne, liver
failure, heart disease and other conditions, along with turning some
users into aggressive jerks. The pills and powders peddled in vitamin
shops may be legal, but there has never been any scientific proof
that they work.</LD>
<LD>   Then came creatine monohydrate, which for the last decade has been
the most popular dietary supplement among jocks in the United States.
Nutrition Business Journal, a trade publication, estimated creatine
sales at $260 million in 2000, and observers say the magic muscle
powder's popularity continues to grow.</LD>
<LD>   Baseball sluggers Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and the
Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa have acknowledged using creatine
supplements. Chances are, some of the guys at your local gym are
swallowing the stuff too. But creatine also made headlines recently
when an editorial in a medical journal raised new questions about its
safety. What the heck is creatine, anyway, and can it boost your
biceps without endangering the rest of your body?</LD>
<TE>   Creatine is high-grade muscle fuel. Your body naturally produces
this amino acid to spark bursts of energy, like when you raise a
barbell or run sprints. A typical diet provides a gram or two each
day; meat and fish are good sources. Creatine is stored in muscle,
but reserves are exhausted quickly during intense exercise. That's
why lifting heavy weights and running at top speed causes us to tire
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists, however, figured out that consuming high doses of
creatine can elevate stored levels of this critical fuel. In theory,
a muscle that's well-stocked with creatine should be able to work
extra long. For a weightlifter, that means more repetitions, which
should lead to more brawn.</TE>
<TE>   Since the early 1990s, dozens of studies have been published
examining whether creatine lives up to its promise. In most cases, it
has come up a winner. "It appears that creatine can be effective for
improving performance and increasing strength and power in athletes,"
said physiologist Melvin H. Williams, a professor emeritus of
exercise science at Old Dominion University and co-author of
"Creatine: The Power Supplement" (Human Kinetics, 1999).</TE>
<TE>   If you decide to try creatine, don't expect a Popeye-like eruption
of vigor next time you hit the gym. The effects of creatine on human
performance are real, but subtle. According to University of
Connecticut kinesiologist William Kraemer, most studies have shown
that adding creatine supplements to your diet may produce a 5% to 10%
increase in power. That would mean, for example, that a guy who can
normally bench-press 150 pounds eight times before pooping out might
be able to squeeze out an extra repetition or two.</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to see why a competitive athlete would want to gain a
little more power--perhaps the difference between a home run that
barely clears the fence or a ball caught at the edge of the outfield.
But is it worth it to you?</TE>
<TE>   First, there's the cost. Some creatine devotees begin a regimen by
taking 20 grams a day for a week, then downing a "maintenance dose"
of 5 grams a day thereafter. I shopped around on the Internet and
found prices as low as 20 cents per 5-gram dose. Because pure
creatine is relatively cheap to produce, however, manufacturers
frequently blend it with other supplements to jack up the price. I
found one product that would cost about $150 a year if used daily.
(The Food and Drug Administration doesn't closely monitor the purity
and potency of creatine or any other dietary supplement, so you can
never be sure you're purchasing a high-quality product.)</TE>
<TE>   Creatine supplements are worthless for about 20% to 25% of people,
since their muscle cells are naturally brimming with the stuff, says
Kraemer. For the rest of us, taking more than the recommended dose is
a waste of money since only small amounts are needed to reach
capacity. "Once you're loaded up, your body has no place to put it,"
says Williams, so the unused creatine is passed in the urine. If
you're an endurance athlete, such as a long-distance runner, creatine
supplements won't give you a stronger kick; aerobic power relies on
other energy sources.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are those lingering safety issues, though evidence that
creatine is dangerous is largely circumstantial.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, three college wrestlers died during weight-loss workouts
over a six-week period. When reports surfaced that one of the young
men had been using creatine, speculation mounted that the supplement
may have led to fatal levels of dehydration, since the amino acid is
known to draw water from the blood and into muscle cells. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the incidents and
found no evidence that creatine played a role in the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, an editorial published in the August issue of the
journal Neurosurgery questioned whether creatine, as well as the
herbal stimulant ephedra, might be responsible for an increase in the
number of deaths from heatstroke among football players in the United
States since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   The authors, University of West Virginia neurosurgeon Julian
Bailes and two other physicians, wrote that the number of football
players who die of heatstroke each year has risen about fourfold in
this country since Congress passed a 1994 law allowing companies to
sell dietary supplements without first proving that they are safe.
Since then, sales of supplements have soared.</TE>
<TE>   Bailes and his colleagues offer no proof that any of the players
who dropped dead at football summer camps were using creatine. In an
interview, however, he points out that anecdotal reports of side
effects among creatine users include muscle cramping,
gastrointestinal problems and dehydration--reason enough, he says, to
avoid the supplements if you're exercising in hot weather.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people ought to be taking supplements of any kind
in extreme environments," Bailes says.</TE>
<TE>   That seems like reasonable advice. Yet, last year, Kraemer and
several colleagues published a study in Medicine and Science in
Sports and Exercise in which they had 20 men pedal stationary
bicycles for half an hour in a heat chamber cranked up to 98 degrees
Fahrenheit and 80% humidity. Half of the men were dosed with
creatine. But when the researchers measured heart rate, blood
pressure and how much sweat the men produced, they found no
difference between the two groups.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have reviewed the medical literature for evidence that
creatine poses a serious health threat. And, says Kraemer, "nobody's
found a boogeyman." Still, most studies involving creatine have been
conducted over a few days or weeks, and researchers say studies that
last longer are needed before anyone can say whether using the
supplements for years has any ill effects on health.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of your motivation for trying creatine--looking good in
a muscle T-shirt, perhaps--keep in mind that it won't re-form your
physique unless you lift weights on a regular basis. Other than
Popeye's spinach, there's no substitute for hard work.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>OVERVIEW: Most books, tapes and programs about boosting your
brainpower recommend good nutrition, exercise, stress reduction and
keeping your brain active. Dr. Gary Small, director of the UCLA
Center on Aging, throws all of these and more into his program for
improving daily memory skills. His thesis: Brain aging is a lifelong
process, and by improving our memory now, we may be able to fend off
future declines.</LD>
<LD>   WHAT WORKS: Small's book helps us rate our own memory skills and
improve them with several exercises. He also delves into the
memory-impairing effects of various prescription and illegal drugs,
and the potential memory benefits of hormones, anti-inflammatories,
anti-Alzheimer's drugs and vaccines now in the works. The appendix
offers up-to-date information about diagnosing, treating and dealing
with Alzheimer's. It reflects Small's philosophy of early and
aggressive action.</LD>

<LD>Question: I like to do both cardiovascular and strength-training
exercises on the same day. Is it better to do one before the other or
does it matter?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: This has been an ongoing question for years. Coaches and
professional athletes who train for specific sports especially want
to know which sequence will most assist our efforts to lose weight,
improve cardio function and gain strength.</LD>
<LD>   But there has been little research on which order of exercises is
most advantageous. Some trainers say that by doing cardio exercise
first, you're warming up the muscles for strength training. Others
say that cardio exercise fatigues the muscles so that we don't make
great strides in the weight room, especially on those leg days.</LD>
<TE>   My theory is that aerobic exercise warms our bodies for strength
training. I've found that, after cardio, my endorphins kick in and I
feel strong enough to take my body into the gym. If I do strength
training first, my muscles get tired and I usually bag my cardio
workout.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, the best program is the one that they will enjoy
and do regularly and that feels right for their body.</TE>

<HD>Love Summer? Or Sick of It?</HD>
<DH>Ask an expert: Our taste for the season is based on brain
chemistry, affluence and, yes, weather.</DH>

<AU>KATHLEEN MEGAN</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Summer's tide is high and soon will turn.</LD>
<LD>   That's how it always is. On July 4, the entire summer lies before
us. A few weeks later, we're in the homestretch to Labor Day.</LD>
<LD>   Among us, there are those who will cling by our fingernails to the
last shred of summer right through September and others who are
already a little sick of sand, chlorine, endless days and bored kids.</LD>
<TE>   Which camp are you in?</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists believe that a person's outlook may come down to
neurotransmitters in the brain.</TE>
<TE>   Craig H. Kinsley, an associate professor of neuroscience at the
University of Virginia, said his friends accuse him of being "an
evangelist for the brain." He believes that everything, from whether
you prefer chocolate or vanilla to whether you enjoy relaxing on a
beach, is related to brain chemistry.</TE>
<TE>   People who can't sit still, who crave new experiences, who desire
new challenges and who are bored with summer relaxation may be driven
by their brain's appetite for a neurotransmitter called dopamine.</TE>
<TE>   Kinsley said that dopamine is released during new experiences and
enhances good feelings. Some of us have a greater need for dopamine
than others.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are more content with a relaxed, low-key routine
apparently have sufficient supplies of dopamine and don't need more,
Kinsley said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's real difficult to reduce people to chemicals, but they have
to be involved at a fundamental level," said Kinsley. In a certain
sense, he said, "happiness is a release of chemicals."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Nuccitelli, a psychologist and executive director of
SLS Health in Brewster, N.Y., said chemicals play a role in people's
reactions to everything but that environmental factors play a role in
how people feel about summer.</TE>
<TE>   One of those factors is wealth. If you can afford beach houses,
camps for your kids and summer toys such as boats or personal
watercraft, you probably like summer better than someone who can't
afford such luxuries.</TE>
<TE>   "I see so many parents who dread summer because they can't afford
the camps," said Nuccitelli. Those are the people who can't wait
until their kids are back in school.</TE>
<TE>   And there are people like Nuccitelli. He considers himself a risk
taker, an adventuresome type, but he's not a big fan of summer
because he can't stand the heat.</TE>
<TE>   He also doesn't get around to taking summer vacations because of
all the planning and packing necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be a management nightmare, more stress than relaxation,"
said Nuccitelli.</TE>
<TE>   He'd rather take time off, stay home, golf and take care of his
fish.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Nicholas DeMartinis, a psychiatrist at the University of
Connecticut Health Center in Farmington, Conn., said that whether you
mourn the demise of summer probably has a lot to do with whether
you're an outdoorsy person.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people find summer less stressful," said DeMartinis.
"One of the best antidotes to stress is getting out and exercising.
People may do less of that in the winter, and it's easier for stress
to build up."</TE>
<TE>   For those who are reactive to light, the days also grow shorter,
which can lead to seasonal blues in the fall and winter.</TE>
<TE>   Some people will find any transition rough going. "These may be
people with a more obsessive-compulsive personality, not a disorder,"
said DeMartinis. "They like to do things the same way, over and over
and over. You start changing things and it's stressful."</TE>
<TE>   As for thrill seekers, said DeMartinis, they may be just as likely
to enjoy winter as summer if they are skiers or snowboarders. In,
general, Kinsley said, human beings weren't really made for a
two-week beach vacation.</TE>
<TE>   If you go back to early man, the competition for resources and
mates defined us, Kinsley said. We needed time for rest, but rest
amounted to a good night's sleep. And then we were ready for more
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The animal, humans included, were not designed nor were we shaped
by the crucible of natural selection, to just sit around," Kinsley
wrote. "We crave stimulation, work, competition. Or most of us do."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that means that those of us who are able to look--without
nausea--at the fall clothes already in department stores are more
like our prehistoric relatives.</TE>
<TE>   And those of us who long to sit on the beach till sunset in
October have accepted change. You could even say we've evolved.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every fitness magazine and exercise trainer seems to devise new moves
to target the gluteals, promising firmer, more sculpted buttocks. As
a result, we're doing more squats, plies, lunges, hiking and cycling
than ever before, and looking better in our shorts because of it. But
keep in mind that--although there's nothing wrong with working out to
get a strong, tight tush--it's also important to stretch the hip
muscles.</LD>
<LD>   A key muscle to keep limber as well as strong is the piriformis
muscle. If you're like most people, you have no idea where the
piriformis muscle is nor what it does. Unfortunately, it is mostly
known for the problems it creates when it is too tight and
overworked. They include sciatica and knee or lower back pain.</LD>
<LD>   The piriformis is part of a group of muscles called the hip
rotators. These muscles are in the back of the hips about six to
eight inches below the waist. They are mainly responsible for turning
the legs outward so the toes can point away from the center of the
body. Strong hip rotators keep the thigh bones and knee joints
properly aligned over the feet for activities such as cycling and
running, and they protect the knees from twisting or buckling during
athletic moves, such as side lunging or deep squats.</LD>
<TE>   We need to keep these muscles in balance because overusing and
under-stretching them can create compression of the nerves, giving
you a nagging pain deep in the buttocks or a dull ache and heaviness
in your legs. One of the easiest ways to make sure your hips stay
flexible is to get out of your chair more often and to sit
cross-legged on the floor whenever you can. This allows the hip
joints to open up and gives the muscles and ligaments around the hip
joint a chance to lengthen out.</TE>
<TE>   The following stretches are a simple way to loosen your hips. If
you are extremely tight, these positions may be uncomfortable at
first. Move in and out of the positions slowly and be gentle while
holding each stretch. Stay in each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds and
then repeat on the other side. Do two to four sets. By alternating
sides, you'll notice differences in each side of your hips. Be
sensitive to each side and don't expect them to feel the same. It's a
good idea to spend a little more time on your tighter side.</TE>
<TE>   Standing Hip Stretch</TE>
<TE>   Stand in front of a sturdy hip-height table or bar. Keep your
weight over your left leg as you bend your right knee in front of
you, placing it on top of the table.</TE>
<TE>   Adjust your bent leg so that your right foot is directly in front
of your left shoulder and your right knee is in front of your right
shoulder. Your right leg should be bent at a 90-degree angle.</TE>
<TE>   Put your hands on the table for support and balance. Lift your
chest and hold your back straight. Inhale to begin.</TE>
<TE>   On an exhale, gently bend forward at the hips, keeping your bottom
leg straight. Feel a deep stretch in the muscles of your right hip.
Do not allow your right hip and knee to rise toward your chest. Keep
both hips level.</TE>
<TE>   If the stretch is too intense, ease up and don't lean so far
forward. If you don't feel any stretch, bend forward a little more.
Just make sure that you are not "rounding" at the waist, but rather
"hinging" at the hips.</TE>
<TE>   Breathe deeply while you stay in this stretch. Focus on relaxing
and softening the muscles in your right buttock. Repeat on the other
side.</TE>
<TE>   Seated Hip Stretch</TE>
<TE>   Sit on the front edge of a sturdy bench. Keep your left foot flat
on the floor directly underneath your knee. Place your right ankle on
your left thigh just above your knee. Keep your right foot flexed.
Your right leg should be bent at a 90-degree angle.</TE>
<TE>   Place your hands behind your hips and lift your chest to maintain
a straight back. Inhale to begin.</TE>
<TE>   On an exhale, bend forward at the hips. Do not allow your right
hip to rise off the bench. Keep your hips and shoulders level as you
continue to slowly bend forward. Breathe deeply as you stay in this
stretch. Focus on relaxing and softening your right buttock. Repeat
on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   Gently stretching your hip muscles after your workouts will help
you develop well-balanced muscles that enhance rather than restrict
your range of motion. So next time you do a set of squats, don't
forget to stretch those muscles out.</TE>

<HD>Forget Uncle Sam-- Homer Simpson Wants You</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was schlepping around town the other day, talking to people about
improving America's image, when I came upon a spin doctor with a
potful of ideas on the subject. Replacing Uncle Sam with Homer
Simpson was one of them.</LD>
<LD>   Image-altering has been on my mind ever since the Council on
Foreign Affairs announced some days ago that we are viewed abroad as
arrogant, self-indulgent, hypocritical, inattentive and hostile. And
that's just in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   When President Bush first heard how the U.S. was perceived
overseas, he thought we were being praised for our many powerful
attributes. But after someone explained to him that they weren't
meant in a positive way, he blinked his squinty little Texas eyes and
ordered the creation of the Office of Global Communications.</LD>
<TE>   I personally don't hold out a lot of hope that OGLOB, as it will
no doubt be called, will do us a lot of good, which is what prompted
me to do some work on my own. And after talking to various
image-makers, I decided that the only man who could be of real help
was Manny Spitzik.</TE>
<TE>   Not many people realize it, but Spitz has been operating for many
years on an international scale, saving well-known people from
themselves, creating positive words and phrases for negative
situations and, as he puts it, generally turning skunks into roses.</TE>
<TE>   Among many achievements, he redefined the nature of sex for Bill
Clinton, allowing the president to declare with a straight face that
he did not have sex with that woman, that Monica Lewinsky, even
though he had come terribly close. Spitz came up with the phrase
"personal, noncommittal affiliation" to describe what they were doing
in that room off the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   Just the man to alter the American image.</TE>
<TE>   "Number one," he said to me as we sat drinking super-oxygenated
Himalayan creek water at a club on Melrose Avenue, "Uncle Sam's gotta
go. Too grim. Too warlike. Too arrogant. Think Homer Simpson."</TE>
<TE>   He peered at me through black-rimmed glasses the size of saucers,
the intensity of his gaze leaving no doubt in my mind that he was
serious.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to visualize Homer in a star-spangled top hat, pointing
like Uncle Sam in that famous poster and saying, "Homer Simpson Wants
Beer!" but it didn't scan.</TE>
<TE>   "Isn't Homer the epitome of stupid and crude?" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly," Spitz said. He leaned closer. "Stupid and crude
translate into one thing, my friend: lovable. It's today's humor." He
ordered another super-oxy laced with carrot oil. "I told young George
when he was running for president, 'Dumb down, boy.' And look what
happened. He won."</TE>
<TE>   Spitz leaned in even closer. "This is still pretty hush-hush, but
in a few weeks Tony Clifton is going to reappear on stage."</TE>
<TE>   "The loud, obnoxious character Andy Kaufman used to play?"</TE>
<TE>   "Right. Everyone's gonna think it's Andy come back to life or
maybe Jim Carrey doing shtick, but you know who it's going to be?" He
didn't wait for an answer. "Osama bin Laden! Binnie's coming out of
hiding! My idea. The people are gonna love it."</TE>
<TE>   I don't sputter a lot, but I did this time. I sputtered and
stared. "Th-that's not only insensitive and offensive," I said when
the sputtering had stopped, "If you're working for Al Qaeda, it might
even be treason!"</TE>
<TE>   "Treason, schmeason," Spitz replied with a wave of his hand. "We
don't call it that anymore. It's furtive cross-cultural cooperation.
You've got to think in today's terms. It's not what you do, it's what
you call what you do."</TE>
<TE>   I probably should have gotten up and walked out right then, but
the man has a way of keeping you listening. He did it in this
instance by saying, "Not an angry, warlike carnivorous eagle as our
national bird, but Tweety Bird, the sweetest animal in God's gracious
kingdom outside of Porky Pig. And not saber-rattling, but
money-rustling."</TE>
<TE>   "We already rustle money," I said. "That's part of the problem.
The world already thinks we're greedier than dingo dogs. And nobody's
going to buy a canary representing us unless it's got laser-guided
missiles under its wings."</TE>
<TE>   "OK, no Tweety, but how about this: mail-in rebates for the
leaders of the nations that hate us the most. You don't just give
away money to everyone and his uncle, you sell the guy in power an
eight-deck CD player for 50 bucks and give him the opportunity to
apply for a $30-billion rebate! Make a game outta foreign aid!
Everybody loves games!"</TE>
<TE>   He suggested altering the flag to feature a round, yellow happy
face symbol with "Have a Nice Day" in Latin across the bottom, and
putting a positive spin on accidental bombings.</TE>
<TE>   OK on the flag, but I don't think that painting our missiles in
bright, cheerful colors would divert attention from the fact that
occasionally we blow up the wrong target.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't blow up wrong targets," Spitz argued, "we simply perform
unintended optional diversions that result in bio-unit
fragmentation."</TE>
<TE>   By the time I left, Spitz had switched from super-oxygenated
Himalayan creek water to vitamin-infused synergetic avocado juice
with a ginseng twist and was writing frantically on a tablet of
recycled hemp. I would guess he was thinking up even more ideas on
how to upgrade America's image, but I'm not sure I want to hear them.</TE>
<TE>   We're going to have to work on the product instead of the image if
we really want to sell the soap, although the idea of Homer Simpson
symbolizing America to the world is beginning to make more sense with
every passing day.</TE>

<HD>Bipartisan Spending at a Show Near You</HD>
<DH>Memorabilia* An Irvine gathering attracts buyers interested
in items from winners and losers of America's highest office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for one group
of people to collect evidence of the political bands which have
connected them ... they head for the American Political Memorabilia
Show sponsored by the American Political Items Collectors. The
57-year-old organization last week convened its three-day national
convention in Irvine to trade, buy and simply admire tens of
thousands of artifacts from America's political campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   The range of material was as rich and colorful as America's
political past. There were original medals from George Washington's
inauguration to "Dubya" campaign buttons--and just about every
banner, poster and ribbon of every political winner and loser and
cause in between. "We have G.W. [George Washington] to G.W. [George
W. Bush]," said Neal Machander, the organization's past president.</LD>
<TE>   Like so many collectibles these days, a few of the items sell for
what would amount to a generous campaign contribution. Take the 1924
button featuring Democratic candidates John William Davis and Charles
Bryan. The item, a little bigger than a thumbprint, would set you
back $150,000--and these guys were losers. It's not all so expensive.
Ted Powell, 83, of Laguna Niguel came looking for a Warren G. Harding
and Calvin Coolidge button, the 1920 Republican presidential
candidates. It was available for about $2,000, but the retired
political scientist's wife vetoed the purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "I said no, no, no," said a smiling Joyce Powell, 75, who has
never spent more than $100 for an individual piece in her
commemorative coin collection.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of items--such as buttons trumpeting the "Equal Rights
Amendment" or those that declared "If I were 21, I'd vote for
Nixon"--can be had for a couple of bucks or less. Though the
organization has some 2,000 members, only about 800 people were
expected at this year's convention, which ran Thursday through
Saturday. The best collections apparently still reside east of the
Mississippi. Explained collector Don Rosen, a Los Angeles attorney:
"California is sometimes considered a wasteland for political stuff."</TE>
<TE>   The West's supposed disadvantage hasn't stopped Gary Kranz Sr.,
60, from acquiring, according to his best estimate, more than 10,000
pieces. And the head of a school portraits company in Santa Ana has
only been collecting since Ronald Reagan trounced Walter Mondale in
1984. "I'm hooked on it I know," Kranz said. "My wife is always
asking me, 'What the hell are you collecting that stuff for?' I don't
know, I just love it."</TE>
<TE>   Memorabilia featuring Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Reagan, John F. Kennedy and Teddy Roosevelt seem to be perennial
favorites. Over the years, those select few presidents have achieved
a cult status within political item collecting circles, say
convention organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "Their stuff is always popular," said Machander, who notes Bill
Clinton appears to be on his way to joining the bestsellers.</TE>
<TE>   Collectors are for the most part men older than 35 who are
die-hard history buffs and political junkies. Their hobby provides
them a way to interact with others of similar interests and to learn
more about the nation's political past.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Adam Gottlieb from Sacramento probably knows as much
about Teddy Roosevelt's 1903 tour through the Western United States
as anybody. Through a collection of medals, ribbons and buttons, he
can trace the Rough Rider president's first trip to Los Angeles.
Through the acquisition of a menu in pristine condition from
Roosevelt's train, Gottlieb knows what the president's lunch choices
were: roast beef, broiled trout or chicken fricassee.</TE>
<TE>   The collection didn't come easy or cheap. The communications
director for the California Arts Council recalls a battle over one TR
button with a small ribbon.</TE>
<TE>   "I got into a bidding war on EBay," Gottlieb said. "It came down
to who wanted it more." When asked how much it cost to prove he
wanted it more, Gottlieb balked at revealing the bottom line: "It's
not about the price. It's about creating a comprehensive collection."
Finally, he confessed he paid between $2,000 and $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   Like any group, political memorabilia collectors have sub-groups.
Tamara Rosen specializes in first lady memorabilia. She has more than
300 pieces, including a small pin of Martha Washington. Rosen spoke
admiringly of Jacqueline Kennedy, Betty Ford, Laura Bush and Hillary
Clinton, the last of whom she met as a campaign worker. "You have to
be a strong woman to be a first lady," said Rosen, who runs a
calligraphy business. "It's go, go, go all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband, Don, is particularly fond of "flashers"--the buttons
that contain two alternating images. Turn them one way, and it's 1968
Democratic presidential candidate Hubert Humphrey. Turn them another
and it's his running mate Edmund Muskie. They don't make them like
that anymore. In fact, according to Rosen who has about 275 flashers,
they don't make them at all. The companies that manufactured them are
all out of business, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to start a flasher chapter," he added.</TE>

of her daughter that she extends motherliness beyond rational limits,
achieves an excess of intrusive concern so bizarre that she (and her
mothering) become ... a comedy routine.</LD>
<LD>   It all began innocently enough: Amy Borkowsky left home in the
Bronx at 18 to live in Manhattan. Her divorced mother moved to a city
1,000 miles away. And every day ever since, the disembodied voice of
Borkowsky's mother has floated onto Borkowsky's answering
machine--exhorting, cajoling, wheedling and inquiring.</LD>
<LD>   She does not command, having undoubtedly learned over the years
that, with a daughter like Borkowsky--who's a member of Mensa and an
award-winning advertising executive--a long-suffering mother has
little leverage. Yet she is still so determined to shield her
daughter from discomfort, illness and obscure hazards that she leaves
multiple daily messages reminding her to perform the most basic
tasks--as if a daughter pushing 40 might forget?</LD>
<TE>   "Hi, Amila. It's me, honey. If you haven't already left to go to
the motor vehicle bureau, keep in mind that the wait is very long. So
before you get in line, you may wanna empty your bladder."</TE>
<TE>   The messages are delivered in a gravely drawl, made particularly
piquant by a Bronx accent and a splatter of Yiddishisms. She adds the
Yiddish "ila" suffix to Amy's name as an endearment. No matter where
Borkowsky has gone, or what she has accomplished, she cannot get away
from the voice or the messages.</TE>
<TE>   So she has embraced them, and thereby found a new career, which is
the one she wanted all along--show business. Borkowsky has created a
comedy act, a book and a CD (both titled "Amy's Answering Machine")
from her mother's daily phone messages. She plays nightclubs,
conventions, events of every sort, peppering her act with the orange,
yellow and red alerts that her mother offers, just like the Homeland
Security office.</TE>
<TE>   "Hello, Amila. I don't know if you heard the latest on the
portable stereos, but they're saying that the foam earpiece on the
headphones is a prime breeding ground for bacteria. So if you still
insist on walking around with the headphones on, you may wanna take
an antibiotic. OK, hon?"</TE>
<TE>   Or: "Amila? I wanted to know if you, by any chance, happened to
catch the story on the new squirting scam. You'll be walking along
the street and, unbeknownst to you, some guy or maybe a woman will
squirt you from behind with a bottle of ketchup. Then, someone else
who's in cahoots with that person will say, 'Excuse me, Miss, but
there's some ketchup on your sweater.' And then, just as you go to
wipe it, they grab your bag and that's the end of that. I just
figured I'd mention it, so if somebody tries to point out any ketchup
on you, you'll be wise to it."</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky's mother has railed in messages about the hazards of
wearing nylon-crotch panties and rubber-soled shoes, and the harm
that might come from wearing her ruby-colored robe when she goes to
the mailbox or takes out the trash because "my friend Eileen's
grandson said that red is a gang color."</TE>
<TE>   And then, of course, there's the weather.</TE>
<TE>   "Amila? I hope you're on your way home. I just heard on the
weather there's a big storm headed for New York and they're expecting
4 to 6 inches in the city, with accumulation of up to a foot in the
outlying areas.... On the weather map, all over New York, they had
snowflakes the size of bagels. So if you have to go out, wrap a scarf
around your face to protect it, cause y' know there was that man who
climbed Mt. Everest and lost his entire nose."</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky's mother sometimes watches TV and fears that her
daughter is in trouble: After a late-night newscast about the Hells
Angels motorcycle club, she phoned Borkowsky to tell her that she'd
seen "a big bear of a guy from Greenwich Village who was covered in
tattoos, and on the back of his motorcycle was a very pretty girl.
Was that you? She had your hair, and she was wearing a green blouse
that looked like the one I gave you for Hanukkah. I'm hoping it was
just a coincidence, because you know how I feel about motorcycles. Do
me a favor: If you wanna go for a ride, it can be just as exciting to
go in a cab."</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky is so secretive about her mother's first name and
whereabouts (she will not divulge either), and about her mother's
reaction to the levity her messages have provoked, that one wonders
if the whole routine could be pure comedic fiction. And if she made
up the messages, could she have also faked the photo of her mother
that is on her Web site--a photo that looks like Borkowsky, made up
to look older than she is? "No, I could not have done that,"
Borkowsky retorts by phone. "I mean, I could have, but I wouldn't.
Those messages are real. My mother's picture is real--taken by her
neighbor at the beautiful undisclosed location where she lives. I am
secretive because I am protecting her like she protected me. I am
returning the favor. I am grateful to her. I will not permit her to
be vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   After obtaining a promise of absolute secrecy from a reporter,
however, the younger Borkowsky revealed not only her mother's first
name and whereabouts, but even cross-connected a call to her mother,
who was not at home. A machine answered: "Hello, if you are calling
about 'Amy's Answering Machine,' I do not do interviews. Anyone else,
please leave a message." Amy's mother answered a later phone call but
referred all questions back to her daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky says people ask her all the time if her mother is upset
that she's being made fun of--and by her own daughter. "I've talked
about this with her," Borkowsky says. "Her typical answer is,
'Whaddya think, that I'm thin-skinned?' My mother was very excited
about the whole thing. She's even played the CD for her friends and
neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   During her 10 years in the ad world, Borkowsky says, she worked
long hours and also played a lot. She was hardly ever home. So she
bought a good answering machine with dual tape cassettes--and soon
realized that "my life and everyone in it was preserved on those
tapes in that machine." She replaced each tape when it was full,
instead of reusing it. "I just threw the used ones in a drawer."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother quickly adjusted to talking on tape as if it were a
two-way conversation. She learned, too, exactly when Borkowsky was
most likely to be home. If the schedule deviated even a bit, she
might lose her cool. She'd first assume her daughter was in the
laundry room, in the tub, taking out the trash. Late one night, when
Borkowsky still wasn't answering her phone, her mother started
phoning all Borkowsky's friends--people she remembered from years
back. A number of them called Borkowsky to say her mother was looking
for her. One left this message: "It's Andrew. I just got a call from
your mom.... She wanted to know if you were spending the night at my
house. I told her we broke up four years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky began to realize what comic treasure was stored on the
tapes, what hilarity they caused when she played them for friends.
She wanted to share the tapes with colleagues at work, she says, but
feared it would cause a lack of credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I am, responsible for major accounts, and my mother thinks I
don't even know when to go to the bathroom."</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky became executive vice president and creative group head
at the Lowe advertising agency in New York, where she worked on
accounts for Mercedes-Benz and Courtyard by Marriott--and won five
Clios, three Cannes Festival lions and an Emmy.</TE>
<TE>   In her spare time, she did stand-up comedy and formed a production
company through which to market the CD she eventually produced, which
carries 28 of her favorite messages from Mom. It is sold only through
her Web site (www.sendamy.com).</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, at what she calls the peak of her advertising
career, she took a six-month leave of absence to promote the
recording. She never went back.</TE>
<TE>   "This thing with my mother is full time now." She spends her days
pursuing comedy gigs, promoting the book and CD--and has a few
possible new projects in the works. They are all mother-centric, she
admits, including a TV show idea in which her mother's messages would
play a starring role.</TE>
<TE>   But a strange thing has happened on Borkowsky's way to success.
Some of her mother's zany wisdom suddenly seems sane,
practical--almost prophetic.</TE>
<TE>   A few years back, for example, her mother warned that Borkowsky
might not be able to get out of her high-rise apartment building if
the elevators didn't work in a fire. "Maybe you oughta get yourself a
parachute," she growled into the machine.</TE>
<TE>   Borkowsky roared when she heard it. "It seemed so insane," she now
recalls. The other day, a friend gave her the same advice in an
e-mail, along with links to some of the Web sites now selling chutes
to apartment dwellers.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly two years ago, her mother reminded her: "If you have a few
extra dollars you should make sure to stay out of the stock market.
It's a roller coaster, and remember, the last time you went on a
roller coaster, you threw up."</TE>
<TE>   And four years ago, her mother warned her not to wear an underwire
bra when she goes on planes, because it might set off the metal
detector. Borkowsky laughed at that one too, she says, because in all
her years of traveling, she had never seen a metal detector set off
by a woman's bra.</TE>
<TE>   Over the July 4 weekend, however, Borkowsky was detained briefly
at an airport when a bit of metal in her bra set off the highly
sensitive metal detectors that are used these days. "I could only
think of how unbelievably ahead of her time my mother's message was."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Monica couple and their three children stood awestruck in
front of Michelangelo's David at the Galleria dell' Accademia in
Florence, Italy. Inspired by the piece's rare beauty, the 39-year-old
mother urged her two older children to sketch the sculpture in their
journals. But her husband, who abhorred the pressing crowd and the
steamy July heat, nixed the idea because he wanted to move on.</LD>
<LD>   His veto incited his wife to rage. "I bit his head off.... I just
jumped on him like there was no tomorrow," said the woman, who asked
her name not be used, as she now regards the outburst last month as
an embarrassment. "Of course, two hours later, I started my period
and he said, 'Well, that explains it.' I wanted to reach over and
smack him, but it was true."</LD>
<LD>   The woman had what some physicians and social scientists call a
"premenstrual outburst." Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, had so
exacerbated her irritability, hostility and tension that it was as if
a switch had been thrown, unleashing a fury out of proportion to her
unsuspecting husband's offense.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, not even a vacation in Italy can diminish some women's
PMS, the symptoms of which can include bloating, weight gain,
headaches, fatigue, backaches, change in sexual interest, poor
concentration, increased appetite, moodiness, anxiousness and
increased irritability, tension and hostility. Between 30% and 40% of
women experience PMS, usually seven to 10 days before their menstrual
flow begins.</TE>
<TE>   Theories about the cause of PMS abound and have to do with various
changes in a premenstrual woman's body chemistry. No theory, however,
is conclusive.</TE>
<TE>   Just how PMS affects a woman's relationship with her husband or
boyfriend is unclear. But a survey released last week by the National
Assn. of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, a professional
organization based in Washington, D.C., and IVillage, a Web site
dedicated to women's issues, suggests that men don't want to get too
cuddly with Our Lady of Chaotic Hormones.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 1,538 U.S. men (older than 18 and in a stable,
exclusive relationship with a woman for at least a year) and 1,562
women participated in the telephone survey. Men were asked to comment
about their partners, while women were asked to comment on how their
female friends and sisters' PMS affected their relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "We found that 68% of men noticed strained relationships with
their wife or girlfriend due to PMS," said Susan Wysocki, president
and chief executive of the nurse practitioners group. "One woman
suffering from PMS said to me, 'I just felt like yelling at my
husband and he was just being his usual sweet self. So I yelled at
him and I felt horrible.'"</TE>
<TE>   One can assume such men don't feel so great either. Forty-one
percent of the men surveyed reported that PMS increased tension with
their partner, 46% said it diminished their partner's happiness and
34% said it decreased their own happiness. About a third said that
PMS negatively affected their sex life and increased conflict. A
little more than a quarter said it caused them to spend less time
with their partner.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-eight percent of women whose best friends or sisters
exhibit symptoms of PMS say their relationship is affected
negatively. Sixty-seven percent reported noticing their loved one's
diminished happiness. Nearly a third of women reported increased
tension in the relationship due to their friend's or sister's PMS
while almost one-quarter of women said they fought more due to a
friend's or sister's PMS.</TE>
<TE>   The great majority of women--78%--whose best friends or sisters
exhibit symptoms of PMS said their relationships were affected
negatively. Nearly a third of women reported increased tension in the
relationship due to their friend or sister's PMS while almost one
quarter said they fought more due to a friend's or sister's PMS.</TE>
<TE>   There is a paucity of research about PMS, its causes and cures. A
few psychologists have investigated what tactics might help couples
weather the hormonal and emotional storms that appear to accompany
PMS. In 1993, David N. Dixon, a professor of counseling psychology at
Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., and co-researchers divided 30
married women who met the criteria for PMS into two groups.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen of the women were placed in one group and, along with
their husbands, asked to record physical, behavioral and emotional
symptoms during the wife's premenstrual phase of her cycle for three
months. The other group of women charted their symptoms solo. At the
end of three months, the researchers found that the couples' group
rated marital satisfaction significantly higher than the control
group.</TE>
<TE>   "Just having the husband become aware of the symptoms the wife was
experiencing seemed to help a lot," Dixon said. "Rather than
attributing the cause of a particular problem to personality or a
permanent characteristic of the person, couples attributed the cause
to PMS. I speculate the husbands became more empathic."</TE>
<TE>   Lonnie Barbach, a clinical psychologist based in San Francisco,
said she counsels couples to mark the calendar for those days when
PMS will hit and asks them to avoid discussing subjects that are
sources of conflict. (Remodeling plans, for instance, would probably
rank at the top of dangerous topics.) When an emotional outburst
occurs on the marked days, a woman is better able to say, "I'm sorry,
I'm premenstrual," Barbach said. She is better able to use her "head
to influence her emotions," because she is aware that her emotional
reactions may have nothing to do with her husband or kids.</TE>
<TE>   "Partners also become more sympathetic if they know when PMS is
going to happen because they are not getting blamed and they deal
with the tension better if they know they are not the object of the
moods," said Barbach, author of "The Pause: Positive Approaches to
Perimenopause and Menopause" (Plume, 2002). A reciprocal situation,
she said, is her own: "The man I live with gets depressed a lot and I
can be solicitous as long as I know that it's not me, that I am not
the object of his moods."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the woman who was traveling in Italy with her husband
and children marks her calendar so she can better understand her mood
swings. But she also has an irregular menstrual cycle, which
compromises predictability.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, all was fine in Florence. Once her husband understood
that her rage was partly PMS and partly because she did want the
children to draw the statue, he capitulated. "In the end, the kids
did sketch David," she said, "because we had to wait in line to get
into the basilica anyway."</TE>

<DH>Care for a hand massage with your root canal? A Westside
office fills a hole in the dental world using the spa concept.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTHA GROVES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a word to the wise patient headed to see dentist Lynn
Watanabe: Before you go, brush your teeth and wash your feet.</LD>
<LD>   While Watanabe picks at your gums and scrapes plaque off your
molars, a massage therapist will be giving your feet a complimentary
rub. Think "ah" instead of "ow."</LD>
<LD>   In a bid to make dental work seem downright pleasurable, Watanabe
in May opened Dental Spa, a multi-tasker's delight offering facials,
massages and root canals. Watanabe, 38, believes that the Pacific
Palisades office is the first of its kind in California and perhaps
the first in the Western U.S.</LD>
<TE>   The business joins a handful of dental practices in New York and
Texas that have begun serving up paraffin baths and reflexology--even
Botox injections--to entice dental phobes and to improve the
experience for plucky regulars. With studies indicating that as many
as 12 million Americans balk at visiting a dentist because of fear or
anxiety, there's a potentially large pool to tap.</TE>
<TE>   And where better, patients say, to roll out a drilling-edge dental
concept with self-indulgent overtones than the Westside of Los
Angeles, home to thousands of bonded and bleached teeth?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't underestimate the hedonistic and sybaritic qualities of
the Californians," said Harley Jean Kozak, an actress and Dental Spa
patient for whom a visit to a typical dentist conjures images of
Laurence Olivier's sadistic probing of Dustin Hoffman's mouth in
"Marathon Man."</TE>
<TE>   Clients know they are in for a different sort of dentistry from
the moment they enter Dental Spa, on the second floor of a wood-sided
office building a block south of Sunset Boulevard, with a view of
mountains and a nursery.</TE>
<TE>   First, there are the unmistakable strains of "spa music," those
blood-pressure-reducing selections popular in places where patrons
get plucked and pampered.</TE>
<TE>   On the counter sits a clear glass pitcher of water, afloat with
lemon and lime slices, beside a bowl of plump peaches and a plate of
almonds. Candles burn; fountains trickle. A small cabinet displays
soaps, lotions and toothpaste, all for sale. About the only thing
that brings a dental patient back to reality is the rack of
magazines.</TE>
<TE>   A Dental Spa banner lists the usual and the unexpected--all dental
services, massage therapy, aromatherapy, facials/cosmetology
services, complimentary chair-side massage (hands or feet, take your
pick).</TE>
<TE>   "I created this to help transform the industry," Watanabe said. "I
want people to leave here feeling great."</TE>
<TE>   A 1995 graduate of the University of the Pacific dental school in
San Francisco, Watanabe hatched the idea for a combination spa and
dental office several years ago with her husband, John Chien, who
grew up in Malibu. As they searched for just the right beach
community, away from traffic and noise, Watanabe worked as a dentist
in several communities, most recently Huntington Beach. She joined
the Holistic Dental Assn., based in Durango, Colo., and encountered
other practitioners who reaffirmed her belief in a mind-body
connection.</TE>
<TE>   Dental schools, in Watanabe's view, are skilled at teaching
students how to use the latest in high-tech gear and techniques, but
innovative approaches to reducing patients' stress are scarce as
hen's teeth. (On its Web site, the American Dental Assn. advises
those bothered by the sound of the drill to "try visualizing yourself
relaxing on a warm beach.")</TE>
<TE>   At a seminar on how to open a spa, Watanabe met Carol Williams, an
aesthetician--someone who gives facials--massage therapist and
self-described dental phobe. Williams agreed to join forces with
Watanabe and Toni Marlow, a massage therapist who has also worked
with plastic surgeons. Joleen Rizzo, an Emmy Award-winning makeup
artist, signed on to provide makeup services by appointment.</TE>
<TE>   In June, Dental Spa became the first of its kind to join the Day
Spa Assn., an 8-year-old trade group for about 600 spas, individuals
and vendors. So specialized is Dental Spa that Hannelore R. Leavy,
the association's founder and executive director, wasn't sure how to
classify it. So she established a subgroup called the Medical Spa
Assn., with about 10 founding members, including Dental Spa,
detoxification clinics and other medically oriented services.</TE>
<TE>   "The day spa industry has developed itself as more of a
beauty-oriented business," Leavy said. "Now the really serious spas
want to distinguish themselves from the pampering places. We see more
and more spas offering total wellness as opposed to just treatments."</TE>
<TE>   That is precisely what Watanabe had in mind. She wanted to go well
beyond the usual primitive relaxation methods--portable audio players
or colorful posters tacked to the ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   She and her team recently went to work on Diane Cote, a Pacific
Palisades hairdresser who was having her teeth cleaned before moving
to Paris.</TE>
<TE>   From the tiny "relaxation room" (a.k.a. waiting area), Cote, who
in March completed chemotherapy for breast cancer, stepped into the
dental area and settled into a light-green vinyl chair. As Watanabe
reclined the chair, Cote looked up at two ceiling panels featuring
blue sky and white clouds. The air smelled faintly of tangerine and
lavender, released by a candle heating a tiny pool of essential oil
in a ceramic holder. On a monitor mounted high on the wall, she could
watch a "mood tape" featuring slow-motion scenes of waterfalls and
flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Marlow brought out a heated cushion filled with flax seeds that
she positioned under Cote's neck. She then removed Cote's shoes and
began rubbing her feet with massage lotion. As a bonus, Williams
massaged Cote's hands with a salt scrub, removing the remnants with a
steaming towel.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Watanabe was performing the presumed main
attraction--a cleaning, for which she uses paste flavored like cookie
dough or pina colada. Even with a suction straw in her mouth, Cote
smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "It was interesting having all these things going on at the same
time," she said afterward. "When you're at the dentist, you're tense.
This definitely does distract you from thinking, 'When am I going to
get poked?' "</TE>
<TE>   Had she chosen to indulge, Cote could have padded down the hall in
white spa slippers to Williams' facial room or Marlow's massage room.</TE>
<TE>   Watanabe does not charge extra for her dental services, even with
the complimentary massage. A cleaning is still $75. Other spa
services are extra.</TE>
<TE>   Dental patients get discounts on spa services, and package deals
are available, including for parent and child. A full-body, one-hour
massage or one-hour facial is $50 for dental patients or $65 for
non-patients. (The summer rate for patients or non-patients is $45.)
This month's special: a full-body massage or facial with
teeth-whitening for $350. Each new customer leaves with a
complimentary "spa in a bag," filled with toothbrush, toothpaste and
spa lotions or sprays.</TE>
<TE>   Business is picking up, Watanabe said, but so too are the tensions
any new business would face, even one dedicated to relaxation. Just
last week, Williams left the company, complaining that answering
phones, which she was occasionally asked to do, should not be part of
an aesthetician's duties. And on Friday, Marlow, too, said she was
leaving over differences with Watanabe and Chien.</TE>
<TE>   Chien said the success of a spa depends on having a closely knit
team willing to do whatever is necessary, especially a spa that is
trying to build up steam, and not just for facials. He said he and
Watanabe hope to hire new employees soon.</TE>
<TE>   If the concept takes off, they hope to franchise it. A San
Francisco dental school classmate of Watanabe's has expressed
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a plastic surgeon for whom Marlow used to work has
offered to give wrinkle-reducing Botox injections at Dental Spa, an
idea that Watanabe is considering.</TE>
<TE>   The American Dental Assn. hasn't yet taken a position on dental
spas. But the concept is getting some buzz.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's kind of innovative," said Sigmund Abelson, a retired

<TE>   But the idea will probably appall many old-school professionals,

<DL></DL>
<LD>Have you ever wondered about the history of your home or apartment?
How it was built or when? These questions have to do with
architecture--the design of a building or house. Let me tell you a
little about how I was built.</LD>
<LD>   I am Rancho Los Cerritos, built by John Temple in 1844. I am one
of the last two-story adobes in Southern California. For this reason,
I am also known as a national, state and local historic landmark.</LD>
<LD>   The building material used most in Mexican California was
sun-dried mud bricks, or adobe. The bricks, made by Indian workers,
weighed as much as 55 pounds each, and were made from sand, straw and
the local clay soil mixed with water and mashed together by foot in a
deep pit. The bricks were formed in wooden molds, then left to dry in
the sun. The whole process took at least a month. I was built with 2-
and 3-foot-thick walls, mud-plastered and then whitewashed with a
lime mixture. I am a combination of Mexican and American building
styles often called Monterey Colonial.</LD>
<TE>   Then, in 1930, my new owner wanted to make his home more
comfortable for his family. He added the current red tile roof, a sun
porch, electricity, plumbing and heating. These changes resulted in a
popular style at that time called Mission Revival.</TE>
<TE>   I have been around for 158 years and have been through many
changes. I have also seen changes in my neighborhood. I once stood
alone on the hillside where I could see for miles--all the way to the
ocean. Back then there were no tall trees, houses or buildings
around. Only me. Now there are buildings and homes everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   What about your home or apartment building? Does it have a name?
What building style is it? Research the history of your home and
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   You can learn more about what Rancho Los Cerritos was like during
the 19th and 20th centuries from 12:30 to 4:30 p.m. Sunday at its
History Mystery Hunt. Admission is free. Call (562) 570-1755 for more
details.</TE>

<HD>Her Calling: To Help Others Find a Voice</HD>
<DH>A nun and social worker motivates residents to speak up so

<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY ROURKE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The playground of Santo Nino Center filled up with families from its
downtown L.A. neighborhood one recent evening. Parents, grandparents
and children ventured into a part of town where most people stay home
after dark, but this gathering meant enough to them that they were
willing to risk the danger.</LD>
<LD>   As representatives of the Los Angeles Police Department, L.A.
Unified School District and City Council arrived to meet with them
and answer their questions about safety and local school conditions,
other neighbors watched from the steps of their battered stucco
homes. Squad cars parked nearby were reassuring, but fathers still
pulled their children close when a gleaming car crawled past,
thumping like a boombox.</LD>
<LD>   At the chain-link fence, Sister Maribeth Larkin, a Catholic nun
who walks with the tilt of a general, handed out programs but kept
one eye on the speaker's platform. After all, she had coached the
parents and schoolteachers who would speak out, asking some tough
questions this night, and she was eager to keep things moving.</LD>
<TE>   Larkin is a Sister of Social Service, a professional social worker
and a senior organizer for L.A. Metro Strategy, which teaches
concerned members of churches, schools and community centers how to
make allies of local leaders who can then help them improve their
neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Some of her latest students, 100 or so organizers in training from
cities around the Southwest, filled the back rows of chairs set up on
the center's playground. Larkin, 52, is teaching them to launch
community gatherings like the one they have come here to observe.</TE>
<TE>   She winced at the suggestion that she deserves any credit. "I show
people how to exercise their own power, to organize themselves and
confront injustice," she said. "They get the credit. All I do is
identify talent and mentor people. It's all about relationships."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year or so, the families living near Santo Nino at the
edge of the city's garment district have lost 10 young people to
street violence. Eight-year-old Anthony Ramirez, the most recent
victim, was killed in April by a random bullet that shot through
Trinity Park, the local patch of green. For the evening's meeting,
fourth-graders at Trinity School decorated the playground with
messages of grief: "No More Broken Promises," "I Am Tired of the
Gangs."</TE>
<TE>   Their pleas seemed weary beyond their years, but the words
expressed just why most of the 300 people in the audience attended.
This gathering, or "action"--a word Larkin has coined to describe a
dialogue with city representatives to voice specific
concerns--included questions to the officials but also stories about
the children. In their schools, residents said, the bathrooms are so
dirty that the young ones wet their clothes rather than use them. The
local park belongs to the drug dealers, and the dangerous streets
cost elementary schoolchildren like Anthony Ramirez their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Each story ended with a question put to the speaker's platform.</TE>
<TE>   Schools Supt. Roy Romer, will you meet with us and make sure that
money actually goes to the schools most in need of repairs? And get
us the school maintenance staff we need?</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Police Chief Peggy York, will you help create a strategy
for better policing in our community? And is it true there will be a
new police substation in Trinity Park?</TE>
<TE>   Romer made some general promises; York was specific. "To answer
you directly, yes," she said about the police station. "We've worked
very well in the past with L.A. Metro groups who've taken the
initiative to take back their streets."</TE>
<TE>   That night was a new beginning for a neighborhood that is ready to
turn things around. For Larkin, nights like this are part of a
personal mission of more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   She chose the Sisters of Social Service for that reason and joined
the community at age 21, then went on to earn a social work degree.
"As a younger person I wasn't really attracted to religious life,"
she said. "All I knew of, for nuns, was teaching and hospital work. I
didn't want to do either."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Long Beach, one of four children who lived "on the lower
side of middle income," Larkin worked at a summer camp run by the
Social Service nuns and learned more about them.</TE>
<TE>   Later, at Holy Names College in Oakland, she did her share of
protest marching against the war in Vietnam. "I didn't feel that I
was very good at agitating," she said. "We live in an anesthetized
culture. We're not supposed to talk about certain things. But by
being around it we learn to keep agitating, and we overcome our
personal histories."</TE>
<TE>   Her first lessons in standing up for herself, and others, came
from her older cousin, Mary Margaret, who has Down's syndrome. "Mary
Margaret taught me to be attentive to others and not embarrassed,"
Larkin said. She remembers Mary Margaret at a recent family funeral
leading the cousins in an impromptu dance around the coffin.</TE>
<TE>   As a young Sister of Social Service, Larkin worked with people who
were stuck in bureaucratic red tape because of their poverty, illness
or prison records. "It was crisis intervention," she said. "I
realized I was bandaging the problems. With the power we have as
sisters, as a church, we can do more than crisis intervention."</TE>
<TE>   The brash, confrontational work of an organizer seems an odd
choice for someone who describes herself as shy. "I understand that
most people don't respond to injustice because they feel invisible,"
she told her students after their night as observers at Santo Nino.
"I'm a shy person; I'm not prone to social activism."</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't stop the negotiator nun from wrapping up
conversations with a direct, "I'd like to talk about our next steps."
And she will throw any plan off-kilter with a quick, "We'll have to
see about that."</TE>
<TE>   In her earliest years as a social worker, Larkin spent a lot of
time in the waiting rooms of government agencies, surrounded by
people who had been there for days. She, however, got faster
attention. "Because I am Anglo, a nun, a professional social worker,"
she explained. "It made me angry. I didn't want to be complicit in
this."</TE>
<TE>   At about that time she got involved with the Industrial Areas
Foundation, the national network of which L.A. Metro is part. In the
'70s, she moved to New York, then Texas and finally back to Los
Angeles in 1999. The network crosses economic and religious lines.
Locally, All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena and Leo Baeck Temple
in Bel-Air are among the 80 members of L.A. Metro Strategy.</TE>
<TE>   To start standing up to the system, Larkin told her students
during their last class, they have to believe that confronting
injustice can be the start of change. "To stay with it," she added,
"you have to believe in the possibility of goodness. That's what
keeps anger in check."</TE>
<TE>   It can be distressing to watch Larkin talk about things that
matter to her. Her eyes scrunch, the tic in her shoulder will not be
calmed, her voice grows heavy with emotion. At times she steps up
onto her toes or drops her knees as if she's just caught a heavy
weight.</TE>
<TE>   "You might not associate a nun with passion," said Lucy Morado,
one of Larkin's students. "But Sister Maribeth is a very passionate
person. She cares about being an organizer and cares about families."</TE>
<TE>   Morado met Larkin three years ago when she came to speak to
members of St. Matthias Church in Huntington Park, where Morado is
director of religious education. At the time, Morado was beginning to
sense that she had to come off the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   At the Santo Nino meeting, where most families in the audience
were first- and second-generation Mexican Americans, Morado was among
those who questioned Romer. "I never thought I could stand up and
speak publicly," Morado said later.</TE>
<TE>   "But watching Sister Maribeth has helped me. It's very important
to demand your rights and demand respect." Morado might say it takes
courage to go public; Larkin would say it takes imagination. "We
can't do things we've never done unless we can imagine ourselves
doing them," Larkin told her class. "We can't change our communities
unless we can imagine that it's possible to create a place where
children are not getting shot."</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Ramirez deserved that much. "When we look for leaders for
L.A. Metro, we look for certain qualities," Larkin said. One is the
ability to understand the two kinds of anger. "Calculated anger and
rage. One is impotent; the other can be a virtue."</TE>

<LD>When I was a little girl long ago, I had a best friend named Ruth. We
lived on the same street in Youngstown, Ohio, and went to the same
school. My name is Shirley, and when we played dolls we named them
Ruth Shirley and Shirley Ruth.</LD>
<LD>   My daddy worked in an office, which wasn't very interesting to me.
Ruth's daddy, Mr. Burt, had a better job. He owned a candy shop. Mr.
Burt even invented a lollipop that he called the Jolly Boy Sucker.
Sometimes he gave one each to Ruth and me, and that was a great
treat.</LD>
<LD>   Once after school when we stopped at the shop, we found out that
the Jolly Boy Sucker had a new name. There had been a lot of talk
about the importance of people eating good food to keep healthy.
There was also talk that good-tasting food could help put people in a
happy mood. So Ruth's daddy renamed the lollipop a Good Humor Sucker.</LD>
<TE>   Ruth had a brother, Harry. He helped make ice cream to sell in the
shop. If candy was a treat, ice cream was a double, triple, quadruple
treat!</TE>
<TE>   Harry used a hand-cranked ice cream freezer. That was slow work.
But business was good back then, and the Burts were happy at their
work.</TE>
<TE>   As I said, Ruth and I were little girls. We never thought about
her daddy and his business becoming something so special that it
would reach across America. We were happy to get lollipops,
peppermint sticks and a taste now and then of a new ice cream flavor.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1920, Ruth's daddy and her brother had an idea.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: What was the idea?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   This story, by Nancy Smiler Levinson, is based on the true history
of the Good Humor ice cream bar, a chapter in a book on the social
history of ice cream, "We All Scream for Ice Cream!" by Lee Wardlaw,
HarperCollins 2000. Levinson's story will be on The Times Web site at
www.la times.com/kids.</TE>

<HD>Vanishing Voices</HD>
<DH>Time is catching up with a generation of old-school
communicators who served as soothing elders in a society that seems
to get noisier by the day</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their voices were filling and reassuring, the communications
equivalent of meatloaf and mashed potatoes. They spoke to their
audiences in the stick-to-the-ribs, common-sense argot of the rural
Midwest, even if they originally hailed from, say, New York or San
Francisco, and even if they'd long since been transplanted to some
tropical oasis like Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   And now they're gone, or going fast: Ann Landers, Jack Buck,
Walter Cronkite, Mike Royko--maybe you'd want to throw Pauline Kael's
name in the pot as well. An advice-giver, a sports broadcaster, an
avuncular network news anchor (still very much alive, thank you, but
retired), a big-city newspaper columnist, and the waspish queen bee
of movie critics.</LD>
<LD>   Voices of a generation, they were trusted friends and late-night
comforters and confidantes, benign authority figures whose power
resided in their calm self-assurance and peppery directness ("Wake up
and smell the coffee!"), soothing, low-key elders in a society that
seems to get younger and noisier by the minute.</LD>
<TE>   As a group, they personified what one academic calls a media
culture of "companionship" versus the current one of confrontation.
Last week, two more of them officially fell silent. Chick Hearn, the
legendary Lakers play-by-play announcer and ex-officio ambassador,
died a week ago, ending a relationship with local listeners that had
spanned nine U.S. presidents. Last week also brought confirmation
that Pauline Phillips, a.k.a. Dear Abby, is suffering from
Alzheimer's disease and is no longer writing her nationally
syndicated advice column, a task that has fallen to her daughter,
Jeanne Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   While words like "icon" and "fixture" inevitably are used to pay
tribute to such figures, their stature may have had as much to do
with sheer consistency and dependability as with whatever snappy
phrases or dazzling insights they imparted, says Irving Rein, a
communications studies professor at Northwestern University. "It was
the whole notion of having a friend or a relationship, of somebody
translating events to you in what you consider common-sense
vernacular," he says. "I won't say it's like the faithful dog, but
they perform a certain ritual."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the advantage these old-school communicators enjoyed in
building longevity was a more stable, paternalistic, homogenous
structure of media ownership. Just as the old Hollywood studios
created brand identity by locking their biggest stars into exclusive
multiyear contracts, so other media established continuity by
cultivating what was once a relatively limited pool of recognizable
names and voices.</TE>
<TE>   Sportscasters like Hearn and Boston Celtics announcer Johnny Most
were identified for their careers with single teams and single
sports, and Cronkite with a single network, CBS. Abby and Ann's mug
shots anchored many a newspaper's feature sections, becoming
practically as familiar as the faces of our own relatives.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, in today's corporate media culture of churn, a
familiar face may be gone overnight. This week's star MTV VJ or hot
sex columnist could be at the front of next week's unemployment line.
"The turnover of celebrities is much faster now," says Rein. ""We can
hardly keep track of them."</TE>
<TE>   "Back in the days before mass communication, it took a much longer
time to build up authority figures," says Ray Browne, professor
emeritus of popular culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio
and author of dozens of books on American popular culture.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Browne says, "we're all free agents, and in a capitalistic
world, free agents are out for their own aggrandizement. Baseball
players used to have loyalty to the team. Now they have loyalty to
the check."</TE>
<TE>   Another thing that anchored these vanishing voices and
personalities was a sense of place, a regional identity that stuck
with them even as they went on to establish wider reputations.
Landers, though nationally syndicated, was from the Iowa heartland
and made her base in adjoining Chicago throughout her long career.
Buck was synonymous with St. Louis, Hearn with L.A., and Royko with
the Windy City's bare-fisted blue-collar attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Cronkite never lost the folksiness of his Missouri and Texas past,
and Kael kept her Bay Area countercultural friskiness intact during
her tenure at the New Yorker, pillar of East Coast sophistication.
Like Will Rogers, an earlier paragon of plain-spoken truth, wit and
intelligence, these "companion" commentators spoke locally but
projected nationally, sometimes even globally. Their association with
a particular place gave them access to a loyal built-in audience in a
way that was very different from the global access granted by the
free-floating, everywhere-but-nowhere Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "These people had a kind of a franchise on the business. There was
no competition," Rein says. "They built an intimacy with their
clients that isn't going to be there anymore. CNN isn't going to
develop those kind of characters."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Browne says, the talking heads keep proliferating and the
audiences have gone worldwide. But exposure isn't the same as trust
and reliability. It may, in fact, be its reverse. "What is it, 500
[cable] channels? And all of them stay on 24 hours a day," Browne
grouses.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the disappearance of someone like Hearn can seem more
important for a city than getting a new mayor, Rein says. These were
people, he says, who conveyed the sense that a Los Angeles was
different from a Trenton or a Philadelphia, that America isn't one
vast, undifferentiated swath of Wendy's and McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   "As they disappear from our lives, we're beginning to lose our
identity," he says. "Los Angeles has lost one more part of its Los
Angeles-ness."</TE>
<TE>   Or, Rein admits, it could simply be gaining a new identity. Our
old "companion" voices might not have liked the change, but, ever
direct, they wouldn't have denied it. As Cronkite would've said,
that's the way it is.</TE>

<HD>Aerosmith Has Power to Stay Current</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Aerosmith, once the '70s rock band considered most likely to
vaporize, keeps finding new ways to extend its musical life and its
lock on the public's affection. The Boston-based quartet is as hot as
ever as it prepares to start its latest U.S. tour on Tuesday in
Holmdel, N.J., with a Los Angeles stop expected in early November.</LD>
<LD>   It's one of the rare veteran rock acts that not only has held on
to much of its old audience, but also has continually attracted new
fans, partly because of its appeal with succeeding generations of
musicians.</LD>
<LD>   The latest newcomers to pledge their allegiance to Steven Tyler,
Joe Perry and company include rapper Eminem and pop-punk bad girl
Pink.</LD>
<TE>   Eminem sampled Aerosmith's hit "Dream On" in "Sing for the Moment"
on his new album, "The Eminem Show." He made his pitch to use
Aerosmith's anthem directly to the band backstage after a concert he
attended. The same song has turned up on Bay Area rock band Train's
set list lately.</TE>
<TE>   The band has also racked up points with teenage fans for Tyler's
duet with Pink on the bluesy "Misery" on her latest album,
"Missundaztood." Tyler wrote the song for Aerosmith but the band
never recorded it. He also turned up to sing it with her in May when
her tour stopped in Boston. They paired up again during Pink's set at
Wango Tango in June at the Rose Bowl, where she also sang Aerosmith's
"Janie's Got a Gun."</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side of the pop-culture spectrum, Aerosmith also has a
big fan in Hilary Duff, the 14-year-old star of Disney Channel's
"Lizzie McGuire." Duff persuaded Tyler to appear on the show with two
of his children in a December episode in which the rocker will play
Santa."They've somehow managed to stay in the media spotlight,
whether it's soundtrack tie-ins or whatever; they've really done a
remarkable job," says Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert
industry tracking publication Pollstar. "They're also one of the few
acts that can get their new records played on the air, and in today's
radio environment, that isn't easy for an act that's been around as
long as they have."</TE>
<TE>   Bongiovanni noted that the band's 2001 tour grossed $49.3 million,
making it the seventh-highest grossing tour of the year, and that
Aerosmith was one of only five acts that sold more than 1 million
tickets in North America during the year, putting it in a club with
U2, the Dave Matthews Band, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.</TE>

<HD>Theaters Honor Shadow Box Tickets</HD>

<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Shadow Box Productions recently canceled the three remaining
shows in its series of musicals at El Portal Theatre in North
Hollywood, it looked as if the 2,030 subscribers might have to
sacrifice tickets that cost about $80 or $90 per subscriber.</LD>
<LD>   Other theater companies, however, have agreed to honor the Shadow
Box tickets.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency and the Valley
Theatre League, a San Fernando Valley association of theaters, will
send Shadow Box subscribers new tickets that can be used at a variety
of sub-100-seat theaters in North Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   The participating theaters are Antaeus, Actors Forum, Actors
Workout, Bitter Truth Playhouse, Group Repertory, Raven Playhouse,
Theatre Unlimited, Whitmore-Lindley, Players' Space, Secret Rose and
Zombie Joe's. Additional theaters are expected to join the list.</TE>
<TE>   The tickets must be used by the end of 2002, and the theaters
require ticket-holders to make reservations. The Community
Redevelopment Agency and Valley Theatre League will partially
reimburse participating theaters.</TE>
<TE>   In separate deals, the Colony Theatre in Burbank and venues in
Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach used by the Civic Light Opera of
South Bay Cities are also offering to accept Shadow Box tickets.</TE>
<TE>   The collapse of the Shadow Box season will not affect other
productions at El Portal.</TE>

<DL>RADNOR, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The Bachelor apparently will stay that way a little longer.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Michel chose Amanda Marsh from among 25 contestants on ABC's
reality dating show "The Bachelor" last spring, but Marsh said Michel
hasn't been courting her.</LD>
<LD>   On more than one occasion, "he told me to get a cab to meet him at
events," Marsh, 23, told TV Guide for its Aug. 17 issue.</LD>
<TE>   Michel once said he was "too busy" to pick her up at the airport,
Marsh said. He didn't help her find her an apartment, and he reneged
on his offer to drive her to Los Angeles, Marsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was obviously not a priority of his, so he was not going to be
a priority of mine," said Marsh, who has decided to stay in Kansas
and is training to be a radio-station disc jockey.</TE>
<TE>   The 32-year-old Michel, a former San Francisco management
consultant, said Marsh's radio job "sounds cool" and it wouldn't be
"loving" of him to dissuade her from it.</TE>

<HD>'Sex' and a Changed City</HD>
<DH>Television* Sept. 11 ended a giddy era in New York; the HBO
show incorporates subtle references to it but keeps focus on the
women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BAUDER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It had already been a lousy day for "Sex and the City" columnist
Carrie Bradshaw when she tried to get on the subway. The entrance was
roped off--another terrorist alert in an already skittish city had
shut it down.</LD>
<LD>   Recognize that scene from the HBO comedy's season-opener last
month? No?</LD>
<LD>   That's because it was filmed and discarded, deemed heavy-handed
and untrue to what the city is experiencing in the summer of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   "Sex and the City" producers faced a delicate balancing act this
season. Not only did they have to craft compelling stories for the
show's four women, they had to be true to dramatic changes in the
fifth character: the city of New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks ended a giddy, supercharged era in
New York's history--a crucial part of the show's identity.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I thought about the show was, 'How do we do it?
How do you continue?' " executive producer Michael Patrick King said,
recalling last fall. "One of the things that people like about the
show is that we talk about what goes on in New York, a travelogue of
what can happen."</TE>
<TE>   It was an awkward time in the "Sex and the City" filming schedule.
A short season of new episodes had already been filmed to air in
January and would contain no references to what happened.</TE>
<TE>   Quite by chance, the mood of those episodes seemed in line with
the city's. The final scene of Carrie, fresh from another missed
connection with Mr. Big, walking down a city street as a leaf
fluttered toward her captured an autumnal feeling.</TE>
<TE>   King convened his writers in December to begin thinking about the
new season, knowing part of their job was to anticipate how the city
would seem months later.</TE>
<TE>   King decided to concentrate on where the characters were going.
"It's always about the city filtered through these girls' eyes," he
said. "It was never designed to capture a mass feeling about
anything. We never thought about doing a 'where were you then'
episode, or trying to trivialize the event at all."</TE>
<TE>   The references left in were subtle--a joke about "manthrax," and a
passing mention about the need to shop downtown to help struggling
shopkeepers.</TE>
<TE>   In an upcoming episode, Carrie balks at having to fly somewhere,
saying, "I get a little nervous seeing the National Guard go through
my makeup case."</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed to hit the right notes," King said. "We and the
audience were in the same place. I was surprised at how many critics
mentioned the references. They liked the reality. It was just a way
of showing that we were not writing in a vacuum."</TE>
<TE>   The season-opening episode, where the women attended a "fleet
week" social gathering to check out visiting sailors, elevated New
York's importance to the series in unexpected ways.</TE>
<TE>   It was jarring when a Louisiana sailor complained about the city's
noise and garbage in a conversation with Carrie. Not that those words
hadn't been heard before--they're practically a cliche for
out-of-towners--but it seemed so strange at a time other qualities of
the city are being celebrated.</TE>
<TE>   Carrie didn't take him home for the night. A few years earlier she
might have, but it's an older Carrie. Slurring something that she
loved was also a real turn-off.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a bad day in New York, you have a bad day," King
said. "If you have a bad day in your relationship, you say you want
to get out of it. Nobody thinks of leaving the city because of a bad
day. We started to realize that we're more understanding of our city
than our lovers."</TE>
<TE>   HBO's advertising campaign for the current season features New
York scenes when it never has before. Previously, star Sarah Jessica
Parker and the other women were photographed for ads in a studio.
This time, Parker is shown around New York--at a hot dog stand, in a
cab or eating a slice of pizza. She looks wistful and pensive in some
shots, as opposed to happily anticipating a night out. While it's
primarily because the show's women are getting older and facing the
prospect of life alone, it was also done with the city in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "What we tried to do is reflect the appropriate tone," said Eric
Kessler, HBO's executive vice president for marketing.</TE>
<TE>   King said it feels like New York is in for some rough times. A
year ago, he filmed a scene with a homeless person outside an
expensive handbag store but didn't use it because it didn't feel
right. He was startled a few weeks ago to see the same scene in real
life.</TE>
<TE>   The good times may be running out for "Sex and the City" too. King
sees himself being involved for one more year after this season.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to stay at the party while it's still a party," he said.</TE>

<LD>SANTA BARBARA--The world of East Suffolk as captured by Benjamin
Britten lives, breathes and sings in the delightful production of
Britten's "Albert Herring" put on by Music Academy of the West in the
historic Lobero Theatre here, over the weekend.</LD>
<LD>   Successfully staging "Herring," a chamber opera for an ensemble of
13 accomplished singers and an equal number of instrumentalists, is
no easy feat, for there are pitfalls in its casting, execution and
demands on enunciation and vocalism.</LD>
<LD>   But once again, the Music Academy's operatic management--vocal
programs director Marilyn Horne, conductor Randall Behr and guest
stage director Lotfi Mansouri--have put together a show that is a joy
to watch and hear.</LD>
<TE>   Seen Friday night--it was repeated at a Sunday matinee--this
handsome production is funny, credible and sung by young voices
mostly at their peak of promise.</TE>
<TE>   Behr's leadership keeps the music in motion and the singing
operating at a conversational level. Mansouri's fluent staging allows
the singers to use their acting muscles without overstating, an easy,
potential error in this opera. Every member of the cast inhabits his
or her character fully but without caricature. Daily life in 1900
Loxford, East Suffolk, is enacted believably.</TE>
<TE>   William Ferguson makes a true-to-life Albert, who comes into focus
only as the action accelerates and earns the audience's affection
gradually, as the character proves himself. Ferguson's utter lack of
self-consciousness also adds dimension to the singing and the acting.</TE>
<TE>   In the person of Erin Wood, Lady Billows dominates the scenario
appropriately; Wood's acting is on target and unflagging, despite
occasional vocal stridency and a sound that can be monochromatic.</TE>
<TE>   The difficult role demands a combination of Aida, Princess Ida and
Turandot; Wood may be on the path that leads to those plateaus.</TE>
<TE>   On this stage, she is handsomely seconded by the Florence Pike of
Megan Lathan, who may be no contralto but knows her way around this
difficult role.</TE>
<TE>   The richest, most promising voices in the cast belong to Holli
Harrison (Mum), Deborah Domanski (Nancy) and Alan Corbishley (Sid),
all of whom deliver their words with admirable clarity and sing with
ardor.</TE>
<TE>   Lady Billows' worthies are Maija Lisa Currie (Miss Wordworth),
Justin Plank (Vicar), Jeffrey Behrens (Mayor) and Alvin Crawford
(Superintendent).</TE>
<TE>   The children are sung by Faith Sherman, Wendy Bryn Harmer and Alex
Rosen.</TE>
<TE>   The production staff includes scenic designer John Coyne, costume
designer Walter Mahoney and lighting designer Connie Yun.</TE>

<HD>To Get the Real Orwellian Feel, Watch 'Big Brother 3'
Online</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER CATLIN</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a guilty enough pleasure to watch "Big Brother 3" in the three
hourlong slots each week. That may make watching it live on a special
Internet hookup 24 hours a day almost shameful.</LD>
<LD>   But it's sometimes more interesting and illuminating to log into
the activities of these chosen-for-TV schemers--who can be watched
live online--than it is to tune into CBS.</LD>
<LD>   Unlike the forced fun and games of the network broadcast, where
the hosts keep them busy for the national telecast, the normal days
offered by "Big Brother 3" video cameras can be excruciatingly
dull--and thus more lifelike.</LD>
<TE>   For those who have started to pick out the various personalities,
it's like checking in on old friends to find them washing up, making
sandwiches or endlessly playing cards.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it's more like spying on them.</TE>
<TE>   While competing for a half-million bucks, the dwindling dozen have
unwittingly allowed themselves to be the fodder of voyeur Internet
peep shows, all for a season pass of $24.95.</TE>
<TE>   Already the feed has provided the same sort of tawdry thrills of
any Campus Cuties Live Webcam site you can name. Chiara and Tonya
showered together. Lisa joined them for a peanut butter and flower
bikini fashion show, and the preparations for that show are legendary
mainly because of five minutes during which the now-evicted Tonya was
topless.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the residents have coupled up, so as to form the strongest
alliances (isn't it always that way among the young--be it dinner
parties or do-or-die survival shows: the couples vs. the single
people?).</TE>
<TE>   So we get to see them snuggle up and spoon, although they must
pull up the comforter when there's more than just dozing on their
minds.</TE>
<TE>   And although there is a share of underwear and bikini parades,
that isn't the reason for the "Big Brother 3" hookup (honest). It's
that their real personalities come out amid the everyday banter,
commonplace chores and, yes, the boredom.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the boredom, somehow, the Internet show is better. Log
on, put it on the corner of your computer work screen and turn up the
sound when things get interesting (or if the guests are trying to
keep from being heard).</TE>
<TE>   "Chiara, please put on your microphone," the disembodied voice
calls out often. It's so common that other house guests have put bets
on how much she'll be scolded for it each day (perhaps the microphone
ruins the look of her teeny bikini).</TE>
<TE>   The disembodied orders ("Danielle, please go to the video diary
room"; "Josh, please wake up") make "Big Brother 3" seem much more of
the Orwellian nightmare than the show does.</TE>
<TE>   Those who watch online might be more aware that the occupants are
being watched all the time by the 38 cameras and 62 microphones.
Sometimes, when someone is walking around the house alone, all you
can hear is the whir of the motors under the cameras trying to keep
him or her in focus.</TE>
<TE>   Online, viewers can see the bright overhead lights needed to
illuminate each player's move. These additional pressures shed a new
light on the game.</TE>
<TE>   It's clear that few of the remaining contestants dream of
capturing the last-person-standing prize of $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   After a few days of spying on the mostly young crew tanning,
eating and scheming, it's clear that the vibe is more like a summer
time share, where the key is to just keep the vacation going.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't want to be thrown out of the house," whines Josh.</TE>
<TE>   The great thing about having the feed on during work is that it
serves as instant water cooler talk for passersby (what are they
doing now?).</TE>
<TE>   The bad thing about the live feed on the East Coast is that the
contestants are usually sleeping until well after noon (except for
the solitary Gerry). The night-vision cameras promise their own
surprises, though, mostly through the nocturnal dialogue of the
recently evicted Eric, the firefighter from Milford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   Internet viewing is as lifelike as the network will allow. A
disclaimer online says "to protect the integrity of the TV show, the
feeds may be edited, delayed and/or blacked out on occasion at CBS'
sole discretion."</TE>
<TE>   It's understandable. Editing is the key to making any good reality
show as good as any other soap opera on network TV.</TE>
<TE>   But something is lost in the editing that is observable in the
day-to-day.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid editing on the network show may make it seem that, say,
Chiara may be talking about sex all the time. But on the Internet
feed, it's clear she's just always talking about all kinds of funny
things, including the personalities on other reality shows and
analysis of their strategies.</TE>
<TE>   It's been said, more than once, too, that after they're out of
"Big Brother 3," they'll be trying out for other shows, from
"Survivor" to "elimidate."</TE>
<TE>   But whatever the program, you'll never be able to see as much of
them as you will this summer, online. For information on the 24/7
feed, go to www.cbs.com.</TE>

<LD>Times television critic Howard Rosenberg has repeatedly insisted that
the media's obsessive coverage of the slayings of JonBenet Ramsey and
Samantha Runnion was due in no small part to the fact that both girls
were white ("When Personal Tragedy Becomes Public Spectacle," Aug.
2). Rosenberg has also decried the media frenzy surrounding the
disappearance of Elizabeth Smart, a "golden victim" with skin color
"matching that of nearly all the hotshots who have dispatched these
[media] hordes to Salt Lake City" (" 'POV' Has Vision to Focus on an
Ordinary Family's Strength," June 24).</LD>
<LD>   "Meanwhile," Rosenberg wrote, "similar tragedies besetting blacks
and Latinos--and all of the unwealthy--become pit stops (when covered
at all) and remain as out of vogue in some circles as sound news
judgment."</LD>
<LD>   On the face of it, the claim that the media lavish a
disproportionate amount of attention on abducted or murdered white
kids might seem to have merit. The problem is that it's possible to
make any theory about media bias seem plausible if one is willing to
ignore enough anomalous data.</LD>
<TE>   Anomalous data like the case of 8-year-old Kevin Shifflett of
Alexandria, Va. In April 2000, Kevin was killed in his frontyard by a
stranger who shouted racist epithets before slitting the boy's throat
and running away. Kevin's slaying had all the ingredients that would
normally propel a case into national headlines: a brutal
stranger-slaying, a racist killer, a suspect on the loose. But there
was one wrinkle; Kevin was white, and his alleged killer, Gregory
Murphy, who had penned a note before the killing in which he pledged
to "kill them racist white kids," was black. The national media were
nearly silent about this case (and even the Virginia media downplayed
it).</TE>
<TE>   Compare this with the example of young Sherrice Iverson, the
7-year-old, "unwealthy" African American girl killed in the bathroom
of a Nevada casino in 1997 by 18-year-old white kid Jeremy
Strohmeyer. The Iverson case made national headlines (and is still
talked about in the press).</TE>
<TE>   It should be pointed out that at least one of the victims in the
recent kidnapping in Lancaster was nonwhite, but that didn't stop
that case from turning into one of the most publicized in recent
memory.</TE>
<TE>   The examples of the Shifflett, Iverson and Lancaster kidnapping
cases no more prove a pro-minority bias on the part of the media than
the Ramsey, Smart and Runnion cases prove a pro-white bias.</TE>
<TE>   Rosenberg's bias claim is the mirror image of the media bias
claims frequently leveled by conservatives, who complain that the
media give a disproportionate amount of coverage to crimes in which
minorities are the victims and whites the perpetrators. Conservatives
often gripe that white-on-black slayings, though statistically less
common than black-on-white killings, receive greater media attention,
especially if racial animus is involved.</TE>
<TE>   It is also charged that this same media "bias" applies not only to
news coverage of small-scale, interpersonal crimes but also to
coverage of large-scale historical crimes and injustices.</TE>
<TE>   Just a few months ago, a friend of mine, a German American
survivor of a World War II U.S. internment camp, leveled a similar
accusation against the L.A. Times. My friend told me that he feels
like his childhood ordeal is purposely ignored by The Times. He
pointed out that, in the months after Sept. 11, The Times published a
good half dozen stories about America's history of civil rights
violations during times of war, and that, although the internment of
Japanese Americans and aliens was mentioned every single time, the
story of the 15,000 German noncitizens and their American spouses and
children who were also interned in camps was not mentioned once. In
fact, in a recent op-ed, former Times contributing editor Robert
Scheer actually denied that any Germans were ever interned during
WWII. (The Times published a correction of Scheer.)</TE>
<TE>   The internment of 15,000 Germans and the "registration" and house
arrest (known as "internment at large") of some 300,000 others
represents one of the largest organized incidents of anti-immigrant
discrimination in U.S. history, but The Times consistently fails to
mention it, even though World War II-era injustices involving
minorities, such as the story of the Mexican laborers who say they
were cheated out of 10% of their wages, receive frequent coverage.</TE>
<TE>   I bring all of this up for a reason: I'm sure that Howard
Rosenberg would scoff at the notion that any disparity in Times
coverage of World War II-era injustices is the result of The Times'
editors' having some kind of collective affinity or preference for
one particular racial group. But this is exactly the kind of charge
that he has leveled at other members of the press to explain the
supposed disparity in the coverage of murdered and abducted children.</TE>
<TE>   It was an unfair accusation for Rosenberg to make. The news
business is, by nature, fickle and arbitrary. Newspaper pages have to
be filled; hourlong news shows can't have dead air. There will always
be inconsistencies and inequities in coverage. Sometimes these
inequities will appear to favor whites; sometimes they will appear to
favor minorities.</TE>
<TE>   A media critic should examine all of the available evidence before
charging other journalists with the serious offense of allowing
racial favoritism to influence the very difficult choices they are
forced to make each day.</TE>

<HD>Weezer's Revenge of the Former Nerds</HD>
<DH>The band sheds its geeky image and transforms into cool
showmen for a dynamic Irvine concert</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the age of irony has indeed ended, somebody better tell Rivers
Cuomo. Leading his band Weezer in concert at Verizon Wireless
Amphitheater on Friday, the singer was all shtick, a self-impressed
rock demigod with an unending spool of smooth talk for the fans.</LD>
<LD>   This wouldn't be at all ironic for a lot of bands, but Cuomo and
Weezer have based their career on being the 98-pound weaklings of
pop. Arriving in the mid-'90s, they looked like the high school chess
club and sang impossibly catchy songs about getting beat up, shut out
and cast aside.</LD>
<LD>   When they played the Hollywood Palladium last year, returning to
the wars after a long hiatus, Cuomo lived up to his reputation as
neurotic eccentric, an owl-like figure bundled in a down vest.</LD>
<TE>   Behold the twerp transfigured.</TE>
<TE>   Weezer's rebound was a resounding success, and Rivers sauntered
onto the Irvine stage Friday in suit and tie and tinted shades,
evoking one of the outsider's archetypes, legendary record producer
Phil Spector. He went on to establish a mocking/rocking dynamic that
would run the show.</TE>
<TE>   For every triumphant gem of bristling, hook-festooned, melodious
pop-rock, from the early anthem "Buddy Holly" to the comeback hits
"Hash Pipe" and "Island in the Sun," there was a Rivers routine.
"Fifteen thousand people, the biggest Weezer show ever!" he crowed.</TE>
<TE>   It culminated in teenage KISS fan's wish fulfillment, with drummer
Pat Wilson's platform 30 feet in the air, a huge, light-bulb-packed
"W" symbol beaming at the crowd, and Cuomo comically stabbing the air
with his scrawny arms.</TE>
<TE>   All this jive did counterbalance the songs' frequently scathing
and caustic characterizations, which Rivers delivered with
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   It was quite the night for outsiders. Chris Carrabba, who preceded
Weezer with his band Dashboard Confessional, introduced "Screaming
Infidelities" by saying, "This song's on the radio--we're sorry."
Someone like Carrabba has to worry at a time when popularity is
viewed with suspicion, but he'll have to cope--he's become a
grass-roots sensation recently, and Friday he made an impression on
an audience that wasn't all his.</TE>
<TE>   There's a lot of Morrissey in the Florida-based singer's
acoustic-rooted, singsongy tales of deception and desperation, but in
his case the angst stays confined to the song.</TE>

<LD>It's easy to see why the British rock press, which is on a roll in
spotting exciting young bands first these days, has flipped over
Craig Nicholls, the leader of the Australian rock group the Vines.</LD>
<LD>   On stage Friday at the Roxy, the 24-year-old singer-songwriter
looked as if he could be the young, hyperactive brother of Ryan
Adams, another media fave, and he sang with the urgency and
conviction of Kurt Cobain and a dozen other seminal rock figures.</LD>
<LD>   Like the White Stripes, the Hives and other bands that are being
hailed as the heart of a new wave of passionate and exciting rock
forces, the Vines reject the drab commercial rock strains of the late
'90s in favor of the music's early, classic values.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, the music on the band's just-released debut album, "Highly
Evolved," seems almost too perfectly suited to the spirit of these
changing times, so that it's tempting to wonder if the Vines aren't
doing a bit of bandwagon-hopping.</TE>
<TE>   In the Capitol album, which entered the national sales chart this
month at No. 11, the music ranges from howling Cobain desperation of
the title tune and the Hives-styled garage-rock sensibilities of
"Outtathaway!" to the psychedelic Beatles haze of "Autumn Shade" and
the ska-bounce of "Factory."</TE>
<TE>   But the Vines blew away any nagging questions about their artistic
authenticity Friday, in the group's first local date since the
release of the album.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the stage after a set by OK Go, a Chicago group with a
smart, tuneful style reminiscent in places of the England's once
wondrous Squeeze, the Vines showed immediate authority and punch.</TE>
<TE>   As his bandmates (Patrick Matthews on bass, Ryan Griffiths on
guitar and Hamish Rosser on drums) conveyed with equal precision the
haunting, dreamlike or explosive qualities in the music, Nicholls
began seducing listeners into his world with a stage manner that was
once richly theatrical and convincingly personal.</TE>
<TE>   You often get the sense with young performers that they have spent
countless hours looking at photos or film clips of their rock heroes,
imagining themselves in the same scenes.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of an hour, Nicholls stepped into several of those
classic rock footsteps. He's narcissistic, rebellious, vulnerable and
teasing.</TE>
<TE>   But Nicholls' commitment to his art isn't just skin-deep. As a
writer and singer, he seems to understand that the challenge of an
artist is to fearlessly explore the sometimes raw, wounded layers of
emotion.</TE>
<TE>   "Get Free" is a two-minute blast of rock adrenalin that starts out
like a familiar declaration of youthful independence. "I'm gonna get
free, I'm gonna get free, ride into the sun."</TE>
<TE>   But the lyrics take a darker twist that reaches for the emotional
bruises that Cobain often expressed with Nirvana: "She never loved
me, she never loved me, why should anyone?"</TE>
<TE>   As the set unfolded, however, it was some of the slower, subtler
songs from the album that hit the hardest--songs, including the
five-minute "Homesick" and six-minute "Mary Jane"--that allowed
Nicholls to stretch out and dig deepest inside.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps a salute to his rock elders, Nicholls savaged the drum
kit with his guitar at the end of the hourlong set.</TE>
<TE>   But the most lasting image was when he put a towel over his head
and face and took a few uncertain steps. In the best moments of the
Vines' music, Nicholls demonstrates the same willingness to step
boldly into unknown territory as a writer.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>My hobby is buffoon watching. Early one morning I got lucky and
caught a glimpse of the rare speckled, yellow-crested, white-cheeked,
red-beaked fool.</LD>
<LD>   He was anchoring a newscast.</LD>
<LD>   Buffoons are always welcome on television and do good business
there, too. Remember Tiny Tim warbling in falsetto and playing his
ukulele? Dennis Rodman selling burgers? Paula Jones and Tonya Harding
squaring off on "Celebrity Boxing"? Frizzed Richard Simmons in his
infomercials, peering deeply into the swollen red eyes of teary,
cellulite-challenged matrons lauding his weight-loss plan? Mr.
Sensitive would then bawl with them, as his inner cash register went
ka-ching, ka-ching.</LD>
<TE>   Television has a new clown elite these days.</TE>
<TE>   Think former stripper and Playboy Playmate Anna Nicole Smith (not
that Anna Nicole and "think" belong in the same sentence). She is
less blond bombshell than shell, the astounding early popularity of
her witless new "reality" series on E! Entertainment establishing her
as this year's pet rock.</TE>
<TE>   And think Steve Irwin, the running, crouching, grimacing,
recoiling, showboating, hyperventilating, croc-wrestling zany who
titles himself the Crocodile Hunter and earns fancy money using
animals as props under the pretense of helping them. More later about
this movie star-come-lately and faux champion of animals and his
latest NBC special that aired Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   At least E! Entertainment's star bimbo is harmless. What's most
boggling about "The Anna Nicole Show" is not really her--she tries so
hard to be outrageous that she's not--but that 4 million Americans
were desperate enough to watch this sucker when it premiered Aug. 4.</TE>
<TE>   All of them taking in Anna Nicole and her forward-tumbling,
panoramic breasts like paparazzi.</TE>
<TE>   The show monitors her, um, life. And because it's crafted so
meticulously (heh heh), Sunday night's Episode 2 was not made
available in advance. As if it would change much.</TE>
<TE>   Viewing the premiere was like watching someone hit herself in the
face repeatedly with a cream pie.</TE>
<TE>   How mindless was it? When her lawyer mentioned suicide bombers
terrorizing Israel, a puzzled Anna Nicole responded like someone who
had just beamed down from Pluto, wondering: "Who's killing the Jews?"</TE>
<TE>   It occurred to me that if her lawyer had mentioned New York's twin
towers and Sept. 11, she'd have been as perplexed and asked: "Who's
killing Americans?"</TE>
<TE>   Anna Nicole has had enough awareness to get herself together for
talk shows and win $88 million in a famous court battle over the
estate of deceased 86-year-old Texas oil baron J.H. Marshall, her
husband of just 14 months. So I suppose it's possible she is not as
dumb as she appears here and is a farceur playing to perfection a
role that requires her to feign stupidity and slur her words as if
she were on something a bit stronger than Pepsi.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the case, watching an imbecile and watching someone play
an imbecile are equally low on the appeal meter.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly at peace with the tonnage she added since her cover-girl
glory, our heroine carried herself like Moby-Dick in drag, as she and
her entourage spent much of the premiere touring houses for her to
rent. She tried out tub after tub and at one point got stuck under a
table with her ample rear appendage facing the camera. Oh, ho-ho.</TE>
<TE>   We met her lawyer, her personal assistant, her teenage son and her
toy poodle (whom she admonished for breaking wind). We also met her
slashing wit, as when she said she wanted to go home and masturbate,
and later when she talked dirty to the camera while dressing for a
party: "Bring it on. I dare you."</TE>
<TE>   Some shows are so bad, they're good. This one dives below even
that bar. No wonder half an hour of Anna Nicole passes like half a
day.</TE>
<TE>   On to another, darker facet of clowndom: the Aussie Irwin in his
signature khaki shirt and shorts, fearlessly confronting "dynjah,
dynjah, dynjah" in NBC's "The Crocodile Hunter: Graham's Revenge."</TE>
<TE>   What revenge? What a crock.</TE>
<TE>   Graham is a big crocodile in the Australia Zoo on the country's
Sunshine Coast. He once chomped on Irwin the way I want to when he
teases, pokes and grapples with wild animals in the name of educating
the public. Irwin's valuable message: Torment wild animals, and they
get grumpy. Also, that he's at great risk from animals he bravely
invites to strike and bite him.</TE>
<TE>   "Graham's never forgiven me for gettin' away with just a wounded
hand," said Irwin, setting up the premise for this show that found
his mates and him moving the big croc and a smaller female to a
bigger enclosure. "We make a mistake with this guy, he's gonna split
us open so badly it's not even funny," said Irwin, departing from
form. He's usually "shakin' like a leaf."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's wife, Terri, his co-star in his Animal Planet series, "The
Crocodile Hunter," was there, too, engaged in the equally dangerous
task of looking beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Would Graham get back at poor Steve, who shrewdly edged closer to
the water where the croc had been relocated in case the animal wanted
to take a swipe? "He has anger written all over his face," reported
Irwin about the submerged Graham, who was not visible.</TE>
<TE>   Despite hype through the hour, and Irwin giving it the big
"Ooooooh" while taunting Graham, the crocodile declined to take his
revenge on cue. So Irwin bowed out much as Geraldo Rivera did years
ago when finding nothing in Al Capone's vault after a big buildup.</TE>
<TE>   TV feasts on facile conflict as much as it does buffoonery. So
Animals versus Humans becomes the gruel du jour, whether it's
"Animals That Attack" or "Shark Week" or Irwin provoking his own
televised confrontations, creating a twisted reality that nourishes
fear of animals in the wild as our natural adversaries and a belief
they're ours to exploit.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I saw him on Animal Planet, he was pursuing
venom-spitting cobras in Africa. It was a tossup who spat more, the
snakes or Irwin as he picked them up by their tails and spun them
almost like lariats. For their own good, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's starting to understand," he said about a 6-footer,
"I don't mean him any dynjah."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin's first feature film, "The Crocodile Hunter: Collision
Course," has done brisk business, and in October he's to host a new
kids series, "Croc Files," on NBC. What's next?</TE>
<TE>   If E! Entertainment's hotshots are on the ball, they'll have him
wrestle Anna Nicole.</TE>

<LD>A spilled tumbler of an exquisite hot chocolate doesn't usually send
shivers down one's spine, but with the sure-handed direction of
French filmmaker Claude Chabrol guiding his frequent accomplice
Isabelle Huppert, the sticky mess can ooze with positively homicidal
implications. Chabrol's most recent film to get a U.S. release,
"Merci Pour le Chocolat," starring Huppert, Jacques Dutronc and Anna
Mouglalis, opens Friday at the Royal in West L.A. and the Rialto in
South Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   As one of the "Cahiers du Cinema" scribes who traded their
critics' quills for movie cameras, Chabrol beat Francois Truffaut and
Jean-Luc Godard to the director's chair with his 1958 feature debut,
"Le Beau Serge." The success of his follow-up, "Les Cousins," allowed
him to set up a company that launched the directing careers of Eric
Rohmer, Philippe de Broca and Jacques Rivette. While directing nearly
50 films in a 44-year career, Chabrol established himself as one of
the enduring members of the French New Wave.</LD>
<LD>   "Merci Pour le Chocolat," co-written with his "La Ceremonie"
collaborator Caroline Eliacheff, returns Chabrol to the subtle,
hairs-standing-on-the-back-of-your-neck thrillers such as "Les Bonnes
Femmes" (1960), "La Femme Infidele" (1968)--which inspired Adrian
Lyne's recent "Unfaithful"--and "Le Boucher" (1969), that established
him as a master of the genre.</LD>
<TE>   Chabrol's films often feature characters whose detached, murderous
ways serve as metaphors, echoing the casual cruelties inflicted on
loved ones. In delivering plots that appear obvious in their
exposition but shroud the level of evil characters allow themselves
to acknowledge, Chabrol explores the solipsism that underlies
contemporary life. "We have tried to illustrate this idea by the slow
dissolution of the most definite certainties of our society," wrote
Chabrol in his director's note of intent. "The main aim is to get
across the idea that all certainties melt away as the story
progresses."</TE>

<HD>Diesel Lets Out a Quiet Roar</HD>
<DH>Box Office* With a take of $46 million, 'XXX' is No. 1 but
doesn't compare to 'Signs' and 'Goldmember' premieres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is Vin Diesel the next big action star? That remains unclear after
his in-your-face spy thriller "XXX" took in a solid, if not
spectacular, $46 million in its opening weekend, according to studio
estimates.</LD>
<LD>   The media-hyped adventure was No. 1 at the box office but failed
to open as big as M. Night Shyamalan's "Signs" or "Austin Powers in
Goldmember," which brought in $60 million and $72 million
respectively on opening weekends.</LD>
<LD>   Sony's Revolution Studios, which produced and distributed "XXX,"
said it met expectations.</LD>
<TE>   "Tracking of the movie told us this movie was going to come in at
this. It is a big number for us," said Tom Sherak, a partner at
Revolution Studios. "[Sony's marketing] has now put 'XXX' into the
culture of Hollywood, and we can now look forward to the sequel."</TE>
<TE>   "XXX" star Diesel and director Rob Cohen are already signed up for
the sequel, which will be set somewhere in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "Signs," appears to be another big hit for Shyamalan
("Sixth Sense"); it took in an estimated $30 million in its second
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   That's a 50% drop from its opening weekend--not unusual for a
summer blockbuster--and it performed strongly during the week; the
sci-fi thriller, which stars Mel Gibson, has tallied an estimated
$118 million in two weeks of release. Where "XXX" appeal has been
mainly with teens and young adults, "Signs" has done well with
audiences of all ages.</TE>
<TE>   "Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams" came in at No. 3, bringing
in an estimated $17 million over the weekend ($25 million since its
release on Wednesday) over the "Austin Powers in Goldmember" came in
fourth with $13 million over the weekend and a total of $168 million.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Eastwood's "Blood Work" got off to a slow start, taking in
$7.2 million in its first weekend.</TE>
<TE>   This weekend's top 12 films, however, showed a 9% drop from last
year, ($134 million compared with $141 million) according to
Exhibitor Relations Co., a box office tracking firm.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest surprise of the weekend was "The Good Girl," a
low-budget dark comedy from Fox Searchlight starring Jennifer
Aniston, which brought in an impressive $148,703 in three days on
just four screens in Los Angeles and New York, according to the
studio.</TE>
<TE>   The film, directed by Miguel Arteta ("Chuck and Buck") and written
by Mike White ("Orange County"), raked in $37,176 per theater.
Matinee and evening shows in Los Angeles on Saturday night were sold
out, according to Steve Gilula, president of distribution for Fox
Searchlight, a specialty division of 20th Century Fox. Already the
studio is drumming up support for an Academy Award nomination for
Aniston, whose performance as the unfulfilled woman working a
dead-end job at a discount store and married to a pot-head has earned
her glowing reviews.</TE>
<TE>   Gilula credits the strong opening of "Good Girl" to "the
uniqueness of the film and Aniston's performance. This film really
shows what a range she has."</TE>
<TE>   If its early success continues, "The Good Girl" could be among a
select group of independent films that have broken out this summer,
including "My Big Fat Greek Wedding," which has grossed a spectacular
$45 million and remains in the top 10 after 17 weeks in release. The
racy Mexican film "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and the Indian film "Monsoon
Wedding" have each brought in $13 million. The Inuit film "The Fast
Runner" continues to chug along, bringing in $2.6 million since its
opening June 7.</TE>
<TE>   These films' success is indicative of older audiences' longing for
more mature, humane films than the usual studio blockbuster,
according to some analysts. "There is a thing called blockbuster
fatigue," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations
Co.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a segment of the audience that is looking for something
more intimate, more character-driven. On a smaller scale, these
movies are doing as well as the bigger movies."</TE>

<HD>Parody Enlivens Ensemble's Concert</HD>
<DH>Strong renditions of works by Hindemith and Shostakovich
close uneven performance by youthful I Palpiti</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eduard Schmieder did an unusual thing for a conductor Saturday night
in Zipper Hall at the Colburn School of Performing Arts. He stopped
his ensemble, I Palpiti, from tuning up.</LD>
<LD>   "Tuning absolutely not necessary," he said from the stage. Then he
went on to explain that the piece the musicians were about to play,
Hindemith's "Minimax," was a satire on military music, in which the
composer had deliberately written imperfections that amateurs make.</LD>
<LD>   The six-part suite, parodying bad writing as well as bad
playing--think pompous marches, skewed Viennese waltzes, formulaic
Italian opera overtures--did much to counter the image of Hindemith
as a dour composer and to bring the uneven four-part program by
Schmieder's 24-member ensemble to a delightful close.</LD>
<TE>   The emotional highpoint of the program came right before the
Hindemith piece: Shostakovich's Chamber Symphony for String
Orchestra, with an arrangement of his shattering Eighth String
Quartet. Here the young musicians, 19 to 26, played with their
greatest cohesion and precision.</TE>
<TE>   If the larger version muted the incisive rhythms four players can
achieve, it compensated by amplifying the terror of hearing midnight
knocks at the door announcing the arrival of the KGB. The first half
of the concert, however, was much less successful. In works by Chopin
and Mozart, the group sounded like a youth training
orchestra--tentative in ensemble and aimless in line.</TE>
<TE>   Schmieder's direction has to take a part of the blame. He led a
driven, severely controlled account of Chopin's Piano Concerto No. 1,
one that rarely let the music breathe. Chopin sounded clumsy and
segmented.</TE>
<TE>   The soloist, 14-year-old Stanislaw Drzewiecki, who has just signed
a recording contract with Sony, played fast and accurately and with
variety of touch but with little insight or poetry.</TE>
<TE>   The conductor opened the program with a romanticized account of
Mozart's Adagio and Fugue in C minor, weighty in string tone and
heavy in vibrato. He took the same approach--now unfashionable--in
Bach's Air for the G String, the only encore.</TE>

<HD>Where's the Wit in Miller's Latest?</HD>
<DH>* The legendary playwright's latest full-length work, the
stodgy 'Resurrection Blues,' has its world premiere in Minneapolis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL PHILLIPS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MINNEAPOLIS--In a 1999 lecture titled " 'The Crucible' in History,"
Arthur Miller acknowledged his reputation for dramatic anguish
enacted on the moral high ground, a patch of land dotted by furrowed
brows and righteously clenched teeth. "I have often wished I'd had
the temperament to have done an absurd comedy," he said of his Salem
witch-hunt drama, "since that is what the situation often deserved."</LD>
<LD>   But temperaments change, either with or against the times. Not
long after the lecture, Miller began writing "Resurrection Blues," a
satire--mournful and odd--set in a Latin American dictatorship, where
a crucifixion is being arranged for worldwide television coverage.</LD>
<LD>   It is a magical-realist polemic, a stylistic change-up from
America's preeminent dramatist, now 86 and still out there, pitching
to an audience, when others approaching his stature would've hit the
showers long ago.</LD>
<TE>   "Out there," in this instance, is a long way from New York City.
Miller and director David Esbjornson deemed the script too large and,
perhaps, too wobbly for a New York premiere at the off-Broadway
Signature Theater, with which Miller has a relationship. So the world
premiere has landed at the Guthrie Theater; Signature artistic
director James Houghton also serves as Guthrie artistic adviser.
Also, recent Guthrie stagings of Miller plays both early ("All My
Sons") and late ("Mr. Peters' Connections") helped pave the way for
this world premiere.</TE>
<TE>   While at odds with the prevailing theatrical image of Miller,
"Resurrection Blues" relates directly to the writer's satiric essays
(collected in the recent and excellent "Echoes Down the Corridor"),
in which Miller proffered modest proposals for televising executions
held in Shea Stadium, or privatizing Congress. Indeed, in 2002, which
will not enter history's ledger as a good year for civil liberties,
Miller's 1954 essay advocating the punishment of America's
"conceptual traitors" has a grimly urgent ring to it.</TE>
<TE>   "Resurrection Blues," strangely, has less of one, though its best
passages are livelier than anything Miller has written for the stage
in decades.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Felix Barriaux (John Bedford Lloyd), suffering from impotence
and a muffled crisis of conscience, oversees his cozy Latin American
dictatorship, hungry for foreign investment, in between jetting off
to Miami for dental work. The guerrilla forces in the hills have been
quelled at the moment, though a mysterious messiahlike revolutionary
has become a hero to the masses.</TE>
<TE>   The general has decided to execute the Messiah, which appalls the
general's wealthy liberal cousin, Henri Schultz (Jeff Weiss),
late-blooming academic and heir to a drug-company fortune. Through
the guilt-ridden Henri comes an offer to the general from an American
advertising agency: $25 million in exchange for exclusive rights to
televise the crucifixion, complete with high-priced commercial air
time.</TE>
<TE>   For narrative convenience's sake, if not for that of plausibility,
"Resurrection Blues" brings TV commercial producer Emily Shapiro
(Laila Robins) and her crew to the site of the crucifixion, unaware
of what they're in for. A Faustian weasel of an account executive,
Skip L. Cheeseboro (David Chandler), urges Emily to swallow her
scruples and fulfill her assignment. But the Messiah escapes. One of
his cultlike disciples (Bruce Bohne), interrogated by the general,
relays that the savior isn't sure if he wants to cooperate with the
general's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" asks the general. "If he's the son of God, crucifixion
shouldn't bother him too much."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," replies the disciple, "but if it turns out he's not the
son of God it'll bother him a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Up against this banter, "Resurrection Blues" goes in for
dead-serious, often static discussions of economic injustice and
corroded values. (The railing against commercialism feels rather
remote; Miller may not, in fact, realize how miserably derisive our
TV-led popular culture has become.) In Henri's reconciliation with
his revolutionary daughter, Jeanine (Wendy Vanden Heuvel), the play
delivers earnest scenes straight out of Ariel Dorfman's "Widows."
There is, however, a startling line in one of them: At one point
Jeanine, who attended Barnard College, says to Emily, "I hear they
finally believe in death in Manhattan, is that true?" It's all the
more startling given Miller claims to have written it well before
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The tonal contradictions are willful, sometimes intriguing, often
half-baked. You sense Miller allowing himself the luxury of loosening
up; you sense also the attendant uncertainty. When it works,
"Resurrection Blues" has a comic tang reminiscent of Graham Greene's
entertainments. When it doesn't, Miller lets the audience get way,
way out ahead of the narrative and restlessness sets in.</TE>
<TE>   The Guthrie premiere doesn't help these tonal contradictions.
Director Esbjornson delivers the material well enough, but there's no
little sense of a specific playing style at work. It's all rather
stodgy and measured, which plays into Miller's polemical side as
opposed to his antic side. One misses a sense of propulsive satiric
brio in the pacing; of the cast, only Lloyd's wittily snappish
general and Bohne's stoner-disciple--first-rate performances--locate
a performance universe that makes sense.</TE>
<TE>   The play's title carries a double meaning: By now, Miller's older,
established plays--"All My Sons," "Death of a Salesman," "The
Crucible," "The Price"--have been resurrected so often, the author
may be feeling a little blue about it. There's something in becoming
a legend, the recipient of revivals galore and accolades unlimited,
that is heartening and a little sad. "Resurrection Blues" inspires
similar mixed feelings.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, here is Miller's latest full-length play, receiving its
premiere 48 years after Miller's first Broadway effort, "The Man Who
Had All the Luck," confounded wartime audiences more attuned to
flag-waving sincerity. "Resurrection Blues" doesn't really hang
together, but there's a touching quality to its best, mordantly funny
debates. In the end, according to Henri--who, as played by Weiss,
resembles Miller --"one must learn to live in the garden of one's
self." A seductive notion. But even when he's struggling with a new
genre, Miller is artist enough to remind himself--and us--of the
political costs of rugged individualism.</TE>

<HD>The Summer of Sondheim</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NELSON PRESSLEY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON--It has been the kind of binge that can leave you a little
delirious, this summer-long Sondheim Celebration at the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. You want to slow down time,
take it all in, soak up every note, for this is the theatrical lap of
luxury. Don't bet on seeing its like again for a while.</LD>
<LD>   The ambition of the project has been dizzying. Kennedy Center
President Michael Kaiser and festival artistic director Eric
Schaeffer didn't simply say, "Hey, let's put on a Stephen Sondheim
show"; they said, "Let's do six." (The chosen six, in order of
appearance this summer: "Sweeney Todd," "Company," "Sunday in the
Park With George," "Merrily We Roll Along," "Passion," "A Little
Night Music.") And then they said, "Let's do 'em three at a time."</LD>
<LD>   There is no significant precedent for this style of producing--a
single musical is often enough to ruin one's health, reputation and
relationships--so the whole shebang could easily have been a
catastrophe.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, it has been a triumph from the moment Brian Stokes
Mitchell, singing gloriously as the throat-slitting Sweeney Todd,
rumbled that "there's no place like London," then hooked up with an
inspired Christine Baranski as a droll, casually murderous Mrs.
Lovett. Thirty minutes in, you could sense that this massive six-ship
flotilla was likely to be snugly harbored.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Sondheim Celebration seemed like a great idea from
the moment it was announced 18 months ago. At minimum, it promised to
fill a basic, gaping need: getting Sondheim's shows on a major stage.
For all his acclaim, Sondheim simply hasn't scored the popular
successes you might expect from someone with an unparalleled facility
for musicals. The original "Company" didn't last as long as
"Applause"; "Follies" was severely outdistanced by "Jesus Christ
Superstar" and "Grease"; "A Little Night Music" tallied one-third the
performances "Pippin" did; and so on.</TE>
<TE>   It's an odd and deeply unsatisfying track record, given that
Sondheim is the indisputable giant of today's American musical
theater. John Kander and Fred Ebb have seen their "Cabaret" and
"Chicago" return to New York for multiyear stands, while the daring
musicals that made Sondheim's reputation in the 1970s have yet to
make triumphant reappearances on Broadway. This relative inattention
to landmark shows is a situation that Kaiser rightly describes as
"shocking."</TE>
<TE>   If Sondheim had been getting his due all along, this opportunity
wouldn't have been available to the Kennedy Center. But it was, and
one measure of its significance is that people have flocked here from
every state in the Union--and from 28 countries--to take advantage of
this rare chance.</TE>
<TE>   The sheer volume of work has been part of the appeal. So has the
scale of the productions, which promised to present the shows with
some approximation of their original physical magnitude (they were
often epic). Another lure: the attractive roster of performers, in
whose hands, more perhaps than anyone else's, the fate of this
festival has rested. This is to take nothing away from Derek McLane,
who came up with a design scheme that delivered two rotating
repertories of three distinctive-looking, smooth-running productions.</TE>
<TE>   This has indeed been a celebration of Sondheim, not a
director-driven "rediscovery" or "reevaluation." Audiences hoping
that previously undetectable patterns would be revealed by this
repertory were probably disappointed. Anyway, Sondheim implicitly
defused that expectation during his public conversation last spring
in the Kennedy Center's Concert Hall when he expressed his reluctance
to write music he's heard before; in other words, he likes wholesale
reinvention each time out (in case we hadn't noticed).</TE>
<TE>   "It's mind-blowing, seeing all the different styles," Schaeffer
says. And he reports that Sondheim's reaction to the first "triad"
weekend--in which each of the first three productions was
performed--was this: "It's hard to believe that I wrote all those
shows."</TE>
<TE>   Because of this relentless ingenuity, Sondheim already stands as
the most exhaustively analyzed composer-lyricist of the last
half-century. Perhaps for this reason, the festival's directors have
not tried to reinvent these works by, say, setting "Sweeney Todd" in
late-20th century Bosnia or the antebellum South. Another possible
reason for the straightforward approach: These shows, unlike the
plays of Shakespeare, are not omnipresent and begging to be done
differently. They are simply crying out to be done, and done well.</TE>
<TE>   That is what the directors have tried to do, and they have called
on talented, personable performers for the job. (And how refreshing
that has been: Personality was in danger of being eradicated in the
recent and apparently receding age of spectacle-driven, mega-musicals
that dominated Broadway while Sondheim's shows languished.) From the
start, the results have been pretty wonderful. Mitchell and Baranski
were a tandem to reckon with; you could clearly build a Broadway
"Sweeney" on their solid foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Other performances that will be fondly remembered: Lynn Redgrave's
defiance and anguish as the drunken cynic singing "The Ladies Who
Lunch" in "Company," and, from the same show, Alice Ripley's
fetching, letter-perfect breakdown as a nervous bride singing the
pell-mell "Getting Married Today." And Raul Esparza's similarly
exciting flameout as Charley Kringas, the idealistic sidekick who
trashes his writing partner on TV in "Merrily." (If a person's being
driven crazy, Sondheim's the man to capture it in song.) The
estimable threesome of "Passion": Judy Kuhn's mesmerizing intensity
as Fosca, Rebecca Luker's grace and assurance as Clara, and Michael
Cerveris' stark inquisitiveness as the man who goes for the
unconventional romantic choice. Douglas Sills and Randy Graff making
comic hay as an unsatisfied married couple in "Night Music."</TE>
<TE>   These performers, and many others, made deep connections with the
audience, which would baffle folks who believe the widely circulated,
utterly mystifying canard about Sondheim being arch and unfeeling. To
read accounts of Sondheim's grim obsession with mortality and his
cynical sprint against the general happy-making grain of musicals,
you would expect his fans to be black-clad Goths popping out of the
coven or den for a spot of dark art. Too often, that has been his
critical reward for writing like an adult, and for adults, with
lyrics that pierce and stories that don't sugarcoat life's
disappointments and emotional hoaxes.</TE>
<TE>   For Schaeffer, the festival has been another coup in a career
built on surprises; no one in Washington theater has pulled more
rabbits out of hats in the last decade. For the Kennedy Center, this
marks an unexpectedly visionary return to theatrical producing after
a dozen years of booking shows, and Kaiser promises more original
programming starting with the 2003-04 season and every year from then
on. That's good news; with its profile and resources, the Kennedy
Center ought to aspire to extraordinary things.</TE>
<TE>   Sondheim's champions are fervent, and from the beginning the
celebration has been a bit of a love-fest. We knew all along that the
shows were smashing and that even the flawed ones were more rewarding
than your run-of-the-mill 10-year sensation. It's been great to see
them up and kicking again.</TE>

<DH>Flamenco artists exhibit complex, dazzling footwork in a
series of solo performances</DH>

<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oppressive pain, heroic defiance, percussive footwork as a tribal
drum: The annual New World Flamenco Festival opened with primal
statements of traditional Spanish Gypsy culture over the weekend at
the Irvine Barclay Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   In a 90-minute program of solos performed without intermission,
Compania Juana Amaya of Seville focused on the tension between
showpiece virtuosity and emotional expression. Indeed, on Saturday,
Amaya sometimes gave the impression of being forced to dance when
she'd rather have been off sobbing in a corner somewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Her opening "Seguiriyas" solo in particular used abrupt switches
of position and pressure to portray a woman undone by uncontrollable
feelings. Everyday non-dance motions--a prosaic walk, an almost
reflexive stroking of her hair--punctuated and heightened the
passages of formal dancing, as if she had been periodically pulled
out of the performance by overwhelming sadness.</LD>
<TE>   Fighting stances and turns that ended with her confronting an
unseen enemy added to the expressive edge of her dancing, and at one
point she reached forward as if asking for help, only to suddenly
walk away. But whatever inner compulsions were being expressed, her
foot-rhythms never wavered from steady, brilliant complexity.</TE>
<TE>   The gruff, wiry vocalism of David Lagos reinforced her
emotionalism and complemented the more conventional bravado of the
dancer billed only as Bartolo in his "Alegrias'' solo.</TE>
<TE>   Alternately slamming his chest, swinging his hips, shadowboxing
and abruptly striking poses in which only one curling wrist moved,
Bartolo made potent spectacle from gutsy unpredictability. He proved
especially masterly in drawing the audience into his changes of
visual focus, sometimes seeming to inspect the entire auditorium as
he danced but elsewhere narrowing his gaze, and performance scale, to
a single hand or foot.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Ana Vizarraga brought raspy vehemence to her segments,
including the "Solea por bulerias" solo danced by Jairo Barrul.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Bartolo's flyaway arms, Barrul frequently kept his
upper limbs passive, with hands tucked in his belt or at his sides,
concentrating on an array of amazing steps. Ornamented with turning
jumps, hopping steps, squat-drops, backward staggers, dialogues
between his feet and a powerful drumming walk, Barrul's dancing
proved kinetically fiery but expressively cool. However, it seemed
almost ungrateful to ask for more personal flamenco from an artist so
remarkably accomplished and even elegant at every moment.</TE>
<TE>   After Amaya's feisty "Solea" solo, in which pride and pleasure in
her own prowess frequently shattered her prevalent angst, the three
company dancers joined forces for a brief, uneventful coda. Moving
professionally through matched step patterns, dutifully trading steps
and venturing mini-solos that said nothing new about them, they
failed to surprise us for the first time on the program.</TE>
<TE>   However, the biggest miscalculation came when the men made a
simultaneous formal exit (one left, one right) and Amaya feigned the
distress of a bride abandoned at the altar. What boundless misery.
What hopeless despair. What ridiculous overkill.</TE>
<TE>   Flamenco intensity is a precious resource that rebukes many other
forms of concert dance for their shallowness and inspires audiences
with a vision of living life deeply. It should not be squandered,
even by a major artist, simply to add a florid exclamation point to a
trio with nothing but convivial expertise on view.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, technical imbalances sometimes left the guitar
painfully overamplified, and foot-patterns often remained inaudible
except when the dancers moved close to the floor-microphones at the
front of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The company roster also listed Chiki, Paco Fernandez and El Fiti.
Next up at the festival: Yaelisa (Tuesday and Wednesday) and Andres
Marin (Friday through Sunday). Information: (949) 854-4646.</TE>

<HD>Project Captures Human Face of Tragedy</HD>
<DH>Memorial * Lawyer-artist is trying to create oil portraits
of every victim of the 9/11 attacks. The effort could take several
years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCH STACY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The features of New York City firefighter Joseph Agnello are
beginning to emerge, sketched roughly in charcoal by an artist who
had never met Agnello but is determined to bring him back to life on
canvas.</LD>
<LD>   Michael DeMinico, working from a photograph published in the New
York Times, will soon dab oil paint on the 9-by-12-inch canvas to
flesh out the mustached visage of the 35-year-old Agnello, one of the
nearly 3,000 people killed in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Then DeMinico will move on to the next photo and the next, until
he has captured on canvas all Sept. 11 victims as they were in life.
He works alone, usually, in the garage studio at his home, but the
project has evolved into something much bigger than one man's
response to a national tragedy.</LD>
<TE>   DeMinico, a 50-year-old trial lawyer, is an accomplished painter
who sells other works for thousands of dollars. To him, creating the
portraits seemed a logical step in his own struggle to comprehend
what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "At least in personal terms it would give me some kind of sense
... of the real scale of this," he says. "There would be plenty of
slabs going up to commemorate the event. I thought the measure of
this thing was in the individual, and not just some name carved on a
stone somewhere."</TE>
<TE>   What began as a private, self-help exercise has turned into a
public art project during the past few months as word has spread.
People have responded with letters, phone calls and donations, and a
nonprofit foundation has been set up to support the effort.</TE>
<TE>   DeMinico, who is married with two children, has scaled back his
law practice to pursue the project. He spends 25 to 30 hours a week
on it, preparing to put oil to the initial group of 15 portraits. He
figures it will take several years to finish them all.</TE>
<TE>   The idea arose from his reflections on the six-month anniversary
of the attacks in March. In April, he took out a notice in the New
York Times announcing his intentions and seeking comment from
victims' families and others. He printed his phone number and Web
site address.</TE>
<TE>   People who saw the ad called and wrote. About a dozen families
sent alternate pictures of their loved ones from which he will now
work.</TE>
<TE>   New York Gov. George Pataki's office called about possibly
incorporating his project into a larger plan to commemorate the
victims. A documentary film crew also has begun chronicling his work
and will follow him to Fairhope, Ala., next month, where he will sell
some of his other paintings in a fund-raiser for the Sept. 11
project.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Lynch, vice president of the 9-11 Widows' and Victims'
Families Assn., which represents about 720 families, says he welcomes
anything that will keep the face of his son, Michael, a New York city
firefighter, in the public consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we want to have this memorialized in every fashion we
can," Lynch says. "We want this to be fresh in everyone's mind
throughout history, and anything that contributes to that effort is
acceptable to us."</TE>
<TE>   DeMinico thinks and talks fast, picking subjects randomly. He
tends to attack painting the same way, which is one reason longtime
friend and art colleague Jack Casey got involved as the project's
conservator.</TE>
<TE>   Casey is the detail man, enlarging and manipulating photographs
from which DeMinico works, and making plans for how the finished work
will be framed, preserved and stored. "I'm always amazed by his
intensity," Casey says of his friend. "This isn't a matter of
painting a few portraits.... I've never seen him happier--that he can
make this kind of contribution and have such a positive response."</TE>
<TE>   DeMinico has ideas about how and where the portraits might be
displayed. Gallery space in New York or Washington might be logical,
he says, but ultimately he sees the decision being made by the
families.</TE>
<TE>   "This is resonating," said DeMinico, "and that's gratifying as an
artist, to feel as if what you're doing is making that connection,
bridging that gap. That's what I think art is about."</TE>

<HD>A Reflective Side of Salonen</HD>
<DH>Premiere of brooding 'Lachen Verlernt' for solo violin
reflects the conductor's altered worldview.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LA JOLLA--No one has called it an Esa-Pekka Salonen festival, but
last week and this are turning out to be one. Within 10 days, Salonen
is presiding over four different programs with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, all preparations for the orchestra's European tour
later in the month.</LD>
<LD>   Then, in the middle of that ambitious schedule, Salonen managed to
put in an appearance as a composer-in-residence with SummerFest, the
chamber music festival in La Jolla, where his latest work was given
its world premiere Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   The piece is "Lachen Verlernt" (Laughing Unlearnt), a 10-minute
chaconne for solo violin, written for Cho-Liang Lin, the SummerFest
artistic director, and it was included on a program that also saw
Salonen conduct his "Five Images After Sappho" and Stravinsky's "A
Soldier's Tale," a program to be repeated tonight in Los Angeles at
the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre.</LD>
<TE>   "Lachen Verlernt" has an unusually unsettled and dark-seeming tone
from a composer whose works have tended to be sunnier. Alone, it says
something about our times. Put in context of the two populist
symphonies--Shostakovich's Second and Beethoven's Ninth--that Salonen
conducted at the Hollywood Bowl on Thursday, and the roseate "Sappho"
songs and the sardonic fate of Stravinsky's soldier on Saturday, the
violin score says quite a bit about music in its time and place.</TE>
<TE>   The title is taken from a line in the song, "Prayer to Pierrot,"
from Schoenberg's "Pierrot Lunaire." The narrator entreats the
harlequin, Pierrot, her "soul's veterinarian," to teach her to laugh
again. In a pre-concert talk Saturday, Salonen said the line
reflected his own natural unease as an artist to the way the world
has changed in the past year. He also felt the concept might be
curiously suited to Lin's cheerful personality, which he suspects
must have its own darker side.</TE>
<TE>   On first hearing, however, Bach's great Chaconne from the Partita
No. 2 for solo violin sounds the obvious influence. In Salonen's
case, though, we never hear the repeated series of chords over which
the series of variations are made. Each variation, instead, offers
just aspects of that chord progression. Instead, the allusions remain
just beyond our grasp.</TE>
<TE>   The beginning is sparse, tense, dramatic--long notes sharply cut
off with brusque curlicues. What follows is both furious and
strangely gorgeous, impressive virtuoso flourishes on open strings,
fancy scale work and passages thick with chords. The final, flutey
bars are but the hint of laughter regained, just sweet enough to
leave a comforting afterglow, especially with Lin's masterful
performance evoking the best Bach playing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the lack of ready optimism proved a striking contrast to
Thursday's Bowl program in which Lenin was hailed as the beacon of
happiness at struggle's end in Shostakovich's 1927 symphony, and
where Beethoven, in his epochal ode to brotherhood a century earlier,
offered the quintessential essay in optimism. Just when we let our
guard down, Salonen reveals, history is always there to remind us the
struggle never ends.</TE>
<TE>   "Five Images After Sappho," which followed "Lachen Verlernt" at La
Jolla, trace the path of a young girl's awakening sexuality, from
puberty to wedding. The soprano on this occasion was the opera star
Heidi Grant Murphy, who brought a ripe Straussian ecstasy to the
songs, a quality quite different than the dramatically nuanced
girlishness that characterizes Dawn Upshaw's recording of the work.</TE>
<TE>   With Murphy distinctly pregnant, the soprano inevitably brought
other dramatic qualities as well. One could not help but think of her
as an about-to-be-mother fondly looking back and also wondering about
the future. It was no surprise, then, that the fourth song, a
rhapsodic lingering over the evening star (which Salonen interprets
as the girl's first intimations of mortality) found Murphy at her
most ravishing. In this and all else, she was aided by a 14-member
powerhouse instrumental ensemble that included Leila Josefowicz and
Lin as the two violinists and Steven Schick as the percussionist.</TE>
<TE>   For "The Soldier's Tale," there was more bold playing from the
seven-member ensemble, none more so than that of Josefowicz, who
seemed but a small step away from rocking and rolling. Her wildness
doesn't always work, but it certainly did here, as she walked an
exciting fine line between ardent virtuosity and sheer showing off.
In fact, she seemed to energize all the players (Schick again was the
terrific percussionist), and Salonen's conducting assured that
cohesion.</TE>
<TE>   Stravinsky's chamber-size music theater piece, written just after
World War I, can be interpreted many ways. Here John Rubinstein read
the text of the soldier returning from war who makes a pact with the
devil as agreeable fable. But it was one overstated level too many to
have three dancers occasionally attempt to literally mime the story
to choreography by John Malashock. If listeners needed anything to
watch, there was always Josefowicz dancing in her seat.</TE>
<TE>   Esa-Pekka Salonen's SummerFest program repeats tonight, 8 p.m.,
$20, John Anson Ford Amphitheatre, 2580 Cahuenga Blvd. East (323)
461-3673.</TE>

<HD>Riveting Showdown in 'True West'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his 1980 play "True West," Sam Shepard held a funhouse mirror up
to America and dared people to take a look. Against the backdrop of a
once-heroic West reduced to stifling suburban sameness, he told a
story of brother against brother in the crazed pursuit of prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   Last summer, a theater group in the small town of Hailey, Idaho,
revived the play, making national headlines. The hoopla surrounded
the fact that Bruce Willis, who has a home near Hailey and owns the
theater building, was directing and co-starring in the production. A
taping of that venture is being shown tonight at 8 on Showtime.
People will tune in to see Willis but will come away having seen a
crackling presentation of one of America's best plays.</LD>
<LD>   Willis plays Lee, who shows up at his mother's suburban Los
Angeles home to find her away and his brother Austin (Chad Smith)
using the place while in town to pitch a screenplay.</LD>
<TE>   Lee, who lives hand to mouth, wears filthy castoffs. He sports a
black eye and scratches at various colonies of parasites residing on
his body. Austin, on the other hand, is Ivy League educated and
neatly groomed. He's trying to type notes for his screenplay while
Lee, with a wild look in his eyes, taunts and physically provokes
him.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, they trade places--realizing, in the process, that
Austin's life is the one to be avoided at all costs. But not before
locking in combat like professional wrestlers, slipping on a floor
slick with spilled beer in the wreckage of Mom's once-orderly
kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Directed for television by Gary Halvorson, the taping zooms in for
close-ups but doesn't try to be flashy. Willis is manically
mesmerizing, but the revelation is Smith, a Hailey local, who should
have Hollywood at his doorstep Tuesday morning--signaling the very
success that Shepard cautions against.</TE>

<HD>Simon Says of Ethical Standards: Well, It All Depends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few moments in May with GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr.,
from his videotaped deposition in the fraud lawsuit brought against
his investment firm by convicted marijuana smuggler Paul Edward
Hindelang:</LD>
<LD>   Asked about the ethical standards at William E. Simon &amp; Sons,
Simon first testified, "I would be very disappointed if people lied."</LD>
<LD>   Hindelang's lawyer, Anthony C. Duffy: "If people lied, would you
take remedial action if they were people that you directed and
employed?"</LD>
<TE>   Simon: "Well, you have to view that in the context of what the
facts and circumstances were."</TE>
<TE>   Duffy: "So there are some circumstances, if you learn the Simon
people had lied in public disclosures, that you might not take any
kind of corrective or remedial action? Is that what you are saying?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon: "No, I'm saying that, you know, there's no such thing to me
as a black-and-white situation. I would have to take a look at
exactly what the facts and circumstances were. So I wouldn't want to
speculate on what I would do, absent knowing specific facts and
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   (Whoa! Is Bill Simon psychic? Two months later, President Bush
defended his eight-month delay in filing a required stock-sale
report, saying at one point, "All I can tell you is, is that in the
corporate world, sometimes things aren't exactly black and white when
it comes to accounting procedures.")</TE>
<TE>   Duffy, later in the deposition: "Have you at any time, sir, heard
of--either on your own part, you doing it, or anyone else doing
it--of going into an investment where the Simon company has presented
itself as being skilled, experienced and successful investors?"</TE>
<TE>   Simon: "You know, I would have to scratch my head on that one. We
have been involved in a lot of situations over the years, so off the
top of my head, I don't remember a precise conversation in that
respect."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview a week ago on Sacramento radio station KFBK-AM
(1530), Simon boasted that of the more than 160 investments by
William E. Simon &amp; Sons from 1994 to 2002, "over 70% of them were
successful and profitable, and if you look at the rate of return on
all the investments, the winners and the losers, they averaged over
20%. And the fact is, that's a good rate of return. The fact is that
that beats the stock market by a substantial margin. And the fact is
that that's why we've been able to attract a lot of good investors, a
lot of very, very prominent institutional investors."</TE>
<TE>   What Would Harding Have to Say on This?</TE>
<TE>   Almost every political season injects some new words or
definitions into the political glossary. Take President Harding, who
made up two words, one of which now passes for real English. One was
"bloviate," as in to "go out in the country and bloviate," which
pretty much means to say a great deal about very little. And Harding
bypassed the noun "normality" and contrived the abnormal noun
"normalcy," which has lamentably entered the dictionary.</TE>
<TE>   Here in California, two neologisms that probably won't last past
November still deserve a hearing--Simonize and Gray-vitate.</TE>
<TE>   The first definitions come from USC senior scholar and political
spinstress Sherry Bebitch Jeffe.</TE>
<TE>   Simonize: the process of polishing yourself off.</TE>
<TE>   Gray-vitate: to be strongly attracted to money; a noun form,
Gray-vitas, a serious attraction to money.</TE>
<TE>   Alternative definitions come from Republican consultant Rob
Stutzman.</TE>
<TE>   Simonize: to upset wealthy former big-city mayors, or to appear in
TV commercials produced in campaign consultant Sal Russo's office
overlooking the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Gray-vitate: the function of placing government for sale ... at
inflated prices, as in "The career politician was convicted of
gray-vitating his office."</TE>
<TE>   Fishy Goings-On Right Under Legislators' Noses</TE>
<TE>   Throughout California, the rainbow trout is not an endangered
species. On the grounds of the state Capitol, its future is more
parlous. Despite a 4-foot-high fence, security cameras, "no
trespassing" signs and an imposing statue of a Spanish-American War
soldier, the trout are disappearing from the pond in Capitol Park.</TE>
<TE>   In the spring, the trout census stood at 35. By mid-July, there
were 19. Because evolution doesn't work nearly that fast, the trout
clearly did not sprout legs and walk. Six died of disease or were
parboiled in the heat, but the rest were clearly poached--so say
lawmen and pond guardians. People cleaning the pond's bottom have
found hooks, lures, fishing line, even car antennas snapped off and
fashioned into makeshift rods.</TE>
<TE>   Caretaker Stephen Fisher hates to see the trout dwindle, but isn't
surprised: "If I were homeless and hungry, I don't think I could pass
one up." Which invites the recipe question: Are the stolen trout
being served raw, sushi-style? Or carted off to some homeless
encampment campfire for a fish barbecue?</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Got dough? Maybe 100 grand? How about being a chair at the lunch
that billionaire David Murdock (Dole foods, developer, that Murdock)
is hosting for President Bush this month to shake the tambourine for
Simon's gubernatorial campaign? That gets you two tables of 10 each,
and two photos with Bush (two guests each with the prez per photo).
If the stock market's hit you hard, consider instead being on the
host committee for $10,000, one table of 10, and one photo-limited
availability, whatever that means, with Bush. All this is yours Aug.
24 at Murdock's Thousand Oaks horse farm.</TE>
<TE>   * No hard feelings: Gray Davis endorsed her brother's opponent in
the mayor's race, but L.A. City Councilwoman Janice Hahn is giving
the governor her support for November.</TE>
<TE>   * Former President Clinton will trek west to Santa Ana on Sept. 5,
when he will star at a fund-raiser for Rep. Loretta Sanchez, the only
Democratic member of Congress in GOP-rich Orange County. Also on hand
will be actress Rita Moreno, who trumps Clinton's two terms in the
White House as one of the few performers to have scored an Oscar,
Emmy, Tony and a Grammy.</TE>
<TE>   * Libertarian gubernatorial candidate Gary Copeland filed papers
last week to run for the less-exalted office of director on the
Trabuco Canyon Water District. The governor's job pays $165,000 a
year; the water district director gets $14,400, with a $120 per diem
not to exceed 10 days a month. Oh, yes, and medical benefits.</TE>
<TE>   * There goes the ol' ball game: The Democratic Party of the San
Fernando Valley will hold its fourth annual Labor Day picnic and
softball game on Sept. 1; starting lineup yet to be named.</TE>
<TE>   * Democrats have given up a plan to close the state's
$23.6-billion budget gap by more than doubling vehicle license fees,
Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson of Culver City said. They fell back
because of unyielding GOP opposition, and for that steadfastness,
Wesson said, the Republicans "should be committed." When everyone
laughed, Wesson corrected himself: "commended."</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "With the Republicans' proposed cuts to our health-care system,
anyone who contracts West Nile [virus] would be left for dead."</TE>
<TE>   --A Democratic Assembly aide waxes pithy over a proposed tax
package debate in which Assemblyman Ken Maddox, a Garden Grove
GOP-ster, compared the budget to a large mosquito carrying the West
Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Separated at birth? House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, above
left, the Missouri Democrat who recently joined Mayor Jim Hahn at Los
Angeles International Airport to announce the installation of
security cameras, and local TV newsdude Paul Dandridge, who actually
went to the news conference. And ... actress/producer Diane Baker,

Lady Laura Bush, who occasionally vacations at a ranch near the Texas
town of Crawford.</TE>

to pursue groundbreaking research is a feminist cause.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago, President Bush approved extremely limited federal
funding for some of the most promising research in medical history,
research that uses stem cells taken from days-old embryos. But
opponents of research are still trying to criminalize some of the
newest work. And a small number of feminists have joined their
efforts, calling for a halt to work known as "research cloning." They
do not speak for most women.</LD>
<LD>   This basic science is not just another way to patch damaged
organs. Remove the nucleus from a donated egg and replace it with the
nucleus of a body cell from someone with a genetic disease. Shock
this egg so that it begins to divide. In a few short days, derive
genetically identical stem cells that will grow into small laboratory
sample tissue of the diseased organs. Now you can learn how the
genetic mutation causes illness and test drugs to cure it.</LD>
<TE>   No other form of stem cell research can be used for this work.
That is why mainstream feminist groups, such as the National Women's
Law Center, the Society for the Advancement of Women's Health and the
National Partnership for Women and Families, have joined patients,
doctors, theologians, ethicists and scientists who are fighting to
keep the research legal.</TE>
<TE>   This research will take the donation of women's eggs. But egg
donation will be voluntary and safe, because of strong federal
regulations and independent monitoring to minimize injury, coercion
of donors or misuse of the research for reproductive or eugenic
purposes. Although we can support proposals to expand safeguards, no
one should forget that we already have a well-tested system of
protections. Halting research while awaiting additional rules would
be tantamount to banning the research.</TE>
<TE>   Most feminists are sensitive to those who view this research as
vulnerable to the occasional excesses associated with efforts by
couples undergoing in vitro fertilization to buy "Ivy League" eggs.
But unlike infertility treatments, regulations prevent such practices
here.</TE>
<TE>   To stop this research under the guise of "protecting" women is to
fall prey to an old trap: seeing women solely as egg-bearers and not
as adults who can be trusted to decide to donate eggs to help
science.</TE>
<TE>   For some, research cloning is caught up in a deeper debate about
human control over nature, as if we could count on nature for moral
direction. But nature is not only burbling streams; it also is the
cruelty of disease. And "unnatural" things are not all bad or
dangerous. Otherwise, we might as well return to the days when we
were told to fear contraception and education lest it cause us to
become "unnatural" women and leave us barren.</TE>
<TE>   Still others worry that this research advances society inexorably
toward the darkest excesses of human eugenics. But research cloning
never results in pregnancy or birth; it is purely laboratory work.</TE>
<TE>   The women's health movement is justifiably proud of its record of
calling attention to the dilemmas, excesses and occasional abuses
made possible by technological innovation, and of its help in
bringing about protections to safeguard this cloning research.</TE>
<TE>   Calls for responsible science and medicine should not be confused
with hostility to well-regulated, innovative research and new hope
for cures. Feminists can identify their opponents, and they are not
the ones in the white coats.</TE>

<HD>Iraq Needn't Be a Vietnam</HD>
<DH>With knowledge, we can avoid a quagmire.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT E. HUNTER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirty-eight years ago this week, two U.S. Navy vessels reported
being attacked by North Vietnamese forces in the Gulf of Tonkin.
Congress promptly passed the Southeast Asia Resolution, giving the
president almost unlimited authority to make war.</LD>
<LD>   The Gulf of Tonkin incident was a surprise; the resolution was
not. Many of us working in the White House knew that the draft had
already been written, waiting for the right moment to introduce it.
It followed several years of national consensus-building.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the military consequences of going to war in Southeast Asia
were barely considered; the nation was confident it could succeed
where France, a second-tier, colonial power, had failed.</LD>
<TE>   Today, there is equal confidence of prevailing militarily against
Iraq. But this time, the belief is founded: The U.S. defeated Iraq 11
years ago and since then America's military strength has risen
dramatically while Iraq's has surely gone down. As in the case of
Vietnam in 1964, we have not yet sufficiently sorted out the "why" of
attacking Iraq, at least not enough for the American people--or our
friends and allies abroad--to understand.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Saddam Hussein has earned his villain's stripes, and Iraq,
the region and the world would be better off without him. But
deposing him does not guarantee that Iraq, under new leaders, would
not continue to seek nuclear weapons--the threat that really matters.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps those who support invading Iraq are right that deterrence
would have no value; perhaps even intrusive inspections, imposed on
Iraq with a gun at its head, would fail to cleanse it of
mass-destruction weapons. But such courses should be explored while
they are options, not historians' conjecture.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam raises another issue worthy of debate before we strike: Do
we have the will to achieve our long-term goals? It is not clear
either that the U.S. has the "staying power" needed to stabilize Iraq
and its neighborhood after victory or that we have the knowledge to
do it right.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle East and Southwest Asia can no longer be treated as
separate islands of isolated threats and challenges. Long-term
victory is not just about defeating Iraq or wiping up what is left of
Al Qaeda. It is also about "nation-building," preventing conflict
over Kashmir, fulfilling America's ineluctable destiny to lead Israel
and the Palestinians to peace, building policies to inhibit the
spread of mass-destruction weapons and to deal with them if they do,
drawing Iran out of its isolation, and promoting political, economic
and social reform in so many societies over so many years.</TE>
<TE>   All these matters are in play as we think about war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Knowledge is the linchpin. There was no lack of people who knew
Vietnam, its history, culture and people and who warned against
hubris and overconfidence.</TE>
<TE>   Today, there is no lack of American expertise about the Middle
East or Southwest Asia. The challenge is to get that knowledge to the
top leaders of government and for them to use it.</TE>
<TE>   We can't ignore past British and Russian failures while we try to
shape Afghanistan to our liking. We can't simply assert that U.S.
invaders will be welcomed as liberators by a grateful Iraqi people,
ready to convert rapidly to democracy; that there will be no
spreading turmoil in the region; and that northern Kurds will at last
work together and abandon ambitions for independence that so trouble
neighboring Turkey.</TE>
<TE>   We only damage our own interests by continuing the delusion that
Iran, so far advanced with internal reforms, really teeters on the
edge of a "revolution from below," when we should support those
leaders working to lead it toward responsible behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Ignorance mired us in Vietnam. Four decades later, we must summon
knowledge and assume due humility. We must finally start widespread,
sustained, open, serious and uncensored debate on Iraq, free of cant
and emotion on all sides; we must be willing to accept permanent
commitment to responsibility in the region--and do all this before
the march to Baghdad.</TE>

<HD>As Egypt Smothers Reform, U.S. Looks On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AUGUSTUS RICHARD NORTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saad Eddin Ibrahim is again in Cairo's Tora prison, sentenced to
seven years at hard labor. Two years after Egyptian police raided and
padlocked the Ibn Khaldoun Center--the leading Arab world think tank
for political reform--the 63-year-old Ibrahim and four colleagues
were re-convicted in late July of sullying Egypt's reputation. Other
charges were leveled, including embezzlement, but this trial was not
about crime or the fate of a scholar of international reputation.
This was a verdict against the dream of peaceful political reform in
Egypt.</LD>
<LD>   Ibrahim, a co-founder of the Arab Human Rights Organization, lent
his exuberant voice and his good mind to tough and often unpopular
causes. He understands the need to liberalize Egypt's ossified
politics. He believes that democracy is the long-term solution to the
Arab world's malaise.</LD>
<LD>   Ibrahim's efforts encompassed the Arab world, but his deepest
commitment was to Egypt, the bellwether for regional politics. By the
late 1990s, he attracted a following of young professionals who were
stymied by "the system" but willing to work hard for change. He met
their youthful impatience and their contempt for corrupt politics
with the counsel of gradual reform.</LD>
<TE>   Ibrahim always assumed that he enjoyed the tacit support of
powerful political figures. I remember his elation when President
Hosni Mubarak adopted the term "civil society." Though he was
ultimately naive, it is not so farfetched that enlightened politicos
would applaud his efforts. Egypt's secular military regime has
confronted violent challenges from the communist left and the
Islamist right, whereas men and women of Ibrahim's ilk try to work
peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   One evening, I listened to Ibrahim's proteges--sounding more like
government apologists than reformers--urge Nile Delta peasants to
work within the system. The Ibn Khaldoun Center also sponsored
programs for teaching tolerance in schools and educating women about
their rights as voters, and it helped prompt a major debate on
granting women greater protection in marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Many educated Egyptians do not even bother voting in precooked
parliamentary elections, but Ibrahim sees elections as an opportunity
to hold government accountable. In 1995, he helped to lead a stunning
effort to monitor the elections and document egregious
irregularities. The effort was vindicated when Egypt's Constitutional
Court invalidated the balloting and ordered new elections.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ibrahim and his think tank publicized patterns of
discrimination against Egypt's Coptic Christian minority. Charges of
unfair treatment for Copts could undercut support in Washington for
the $2-billion-a-year U.S. largess that Egypt enjoys.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than embracing reform, Mubarak and his "iron circle"
jealously guard their power and view any opposition voice as
potentially erosive.</TE>
<TE>   Before Ibrahim's initial arrest in June 2000, an orchestrated
campaign in the Egyptian press vilified him as acting against the
nation's interest. The underlying rationale for going after Ibrahim
was to make an example of him and to make other reformers afraid to
accept foreign funding.</TE>
<TE>   Critics are tamed with tight financial reins. Brave souls who
ignore the leash laws must now ponder a stifling cell in Tora prison.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. meekly expressed only "disappointment" about the jailing
of Ibrahim. The amorphous war against terrorism tacitly licenses
friendly dictatorships to imprison peaceful opponents. The issue at
hand is only incidentally about a jailed scholar (who is also a
naturalized U.S. citizen).</TE>
<TE>   The United States' standing in Egypt and the world is now
contaminated by Washington's feckless approach to political reform
and its tolerance of repression and dictatorship. The Ibrahim case
presents a fitting moment to debate whether a serious adjustment in
policy is needed, and a test case to see whether such an adjustment
is possible.</TE>

<HD>Couch Trip 2002--Dr. Freud, Meet Mr. Greenspan</HD>
<DH>Your psyche is down 300 points? Let's talk about it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL STEINBERG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last century, economists have borrowed heavily from the
mental health field in describing dramatic economic phenomena of the
last 300 years. Who can forget the "depression" of the 1930s or the
"panic" in sell-offs in 1987 or even the tulip "mania" of 1636?</LD>
<LD>   To this lexicon we have added "irrational exuberance," a term that
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan made famous but that
economist Robert Shiller was instrumental in coining--with the help
of his wife, a clinical psychologist.</LD>
<LD>   Recently, Charles Kindleberger's "Manias, Panics, and Crashes," a
historical treatise on financial crises, has become virtually a de
rigueur text for psychiatrists. Indeed, in this natural
cross-fertilization between psychiatry and economics, psychiatry has
been the true winner by renewing itself through a host of fresh
metaphors.</LD>
<TE>   Economic ideas have begun to pervade the psychiatric interview.
For example, when patients come in for consultations, I find myself
borrowing some of the terminology of my financial colleagues. I might
say to a patient, "Given that your marriage stinks, that you hate
your career track, that you barely have a communicative relationship
with your children, I think your prior exuberance was irrational. Now
you are simply going through a 'correction.' "</TE>
<TE>   I go on to explain the concept of vicious circles. Having hit some
of life's rough spots, I explain, you have stopped investing in
yourself. A period of "growth and expansion" can replace the previous
contractions in one's development.</TE>
<TE>   Just as countries must go through major structural changes to stem
economic crises, individuals in the midst of personal crises must
recognize their need for structural changes in their lives. It helps
to employ the language of the International Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   "You have used up all your emotional reserves," I might tell
certain patients. Or, "There is absolutely no transparency in your
internal affairs."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the concept of a double-dip recession has become a
useful diagnostic term. Occasionally one encounters individuals who,
beset by new traumas, experience a recurrence of depression after an
initial fragile recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Patients often inquire about their long-term prognosis. "In the
long run, we're all dead," I assure them, quoting from my favorite
psychiatric mentor, John Maynard Keynes.</TE>
<TE>   So, why do I engage in this conciliation of economics and
psychiatry? To reduce any remaining stigma about psychological care.
If countries, stock markets and galaxies can experience vicious
spirals, then certainly we mortals can acknowledge our similar
tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   We are all muddling through, Greenspan and George W. Bush as much
as the rest of us. A tweak here, a tweak there seems all we can do,
but these tweaks can have a significant effect on our dealings with
those momentous and sometimes vicious circles of life.</TE>

<HD>Quiet Raid on Public Lands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The battle for the environment is never easy. The struggle to clean
the air and water and preserve wild lands for our children and our
children's children was tested in the 1980s by the attacks of
Interior Secretary James G. Watt. Fortunately, public outrage stymied
Watt.</LD>
<LD>   But today, from Florida to Alaska, the environment again is under
assault. The Bush administration is undercutting laws and reversing
regulations under the guise of "balance" and of what's good for the
nation. The beneficiary is industry.</LD>
<LD>   It's the most concerted exploitation of the public's land, air and
water since fundamental protection laws went into effect three
decades ago.</LD>
<TE>   Many worthy initiatives are being junked, including a Clinton
administration decision to halt road building in 59 million acres of
untracked national forest. Corporations itching to tear up federal
lands in the West for their energy and mineral wealth are getting a
sympathetic hearing in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The present reversal is smarter, broader and more threatening than
the Watt actions. Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton, a Watt protege,
extols the parks and wild animals; behind that shield, damage is
taking place.</TE>
<TE>   Many Americans are familiar with the administration's quest to
drill for oil on the Arctic plain in Alaska and repeal the snowmobile
ban in Yellowstone. Scores of other rollbacks never make headlines. A
sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * A new Environmental Protection Agency rule allows companies to
dump mine waste into rivers and streams.</TE>
<TE>   * The Interior Department is pushing to develop oil and gas leases
off the Central California coast and new energy leasing in the Los
Padres National Forest, part of it habitat for the California condor.</TE>
<TE>   * The EPA ordered a 16-year delay in enforcing rules to clean
emissions from dirty older electric power plants.</TE>
<TE>   * The Interior Department says it will allow drilling of 51,000
methane gas wells in northeast Wyoming, threatening the area's
groundwater supply. Interior also is opening the pristine Rocky
Mountain Front in Montana and the red rock country of Utah to oil
exploration.</TE>
<TE>   * The U.S. Forest Service is expanding logging plans in the
national forests and Interior is proposing oil exploration near
Florida's Everglades.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also is slashing the regulatory budgets of
agencies such as the EPA. Committed professional staff members have
felt ignored, sometimes driven out. Former energy and logging
industry executives manage the nation's parks and forests.</TE>
<TE>   Norton talks of restoring balance between protecting the
environment and the need to develop public resources. But her
initiatives, far from being balanced, are a swing back toward the
exploitation that ravaged the public estate in the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Congress should be fighting these shadowy dealings, but most
members are preoccupied with national security issues and some are
simply cozy with the energy industry and thus happy with the Bush
administration actions.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress continues its passive acceptance of this environmental
reversal, the courts may be the only defense left. Americans should
make their voices heard before it comes to that.</TE>

<LD>Despite the cramped seating and shrink-wrapped lasagna, getting paid

Tijuana. Yet Border Patrol agents are critical to U.S. security. So
the Immigration and Naturalization Service needs to find ways to keep
people from abandoning their posts to become sky marshals.</LD>
<LD>   As the United States finds itself confronting international
terrorists, INS Border Patrol agents, immigration inspectors and
detention and enforcement officers are leaving in record numbers,
often taking better-paying government jobs with agencies such as the
newly formed Transportation Security Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Since Oct. 1, about 2,100 of the INS' 15,000 Border Patrol
officers and immigration inspectors have left. By July 27, the Border
Patrol alone had hired 1,598 agents but lost 1,506.</LD>
<TE>   Joining the ranks of the INS is not easy. Applicants need
comprehensive knowledge of complex immigration laws and regulations,
a reasonable command of a foreign language, good physical abilities
and a lot of common sense. They also must undergo rigorous training.</TE>
<TE>   So far, recruiting has not been a problem. This fiscal year, about
75,000 people applied for Border Patrol jobs and 80,000 as
immigration inspectors. Retaining experienced agents is another
matter. Veteran agents say the main reasons for the exodus are low
pay, little job satisfaction and difficulties in transferring from
undesirable posts.</TE>
<TE>   Moving the border to a more hospitable location would be
difficult. Giving agents more money and recognition would not.
Congress and President Bush have approved raises of up to $6,000 for
many Border Patrol and immigration positions and have pushed the top
annual base pay to more than $54,000, not counting overtime or extra
pay for working in unpopular locations.</TE>
<TE>   In a measure that has cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee,
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is calling for another increase for
fiscal year 2003 that in most jurisdictions would give officers an
additional $7,500 to $8,000 a year. The Senate and House should pass
it.</TE>
<TE>   These raises would only narrow the salary gap between INS
employees and other government workers. Parity for federal employees
doing similar work would close it. The INS is locked into an
inflexible government service pay system, which offers 15 grades with
10 steps each. The new Transportation Security Administration offers
flexible salary ranges. As Congress and the administration struggle
to reinvent the INS, they should adopt a similar pay scale.</TE>

<LD>California banks and insurance companies should not be allowed to
sell supposedly confidential financial information to other companies
for marketing purposes. That this is legal is outrageous. No one
wants his bank broadcasting the size of his account, the balance on
his mortgage or his telephone number.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature can stop that practice by passing SB 773, by Sen.
Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough). It's shameful that this measure has
been stuck in the Assembly since Sept. 13. The bill got only 32 votes
there--all from Democrats--nine short of the majority needed.</LD>
<LD>   Even more infuriating is that 18 Democrats didn't vote at all on
the most important piece of consumer protection legislation to come
before the Legislature this year. (Ten of those represent parts of
Los Angeles County or Orange County.) The reason is simple and
deplorable. The legislators didn't want to vote against the bill and
be targeted by their supporters as anti-consumer. But they didn't
want to vote for the bill and possibly alienate the giant financial
institutions that make generous campaign contributions. This may be a
new high, or low, in lack of legislative courage. All Assembly
Republicans voted no.</LD>
<TE>   In the absence of adequate federal law, the Speier bill generally
would require financial institutions to get the customer's permission
before they could sell personal information to another company.</TE>
<TE>   Firms still could pass on the information to other units under the
same corporate ownership, but customers would have the opportunity
each year to declare whether they wanted that practice to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Many, but not all, of the biggest banks and insurance companies
are vigorously opposed to the bill. Speier does has the backing of
American Express, Pacific Life Insurance and the California State
Automobile Assn., a major insurance carrier, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Speier soon will bring back the legislation to the Assembly floor
for another try. This time, the Assembly should give her the needed
votes. Any members who claim to be on the side of consumer rights but
don't vote for this bill had better be prepared to explain why they
did not support it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Allies Cool to Striking Baghdad," Aug. 7: I hope our fair-weather
friends in Europe and elsewhere who refuse to support our planned

is a danger to every nation, will not call on the U.S. for help when
they are threatened by a foreign power.</LD>

<TE>   Once again our "moderate Arab friends," a.k.a. Saudi Arabia,
inform us that they will not support our efforts against Saddam
"Insane" ("Saudis Say They Won't Give Access for Iraq Hit," Aug. 8).
Thanks a lot, Saudi Arabia. For my part, not one American life is
worth defending them. That is the message I would send them.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me President Bush said that those who were not with us
were against us. Hmm ... very interesting.</TE>

<TE>   The trouble with Saudi Arabia is easy to understand. When we set
up military operations and permanent bases inside their country
during the Gulf War it infuriated the Saudi people. That Saudi Arabia
needed foreigners to sit on its land to protect it from outsiders was
(and is) humiliating and a slap in the face. (Imagine if a foreign
power like China set up military bases and operations in Long
Beach--how would we feel?)</TE>
<TE>   It is the primary reason Osama bin Laden changed his hate from the
Russians to the U.S. and is the first of a number of reasons that
9/11 actually took place. Given our long-range military capabilities,
keeping military bases in places such as Saudi Arabia only infuriates
the locals and increases the worldwide anger and terrorism against
the United States.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Weighing a Just War, or Settling an Old Score?" Commentary,
Aug. 6: Anyone crazy enough to lob Scud missiles into Israel as
Hussein did during the Gulf War should meet anyone's definition of a
madman, although apparently not Robert Scheer's.</TE>
<TE>   I agree with Scheer that if Hussein accepts the return of U.N.
weapons inspectors, the Bush administration would be hard-pressed to
pursue military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   But will the inspectors be successful? Prior experience suggests
not. And prior experience clearly shows Hussein to be undeterred in
his efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, even if he
sacrifices the Iraqi people in the process. That's why we have to be
prepared to remove him. I hope we never see the day when Hussein
manages to get hold of a nuclear weapon.</TE>

<HD>VISTA Volunteers Experience Poverty</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As a member of the very first group of urban VISTA volunteers, I was
dismayed, not to mention astonished, to read that current VISTAs are
frustrated because they can't make ends meet without taking second
jobs ("Should Workers Share the Poverty They Fight?" Aug. 5).</LD>
<LD>   My VISTA colleagues and I trained in Chicago, where many of us
lived in public housing projects because that was what our stipend
could support. After graduation, a group of us went to Newark, where
most lived in projects again because it was what we could afford; my
roommate and I wheedled meals from friends at the end of most months
because we were out of money.</LD>
<LD>   The reality of poverty became part of our lives, and we became
more effective as VISTAs--and eventually, I believe, better
citizens--precisely because we experienced that reality.</LD>
<TE>   VISTA was built on the compassionate principle that poverty will
be significantly diminished, never mind eradicated, only when enough
folks have gained the understanding that comes of walking a mile, or
more, in those shoes.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes a generation of VISTAs whose principles seem weirdly
disconnected from that essential thesis; they give rich new meaning
to "unclear on the concept." And they make me sad.</TE>

<LD>Re "Promised Land for Donkeys" (Aug. 8), about a woman who is saving
donkeys horrendously mistreated in the Mideast: Gandhi wrote, "The
greatness of a nation and its moral progress can be judged by the way
its animals are treated." It is obvious that societies that treat
their "lowest of the low" with such cruelty and indifference are
barbarians and should be understood as such.</LD>
<LD>   How do you talk with barbarians? How do you negotiate for peace?
How can you expect anything resembling a civilized way of dealing
with politics and sociology, or empathy and compassion, from such
people?</LD>
<LD>   Let's face it. There are plenty of humans in every land whose
treatment of others, be they animals or people, is savage. But the
description of this ubiquitous attitude toward animals that are
enslaved to humans and cannot save themselves is appallingly telling
of what we have to contend with in that region of the globe.</LD>

<LD>Re "As Kashmir Boils, Keep Heat on Pakistan," Commentary, Aug. 7:
Selig Harrison is so off the mark when he advises the Bush
administration to "get Pakistan to keep its hands off" Kashmir as a
means of finally resolving the Kashmir issue. Whether Pakistan can do
more to stop "infiltration" by militants has less to do with
resolving the 55-year-old Kashmir conflict than whether India can
admit that a problem of national self-determination cannot be solved
by military force, no matter how overwhelming and how brutal.</LD>
<LD>   In Kashmir, as in the Palestinian territories, when the problem is
finally seen by the powers that be as a quintessential question of
self-determination and the freedom of a whole nation of people, only
then will such problems ever come close to a final resolution. And
another round of sham elections will not help in this regard.</LD>
<LD>   Saif M. Hussain</LD>
<TE>   Woodland Hills</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Harrison's commentary clearly documents the duplicity in American
foreign policy. While India has remained a secular democracy since
its independence in 1947, Pakistan has rarely had free elections and
is an Islamic state where non-Muslims do not have equal rights. A few
months ago, dictator Pervez Musharraf "won" a rigged election, with
more than 90% of the public's support.</TE>
<TE>   The state of Jammu and Kashmir is one state in India, and while
there is corruption throughout Indian local, state and national
governments, people have a right to change the government through the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Islamic separatist movement is an anti-democratic movement to
establish another Islamic state on India's border--not a movement for
better rule.</TE>

<LD>The state needs money; L.A. County needs money--for health care, for

<LD>   We must tax gasoline, at least $1 per gallon. In 1932 gas was 18
cents per gallon. If inflation has increased about twentyfold,
gasoline should cost $3.60 per gallon by 1932 standards. This revenue
could be shared with the counties where the gasoline was sold.</LD>
<LD>   This tax would decrease traffic, penalize the SUV gas gulpers,
help clean up the air and fight global warming. California could once
again lead the way, just as it has done with auto emission standards.</LD>

<LD>Re "Bond Issue Would Aid Arts Centers," Aug. 7: So the Board of
Supervisors passed a bond proposal that will send some money the way

museum--LACMA--whose directors plan to tear it down in order to make
room for a sprawling floor plan supporting a $300-million Mylar roof?</LD>
<LD>   If LACMA will not reconsider its decision to destroy what exists
in favor of something to compete with the Walt Disney Concert Hall, I
hope the supervisors will reconsider the bond issue so that
institutions in need of tax money for more-fundamental care, like the
Natural History Museum [also included in the bond proposal], will
receive the funds they need.</LD>

<LD>If Michael Ramirez believes "moral relativism" to be more dangerous
than a fatal virus, what is his alternative (editorial cartoon, Aug.
6)? Moral absolutism? And who is to declare the moral absolutes?
Ramirez? George W. Bush? Jerry Falwell? How about Osama bin Laden, so
certain of his own values? It's moral absolutism that led to Sept.
11, Mr. Ramirez, not an appreciation of human and cultural diversity.

<LD>To all who have written or spoken objections to the teenage girls
going public about their kidnapping (Aug. 7-8), I say shame on you. I
say get rid of the perception that victims of rape should feel any
shame.</LD>
<LD>   Why should a victim be ashamed of any violation?</LD>
<LD>   If the sexual abuse victims had felt no shame after being violated
by priests and other members of the clergy, they might have been more
apt to tell on the abusers immediately after the crimes were
committed. If children feel no shame when they're the victims of
sexual abuse committed by their parents, they might be more apt to
tell. It's time to stop shaming the victims.</LD>

<TE>   I agree wholeheartedly with columnist Steve Lopez (Aug. 7) that
the appearance of the two kidnap/rape victims on TV shows the next
day was exploitation at its worst by the TV shows. It does
desensitize us to the ghastliness of the crimes. TV news disgusted me
years ago, and I quit watching.</TE>

<TE>   It's disgusting when law enforcement officers must face a review
board after killing a kidnapper/car thief who was shooting at them
("Killing of Abductor Is Ruled Justified," Aug. 8). It seems that our
laws are giving more rights to the criminals than the victims.</TE>

<LD>Re "Billboard Fight May Change State Landscape," Aug. 6 and "Senate
Tables Billboard Plan," Aug. 7: Under the smokescreen that the plan
would give cities more control over billboards, it would actually
allow hundreds of these visual polluters on our freeways and highways
statewide, where they are not allowed at present. Assembly Bill 2087,
carried by Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long Beach), which actually
passed the Assembly, is the work of the same billboard lobbyist who
tried to put billboards on L.A.'s freeways last year but,
fortunately, failed.</LD>
<LD>   We wish to question the assemblywoman's ulterior motive, urge Sen.
Kevin Murray (D-Culver City), chairman of the Senate's Transportation
Committee, not to reconsider the tabled bill and warn all our
senators against this bill that is so detrimental to California's
visual environment.</LD>

<HD>Reserves Being Misused to Boost Earnings</HD>
<DH>Accounting: WorldCom employed the 'cookie jar' practice to
help it hide $3.9 billion in expenses, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID WARD</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s use of so-called cookie jar accounting--inflating
provisions for expected expenses and later reversing them to boost
earnings--is the largest among numerous cases of misuse of reserves.</LD>
<LD>   Companies set reserves to cover the estimated costs of taxes,
litigation, bad debts, job cuts and acquisitions. Once the costs are
incurred, the excess amount in the reserve can be reversed to boost
earnings. Company managers estimate reserves and the outside auditor
judges whether the reserves are reasonable.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom, the carrier of about half of all Internet traffic, filed
the largest U.S. bankruptcy case last month after revealing that it
hid $3.9 billion in expenses since 2001. The company said Thursday
that it found $3.3 billion more in improper accounting since 1999,
most from overestimating reserves to create a slush fund that was
drawn from to inflate profit, spokesman Brad Burns said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is by far the biggest case of this that has come to light,"
said Walter Schuetze, a former chief accountant for the Securities
and Exchange Commission. "Companies can just reach into these
reserves any time they want to and make any earnings number they need
to."</TE>
<TE>   Auditors rarely challenge company estimates because there are
unclear guidelines for calculating reserves, accountants said. Arthur
Andersen audited Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom's financial statements
from 1989 to May 14, when the telecommunications company dropped
Andersen and hired KPMG.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. this year agreed to settle SEC allegations it
misstated earnings from 1994 to 1998 by moving $900 million to
reserve accounts for anticipated expenses, over-reporting earnings in
some quarters and underreporting earnings at other times. Microsoft
neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Corp. paid a $10-million fine to settle SEC charges that it
inflated revenue by $2 billion between 1997 and 2000. The SEC charged
that Xerox created reserves for liabilities including vacation pay
that the company knew were too high so it could draw on reserves in
years when it needed a boost to meet earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC last year accused Sunbeam Corp. and former Chief Executive
Al Dunlap of boosting earnings at the appliance maker by creating
cookie jar reserves to inflate income, in addition to other improper
accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly became increasingly a concern over the last five
years," said Tim Lucas, former research director for the rule-making
Financial Accounting Standards Board. "The SEC has accused companies
of overdoing it, creating big reserves then taking that money out at
very convenient times."</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's reserves for estimated costs related to acquisitions
fell to $938 million at the end of 2000 from $2 billion in 1998 and
most of the liabilities were unpaid, according to the company's
annual report for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom reduced earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization by $217 million in 1999, $2.86 billion in 2000, $161
million in 2001 and $88 million in the first quarter of 2002 after
the most recent accounting errors were uncovered.</TE>
<TE>   KPMG and WorldCom auditors may uncover more improper accounting,
WorldCom said in a statement last week.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, including former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, say
companies may inflate charges and reserves when they make
acquisitions because most investors ignore or discount large,
one-time write-offs associated with purchases. WorldCom acquired at
least 15 businesses in the 1990s, including MCI Communications and
SkyTel Communications.</TE>
<TE>   "This is traditionally abused when companies want to push reserves
into future earnings," said Ron Kasznik, an accounting professor at
Stanford Business School. "The question is whether companies are
accruing too little or too much. That's when people get concerned."</TE>

<HD>Small Companies Increasingly Turning to Plastic</HD>
<DH>Financial services: Banks are pushing business credit cards
in a bid for new revenue. But there is a downside.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's entrepreneurs accessed more than $126.8 billion in
"micro" loans from banks and thrifts last year, with a growing
percentage of it in the form of costly credit card debt, according to
a report to be released today by the Small Business Administration.</LD>
<LD>   Small-business owners using credit cards to finance their
enterprises is nothing new. But federal officials are growing
concerned that the use of so-called business credit cards is
supplanting traditional bank loans for amounts under $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   Officials say the growth in credit card loans is a convergence of
entrepreneurs' perpetual need for quick and easy access to capital,
banks looking for new markets for their credit cards and traditional
financial institutions tightening up standards on small loans.</LD>
<TE>   "For banks, the profitability of these loans is high, so what you
see is the numbers shifting to business credit cards, and most of
those are by larger banks," said Charles C. Ou, a senior economist
with the SBA's office of advocacy and author of the lending report.</TE>
<TE>   And though credit cards may provide a short-term cash infusion,
experts caution that using credit card debt in place of a loan can
ultimately hamper efforts to get more traditional bank financing and
also can carry a hefty price tag.</TE>
<TE>   "After the saturation of the consumer credit market, now banks are
pushing these [business] credit cards, and those can be higher-cost
loans," Ou said.</TE>
<TE>   In researching loan patterns, Ou identified 16 large banks in 2000
that he classified as "credit card banks," that is, banks with a high
ratio of credit card loans to total assets and with a large number of
outstanding loans of less than $100,000 and averaging less than
$3,000. Last year the number of these credit card banks grew to 21,
including major credit card issuers such as MBNA Corp., Providian
Financial Corp. and Advanta Corp.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the rate of growth of micro loans at non-credit
card banks was flat, and the number of small loans at the so-called
credit card banks grew by nearly 20%, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Interest rates on business credit cards often range up to 20%. By
comparison, the typical micro loan in a program funded by the SBA has
rates in the 11% range, said Jody Raskind of the SBA's office of
financial assistance. In that agency's micro-lending program, owners
can access up to $35,000, to be paid within six years.</TE>
<TE>   Though some business cards, such as American Express' Blue card
and Fleet's Platinum Visa Business Credit Card, start with a low
introductory rate, they often jump after six months to rates of 12%
or more.</TE>
<TE>   Much less profitable, said experts in small-business financing,
are traditional loans in small amounts.</TE>
<TE>   "A credit card is low administration and high return for a bank,"
said David Banfield, president of the Toronto-based Interface
Financial Group, which offers invoice financing to small businesses.
"They couldn't give you the same amount of money as a loan, because
the administration of it would kill them. They would have to monitor
that loan, report on that loan [to the government] and do a whole lot
of policing.</TE>
<TE>   "In policing and paperwork, it costs the bank the same to make a
$300,000 loan as a $30,000," Banfield said. "But they can't make any
money on the $30,000 loan."</TE>
<TE>   For small-business owners, these business credit cards can offer
organization: Business cards often send detailed, itemized statements
at year end that can be helpful at tax time. Others, such as Bay Area
businessman John Blount, are seeking a relatively hassle-free way to
access cash.</TE>
<TE>   After racking up more than $15,000 worth of business-related debt
on a personal credit card, Blount, owner of La Raccolta, an Italian
import shop with outlets in San Francisco and Mill Valley, opted for
a business credit card, which he strives to pay down every month.</TE>
<TE>   After taking out home equity loans in the past, he said he was not
eager to go through the application process again for a micro-loan.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been looking into getting loans and they ask you to do a
ton of paperwork and then we go through that and get rejected," said
Blount, who runs his business with his wife. "This was no questions
asked."</TE>
<TE>   Banfield noted that keeping the credit card constantly maxed out
may hamper efforts to get a more traditional loan in the future,
because "bankers like ... to see movement" on the loan balance.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that credit cards provide small entrepreneurs access
to capital "they have to help on some level," said Charles H. DeBow
III, special projects director with the Washington-based National
Black Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   But he cautioned that getting a credit card "doesn't give you a
relationship with a bank." His organization has helped provide more
than $42 million in small, SBA-backed loans last year and is working
to create a program to provide "mini-micro" loans of up to $5,000 to
start-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such lending programs--there are about 430 micro-lending
programs nationwide--entrepreneurs probably will continue to turn to
plastic for a quick cash infusion.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not incurring any debt with the [business] card because I pay
it off every month," Blount said. "And it seemed a lot easier to get
this card, with 3.9% interest, than try for another loan. And
anything that makes life easier, I'm happier."</TE>

<HD>Buffett on a Bargain Hunt</HD>
<DH>Investing: Berkshire Hathaway has spent $4.24 billion this
year on deals with Dynegy, Williams and Level 3 Communications.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN LONKEVICH</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is on a $20-billion buying
spree that some investors say has only just begun.</LD>
<LD>   So far this year, Buffett has joined with Lehman Bros. Holdings to
provide $2 billion in financing to energy concern Williams Cos.,
invested $100 million in telecommunications specialist Level 3
Communications Inc. and bought two gas pipelines--one from Williams
for $450 million and one from Dynegy Inc. for $1.88 billion in cash
and debt.</LD>
<LD>   After spending $4.24 billion this year and more than $15.4 billion
over the last two years, Buffett still has as much as $40 billion in
cash and short-term investments available for acquisitions.</LD>
<TE>   He said in his annual letter to shareholders in March that he
wants to make acquisitions in the $5-billion-to-$20-billion range.</TE>
<TE>   "Absent a major catastrophe, this should be Berkshire's best year
ever," said Keith Trauner, an analyst at Fairholme Capital
Management, which manages $33 million and owns Berkshire shares.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market rout has created investment opportunities for
Berkshire and also is helping the company's insurance businesses
maintain price increases instituted since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks, which cost Berkshire $2.28 billion and the insurance
industry about $58 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Berkshire's second-quarter earnings excluding investment gains or
losses probably rose to $550 a share from $231 a year ago, according
to a survey of analysts by Thomson First Call. The company is
expected to report earnings after the market closes today.</TE>
<TE>   "He's buying great assets from companies whose holding companies
are in distress," said Fairholme's Trauner. Kern River, the pipeline
Buffett's MidAmerican Energy unit bought from Williams, "is a great
asset," Trauner said, considering how much it would cost in time and
money to lay a new pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett, in his letter to investors, decried what he said was a
lack of investment opportunities, saying Berkshire's size as well as
market conditions such as outsized valuations make it impossible to
replicate the company's past successes.</TE>
<TE>   "Two conditions at Berkshire are far different from what they once
were: Then we could often buy businesses and securities at much lower
valuations than now prevail; and more important, we were working with
far less money than we now have," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Oracle of Omaha also said he needed to find "elephants," or
large undervalued companies, to make significant gains.</TE>
<TE>   "You could see him buying some elephants," said Greg Lapin, an
analyst at Citigroup Asset Management, which manages $409 billion and
owns Berkshire shares.</TE>
<TE>   Buffett missed an opportunity a few years ago to buy
pharmaceutical stocks before they rallied, Lapin said. "He didn't
take advantage then but he might be interested in a basket of
pharmaceutical stocks today," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed since the March 9 letter, investors say. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has lost more than 26% and the Dow Jones
industrial average has lost 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Berkshire have lost more than 6% this year and rose $110
to $71,000 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They've
outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by 22% since March 9.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the ideal market for Warren Buffett," said Guy Spier, a
money manager at Aquamarine Fund, which has 27% of its $30 million in
Berkshire stock. "With the Dow cheaper, opportunities are likely to
be better. If the Dow were down to 10 times earnings, he would be in
even better shape."</TE>
<TE>   Buffett, who turns 72 this month, declined a request for an
interview on possible acquisition targets. At his company's 2001
annual meeting, he said asbestos litigation is a "cancer" that will

<HD>O.C. Register Owners Decide Not to Sell Firm</HD>
<DH>Media: In a compromise, family votes to explore ways to
transfer ownership to fourth generation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ending weeks of speculation, the family that owns Orange County
Register parent Freedom Communications Inc. decided Sunday against
selling the company but agreed to transfer ownership to the fourth
generation of shareholders, now in their 20s and 30s.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was largely a compromise by the family, which was
under pressure from dissident third-generation shareholder Tim Hoiles
to liquidate his 8.6% stake. Hoiles, the 50-year-old grandson of
founder R.C. Hoiles, had threatened to sue his relatives if his
demands to be bought out at a favorable price weren't met.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Bassett, a tax attorney and fourth-generation Hoiles who
proposed the stock transfer idea, said it would be six to 18 months
before any transaction took place.</LD>
<TE>   Experts said that to raise funds to buy out the third-generation
shareholders, the family could sell some shares to the public or in
the private equity market, or put part of the Irvine-based media
company up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Bassett, 38, said the proposal to transfer shares should satisfy
those family members who want to cash out.</TE>
<TE>   "People who want liquidity can and will get bought out, while
[Freedom] will remain a privately held media company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, at the conclusion of a two-day family meeting, Hoiles
declined to say whether he agreed with the share transfer decision or
whether he would pursue a lawsuit. "We'll have to see," he said after
emerging from a Costa Mesa hotel conference room.</TE>
<TE>   For now, younger shareholders will work with financial advisor and
family-business expert Francois De Visscher to devise the best
course. A conference call has been scheduled with him for Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the family's proposal is to be presented Tuesday
to the company's board, which includes Hoiles and five other
shareholding family members, six non-shareholding outside directors
and Chief Executive Samuel Wolgemuth. Freedom owns 28 daily
newspapers, 37 weeklies and eight television stations.</TE>
<TE>   The Register, the crown jewel of the Hoileses' holdings, is a
standard-bearer of libertarianism and the dominant newspaper in one
of the country's most politically conservative counties.</TE>
<TE>   The closely held company last year had revenue of $760 million and
lost about $109 million amid the nationwide advertising downturn and
softening economy, said sources familiar with the results. The
business also reportedly wrote off $103 million for magazine,
Internet and other losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Hoiles family was under pressure to hold a meeting about
restructuring after talks to buy out Tim Hoiles faltered, and the
maverick shareholder went to the media to publicize his discontent
with the company's performance and his inability to cash out. His
threat to sue his relatives ratcheted up the heat.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles, who maintains that the company has lost 25% of its
value in the last five years because of mismanagement, said an
outright sale of the company would fetch far more than any other
option. Independent analysts have valued the company at $1.5 billion
to $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles said that earlier this year he demanded as little as $75.2
million to sell his stake, but a deal failed to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   He said that other family members also want to liquidate some or
all of their holdings and had grown unhappy with their lack of
options.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday, the family rejected a proposal to sell the company
because such a step probably would cost the family control of its
businesses, eliminate potential employment opportunities for family
members, end the libertarian bent of Freedom's media holdings and
potentially have "a negative impact on the continuation of various
family relationships," according to an internal Freedom document.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph M. Alioto, a member of Tim Hoiles' high-profile team of
legal and media advisors, recently said his client "would not allow
shareholders to keep him hostage and prisoner against his will."</TE>
<TE>   Alioto disputed the claims that shareholders had reached a final
decision about the company's future.</TE>
<TE>   He said that of the 13 alternatives examined at the weekend
meeting, selling the company received the second-most votes. That
option would be pursued if a buyout by the fourth generation could
not be completed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Hardie, 26, said members of the fourth generation are closer
and more cohesive than their elders, but just as politically
committed. "We want to maintain the legacy our great-grandfather
started by promoting the libertarian philosophy in our communities,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under R.C. Hoiles, the company's flagship Orange County Register
became a bully pulpit for libertarian and right-wing causes, helping
to launch grass-roots political efforts that helped fuel the
presidential bids of such conservative icons as Barry Goldwater and
Ronald Reagan. The paper, which toned down the ideological fire and
brimstone after the elder Hoiles' death in 1970, has since won three
Pulitzer Prizes. With a daily circulation of about 315,000, it now
ranks as the nation's 12th biggest newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   There are an estimated 30 fourth-generation Hoileses and 15
third-generation members, mostly in their 50s.</TE>
<TE>   That the 43 Hoiles shareholders who participated in this weekend's
meeting came to a decision was a surprise. Initially, they were
expected to winnow down the list to three or four options and forward
them to the board for further exploration.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy with the outcome," said Robin Hardie, a 32-year-old
shareholder.</TE>

<HD>Gas Prices Stable Despite Strong Demand</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gasoline prices declined nationally by less than a penny in the last
two weeks, reflecting continued stability in prices despite strong
consumer demand.</LD>
<LD>   Prices at the pump have fluctuated by only 2.5 cents since April,
analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "The continued adequacy of gasoline supply and very little change
in the cost of crude oil gives us this relative price stability,"
Lundberg said.</LD>
<TE>   Despite increased summer driving demand, gasoline supplies
remained plentiful during the two-week survey period that ended
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the price of gas at the pump averaged about $1.45 per
gallon on Friday, according to the Lundberg survey of 8,000 stations.
That was down less than a penny over the last two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The average has remained relatively steady since peaking at $1.46
in early April, Lundberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The national weighted average price of gasoline, including taxes,
at self-serve pumps was about $1.42 per gallon for regular, $1.52 for
mid-grade and $1.61 for premium.</TE>
<TE>   "There appears to be plenty of supply to continue to meet current
demand," Lundberg said.</TE>

<HD>Analyst Is Under a Harsher Light</HD>
<DH>Jack Grubman, whose telecom reports once moved markets, is
the focus of probes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL RUBINKAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Jack Grubman emerged from the working-class neighborhoods here more
than 30 years ago with little more than an aptitude for numbers and a
reputation as someone who was going places.</LD>
<LD>   That place was Wall Street, where Grubman became one of the most
influential and highest-paid securities analysts of the 1990s,
pulling down a reported $20 million a year during the stock market
boom.</LD>
<LD>   Grubman specialized in the highflying telecommunications sector,
and he remained one of its biggest cheerleaders--right up until the
business collapse that spurred allegations of massive accounting
fraud and erased trillions in investors' paper wealth.</LD>
<TE>   The once-celebrated analyst is now under fire for hyping WorldCom
Inc., Global Crossing Ltd. and other telecom companies while they
were clients of his investment firm, Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman and Salomon deny any wrongdoing. Testifying before the
House Financial Services Committee last month, Grubman said he had no
idea that WorldCom executives hid billions of dollars in company
expenses from investors.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the analyst acknowledged remaining bullish on WorldCom for
too long. "I certainly made mistakes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week brought the revelation that Grubman wrote a $100,000
check to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee--a check that
was received the very day he was subpoenaed to testify before
Congress. The contribution, described by the Wall Street Journal as
Grubman's biggest political contribution ever, was solicited by the
committee, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Such reports only reinforce Grubman's public image as an elbow
rubber seeking influence with the high and mighty.</TE>
<TE>   It's been an abrupt fall from grace for Grubman, an intense,
self-described "telecom junkie" whose favorable research reports once
moved markets.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Benjamin Grubman, 48, was raised in a working-class section
of northeast Philadelphia. His father, Izzy, was a municipal worker
and professional boxer who was so strong he could tear a phone book
in half. His mother, Mildred, worked in a dress shop.</TE>
<TE>   Young Jack worked as a busboy, loaded packages and sold beach
umbrellas during summers in Atlantic City, N.J. At Northeast High
School, he played the clarinet in the marching and concert bands and
was a three-year member of the debate team. He made the National
Honor Society his junior and senior years.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack was a very smart and aggressive guy," said Jacob Zamansky,
who double-dated with Grubman at their prom. "I had the feeling he
would be a success in whatever he chose to do."</TE>
<TE>   After graduating in 1971, Grubman headed to Boston University,
where he majored in mathematics. But in his official biography, he
listed his undergraduate alma mater as the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology--a deception revealed by Business Week two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman told the magazine it was "a stupid mistake on my part,"
adding: "At some point, I probably felt insecure, and it perpetuated
itself."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman, an amateur boxer in high school, also claimed to be from
south Philadelphia, a more colorful section of the city that
Sylvester Stallone made famous in the film "Rocky."</TE>
<TE>   After Boston University, Grubman earned a master's degree in math
from Columbia University and went to work for AT&amp;T Corp. in 1977. He
stayed with Ma Bell until 1985, then joined PaineWebber as a telecom
analyst.</TE>
<TE>   There, he developed a thesis that would serve him well for 17
years: that smaller, more nimble telecom companies would outperform
entrenched industry giants such as AT&amp;T.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman moved to Salomon Bros. in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   By the late 1990s, deregulation had caused explosive growth in
telecommunications, and Grubman was named the top analyst in his
field by Institutional Investor magazine. A workaholic, he traveled
constantly and enjoyed close relationships with executives.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman was more than an analyst--he was an advisor. He worked
with Global Crossing on its failed 2000 merger with US West, the
Denver-based Baby Bell, and consulted with then-WorldCom Chief
Executive Bernard J. Ebbers on dozens of acquisitions during the
1990s.</TE>
<TE>   He was paid handsomely for his efforts, earning a reported $20
million in 1999. In January of that year, Grubman and his wife,
Luann, bought a Manhattan duplex for $6.2 million. The couple has two
children.</TE>
<TE>   Critics said Grubman and other Wall Street analysts knocked down
the traditional "Chinese wall" between investment bankers and
supposedly objective researchers. It was an allegation Grubman didn't
exactly dispute.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sculpting the industry," Grubman said in 2000. "I get
feedback from institutions and CEOs.... It's a virtuous circle."</TE>
<TE>   During another interview, he said: "Objective? The other word for
it is uninformed."</TE>
<TE>   Grubman declined to comment for this story. But he has his
defenders.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon spokeswoman Susan Thomson said Grubman has the company's
full support.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an active member of our research team," she said. "And that
kind of speaks for itself."</TE>
<TE>   Salomon also pointed out that Grubman's bullish stock picks came
with warnings that the investments were high-risk.</TE>
<TE>   Stock commentator and former hedge fund manager Jim Cramer said
Grubman has been unfairly set up as a fall guy.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all mad because we all lost so much money," Cramer wrote
in a column on TheStreet.com. "But we sure as heck weren't upset when
Grubman was making us money hand over fist. If you think Grubman
committed a crime, believe me, you are applying laws to his behavior
that didn't exist at the time."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan is investigating stock
research at Salomon, including the work of Grubman and other
analysts, according to reports in the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   Grubman also is being targeted for disciplinary action by the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, a self-policing group for
brokers, for his bullish advice on Winstar Communications Inc.,
another fallen telecom company.</TE>
<TE>   A database maintained by the NASD lists 40 consumer complaints
against Grubman, including several lawsuits. Most are related to the
WorldCom collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Even Zamansky, Grubman's childhood friend, is suing the analyst on
behalf of a 60-year-old man who says he had to file for bankruptcy
after his Global Crossing stock lost more than $450,000 in value.</TE>
<TE>   Zamansky, a New York attorney whose firm specializes in securities
litigation, said he didn't initially make the connection.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even realize it was the same Jack Grubman," Zamansky
said. "There weren't a lot of people from northeast Philly who went
to Wall Street or even left Philly. We were some of the few who left
town."</TE>

<HD>Grand Jury Reportedly Is Probing Kmart</HD>
<DH>Bankruptcy: Two top execs of the troubled retailer got $34
million in compensation in less than two years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal grand jury in Detroit is reportedly probing Kmart Corp.'s
spectacular slide into bankruptcy protection while federal
investigators examine whether the company's former top two
executives--who together received $34 million in compensation in less
than two years--should face criminal charges for their role in the
downfall of the discount retailer.</LD>
<LD>   More than 20 subpoenas have been issued for witnesses, bank
records and other documents, according to a report in the Detroit
News citing unidentified federal sources. Federal officials told the
newspaper that as many as 200 subpoenas could be issued in the
investigation, which could last six more months.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators are looking into whether Kmart executives hid the
company's financial condition from its board of directors, employees
and shareholders.</LD>
<TE>   "The public can rest assured that we are actively and aggressively
pursuing this matter," FBI spokeswoman Dawn Clenney told the Detroit
News. The FBI is working with investigators with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and a U.S. House subcommittee is gathering
evidence for a separate Kmart inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials on Sunday declined to comment on the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 22 after
a lackluster holiday season sent the company's stock into a free
fall. The Troy, Mich.-based retailer laid off more than 22,000 people
earlier this year and shuttered 284 stores nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit News' articles detailed compensation packages received
by former Chief Executive Chuck Conaway, former President Mark
Schwartz and other top executives. While the company was losing
billions, executives purchased two new corporate jets and approved a
company vehicle program that allowed executives to drive Jaguars and
Land Rovers.</TE>
<TE>   Conaway and Schwartz were fired earlier this year. The FBI has
since interviewed both men, according to the newspaper. Neither
Conaway or Schwartz could be reached for comment, and Kmart
executives declined to elaborate on the probes.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been fully cooperating with the SEC investigation and with
the U.S. attorney's office investigation," Kmart spokesman Jack Ferry
said Sunday. He added that the company has been "conducting our own
investigation into past practices of the former management team under
Chuck Conaway and Mark Schwartz."</TE>
<TE>   Conaway was hired in May 2000 to turn around the company, which
had been consistently losing ground to competitors. His package
included a $1.4-million annual salary, $6 million in upfront cash and
stock bonuses, and a restricted stock award worth $5.4 million at the
time. After one year's service, Conaway received an additional
$5-million retention loan to keep him from leaving the company.</TE>
<TE>   From May 2000 until he was fired in March, Conaway collected
nearly $23 million in compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz was hired by Conaway in September 2000 to help Kmart
compete with industry leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. even though three
of Schwartz's previous companies wound up in Bankruptcy Court. The
circumstances of Schwartz's hiring have become a key focus of Kmart's
internal stewardship review, according to the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   During his 16-month stint with Kmart, Schwartz received $10.8

<HD>Key Events to Set Mood on Wall St.</HD>
<DH>Markets: The Fed's decision on rates and the deadline for
financial certification could aid, or hinder, a rebound.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM PETRUNO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some of the nation's biggest investment firms are goading the Federal
Reserve to cut interest rates this week--or at least to signal that a
cut is coming later in the year.</LD>
<LD>   But the majority of professional Fed watchers don't believe that
the central bank plans to accommodate Wall Street. And that is
raising questions about the stock market's ability to keep its recent
rebound alive.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, Wednesday's deadline for executives of the
largest U.S. companies to certify their firms' financial results
could be a catalyst for another market rally, if no significant
earnings restatements are announced, some analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed's meeting Tuesday and the financial-certification deadline
Wednesday will be key in setting the mood on Wall Street this week
and perhaps for the rest of the month, barring some unforeseen
geopolitical event.</TE>
<TE>   Stocks have rebounded over the last three weeks from the five-year
lows reached on July 23. The blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index
jumped 5.1% last week and is up nearly 14% from its closing low on
July 23.</TE>
<TE>   The average U.S. stock mutual fund rose 3.8% last week, according
to fund tracker Morningstar Inc. Year to date, however, the average
U.S. fund still is mired in red ink, down 20.3%.</TE>
<TE>   The stock market gained steam last week after a number of major
investment firms said they expect the Fed to further lower its
benchmark short-term interest rate by year's end, even though that
rate--at 1.75%--already is at a 40-year low.</TE>
<TE>   With recent economic data strongly suggesting that the economic
recovery is fading, investment titans including Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.,
Lehman Bros. and Deutsche Bank Securities have told clients that they
expect the Fed to ease credit by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan Stanley's chief U.S. economist, Richard Berner, went
further Friday, saying he expects the Fed to slash its so-called
federal funds rate target by a half-point on Tuesday, to 1.25%.</TE>
<TE>   That would cut banks' prime lending rate from 4.75% to 4.25%,
because most banks peg that rate three percentage points above the
federal funds rate. If the prime falls, many firms and consumers
would see borrowing costs decline.</TE>
<TE>   A drop in the Fed's rate also would push rock-bottom yields on
money market accounts even lower, potentially driving some of that
cash into the stock market in search of better returns.</TE>
<TE>   Yet most Fed watchers see no chance of a Fed cut this week, or
even this year, barring a deep slump in economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Reuters poll of 22 big Treasury bond dealers found that
17 expect no change in rates through the end of 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Most bond dealers aren't even optimistic about the chance that the
Fed could take a halfway step on Tuesday. That step would be for
Chairman Alan Greenspan and cohorts to change their rate "bias" from
neutral to one that suggests the economy could be weakening enough to
justify future rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of bond dealers expect the Fed to maintain its
neutral stance, according to a Bloomberg News survey.</TE>
<TE>   Ethan Harris, co-chief economist at Lehman Bros. in New York,
believes that the majority is wrong. He expects the Fed to change its
bias Tuesday to allow for rate cuts this fall, and then sees
Greenspan following through with a quarter-point cut at the next
policy meeting on Sept. 24.</TE>
<TE>   "Once they move into action they want to be decisive," Harris
said. He expects the Fed's key rate to fall to 1% by year's end, in a
succession of reductions.</TE>
<TE>   A big question is whether the stock market's rally since July 23
has rested heavily on an assumption of still-lower interest rates. If
so, and the Fed balks, it risks triggering another stock sell-off,
some experts warn.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unlikely the Fed will risk disappointing the markets, with
sentiment being as fragile and volatile as it is," investment firm
Bridgewater Associates said in a note to clients Friday. "With the
stock market showing some signs of stability in the last few days, a
significant jolt of liquidity from the Fed could be what finally
turns the tide."</TE>
<TE>   Bridgewater expects the Fed to cut rates at least a quarter-point
on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the Fed holds steady, the stock market could be buoyed, at
least temporarily, if the Wednesday deadline for corporate financial
certifications passes without significant incident, some say.</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, the majority of chief executives at the largest U.S.
companies still hadn't filed the required statements with the
Securities and Exchange Commission affirming that their companies'
recent financial results are accurate.</TE>
<TE>   Most firms are expected to file the statements Tuesday or
Wednesday. The deadline is 2 p.m. PDT on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Telecom firm WorldCom Inc., which has filed for bankruptcy
protection, on Thursday gave investors a sobering reminder that the
extent of the accounting scandals at U.S. companies may not yet have
been fully revealed. WorldCom said it uncovered an additional $3.3
billion in accounting errors, bringing the total to more than $7
billion.</TE>
<TE>   But on Friday, Wall Street reacted with a shrug: The S&amp;P 500 index
and the Dow Jones industrials eked out modest gains.</TE>
<TE>   Many investors have been expecting some major companies to restate
their earnings before Wednesday, to clear the books of questionable
accounting so CEOs can certify the results without the threat of
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   If restatements aren't announced, however, a "relief" rally could
follow on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Because investors have been expecting bad news related to the
certifications, "If we don't get that bad news, it ought to be a
homerun" for stocks, said Tom Sowanick, senior fixed-income research
chief at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>

<HD>Interpretation of Law Could Lead to Ban on Range of
Executive Perks</HD>
<DH>Reform: Broad wording in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that bars
loans to top brass may have unintended effects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Top executives at public companies soon may not be able to use
company credit cards, get as much life insurance or exercise stock
options in the way they're accustomed to--all possible consequences
of the sweeping corporate reform bill recently passed by Congress.</LD>
<LD>   When Congress swiftly passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act late last
month to crack down on executives and accountants who knowingly
falsify company financial statements, legislators didn't appear to be
aiming at some of these ancillary issues, industry experts say. But
due to broad wording in the bill that bars all loans to officers and
directors of public companies, life in the executive suite could
change in myriad ways.</LD>
<LD>   Whether those changes will lead to a more far-reaching
restructuring of how executives are paid is an open question.</LD>
<TE>   "Many of the provisions in the law require the Securities and
Exchange Commission to issue regulations, so people are reluctant to
say whether some of these things are certain," said Edward Rhyne, a
partner in the Houston law firm Gardere Wynne Sewell. "But executives
who are in high demand may want more cash compensation upfront
because they are not going to be able to get the perks that they had
in the past."</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time congressional efforts to rein in
executive pay have yielded what may be unintended consequences, said
Diane Doubleday, principal at Mercer Human Resource Consulting in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   When corporate takeovers were sweeping the country in the early
1980s and executives were getting paid millions as they were forced
out in the wake of mergers, Congress acted to put a lid on so-called
golden parachutes, Doubleday said.</TE>
<TE>   The law created penalties for severance packages that exceeded
three years of an executive's pay. But instead of creating a hurdle,
the law built a standard, she said. Now, companies commonly pay out
three years' salary and bonus when executives leave after a
merger--some pay even more and simply accept the penalties.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened when legislators, incensed by the rapid
rise in chief executive salaries, tried to pare the number of
seven-figure salaries by banning tax deductions for pay exceeding $1
million, unless the pay was "performance-based." Companies used the
$1 million as a floor for CEO salaries and heaped incentive
compensation on top of it, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, attorneys and consultants are speculating about how the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act will affect everything from company-paid life
insurance policies to stock option grants for the fortunate few who
work in top-level positions at public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Life Insurance Plans Could Be Affected</TE>
<TE>   Congress intended to stop companies from using company funds to
make huge loans to top executives, which clearly is an inappropriate
use of corporate assets, Doubleday said.</TE>
<TE>   The broad ban on loans, however, also appears to apply to
so-called split dollar life insurance arrangements. Companies pay the
premiums on these policies, calling the payment a loan because the
executive's heirs are contractually obligated to pay back the
premiums from the proceeds of the death benefit when the executive
dies.</TE>
<TE>   Certain types of executive signing bonuses also may be outlawed,
Doubleday said. Why? Some require repayment if the executive quits
within a set period, and that could be interpreted as a loan under
the new law.</TE>
<TE>   Relocation loans for the top five officers of a company also could
be out. And unless a company was in the business of issuing credit,
it couldn't even give its top officers a credit card, Rhyne said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, so-called cashless exercise programs for stock
options might be viewed as short-term loans, banned under the law,
experts contend. In these cases, when an executive exercises stock
options by buying and then quickly selling shares of his company's
stock, the company often will transfer the shares to a broker before
it receives payment for the stock from the executive. Under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, this transaction could be considered a short-term
loan.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear whether Congress intended to take away these other
perks when it slapped a ban on company loans to corporate bigwigs,
but such a result wouldn't be unwelcome by corporate governance
critics who have been complaining about the lavish compensation
packages bestowed on many American executives.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, these results are speculative because
securities regulators are charged with interpreting the muddier
aspects of the law.</TE>
<TE>   "Where there is a fuzziness, the SEC is going to have to clarify
it," said Frank Torres, legislative counsel at Consumers Union in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident that where it's not so much a question of
corporate shenanigans versus a reasonable way to treat executives,
the regulations will resolve it."</TE>

<HD>Group to Ask U.S. for a National Tourism Body</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tourism industry leaders plan to ask for a national organization to
sell the United States as a destination to international travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Travel Industry Assn. President and Chief Executive William Norman
plans to argue in a speech today that a national marketing
corporation would go a long way toward restoring the weak
international market that has slowed the U.S. tourism industry's
recovery, according to an advance copy of the speech.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. is the only major industrialized nation in the world
whose government doesn't directly spend money on marketing tourism
abroad.</LD>
<TE>   Leaders of the nation's $546-billion tourism industry plan to ask
Congress this fall to create a national tourism marketing
corporation, according to Norman. International travel to the U.S. is
a $103-billion market annually.</TE>
<TE>   International travelers are seen by many as the key to growth for
the U.S. tourism industry because the domestic market is considered
mature. International travelers also spend more money and have more
time to spend on vacation than do their American counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Popular tourist destinations, such as Orlando and Las Vegas, must
rely on their own campaigns and the efforts of state tourism offices
to market to international travelers. A national organization would
let U.S. destinations compete in international markets they
ordinarily wouldn't be able to reach on their own, according to
Norman.</TE>
<TE>   The tourism slowdown after the Sept. 11 attacks worsened what
already had been softening tourism demand last year. The travel
industry is recovering slowly, but the international and business
travel segments have been the weakest areas, according to the Travel
Industry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   International airplane passenger traffic to the U.S. is down 12%
for the year and international arrivals to the U.S. declined by 11%
last year. Pleasure travel in the U.S. this summer, though, was
expected to increase by 2% over last summer.</TE>

<HD>Slight Gains Expected in Spending, Construction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Economic reports this week on monthly consumer spending and home
building are expected to show slight gains.</LD>
<LD>   That may lead Federal Reserve policymakers to say the economy
hasn't weakened enough to warrant a 12th reduction in interest rates
when they meet Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Retail sales probably rose 1.2% in July, the third gain in four
months, according to the median of 47 forecasts in a Bloomberg News
survey. New home construction probably increased 0.4%, the survey
showed. The retail sales statistics will be released by the Commerce
Department on Tuesday and the housing figures Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Consumer spending accounts for more than two-thirds of the
economy, and consumers have been taking advantage of interest-free
loans on purchases of new cars made by General Motors Corp. and other
auto makers, aided by Fed rate cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a report Thursday from the Fed probably will show that
industrial production was unchanged in July, after output at the
nation's factories, mines and utilities surged 0.8% in June. July
would be the weakest month this year.</TE>
<TE>   Other reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the Commerce Department is expected to report that
business inventories rose 0.1% in June following a 0.2% increase in
May.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, the Philadelphia Fed's index of manufacturing business
in the region probably rose to 7.8 in August after slumping to 6.6 a
month earlier, which was the lowest reading this year. Still, the
index has been above zero, the dividing line between growth and
contraction, since January.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, the University of Michigan is expected to report that
its preliminary consumer sentiment index for this month increased to
89 from 88.1 in July.</TE>

<HD>Curtain May Fall on AOL-AT&amp;T Venture</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc.'s new management team could unwind the
beleaguered media giant's complex entertainment venture with AT&amp;T
Corp. as early as this week, in the process taking a big step toward
building its high-speed Internet strategy.</LD>
<LD>   Sources familiar with the situation said the most probable
resolution calls for AOL Time Warner to offer up to $2 billion in
cash, some AOL stock and about a 20% stake in a publicly traded cable
TV business for the stake in Time Warner Entertainment, held by AT&amp;T
and Comcast Corp., which agreed this year to purchase AT&amp;T's cable
operations.</LD>
<LD>   Such a deal would give AOL Time Warner full control of HBO and
Warner Bros. Studios and access to offer AOL high-speed Internet
service on AT&amp;T and Comcast cable systems, the nation's largest,
sources added.</LD>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner then could sell some small assets to alleviate its
debt load, said industry insiders, who also look for the company to
replace more managers at its AOL unit now that a new chief has been
named for that business.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner has seen its stock price drop 70% this year amid
slower growth, federal probes of its America Online division and an
unclear strategy of how to add high-speed Internet customers.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner closed at $11.05 on Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Stem Cell Researchers Cite Numerous Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Science: Many say politics, patents, poor condition of some
specimens and a lack of funding are hindering their ability to
conduct experiments.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL ELIAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>A year after President Bush restricted federal funding for human
embryonic stem cell research to a select number of existing cell
lines, leading scientists say the field is hampered by political,
financial and scientific chaos.</LD>
<LD>   An overwhelming majority of the stem cells the Bush administration
approved are in poor condition and useless for research, they
complain.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, a lack of funds, a charged political climate and
intellectual-property disputes are slowing progress in a field
scientists believe is vital to more effectively treating--and even
curing--a wide range of diseases.</LD>
<TE>   "It really is a mess," said Stanford University Medical School
professor Paul Berg, a Nobel laureate and one of the first
high-profile critics of the administration's policy. "There are so
many things that have to happen to make this work."</TE>
<TE>   Chief among the complaints is the relative lack of money devoted
to such research. Most of it comes from small, private foundations
backed by ailing actors--including the Christopher Reeve Paralysis
Foundation and the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's
Research--along with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Those three foundations have committed a total of $6 million to
human embryonic stem cell researchers, and last week Intel Corp.
Chairman Andy Grove announced a $5-million challenge grant to fund
research at UC San Francisco. By comparison, the federal National
Institutes of Health has pledged just $3.5 million to stem cell
research.</TE>
<TE>   The NIH said it can't be blamed entirely for the funding drought.
It began offering grants for stem cell research in November, but
researchers have been slow to apply, said Wendy Baldwin, who helps
manage the NIH's stem cell program.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here and ready to fund," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even large foundations, such as the American Heart Assn. and the
American Cancer Society, have shied away from this political hot
potato. Both have declined to fund stem cell research.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Bonow, president of the AHA, said debate continues
inside the organization among doctors, researchers and patients. One
concern is that the group could lose donors who are opposed to such
research.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a controversial area," Bonow said. "It certainly is an
issue."</TE>
<TE>   Scientists hope to someday manipulate stem cells to grow into all
kinds of adult cells. That could lead to cures for a host of
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   But many antiabortion activists equate the science with murder. To
harvest embryonic stem cells, 5-day-old embryos must be destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure from political conservatives preceded Bush's announcement
a year ago that the government would fund only research conducted on
existing stem-cell lines. Federally funded scientists are restricted
to working with 78 stem cell lines controlled by 14 NIH-approved
labs.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of cell lines available for research," Health and
Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson said in June at a
biotechnology conference in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   But researchers have long argued that stronger federal support is
necessary to nurture nascent fields so they can grow to produce
useful science. Companies are loath to invest in such research
because the payoffs are far from guaranteed--and are years away.</TE>
<TE>   "Very few breakthroughs have come from the business sector," Berg
said. "They come from the academic community, which relies on federal
funds."</TE>
<TE>   The one U.S. company heavily invested in stem cells, Geron Corp.,
is struggling. In June, the Menlo Park-based company laid off 43
employees--30% of its work force--and its stock is trading in the $4
range, near its 52-week low. It closed Friday at $4.38, down 16 cents
on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the NIH-listed suppliers are shipping stem cells--from
just three lines--to other researchers. Cells from most of the other
lines aren't in good enough shape to ship and thrive in other labs,
researchers say.</TE>
<TE>   A few other cell lines are hindered by intellectual-property
issues because of two powerful patents held by the University of
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   University researcher James Thomson won a worldwide scientific
race to isolate human embryonic stem cells in 1998. The resulting
patents give the university commercial control of most research
related to stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Wisconsin has five stem cell lines but is
shipping cells from just one of them to a total of 57 researchers.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman said two more of the lines will be in good enough
shape within two weeks and all of its lines should be available to
ship by February.</TE>
<TE>   The university has intellectual-property agreements with
researchers at 78 institutions in 12 countries. Nearly all have
agreed not to commercialize any of their work, leaving that financial
plum to the aggressive patent office at the university.</TE>
<TE>   It claims all U.S. commercial rights to the research and demands
that anyone seeking to profit from stem cells first obtain a license
from its patent office.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the few companies with their own stem-cell lines,
such as BresaGen Ltd. of Australia, can't provide cells to nonprofit
researchers without paying the University of Wisconsin first. This
hinders research, scientists say.</TE>
<TE>   BresaGen has balked at those terms, but the university denies
slowing any research.</TE>
<TE>   In a first for a university, it is opening a satellite patent
office in San Diego in hopes of striking more commercial deals in
California's burgeoning biotechnology community.</TE>
<TE>   "Lines are available for research," said Andrew Cohn, a spokesman
for the University of Wisconsin's technology transfer office. "All
anyone has to do is call us."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A unit of Sony Corp. is going to court in the Netherlands this week
over claims that it wrongfully used the trademarks of three top Dutch
professional soccer clubs in one of its video games.</LD>
<LD>   Dutch clubs Ajax, PSV and Feyenoord allege that Sony Computer
Entertainment Europe, the division that publishes the games,
wrongfully incorporated the teams' trademarks in the game "This Is
Football 2002," said attorney Sven Klos.</LD>
<LD>   The clubs are asking a Dutch court to order SCEE to immediately
suspend sales of the game and to halt the launch of the 2003 version,
due out this fall.</LD>
<TE>   A representative for SCEE in London declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The practice of securing licensing arrangements with professional
sports clubs and leagues has become a cutthroat business over the
last decade, with game makers vying for long-term deals with top
teams.</TE>

<BD>From a Times staff writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Advocates of open-source software are planning to unveil a
legislative proposal this week that would prevent the state of
California from buying software from Microsoft Corp., according to
CNet.</LD>
<LD>   The Digital Software Security Act would prohibit state agencies
from buying software from companies, such as Microsoft, that restrict
access to their source codes and have restrictive licensing policies.</LD>
<LD>   State agencies also would be allowed to "make and distribute
copies of the software" if the proposal is enacted as written.</LD>
<TE>   "For software to be acceptable to the state, it is not enough that
it is technically capable of fulfilling a task, but that the
contractual condition for purchase and/or licensing must satisfy a
series of requirements regarding the license," the proposal states.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters plan to march Thursday in San Francisco to highlight
their view that open-source software such as Linux can play an
important role in discouraging abuses by proprietary software
companies, including Microsoft.</TE>

<LD>An inmate impersonating Hollywood executives from a jail telephone
duped Nextel Communications Inc. out of more than 1,000 cell phones
for fake movie shoots, prosecutors in White Plains, N.Y., said last

<LD>   James Sabatino, 25, was charged in federal court with making
interstate phone calls from the Westchester County Jail to defraud
the cell phone company of more than $1 million.</LD>

phones, which were sent to various locations, including a Federal
Express pickup facility in Manhattan.</LD>
<TE>   Sabatino's lawyer, Joseph Vita, declined to comment.</TE>

close attention to the voices that represent them to callers. Generic
voices still abound in corporate America's phone systems. But some
firms spend tens of thousands of dollars designing custom voices to
solve the difficult problem of conveying a brand image through sound
alone.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the team behind Yahoo's fictitious Jenni wrote a
five-page biography that included her career as a high school soccer
player and her stint playing guitar in an all-girl band. Their aim
was to create a voice that sounded innovative and fun to hang out
with, with the hope that callers would associate those qualities with
Yahoo.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand where she comes from," said Deborah Ben-Eliezer, the
voice actor whose words are mixed and matched to create the McDermott
who "talks" to callers. "It affects how I stand in the recording
booth and the dialect I use."</TE>
<TE>   The driving force behind this transition to brand-specific voices
is the increased accuracy of speech-recognition systems. Computers
can understand spoken words, even if the speaker has a thick accent
or a cold, or is talking on a cell phone while driving on the freeway
with the windows rolled down.</TE>
<TE>   But when people speak into their phones, they expect to hear a
person talking back--not some harsh synthesized voice. That's what
prompted Yahoo to craft a specialized voice for its Yahoo by Phone
service.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a conversation, and in a conversation the persona is
much more amplified," said Madhu Yarlagadda, general manager of Yahoo
Everywhere, the mobile access initiative that includes Yahoo by
Phone. "The moment you start talking to somebody, you get a picture
in your head. You start putting a personality to the person."</TE>
<TE>   And that personality will be associated with the company--at least
in the customer's mind.</TE>
<TE>   "When a customer calls a customer service agent, whatever that
person is like brands the company," said Lynda Kate Smith, chief
marketing officer for Nuance Communications Inc., the Menlo Park
company that created Jenni McDermott's voice. "If you get a British
accent versus someone who woke up with a headache and has to get home
to fix dinner for the kids, you get a totally different perception of
the company."</TE>
<TE>   It's a far cry from the 1939 World's Fair in New York, where AT&amp;T
Corp. demonstrated the first machine that used computers to blend
prerecorded sounds into words. The Voder, as it was called, was more
of a novelty item than a useful device.</TE>
<TE>   "Operators had to be trained for months on how to spell
phonetically and hit keys on the device that prompted it to speak,"
said Michael Dickman, a spokesman for AT&amp;T Labs.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers kept at it. Half a century later, the technology was
good enough to let brokerage clients dial up the latest stock quotes
over the phone. All they had to do was spell out a ticker symbol
using the phone's touch-tone keypad, and a computer would read the
price for the desired stock. The voice sounded far from human, but
brokers and their clients came to rely on the technology because it
saved time and money.</TE>
<TE>   Now, all sorts of tasks that used to be performed by armies of
customer service agents are handled by automated phone systems, said
Dan Hawkins, managing analyst at New York market research firm
Datamonitor.</TE>
<TE>   "About two-thirds of call center costs are taken up by agent
salaries and training," Hawkins said. "Anything you can automate can
save companies money."</TE>
<TE>   Companies are expected to spend $700 million this year on
automated phone systems, according to Kelsey Group Inc., a market
research firm based in Princeton, N.J. About $50 million of that is
earmarked for the text-to-speech applications that put voices--such
as Yahoo's Jenni McDermott--on the line.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, automated systems will do more than merely replace humans,
said Mark Plakias, senior vice president at Kelsey Group.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking at new applications that it just doesn't make sense
for a live agent to do," he said. "I'm not going to have an operator
call all the people on Flight 85 to say that the flight's been
delayed. But with automation, I can do that."</TE>
<TE>   For now, the cutting edge is occupied by characters such as Jenni
McDermott. Yahoo customers will never hear Jenni discuss her dogs,
her artistic hobbies or any other facet of her elaborate personality.
But those details are critical in allowing Ben-Eliezer to strike the
exact tone that embodies Yahoo's brand.</TE>
<TE>   To get to that point, Yarlagadda's team gave Nuance a list of
characteristics--including efficiency and youthfulness--they wanted
to hear in the Yahoo by Phone voice. Nuance used the list to create
more than 10 sample personalities. Yahoo tested them with its users,
who described Jenni as "innovative" and "fun to hang out with."
That's when the company knew it had its voice, Yarlagadda said.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ben-Eliezer went to work, recording thousands of phrases such
as "Got it," "What can I get you?" and "Is that right?" For Yahoo's
weather function, she recited the names of 1,500 cities. When she
records, she adopts Jenni's imagined mannerisms, holding one hand on
her hip, shrugging her shoulders up and down and bouncing her head
slightly as she talks.</TE>
<TE>   Jenni made her debut in February. The result is a system that
sounds more lifelike--and more Yahoo--than even Yarlagadda expected.
Jenni's personal touch came through on a day when his e-mail inbox
happened to be particularly full.</TE>
<TE>   "I got, 'Oh, you're very popular,' " Yarlagadda said. "And I
thought, 'Oh, am I popular?' These are the little things that make a
lot of difference."</TE>
<TE>   It may seem like a lot of trouble to go to for a disembodied
voice. But people easily pick up on voices that sound false or
insincere, said Stanford University professor Clifford Nass,
co-director of the school's Social Responses to Communications
Technologies Project.</TE>
<TE>   In one of Nass' studies, a computer read news stories in both
happy and sad voices. Listeners found "a total loss of credibility"
when the happy voice read a sad story and vice versa, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The human brain is built for speech," Nass said. "We're built to
detect personality and emotion."</TE>
<TE>   All kinds of subtle clues help listeners discern the personality
behind a voice, and none of them should be taken for granted, said
Steve Chambers, chief marketing officer for Boston-based SpeechWorks,
which also designs custom voices for automated systems.</TE>
<TE>   Among the details he considers are "the phrasing of the questions,
the intonations, the speed of the questions, the navigation--how you
get from one place to another--and the grace with which the system
recovers if it makes a mistake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   When Wells Fargo executives decided to revamp the automated phone
system for the bank's credit card customers, they thought they could
evoke their Western-themed brand by adding sound effects such as
horse hoofs and stagecoach wheels. But unimpressed customers said
they would rather talk to a banker than to a cowboy, said Tom
LaCentra, director of customer service for Wells Fargo Card Services
in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The company took that advice to heart and designed a new voice
based on a Nuance character named Reed Johnston. Originally conceived
as a surfer dude with a literary side, Nuance aged Reed slightly,
took him out of the surf culture and put him on a golf course so that
he was more in keeping with the bank's corporate image.</TE>
<TE>   "The voice is trustworthy," LaCentra said.</TE>
<TE>   All that attention to detail makes the voices--and the companies
they represent--seem human.</TE>
<TE>   "People are intelligent," said Ben-Eliezer, the voice of Jenni
McDermott. "They know ultimately they're talking to something
automated. But I want them to be comfortable enough that they'll
vocalize rather than push buttons."</TE>

<HD>G. Bushnell, 77; Vocal ABA Leader</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George E. Bushnell Jr., a former president of the American Bar Assn.
whose polished pedigree belied a wickedly blunt take on drugs, race
relations and the law, died of kidney failure Wednesday at a hospital
in Grosse Pointe, Mich. He was 77.</LD>
<LD>   Bushnell, the son of a Michigan Supreme Court chief justice, held
leadership posts in the ABA, the largest voluntary legal association
in the country, and was its president in 1994 and 1995.</LD>
<LD>   Outwardly conservative in appearance, well-tailored, with soft
white hair, Bushnell could voice surprising opinions, including heavy
criticism of lawmakers and calls for the legalization of all drugs.
In a Washington Post profile, a colleague described him as a "liberal
curmudgeon."</LD>
<TE>   Bushnell's comments were peppered with borderline obscenities, and
he took the unusual tack of granting an interview to Rolling Stone
magazine to disclose his personal views about drug laws. He said
federally regulating marijuana and crack cocaine would reduce profits
for street sellers and crime by users.</TE>
<TE>   One member of the ABA governing board said Bushnell's drug
statements were "damaging the credibility of lawyers." Bushnell said
that he was largely unconcerned with the image of the profession and
that lawyers should stand "at the forefront of social change."</TE>
<TE>   Several members of the House of Representatives called for his
resignation over Bushnell's vulgar characterization of those opposed
to federal funding of the Legal Services Corp., which aids the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such polarizing remarks, he often worked the machinery of
the ABA to find consensus on issues such as broadening gun-control
laws. Colleagues said he seldom took credit for his successes,
preferring to recognize others or to credit the larger debate for
change.</TE>
<TE>   After his ABA term ended, Bushnell returned to his native Detroit
to practice law. He remained active in the ABA House of Delegates,
the organization's policy-making body, and continued to speak out
when he felt that his peers were being deferential to political
correctness.</TE>
<TE>   George Edward Bushnell was a 1948 graduate of Amherst College and
a 1951 graduate of the University of Michigan law school. He served
in the Army during World War II and saw combat in the Korean War. He
was a senior partner in the Detroit law firm of Miller, Canfield,
Paddock and Stone before starting his own firm in 1977. At his death,
Bushnell was counsel to Roy, Shecter &amp; Vocht in the Detroit suburb of
Bloomfield Hills.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, he was a board member of the Detroit chapter of the
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and helped start
an urban coalition to rebuild the city after race riots.</TE>
<TE>   He also was a former president of the National Conference of Bar
Presidents and the Assn. of Trial Attorneys of America.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include three children and eight grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Kristen Nygaard, 75; Computer Pioneer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OSLO</DL>
<LD>Kristen Nygaard, a pioneer in developing the computer programming
language that laid the foundation for Java, C++ and others that
fueled development of the Internet, has died. He was 75.</LD>
<LD>   Nygaard died Saturday after suffering a heart attack in the
Norwegian capital, according to media reports.</LD>
<LD>   The University of Oslo professor was acclaimed internationally for
his work in developing the programming language Simula, which formed
the basis for MS-DOS and the Internet.</LD>
<TE>   He and his colleague Ole-Johan Dahl, who died in June, were
presented the 2001 A.M. Turing Award and other prizes for their role
in the invention of object-oriented programming at the Norwegian
Computing Center from 1961 to 1967.</TE>
<TE>   The Assn. for Computing Machinery, which awarded the prize, said
the work had paved the way for the widely used programming languages
Java, C++ and others used in personal computers and home
entertainment devices.</TE>
<TE>   The first models of Simula--an abbreviation for simulation
language--were for calculators.</TE>
<TE>   Later editions of Simula became the basis for icon-based
programming language.</TE>
<TE>   Nygaard also helped spearhead the successful campaign against
Norway's membership in the 15-nation EU.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that work involved holding together a highly divergent
group of opponents, including conservative farmers and leftist trade
unionists.</TE>
<TE>   Friends and political foes alike gave him credit for the EU
opponents' victory in an October 1994 referendum in which Norwegians
voted 53% to 47% against membership.</TE>

Consultant</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Barnes, 42, one of San Francisco's most influential gay
political consultants, died Friday at California Pacific Medical
Center in San Francisco. The cause of death was complications from
Guillain-Barre syndrome, a neurological disease similar to multiple
sclerosis.</LD>
<LD>   The son of a machinist and labor activist, Barnes founded one of
the nation's first teenage gay clubs when he was a student at his
native San Francisco's Lowell High School. He also helped organize
student opposition to an initiative that would have banned gay
teachers in state schools.</LD>
<LD>   After unsuccessful attempts to win his own seat on the city's
Board of Education in the early 1980s, Barnes turned his attention to
working behind the political scenes. He has since been credited with
helping win seats for more gay and lesbian candidates than any other
political consultant in the country.</LD>

<HD>Betty Bethards, 68; Dream Interpreter, Meditation Teacher</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Betty Bethards, 68, called the "common sense guru" for her teaching
of dream interpretation and meditation methods, died July 30 in
Petaluma, Calif., of a stroke.</LD>
<LD>   Bethards embarked on her unusual career after having a near-death
experience when she was the 32-year-old mother of four.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, she wrote a book, "There Is No Death," to comfort the
ill and bereaved. She also founded the Inner Light Foundation,
promoting development of individual spirituality.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than promoting herself as a leader, she tried to teach
others to develop their own spiritual potential. Among her nine books
were "Be Your Own Guru," "Techniques for Health and Wholeness" and
"Seven Steps to Developing Your Intuitive Powers."</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, Bethards published one of her most popular books, "The

<HD>John Zimmerman, 74; Noted Photographer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John G. Zimmerman, a photographer who broke ground in sports
photojournalism with innovative techniques as a staff member of a
then-fledgling publication called Sports Illustrated, has died. He
was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Zimmerman, a native of Los Angeles, died Aug. 3 of complications
from lymphoma in Pebble Beach, where he had lived since the early
1990s.</LD>
<LD>   Considered a wizard with specialty cameras, camera angles, strobe
lighting and shutter design, Zimmerman was among the first to put a
remote-controlled camera inside a hockey net to show the fierce
action around the goal, behind a basketball net to show the intensity
of Wilt Chamberlin and underwater to catch the power and grace of
great divers and swimmers. While these techniques may seem familiar
today in the world of television minicams and constant sports
coverage, they were new and exciting when Zimmerman perfected them
more than 40 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   But Zimmerman was more than just a technical genius. He was an
excellent sports action and portrait photographer. Over the years, he
shot 107 covers for the magazine, including action shots, portraiture
of stars like Dodger pitcher Sandy Koufax and several swimsuit
issues, working with models Christie Brinkley, Elle MacPherson and
Carol Alt.</TE>
<TE>   "He basically was the godfather of sports photography at Sports
Illustrated," said Steve Fine, the current director of photography at
the magazine. "He took shots from angles that had never been seen and
pioneered techniques that had never been used--including slow shutter
speeds, blurs--and produced interesting studies of motion."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pacoima, Zimmerman was the son of a gaffer at MGM who
began teaching his son photography at an early age.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman attended Fremont High School and came under the tutelage
of C.A. Bach, whose three-year photography course was considered one
of the best vocational programs in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Other Fremont alums would recall that Bach worked like a photo
editor, sending his students out on assignments that included
everything from police calls to fashion shoots. Photographs by Bach's
students were picked up by wire services and appeared in national
magazines like Life.</TE>
<TE>   Several of his students went on to make names for themselves as
photographers for some of the leading magazines in the country. Those
names would include John Dominis, Hank Walker and Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman served in the Navy during World War II. After the war,
he was eventually hired as a lab technician at the Time-Life office
in Washington. He was later given photographic assignments and was a
working photographer when he was hired by Sports Illustrated in 1956,
one of just two staff photographers.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1950s and '60s, sports photography was a cutthroat
business," said documentary filmmaker Neil Leifer, also a well-known
photographer who worked with Zimmerman at Sports Illustrated. "John
Zimmerman was the biggest star and the biggest exception to the rule.
He was always available with advice. I don't know if there was a
greater all-around photographer."</TE>
<TE>   One of Zimmerman's memorable photographs was taken in 1980 for
Sports Illustrated, which reprinted it this week along with several
pages of Zimmerman's other photographs in a tribute. It shows diver
Jenni Chandler completing her dive and swimming submerged toward the
camera. To accomplish this, Zimmerman used a partially submerged
camera, fired four strobes during her dive while leaving the shutter
open, then refocused after her entry and fired another strobe for the
underwater image.</TE>
<TE>   Zimmerman left the Sports Illustrated staff in the early 1960s to
pursue his photography career as a freelance shooter. He covered 10
Olympic Games for Time, Life and Sports Illustrated. His work also
showed up in the Saturday Evening Post, and he built a lucrative
commercial business with clients that included Ford Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   He continued to contribute frequently to Sports Illustrated into
the 1980s. He retired from photography in 1992 when he moved to the
Monterey Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife, Delores; three children, Darryl, Greg
and Linda; a sister Molly Bishop and a brother Ed Zimmerman.</TE>
<TE>   In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations be made to
the American Cancer Society.</TE>

<LD>   Colombian President Alvaro Uribe declared a state of emergency
early today to fight what the government described as a "regime of
terror" after a surge of violence.</LD>
<TE>   Uribe also decreed an emergency tax to raise $778.5 million to
fund a military buildup. Interior and Justice Minister Fernando
Londono announced the state of emergency at a news conference in the
capital, Bogota, but did not say what it would entail.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia is gripped by a 38-year-old war that pits leftist rebels
against outlawed paramilitary fighters and the military. About 100
people have been killed since Uribe took office Wednesday.</TE>

<LD>   Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, whom a Turkish court had
sentenced to hang, praised Turkey's recent elimination of the death
penalty and called on Kurds and Turks to live together as brothers,
an Italian paper reported.</LD>
<TE>   Prison authorities allowed La Repubblica to put questions to
Ocalan in writing. He called the elimination of the death penalty
"the most important decision in the history of the Turkish Republic,"
the paper said, and he hailed reforms allowing wider use of the
Kurdish language.</TE>
<TE>   "Turks and Kurds must live together like a brotherly people," he
said. "Now an important task awaits the Kurds. They must not
underestimate what's been done."</TE>
<TE>   Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason in 1999.</TE>

<LD>   President Saparmurad A. Niyazov will largely empty Turkmenistan's
prison cells by Dec. 1, granting amnesty to almost all of the former
Soviet republic's 17,000 prisoners, an official said.</LD>
<TE>   Only prisoners who have committed crimes against the state, been
convicted of premeditated murder or are repeat offenders will remain
behind bars, a Justice Ministry official said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Niyazov has resisted moves toward democracy and economic
reforms, he has favored grand gestures of mercy. Since 1992, Niyazov
has announced 24 amnesties, freeing 112,000 people, the ministry
said.</TE>

<HD>Mayor's Circus in Exalted Square Causes an Uproar in Mexico
City</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Critics say the free show is a campaign
event and robs Zocalo of its dignity. But while putting it down,
people keep lining up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>In the vast plaza known as the Zocalo, at the center of this madhouse
megalopolis, you can now hear the roar of tigers along with the bells
of a 16th century Roman Catholic cathedral.</LD>
<LD>   A lot goes on at once in the square, and little escapes notice. A
throbbing kaleidoscope of activity, the Zocalo is often held up by
pundits as a mirror of Mexico's character, a snapshot of the national
condition.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose office
overlooks a corner of the square, added a tall blue-and-white tent to
the mix. He surrendered part of the Zocalo, for the first time in its
nearly five centuries of existence, to a circus.</LD>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of Mexicans have lined up for free, twice-daily
performances since the Vazquez Brothers Circus opened Aug. 4 for a
10-day run. But the main event--featuring two tigers and a giraffe,
plus a lineup of clowns, acrobats and jugglers--has spun off a
sideshow of political controversy, putting the popular 48-year-old
mayor on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition members of the City Council have been unable to resist
comparing Lopez Obrador, an undeclared candidate for Mexico's 2006
presidential race, to the Roman emperors who wooed the masses with
"bread and circuses."</TE>
<TE>   Other critics say he is offending the dignity of Mexico City's
already crumbling historic district with a banal spectacle and a row
of portable toilets. Opposition lawmakers have filed complaints
accusing the mayor of violating statutes against outdoor commerce in
the Zocalo, animal spectacles in a public thoroughfare and use of
public funds for political campaigning.</TE>
<TE>   "He is trying to turn the country, along with its cultural
symbols, into a circus," said Homero Aridjis, a prominent Mexican
environmental activist. "The Zocalo is not only the historic center
of our city, it's the brain and heart of Mexican culture."</TE>
<TE>   Because the mayor hails from the Gulf state of Tabasco, Aridjis
added, "perhaps he does not understand this."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez Obrador, whose approval rating stands at 64%, points out
that Paris stages a popular circus every two years at the foot of the
Eiffel Tower. He has offered to move the Big Top if its location in
the Zocalo is ruled illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he is urging his critics to lighten up.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember, when I was a boy, when the circus used to come to my
town," he told reporters. "You've got to look at life from a
different point of view. Life is happiness. You've got to have a
sense of humor, of fun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better than a political circus," he added. "It's a circus
that's entertaining children and families."</TE>
<TE>   Voting with their feet, Mexicans have been lining up for hours at
a time for circus tickets, even though some said they agree with the
mayor's critics.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, I don't like the idea of a circus in the Zocalo,"
said Carmen Martinez, 37, who brought her 2-year-old daughter. "It's
ugly. That tent looks out of place here. But the truth is, it's a
good opportunity for those with little money to enjoy a summer day.
It's well worth the wait."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico City's 18 million people have enough woes--kidnapping,
pollution, traffic--that cry out for escape. The city endured a
subway strike Thursday that affected hundreds of thousands of
commuters and is torn by controversy over the mayor's $900-million
plan, to be put before voters next month, to add an upper deck above
18 miles of roadways.</TE>
<TE>   In the Zocalo--a 14-acre expanse of stone paving surrounded by the
cathedral, the National Palace and city government
buildings--homeless, landless and jobless people held more than half
a dozen mini-demonstrations at once Friday, seeking various redresses
from City Hall. Each group had its own microphone.</TE>
<TE>   The cacophony canceled out the individual demands and faded into
the buzz of excitement among those lined up outside the Vazquez
Brothers' four-story-high tent.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, the circus is a distraction," said Pedro Juarneros, 46, a
street sweeper who traveled for two hours with his wife and two small
children from their home on the edge of the capital. "The mayor is
putting on a circus so people don't worry about the lack of jobs,
decent schools and transportation. He should be spending the money on
these problems instead."</TE>
<TE>   Then Juarneros turned to a circus official who was passing by and
demanded to know why there were no more free tickets for the
evening's performance.</TE>
<TE>   The official, Omar Cruz Acosta, explained that tickets were being
given away at a city office several miles from the Zocalo. There,
people learned, half the 1,700 tickets handed out for each
performance were reserved for city employees, who owe their jobs to
Lopez Obrador's left-leaning Democratic Revolution Party.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican President Vicente Fox's conservative National Action Party
has called for an investigation into the circus, calling it a
campaign event to help the mayor's party in next year's midterm
congressional elections. City Hall says it has spent $10,000 to
defray the Vazquez Brothers' costs.</TE>
<TE>   The electoral fortunes of Lopez Obrador and his party will depend
on more than entertainment. The mayor has pledged to rescue the
historic district from squatters, hawkers and thugs who have
proliferated after years of urban flight--a process that accelerated
in the early 1980s when the Mexican president's office moved from the
National Palace to Los Pinos a few miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez Obrador has dedicated about $55 million to start restoration
work in a 30-block area around the Zocalo. In a walking tour
Thursday, he assured shopkeepers that he had set a December deadline
for chasing off an estimated 5,000 illegal sidewalk vendors, many of
them plying stolen goods.</TE>
<TE>   But with the circus underway, street vendors have drifted into the
Zocalo to push their wares on people lined up outside the tent.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is undermining his own authority," Aridjis said. "What
is happening to the Zocalo is what is happening to Mexico. It used to
be kind of sacred, a symbol of a more orderly country. Now it's a
scene of political conflict ... disorder, insecurity, noise and a
lack of government authority."</TE>

<DH>Asia: Half a million early deaths a year, natural disasters
may be caused by thick cloud, U.N. says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>The "Asian Brown Cloud," a 2-mile-thick blanket of pollution over
South Asia, may be causing the premature deaths of half a million
people in India each year, deadly flooding in some areas and drought
in others, a new U.N.-sponsored study indicates.</LD>
<LD>   The grimy cocktail of ash, soot, acids and other harmful airborne
particles is damaging agriculture and changing rainfall patterns from
Afghanistan to Sri Lanka, the study found.</LD>
<LD>   "We have an early warning. We have clear information, and we
already have some impact. But we need much, much more information,"
U.N Environment Program chief Klaus Toepfer said at a news conference
in London on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   "There are also global implications, not least because a pollution
parcel like this ... can travel halfway round the globe in a week."</TE>
<TE>   Toepfer said the cloud was the result of forest fires,
agricultural waste incineration, dramatic increases in the burning of
fossil fuels in vehicles, industries and power stations and emissions
from millions of inefficient cookers.</TE>
<TE>   More than 200 scientists contributed to the study, overseen by the
U.N. Environment Program in preparation for the World Summit on
Sustainable Development opening Aug. 26 in Johannesburg, South
Africa. They used data from ships, planes and satellites to study
Asia's haze from 1995 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists say that more research is needed but that some
trends are clear. Respiratory illness appears to be increasing along
with the pollution in densely populated South Asia, with one study
suggesting 500,000 premature deaths annually in India.</TE>
<TE>   The dense cloud of pollution cuts the amount of sunlight reaching
the ground and the oceans by 10% to 15%, cooling the land and water
while heating the atmosphere.</TE>

<HD>Debate Over Tying Cuba to Terrorists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With public and congressional support for the 40-year economic
isolation of Cuba steadily diminishing, embargo advocates are pushing
a new line: that the island nation 90 miles from Florida has become a
dangerous "comfort station" for terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Advocates in the Bush administration and Congress maintain that
while the United States has been mobilizing a global war on
terrorism, Cuban President Fidel Castro has been providing shelter
and possibly aid to Basque separatists, Irish Republican Army
members, leftist Colombian guerrillas and perhaps Iranian agents and
others.</LD>
<LD>   They contend that in light of the Sept. 11 attacks, the United
States needs to hold a firm line against a country that could become
a terrorist incubator like the onetime Taliban-run Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Opponents of the embargo scoff at these arguments as yet more of
the overheated rhetoric that surrounds the politically charged issue
of Cuba. They note, for example, that not even the Bush
administration claims any Cuban ties to Al Qaeda or other Islamic
terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   These critics contend that the embargo's defenders are playing the
"terrorist card" in desperation because fewer Americans believe that
Cuba should be cut off from U.S. tourism and trade.</TE>
<TE>   The allegations about Cuban involvement in terrorism are not about
foreign policy but rather "about domestic politics," said Rep.
William D. Delahunt (D-Mass.), a leading embargo foe.</TE>
<TE>   In the administration's view, Havana has become a bustling
terrorist way station even as U.S. military authorities have been
locking up accused foreign terrorists at the U.S. naval base at
Guantanamo Bay on Cuba's southeastern end.</TE>
<TE>   In its most recent report on the subject, the State Department
listed Cuba as one of seven "state sponsors" of terrorism because of
its role in offering sanctuary and support to insurgent groups.</TE>
<TE>   The report said Castro's government has been treating 20 members
of the Basque separatist group ETA, which is seeking independence
from Spain, as "privileged guests" and providing "some degree of safe
haven and support" to the two principal guerrilla groups in Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   It said that Niall Connolly, one of three IRA members facing trial
in Colombia on charges of teaching bomb-making to the Colombian
guerrillas, lived in Cuba for five years as the Irish group's Latin
America representative before being jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cuba has signed a U.N. anti-terrorism convention, Castro
continues "to view terrorism as a legitimate revolutionary tactic,"
the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Some embargo supporters in Congress have asserted that Cuba was a
transit point for Iranian terrorists who are alleged to have bombed a
Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994, killing at least 85
people. But the State Department report makes no mention of that
connection, or any other link to Islamic terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics argue that the presence of terrorists, even if true,
is no reason to keep the embargo in place. To the contrary, open
trade and communication could make it harder for clandestine groups
to operate, this argument goes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even some experts who are skeptical about the embargo
acknowledge that any traffic of terrorist groups through Havana
raises troublesome questions about the Cuban government's clandestine
activities with anti-government organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Cuban Interests Section in Washington did not
return calls for comment. Cuba has denied supporting terrorist
activities of the IRA, Colombian guerrillas or the Basque
separatists. But Castro traveled through the Mideast after Sept. 11
and has been trying to cultivate relations with several nations on
Washington's list of terror-sponsoring countries, including Iran,
Libya and Syria.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say they believe that there are dozens of
foreign terrorists in Cuba and that they receive special treatment
from the government, making their lives more comfortable than those
of ordinary Cubans.</TE>
<TE>   They suspect that these foreigners are collaborating with the
Cuban government on intelligence matters. Noting that Cuba had a
network of terrorist training camps as recently as the 1980s, they
say they suspect the foreigners may be receiving military and
intelligence training as well.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials have not publicly argued that they have proof
the groups have active terrorist camps in Cuba or are using a Cuban
sanctuary as a base for activities elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The new visibility of the issue comes as pressure builds for a
change in the longtime U.S. policy on Cuba. As trade grows with such
remaining Communist nations as China and Vietnam, and the aging
Castro remains securely in power, a growing number of Americans think
it is time for a change.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting the strength of this sentiment, late last month the
House passed, by a 262-167 margin, language that would lift
restrictions on travel. If the Senate adopts similar language, as
expected, and congressional conferees follow suit, President Bush
could face a tough choice between exercising the first veto of his
term or accepting a major weakening of the embargo.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, in a significant defection, retiring House Majority
Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said he believes the United States should
open trade with Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba policy is important to the president's political
fortunes--and those of his brother, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush--because of
Florida's influential and staunchly anti-Castro Cuban American
community.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of the embargo contend that the administration's case
against Cuba is weak and vaguer than those against other governments
accused of sponsoring terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Peters, a former State Department official now at the
Lexington Institute research and consulting organization, notes that
in contrast with the six other countries it listed, the recent State
Department report did not accuse Cuba of involvement in any specific
terrorist operations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some analysts say the Cuba-terrorist connections can't be
explained away entirely.</TE>
<TE>   Richard A. Nuccio, who was President Clinton's top advisor on
Cuba, said that while he has not seen evidence that the IRA has used
Cuba as a training or staging ground for operations, the IRA's ties
to the Castro government "should be cause for concern" and should be
taken up by U.S. officials with Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Cuba is actively supporting international terrorism is "an
open question," he said. "It bears watching and monitoring."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official, who asked to remain
unidentified, acknowledged in an interview that the extent of
Castro's active support for such groups remains unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "I'm interested that Havana has become the preferred
transit point for people of this dubious profession," he said.
"That's got to raise a serious set of questions."</TE>
<TE>   The official noted that from the time of Castro's revolution in
1959 through the 1980s, Cuba was active in supporting and financing
revolutionary groups in Central and South America and Africa, and
even trained insurgents on its soil.</TE>
<TE>   He said that with the fall of the Soviet Union, most Americans
have felt less threatened and "there's been a kind of forgetfulness
that Cuba played this role."</TE>
<TE>   IRA members who allegedly taught Colombian guerrillas how to make
mortars from propane tanks may have learned some of their skills in
Cuba, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say that the three IRA men in Colombia were trained in
Cuba," he said. "But ... if it looks like a duck and quacks like a
duck ... "</TE>
<TE>   The administration official said he knew of no link between Cuba
and Al Qaeda or related extremist Islamic groups, although "I hope
the intelligence community is asking those kinds of questions."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of Cuba's role in supporting terrorism came in for a
full-scale debate in Congress on July 23, when House members
considered the proposal, offered by Rep. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), to
lift restrictions on travel to Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   As the embargo's congressional defenders looked for ways to stop
the proposal, Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) offered a motion that the
restrictions shouldn't be lifted unless the president certified that,
among other things, Cuba was not offering "support or sanctuary to
international terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   Goss is chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, a role
that embargo supporters had hoped would add credibility to his
proposal. But even Goss acknowledged that whether Cuba is a terrorist
sponsor today "remains a difficult, open question, and one which our
executive agencies are working on."</TE>
<TE>   His proposal was defeated easily, 247-182. Interestingly,
Republicans on the intelligence committee, who presumably have the
best access to classified intelligence on the Cuban threat, narrowly
voted against Goss' proposal, 6 to 5.</TE>

<HD>Relatives, Athletes Remember 11 Killed at Munich Olympics</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: The small group gathers for a memorial service
nearly 30 years after the attack on the Israelis by Palestinian
militants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany</DL>
<LD>A small group of athletes and relatives of the 11 Israelis killed at
the 1972 Munich Olympics gathered for a memorial service Sunday,
standing in a moment of silence, listening to songs and speeches and
promising not to forget the victims.</LD>
<LD>   The one-hour ceremony took place in cool, drizzly weather amid
extraordinary security at the monument to the victims, a large stone
tablet placed at the bridge linking the former Olympic village to the
Olympic stadium. The victims' names are etched in the Roman alphabet
and in Hebrew, with the words: "In honor of their memory."</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli flag was draped across the tablet, with 11 candles
burning and fresh wreaths laid at the foot of the monument. Six
Israeli flags fluttered in the wind.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to 25 relatives of the athletes who were killed, the
17-member Israeli team participating in the European athletics
championship, a track and field competition that ended Sunday in
Munich, took part in the remembrance. This year's European
championship was the first time since the 1972 Olympics that
international athletes have competed in the village, which is
normally used as a student dormitory.</TE>
<TE>   During the ceremony, police helicopters circled above, the main
highway passing under the bridge was closed off in both directions
and police sharpshooters scanned the area from atop the bridge
supports.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 5, 1972, Palestinian terrorists stormed an Olympic
village apartment building, killing two Israeli athletes and holding
nine others hostage in an effort to gain the freedom of 200
Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.</TE>
<TE>   In a botched rescue attempt after a 20-hour standoff, the nine
hostages--as well as five terrorists and a German policeman--were
killed.</TE>
<TE>   Ankie Spitzer, the widow of fencing coach Andre Spitzer, one of
the 11 victims, criticized the rescue attempt as "incompetent and
stupid."</TE>
<TE>   "We are here not to forget and not to forgive," said Spitzer, who
was at the games with her husband.</TE>
<TE>   Michal Rot, the 20-year-old daughter of Esther Rot, an Israeli
athlete who escaped capture because female competitors were in a
different building, sang and performed on the guitar a song she
composed in memory of the tragedy.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Poll Results 'Alarming'</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Sociologist says survey shows support declining
for democracy as it grows for Islamic rule. Most would reelect
Arafat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A new survey of Palestinian public opinion due to be released today
shows a further hardening of attitudes and a rise in support for an
Islamic political system over a democratic one.</LD>
<LD>   The poll by Birzeit University, the Palestinians' oldest
institution of higher learning, suggests that a majority would vote
for Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat if he ran for
reelection. But the most important criteria for a president,
Palestinians said in the poll, are the ability to "confront Israel"
and remain committed to "Islamic values."</LD>
<LD>   Nader Said, the Birzeit sociologist who conducted the survey, said
the results are troubling for anyone who wants to build a democratic,
pluralistic Palestinian state. He said the last 23 months of violence
and extremism have erased any gains made before the outbreak of the
current intifada, or uprising, and have radicalized the society.
Deepening poverty and the failings of the Palestinian Authority have
helped push people toward Islamic militancy, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "There has been a major shift in Palestinian political culture
that has negative social implications," Said said. "It's extremely
alarming from my perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Among the causes for concern, he said, is the large majority of
18-to 22-year-olds who said they would not vote for a woman for
president. Overall, 54% of the respondents said they would be willing
to vote for a woman.</TE>
<TE>   In choosing a political system, 42% favored a democratic,
pluralistic one, and 42% wanted one-party Islamic rule. Birzeit's
Development Studies Program conducts such surveys regularly but had
not previously posed this question. From other polling done in the
late 1990s, however, Said estimated that support for democracy has
dropped about 20 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   It is not clear whether such views are permanent. Though support
for radical Islamic organizations such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad
has increased, some of the extremism may be exaggerated as a way of
defying what Palestinians perceive to be U.S.-and Israeli-imposed
ideas, Said said.</TE>
<TE>   To conduct the poll, researchers hiked over back roads and through
ditches to reach many of the targeted 75 towns and villages, most of
them cut off by Israeli army restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The survey reflects widespread skepticism about presidential,
legislative and local elections called by Arafat, and about announced
measures aimed at reforming the Palestinian Authority's security
services and financial system. Neither elections nor reform were seen
as likely to improve Palestinians' lives.</TE>
<TE>   In a piece of bad news for U.S. policymakers, similar skepticism
was expressed about the U.S. role in the region. Ninety-one percent
said Washington is demanding reform of Palestinian institutions
merely for its own political interests, with only a fraction
believing that the reforms are designed to benefit the Palestinian
people.</TE>
<TE>   Support for resuming political negotiations with the Israelis also
has declined.</TE>
<TE>   "Two long years of extreme hopelessness and violence is going to
have an impact, especially on young people who see that this intifada
is not empowering them," Said said.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, scattered violence continued. The Israeli army said
troops killed a Palestinian gunman who was attacking a Jewish
settlement in the Gaza Strip. An Israeli was wounded by gunfire in
that encounter. In the northern West Bank city of Jenin, two Israeli
soldiers were wounded in a gun battle with Palestinians, the army
said.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli journalist Gideon Levy said the army opened fire on him
and his photographer earlier Sunday as they were riding in a marked
Israeli taxi into the West Bank city of Tulkarm. They had obtained
explicit army approval to enter the town and had checked in with the
soldiers on duty as they approached, Levy said.</TE>
<TE>   But as they drove slowly toward a second army position, the
soldiers opened fire and continued to shoot, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, Levy said, the car was bulletproof and no one was
hurt. Also in the taxi was an investigator from Israeli Physicians
for Human Rights.</TE>
<TE>   Levy, who writes for the liberal newspaper Haaretz, specializes in
articles about the suffering of Palestinians and was traveling to
Tulkarm to look into the killing last week of a Palestinian teenager.</TE>
<TE>   The army said Sunday evening that the shooting was a mistake and
apologized. Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer called Levy to
express his regret, Israeli radio reported.</TE>

<DH>Disaster: Scores die as fierce weather strikes vacationers,
damages crops and causes chaos.</DH>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At least 58 people, most of them Russian vacationers, have died in
floods in Russia's Black Sea region, the Emergencies Ministry said
Sunday, as fierce weather continued to hit wide swaths of Europe and
Asia.</LD>
<LD>   In India, police put the death toll at 43 after torrential rains
triggered flooding and landslides in the northern state of
Uttaranchal, nearly 185 miles northeast of the capital, New Delhi.
But large areas of the rest of India were suffering their worst
drought in at least 14 years.</LD>
<LD>   Erratic monsoon rains have also caused flooding in neighboring
Nepal and Bangladesh.</LD>
<TE>   China was battling the effects of floods in its southern Hunan
province, where 70 people have died and crops in a main
rice-producing area have been damaged. So far this year, about 900
people in China have been killed in seasonal floods.</TE>
<TE>   In South Korea, 14 people have died in the last week as deluges
dumped two-fifths of the average annual rainfall on the country. More
rain is forecast, and the government has mobilized troops to help
deal with the floods.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, already suffering a severe food shortage, has also
reported crops destroyed by torrential rains, but there are no
estimates so far of the extent of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   In Russia, an Emergencies Ministry spokesman said 49 bodies had
been recovered around the port of Novorossiysk and nine more near the
resorts of Sochi and Tuapse.</TE>
<TE>   Russian news agencies said scores of people were still missing,
raising the prospect of a significantly higher final death toll,
while many hundreds of vacationers were stranded with no immediate
means of getting back home.</TE>
<TE>   The flooding, which was accompanied by a violent tornado, forced
the evacuation of thousands of vacationers from summer camps and
villages along the coast. But the ministry said the worst of the
danger had passed and that weather conditions were improving.</TE>
<TE>   During the current flooding and storms in Eastern Europe, about
seven people have died in Romania, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rains have also brought chaos to southern Germany, Croatia
and Italy and less serious flooding to many other parts of Europe,
police said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   In Austria, a dam burst Sunday night in the town of Zwettl,
submerging 50 to 60 houses, the Austria Press Agency said, but no
injuries were immediately reported.</TE>

<DL>STEPANAKERT, Azerbaijan</DL>
<LD>Azerbaijan's breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh voted for a new
leader Sunday, defying the world community and brushing off angry
protests from the Azerbaijani capital, Baku.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest twist in the long dispute over the mountainous
enclave, its predominantly ethnic Armenian people turned out in fog
and rain to elect a new "president" in a poll they hope will help
gain recognition for their homeland.</LD>
<LD>   "Any international organization that does not recognize these
elections ... is itself against democracy," said incumbent Arkady
Gukasyan, who is seeking reelection.</LD>
<TE>   Azerbaijan and Armenia have been in conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh
since the 1980s, and the two nations fought a war over the enclave in
which 30,000 people were killed.</TE>
<TE>   A cease-fire has been in force since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Azerbaijan condemned Sunday's election as illegal and urged the

<HD>Speaking Out Has High Cost</HD>
<DH>Whistle-blowers often face retaliation by their employers
in Japan, but a new push to protect insiders follows recent corporate
scandals.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>In 1973, salesman Hiroaki Kushioka discovered evidence linking his
employer to price-fixing. He complained to his boss, a vice president
of the package delivery company, but was told to keep quiet. He
raised the issue with other company officials but was told not to
rock the boat.</LD>
<LD>   Frustrated, he turned to the media and government regulators.
This, finally, created a stir. It also angered the company and landed
Kushioka in employment hell, he says. As soon as the media attention
died down, the company took its revenge.</LD>
<LD>   In 1975, his employer, Tonami Transportation, transferred him to a
tiny, remote subsidiary. For the next 27 years, Kushioka says, he was
humiliated, badgered and bullied. The company stuck him in a room 9
feet square without a working telephone and made him weed lawns,
shovel snow and arrange cushions. His pay remained virtually
unchanged for more than two decades.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt terrible humiliation," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Tonami disputes Kushioka's version of events and blames his poor
performance. But early this year, Kushioka filed a lawsuit against
Tonami seeking an official apology and $415,000 in damages and
forgone wages.</TE>
<TE>   Kushioka's stubborn endurance and willingness to challenge Tonami
legally have made him something of a model for a once-unthinkable
movement: a growing push to protect whistle-blowers, in a country
where loyalty and group harmony have long trumped notions of social
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Kushioka might still be languishing unnoticed in the corporate
wilderness if a parade of recent scandals hadn't shocked many
Japanese and undermined their faith in institutions that helped
rebuild the nation after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Tainted-blood scandals in the early 1980s at the Health Ministry,
wining and dining abuses in the 1990s at the Finance Ministry, and
slush fund improprieties at the Foreign Ministry over the past two
years have convinced Japanese that many elite bureaucrats were more
interested in feathering their nests than safeguarding the public
interest.</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, the auto industry, long a symbol of Japanese
pride, was tarnished in 2000 after Mitsubishi Motors was discovered
hiding customer complaints, thereby masking potentially deadly
defects.</TE>
<TE>   Especially shocking to many Japanese were revelations of crooked
dealings in the food industry. This, after all, is a nation weaned on
the belief that its farm products and inspection standards were among
the world's best. Snow Brand, one of Japan's largest dairy producers,
was accused of selling tainted milk after thousands of its consumers
fell ill in 2000. And the meat-packing industry was caught this year
mislabeling beef to boost profit margins and collect government
handouts in the wake of a "mad cow" scandal.</TE>
<TE>   A common theme in most of the cases was insiders speaking out. A
telephone caller tipped regulators to look in a Mitsubishi Motors
locker for thousands of long-hidden customer complaints. A supplier
helped break the meat scandals. Other leakers laid bare the host of
ministry scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Still, activists remain concerned that Japan's cultural bias
against those who speak out will undermine efforts to foster a
vibrant whistle-blowing culture and secure greater legal protection
against retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Most whistle-blowers don't stick around long enough to match the
27 years of exile and hounding that Kushioka says he endured. Even
so, they face witch hunts, bullying and pariah treatment as long as
they stay. The treatment here is arguably more devastating to
people's sense of worth and self-esteem than in other countries,
experts say, given Japan's long historical isolation and unique
traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Since its samurai days, Japan has stressed loyalty at almost any
cost--whether to one's feudal lord, employer or ministry. Those who
broke this code frequently were labeled traitors and sent away, a
terrible fate in a group-oriented culture.</TE>
<TE>   "Traditionally, betrayal is the biggest crime in Japan, almost
worse than murder," says Tetsuo Yamaori, a religious scholar. "The
price was mura hachibu, or exile from the village."</TE>
<TE>   Group Harmony Prized</TE>
<TE>   Closely related is a long-standing taboo against confrontation,
challenging authority or disturbing the wa, or group harmony.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese don't like to be different from others. They also tend
to hide unpleasant things from outsiders," says Etsuko Kawada, an
independent lawmaker. "So whistle-blowing has met with suspicion on
both counts."</TE>
<TE>   Kawada should know. Her hemophiliac son, Ryuhei, is HIV-positive
because the Health Ministry did not screen the nation's blood supply
in the early 1980s, despite knowing the risks.</TE>
<TE>   "If only someone in the ministry had spoken out, it would have
saved so many people's lives," she says. "We need to change the
system."</TE>
<TE>   Another factor behind Japan's traditionally jaundiced eye toward
whistle-blowers, analysts believe, is its view of right and wrong.
Historically, Japan's concept of justice has been more malleable and
dependent on situation and context, compared with the West's focus on
objective rules.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taught to respect those above us in the hierarchy, not to
act on absolute standards," says Kazuko Miyamoto, a consumer advocate
and author of the book "The Era of Whistle-Blowing."</TE>
<TE>   That said, globalization, Japan's decade-long economic slide and
growing suspicion of authority increasingly are spurring a far more
sympathetic view toward those who disclose wrongdoing. A poll by the
Consumer Research Institute in 2000 found that 45.1% of those
surveyed supported whistle-blowing in the public interest, although
28% worried that it could spur betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   In-house loyalty has also eroded in tandem with lifetime
employment as middle-aged "salary men"--with extensive knowledge of
corporate impropriety--are squeezed out of jobs and seek revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "The Internet is also a growing force," says Iwao Taka, a
professor with Tokyo's Reitaku University and a business ethics
specialist. "Japan now has over 10,000 sites disclosing what's going
on inside companies."</TE>
<TE>   The social tussle over whether whistle-blowers are Benedict
Arnolds or public saviors is frequently played out in a
not-in-my-backyard approach.</TE>
<TE>   For many Japanese, whistle-blowing is exemplary as long as it
isn't in their company and doesn't jeopardize their jobs. Fresh in
many minds is the food unit of Snow Brand, which went bankrupt after
shoppers shunned the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Business Lobby Vocal</TE>
<TE>   The biggest opposition to whistle-blower protection laws--which
might ensure, for instance, that people who speak out aren't denied
promotions or forced out of their jobs--comes from Japan's mainstream
business community--and many in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
One company executive compared whistle-blowing to "telling on one's
parents."</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you create new laws, it doesn't solve the problem," says
Mitsuru Shinozaki, a spokesman with the umbrella Federation of
Economic Organizations. "Bullying isn't welcome, of course. But
another law isn't going to stop it."</TE>
<TE>   This view is tempered by other voices, however, arguing that
whistle-blowing, when channeled through in-house hotlines and
corporate compliance programs, provides indispensable alarm bells.</TE>
<TE>   "Companies that change with the times have a better chance of
competing and surviving," says Tadashi Kunihiro, a corporate
attorney. "Just look at Snow Brand. It doesn't exist anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Other opponents fear broader social damage. "Bringing Western
ideas of whistle-blowing will accelerate the breakdown of Japanese
society," religious scholar Yamaori says. "Japanese will lose their
basic trust in one another, leading to chaos."</TE>
<TE>   Working on Legislation</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are now exchanging draft proposals and studying U.S. and
British legal models. Some, such as members of the Democratic Party
of Japan and the Social Democratic Party, favor a narrowly focused
law initially covering only government workers, given industry's
strong opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Others, such as lawmaker Kawada, want as broad and comprehensive
an approach as possible. Early betting is that Japan will see a civil
service whistle-blower law passed within a year or two, followed
later by a broader corporate law.</TE>
<TE>   Japan already has one whistle-blower law on the books, covering
the nuclear power industry, although it's never been tested. The
statute was enacted in 2000 after an accident at a nuclear
fuel-processing plant 80 miles northeast of Tokyo revealed that
workers had for years transferred radioactive material using
stainless steel buckets without speaking out.</TE>
<TE>   A review of the 1968 Basic Consumer Protection Law now underway
also is expected to strengthen whistle-blower safeguards in the food
and medical areas.</TE>
<TE>   Most Japanese seem to favor Britain's approach, which requires
whistle-blowers to first exhaust internal complaint channels before
going public. This contrasts with the more blanket protection
afforded under the 1989 U.S. Whistleblower Protection Act--a law
inspired by the 1986 space shuttle Challenger explosion, in which it
turned out that an engineer had complained of defects and been fired.</TE>
<TE>   Another legitimate Japanese concern is the greater difficulty that
Japanese whistle-blowers face finding another job compared with their
counterparts in the U.S. or Europe, where blacklisting is illegal and
job-hopping more common.</TE>
<TE>   "In Japan, people need to blow their whistles more quietly than in
the U.S.," says Tetsuro Kuroda, director general of the Freedom of
Information Citizens Center.</TE>
<TE>   Whistle-blower Kushioka had a quarter-century in his tiny office
to think about whether he'd done the right thing by going public.</TE>
<TE>   "I was naive and didn't realize at first how much they'd retaliate
against me," he says. "When I told the company I was going to the
prosecutor's office, the pressure really got worse."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about Kushioka's price-fixing allegations, Tonami officials
would say only that "shortcuts were taken." Prosecutors launched an
investigation at the time, but Japan was far more tolerant of
monopolistic behavior in the mid-1970s than it is now, and the case
was quietly dropped. Tonami denies any bullying and blames Kushioka's
derailed career on his argumentative nature and poor leadership
skills.</TE>
<TE>   "His unique personality is the issue here, not whistle-blowing or
human rights," says Noriaki Murata, a Tonami planning manager.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kushioka, however, fellow employees would call his
mother intimating that he had no pride and should quit his
meaningless job.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials also pressured his brother and father-in-law,
who worked elsewhere, to persuade him to quit.</TE>
<TE>   And a board member harassed Kushioka deep into the night hoping to
exhaust him into leaving the company, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Another Tonami board member asked colleagues to slip Kushioka some
drinks and bait him into punching a co-worker, thereby giving the
company cause for dismissal. The plot failed when the colleagues
refused.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most heavy-handed effort involved phone calls and
visits from someone identifying himself as part of the yakuza, or
Japanese organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   The man first tried to bribe Kushioka with $25,000 to quit, then
sought to intimidate him, Kushioka says.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't resign, younger yakuza may stage a traffic accident,
and the police would never know you were murdered," Kushioka recalls
him saying.</TE>
<TE>   Kushioka refused to give up, however, despite the enormous strain
on those around him and on his mental health.</TE>
<TE>   His entire family urged him to resign, and his mother even pleaded
with his wife to divorce "my stupid son."</TE>
<TE>   Early this year, faced with five more years until mandatory
retirement, an increasingly sympathetic social environment and little
to lose, he filed his suit against the company. The case is now
working its way through the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though it won't help me now, Japan really needs a
whistle-blower protection law," he says. "I'm determined to fight on,
no matter how long it takes. I just hope I can win this case and
create a good precedent for others."</TE>

<HD>US Airways Files for Bankruptcy Reorganization</HD>
<DH>Business: Burdened with debt and losses, airline was the
one most damaged by Sept. 11 aftermath. It says flights will not be
interrupted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc., becoming the first major airline casualty of
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, filed for bankruptcy reorganization
Sunday but said its 3,800 daily flights would continue without
interruption.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's seventh-largest airline, already suffering from heavy
debt, high operating costs and massive losses, was the carrier most
severely damaged by the fallout from the attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The carrier's route system is concentrated in the East, where the
post-Sept. 11 travel slump hit the hardest. The prolonged shutdown of
Reagan National Airport in Washington after the attacks also
exacerbated US Airways' struggle. The airline, which boarded 62
million passengers last year, lost $2 billion in 2001 and has lost an
additional $517 million in the first six months of this year.</LD>
<TE>   US Airways' filing marked the latest in a string of high-profile
bankruptcy cases in the last several months, though most of the
others were related to scandal as much as financial distress. They
include energy trader Enron Corp., telecommunications firms WorldCom
Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd., cable giant Adelphia Communications
Corp. and discount retailer Kmart Corp.</TE>
<TE>   One smaller airline, Vanguard Airlines, filed for bankruptcy and
shut down operations in July.</TE>
<TE>   But history shows that many airlines keep operating without
incident while going through a bankruptcy reorganization. Over the
last decade, Continental Airlines and America West both kept flying
as they restructured, as did Trans World Airlines, which eventually
was bought by American Airlines.</TE>
<TE>   For months US Airways had warned it might have to file for
bankruptcy if it couldn't restructure quickly enough, but its filing
Sunday still caught some observers by surprise. The Arlington,
Va.-based airline already has received conditional support to get
federal backing for $900 million of a $1-billion bank loan. The
guarantee was part of the $15-billion federal bailout of the airlines
after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The agency in charge of the bailout, the Air Transportation
Stabilization Board, issued a statement Sunday saying US Airways'
application "remains in effect," though it still is subject to
revisions mandated by the board and approval by the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.</TE>
<TE>   To help secure the guarantee, US Airways has been racing to wring
about $1 billion in wage cuts and other concessions from its 35,000
full-time employees, and it recently got approval for the cuts from
the unions representing its pilots and flight attendants. The airline
also is seeking at least $300 million in concessions from its
suppliers and lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Yet US Airways' chief executive, David Siegel, said the airline
needed to file under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code anyway because
the airline "determined that it was unlikely" to reach agreements in
time with certain of its vendors, aircraft lessors and financiers. US
Airways already had defaulted on a number of public and private debt
obligations.</TE>
<TE>   "US Airways will continue to operate while we complete our
financial restructuring," Siegel said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Under Chapter 11, a company's debt is frozen--and it is protected
from creditors seizing assets to satisfy their loans--while the
company works out a plan to overhaul its financial situation. In its
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Alexandria, Va., US Airways listed
debt of about $7.83 billion and assets of $7.81 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The airline's more than 300 jetliners fly to 204 cities--including
Los Angeles and San Diego--in the United States, Canada, Europe,
Mexico and the Caribbean. US Airways' hub airports are in Charlotte,
N.C., Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. The airline also operates shuttle
service connecting Boston, New York and Washington.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways said it expected its stay in Bankruptcy Court to be
relatively brief. The carrier said it already has secured $500
million in debtor-in-possession financing from Credit Suisse First
Boston and Bank of America.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Texas Pacific Group, a private investment firm, has agreed
to pump $200 million into the airline in exchange for 38% ownership
of the carrier after it emerges from Chapter 11, US Airways said.
Texas Pacific, led by financier David Bonderman, also has invested in
Continental Airlines and America West in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Whether US Airways stockholders still have an investment will
remain to be seen. When a company files for Chapter 11, its existing
stock often becomes worthless because all its assets are claimed by
its creditors.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways' stock closed Friday at $2.45 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways, a troubled airline for many years, traces its roots to
1939 and the early days of the old Allegheny Airlines. After the
airlines were deregulated in 1978, Allegheny changed its name to
USAir and then, in 1987, acquired the California-based carrier
Pacific Southwest Airlines and Piedmont Airlines, which served mainly
the mid-Atlantic region. It adopted the US Airways name in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   But since deregulation, US Airways hasn't been able to find the
right formula for generating sustained profits. Different union
contracts for all the workers brought in from the merged airlines
caused employee-integration problems and added to US Airways'
relatively high costs. Constant assaults from lower-cost, lower-price
carriers such as Southwest Airlines also hurt its performance.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways has been hurt by the combination of having a regional
route system "with a cost structure that's as high as the major
airlines' with far larger networks, overexpansion at its small hubs
and rapidly expanding low-fare competition," said Gary Chase, an
analyst with Lehman Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel, though, seemed to be making quick progress in
restructuring US Airways. After the carrier got its pilots and flight
attendants to agree to cutbacks, the International Assn. of
Machinists--which represents about 6,800 US Airways mechanics and
other workers--said its members also would soon vote on the airline's
concessions proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our members will not give up on US Airways, and neither should
anyone else," Robert Roach Jr., the union's general vice president,
told Associated Press on Sunday. "We believe US Airways can
successfully restructure while it continues to serve the traveling
public and provide employment for our members."</TE>
<TE>   Though the bankruptcy filing could complicate matters among US
Airways, its unions and the federal government, it should give the
airline more leverage in dealing with its aircraft lessors and other
vendors, said Eric Schaffer, a bankruptcy lawyer with the firm Reed
Smith in Pittsburgh. The airline, in effect, will get the help of a
bankruptcy judge in trying to restructure loans on terms it can
afford.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, "it's hard to imagine that any constituency [of US
Airways] wants to undermine the ATSB" and the agency's conditional
agreement to guarantee the $1-billion loan that the airline says it
needs to survive, Schaffer said.</TE>

<HD>Ad Boost for Art Village</HD>
<DH>Tourism: Santa Ana resorts to low-budget television spots
to promote its creative side.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eager to polish its image and promote its emerging Artists Village
but short on cash, Santa Ana is billing itself to Southern California
as "The Place for Art" on an artist's budget.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Yenglin, the city's redevelopment project manager, has an
advertising budget of only $30,000 a year, but that didn't stop him
from thinking prime time.</LD>
<LD>   Yenglin, taking advantage of an offer by KCBS-TV Channel 2 for
Orange County businesses, scored seven 15-second advertising spots to
promote the Artists Village for $1,500.</LD>
<TE>   City officials were thrilled because they want to bring more
people downtown and show that Santa Ana is more than a magnet for
immigrants. In the commercials, they get to explain, albeit quickly,
that Santa Ana also is a place for artistic creation.</TE>
<TE>   With no money to film an advertisement, Yenglin planned to put the
city's "A Place for Art" logo on a photograph of the Bowers Museum
and Discovery Science Center. Creating a commercial can cost upward
of $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   He mentioned his plan to Joe Duffy, president of Santa Ana ad
agency Truth and Advertising, who markets the Artists Village and its
studios, restaurants and shops for a $20,000 annual fee, about $8,000
of which comes from Yenglin's advertising budget. Duffy had his
employees come up with the ideas for the commercials, and asked
contractors to donate their time to make them. Santa Monica-based
production company G &amp; M Plumbing brought in a 15-member crew,
including a director, cameramen and lighting. Harley's House of Santa
Monica donated editing work.</TE>
<TE>   The results are the spots that will appear on CBS next week and
the following week. The spots will air during the day, but exact
times haven't been set.</TE>
<TE>   Duffy wanted an abstract representation of the city and its
nascent art scene for the promotional spots. He decided to use real
people and put out a casting call at the city's public works yard.
Twenty employees auditioned.</TE>
<TE>   "When you cast real people, it's going to be really great or
really bad," Duffy said. "We hit pay dirt--these guys are better than
actors."</TE>
<TE>   In one of the spots, equipment operator Miguel Gonzalez splatters
paint as if he were Jackson Pollock and says, "It's like I completely
lose control. Inspiration overpowers me, and the paint just speaks
for itself."</TE>
<TE>   The logo, "Santa Ana, a Place for Art," flashes on screen. Then
his boss yells, "Get back to work!" and Gonzalez is shown painting a
stop sign.</TE>
<TE>   In the second advertisement, maintenance worker Mike Blackmore
lets down his long mane to recite a passage from "Hamlet" before
returning to his sweeping.</TE>

<HD>Alhambra Banks on Charming Them</HD>
<DH>Renewal: The new Main Street attractions seek to
complement, not compete with, nearby Old Pasadena.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE CHAVEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After years of cajoling, begging, and even paying businesses to move
to Main Street, Alhambra, the city's prime thoroughfare is seeing
something it's been missing for 25 years: people.</LD>
<LD>   People are waiting half an hour on Friday nights for a barbecued
rib dinner. They stand in line for coffee and listen to free music at
a sidewalk stage outside at Rick's burger joint. Weary professionals
stop at the Havana House for a cigar after work.</LD>
<LD>   With about 40 new businesses, $25 million in public investment,
and the impending opening of a 14-screen movie theater, Alhambra has
caught the tail of a national trend, which has shoppers and diners
flocking back to their hometown downtowns.</LD>
<TE>   But call Main Street trendy or upscale, and city officials and
residents alike shudder.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to be another Old Pasadena," said City Manager
Julio Fuentes, referring to the bars, restaurants and shops that draw
surging crowds to a historic swath of Colorado Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   But by complementing, instead of competing with, nearby Old
Pasadena, Main Street Alhambra appears to be in step with other
commercial areas that form informal pairings, such as Studio City and
Encino, Burbank and Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   "These centers can duplicate themselves every two, three miles,
given the market density," said Larry Kosmot, a Los Angeles-based
real estate consultant. "There's a localization of habits. People are
saying, 'I'm staying here.' "</TE>
<TE>   And if they stay in Alhambra, they find a decent meal and a nice
evening stroll.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to be too hip. That's not Alhambra," said
Councilman Paul Talbot. "It sounds a little hokey, but this is a
place where you are going to feel comfortable with your family."</TE>
<TE>   That's why the City Council approved a new martini bar, but said
no to cheap drinks and happy hours.</TE>
<TE>   The council wants crowds of youthful moviegoers, but vetoed a
video arcade.</TE>
<TE>   No Cover Charge</TE>
<TE>   Live music turns many a diner into a dancer at the Cuban Bistro
restaurant, but Main Street has no "cover charge" establishments.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out that Main Street, Alhambra, circa 2002, is much like
Main Street, Alhambra, circa 1955--no themed gimmicks, no paseos or
promenades, not much in the way of historic architecture.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly mile-long stretch of this mainstream Main Street is
proud to play host to a Ross Dress for Less. It offers a $19 Cajun
blackened fish entree on one block and a $1.99 fish taco around the
corner. There are $3.05 grande lattes at Starbucks and a $2.99
Grand-Slam breakfast at Denny's.</TE>
<TE>   That Ross Dress for Less is "outperforming expectations," as a
spokeswoman put it, but it's too early to call Main Street a
hands-down success. It still needs more people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving it another year," said Kim Phan, owner of the
Perfume Station. Phan needs to clear $20,000 a month in sales to
sustain the business. "So far there are a lot of restaurants, but we
are not sure how we fit in yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Alhambra "Oh My Sole Store," is doing the most poorly of the
company's 10 shops, including one in Old Pasadena. "To be honest with
you, it's not really successful," said Young Lee, a corporate manager
of the shoe chain.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, Phan and others have pegged their futures to the November
opening of the centerpiece "Renaissance Plaza," a theater complex
capable of seating about 9,000 moviegoers over a single
weekend--people they hope will turn into shoppers.</TE>
<TE>   The plaza itself will be an eye-catcher for Alhambra, a city of
86,000 where the median household income is about $39,000 a year, a
bit less than the Los Angeles County median of about $42,000. The
plaza at the busy intersection of Garfield Boulevard and Main will
feature a computer-operated fountain where streaming water will
pulsate to lights and music, creating a gathering place with merchant
kiosks, benches and a row of eateries.</TE>
<TE>   "We really want to create a small-town feel, not glitz and
glamour," said Fuentes. After all, city officials, who pumped $1.2
million into the project, didn't want to tamper with Alhambra's
reputation as a nice-place-to-live, freeway-close suburb.</TE>
<TE>   The face of Main Street that is emerging after an eight-year
effort to jump-start Alhambra's long-dormant redevelopment zone, grew
from an idea first approved a generation ago. At that time, 1972,
modern malls had siphoned off enough business to warrant an official
declaration of blighted conditions around a stretch of Main Street
that included the civic center.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Talmage Burke, 84, recalls the Main Street of the '40s,
'50s and '60s as a premier shopping district in the San Gabriel
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother used to say she couldn't think of another city that has
so many shoe stores," Burke said. "People used to come to Alhambra
because the styles and clothing options were great."</TE>
<TE>   Fuentes, with the blessing of the City Council, aggressively set
the pace for revival. Members of the city's staff have acted much
like real estate brokers, scouting out vacant, run-down or under-used
sites for new businesses that fit their vision for Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   The city then brings property owners and business owners together
to work out lease agreements. The city pays to relocate the old
businesses. Since 1995, the city has given nearly $14 million in
grants to lure businesses to Main Street.</TE>
<TE>   Rents Tripled</TE>
<TE>   When the city started its campaign, officials said, Main Street
rents were about 50 cents a square foot. They have since tripled.</TE>
<TE>   Only twice has the city used its powerful redevelopment tool,
eminent domain, to condemn a property and force the owner to sell at
market value.</TE>
<TE>   However, the threat of condemnation can be a strong negotiating
tool to reach lease agreements. Some business owners bitterly
complain about what they call high-pressure tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. David Quon, who for 14 years has run a cosmetic surgery center
out of a defunct bank building, said that the city has prevented him
from expanding his business because redevelopment plans call for a
major retail center on his site.</TE>
<TE>   When his sister, also a doctor, applied for a business license in
1997 to join her brother's practice, it was denied because, a city
document said, officials did not want an "intensification of medical
use on-site, not approved by the Redevelopment Agency." Three other
property owners said prospective tenants had also been denied
licenses because their businesses did not fit into the city's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Quon said his surgery center and the clients he brings are a plus
for the new Main Street, a district he helped to prop up during the
down years. But now the city wants to talk about buying his land. "I
don't want to lose this prime property," Quon said. "What am I going
to do? If I move, my business will suffer. I don't have all the
money, all the attorneys to fight like they do."</TE>
<TE>   What Alhambra officials point to as one of their redevelopment
success stories--a Juice It Up and two small shops--represents what
one family said is the loss of their retirement investment.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Kan said his father, who ran a small restaurant supply
business, sued the city during condemnation proceedings, eventually
settling on a $600,000 price for his building. But the lump sum was a
disappointing end to ownership of a property he had bought to
generate monthly income during retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, you use eminent domain for a public use, but not to
bring in a juice stand," said Kan.</TE>
<TE>   But that's exactly what the city wants on Main Street. More than
10 years ago, the council approved a zoning ordinance prohibiting new
office uses on the ground floor of Main Street buildings, which are
reserved for retail, entertainment or restaurant uses.</TE>
<TE>   "Offices hurt the retail district on the ground floors," said
Michael Martin, director of the city's Development Services
Department. "If we had no control, Main Street would be a hodge-podge
of office uses, nail salons and Internet gaming houses."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, a new generation of restaurants has come to Main Street,
among them Leo Prats' Cuban Bistro in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know where Alhambra was," said Prats, a partner in
the popular Versailles restaurants elsewhere in Southern California.
His partner said no.</TE>
<TE>   But after studying the demographics of Alhambra and nearby South
Pasadena, San Marino and Monterey Park, Prats decided to take the
risk, using about $500,000 of his money and a $350,000 city grant.</TE>
<TE>   One of his loyal customers is Kay Cardenas, 50, an 18-year
Alhambra resident.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a long time in coming, but we finally have a place for
the birthdays, the weekends," she said one Saturday night, listening
to live salsa music in the bar with her two adult children and
brother.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Alhambra, you know? The ambience is more family," she said.
"This isn't the kind of bar where people are going to pick up on
you."</TE>

<HD>Ethnic Tensions, Corruption Charges Tangle Town Politics</HD>
<DH>Recall: Arvin's mayor casts Tuesday's election as Latino
vs. white. Critics say he's corrupt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARVIN, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Petty corruption and bureaucratic incompetence are not exactly
unknown in the far-flung farm towns of the southern San Joaquin
Valley. But the rap sheet against officials in this small town is
setting a new standard for roguishness.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor of this community of 10,000 at the foot of Bear Mountain
is facing a recall over allegations of corruption. To make sure the
election isn't stolen Tuesday, the state is sending special monitors.
Another member of the council, a minister, has been indicted on
charges of stealing child-care money. The police chief pleaded guilty
to charges of hijacking funds meant for a police awards dinner. (He
paid off a loan on his truck.) The city manager left amid allegations
that he had installed a secret videotaping system to spy on the
mayor.</LD>
<LD>   In this town, Barney Fife might roll the local drunk for pocket
change. Things have gotten so bad that the newspaper in Bakersfield
editorialized that the city is "just one flush away from disappearing
altogether." Said Dist. Atty. Ed Jagels of Bakersfield: "We have had
some bad [city governments] in Kern County, but this one takes the
cake."</LD>
<TE>   All the intrigue has divided Arvin into two warring camps. Its
City Council meetings devolve into name-calling sideshows that the
local TV news covers like an ongoing soap opera.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to blame is a matter of vigorous debate from La Mexicana
market to Taps bar, but all sides agree that the feud is charged with
ethnic tension. Some say an interloper from Los Angeles, a Latino, is
stirring up racial hostilities. Others say the strife is nothing more
than the last gasp of a white political machine that refuses to
recognize that the world has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always been a good-old-boy syndrome in this city," said
Lonnie Ferguson, a 58-year-old minister at the Gospel Tabernacle.
"Those in power for years are losing it. Us white folks don't like
that."</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by some of the richest agriculture in the world, this
pinprick on the map holds a special place in California history. It
was an organizing center for Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers union
and one of the UFW's so-called five martyrs was shot and killed in
the fields here.</TE>
<TE>   That history hangs over Arvin as it manages its transition from
white to Latino control in a town that is now 95% Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us to Juan M. Olivares, a 40-year-old pest control
operator from Los Angeles who moved to town four years ago. A
frequently smiling, bombastic man who favors Superman T-shirts and
blue jeans, Olivares has said he decided to run for office after
running into bureaucratic roadblocks when he tried to open a video
store.</TE>
<TE>   "It cost me $400 to paint the building and $1,200 for a permit,"
he said. "I complained. The mayor said 'If you don't like it, run for
mayor.' "</TE>
<TE>   He did and won handily. That was in 2000. He said the
approximately 1,500 votes cast, three times the usual number, proved
that the Latino community had been waiting for someone with a vision.
Opponents said the numbers proved nothing but Olivares' skill at
stealing elections by trucking in noncitizens to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Wraceburn of the district attorney's office headed an
investigation into charges of vote fraud, but "we didn't develop
enough for a case," he said. Still, concerns about the fairness of
Tuesday's election are strong enough that the D.A.'s office requested
the state monitors.</TE>
<TE>   Once in office, Olivares wasted little time making his mark. After
learning that the police were giving tickets to kids who were not
wearing bike helmets, he started giving helmets away free. He handed
out business cards to motorists who complained about moving
violations.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of our officers need to take a course in racial
sensitivity," he said. When the police chief balked at the new
mayor's policies, the chief was fired.</TE>
<TE>   The city also hired J. Arnoldo Beltran as city attorney. In 1999,
The Times reported that Beltran was part of a team that allegedly had
used the threat of recall elections against city councils in the Los
Angeles area to win contracts to represent the cities. Olivares
called Beltran a "great individual" who sponsors medical clinics in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   A widely circulated story, which Olivares has denied, has him
boasting that he would drive all the whites out of town.</TE>
<TE>   To critics, the final straw was Olivares' decision to name the old
county library building for the farm labor organizer Dolores Huerta,
who helped Cesar Chavez create the UFW. Irritating the white farm
families even more, the night he announced his intentions, Olivares
showed up at the council meeting in a red UFW shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this guy figures, 'We're taking over. You whites are old.
Now it's our turn,' " said Mike Kovacevich, whose family has farmed
1,000 acres in the area since 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Kovacevich presented the council with 65 signatures of people
opposed to the name change, but he got nowhere. "Mayor Olivares used
that meeting as a forum to humiliate me," Kovacevich said. "He said,
'What have you done for Arvin?' "</TE>
<TE>   The library name change honoring Huerta went through, but the
meeting galvanized opponents, who began planning a recall.</TE>
<TE>   Joet Stoner, a 25-year-old substitute teacher, put her name in
opposition to Olivares. She criticized his micromanaging style and
called him racially divisive.</TE>
<TE>   The lines of ethnicity in Arvin vanished long ago, except in
Olivares' mind, she said. "In every family in this city there are
interracial marriages," she said. "We aren't picky. We love
everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Stoner is an example. Her mother is white and her father is a
Latino farm laborer who worked all his life in the fields, she said,
while Olivares showed up recently. If anyone is the phony, she said,
it's the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares countered that he toiled in the fields outside Arvin when
Cesar Chavez was active, but Stoner said nobody in town remembers
him.</TE>
<TE>   A cheerful woman with broad features, the candidate takes
personally the attacks on Arvin as a town that has neglected and
abused minorities. Citing herself as an example of how it cares for
the poor, she said she could not have afforded her college education
at Cal State Bakersfield without donations and scholarships from
local civic groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This used to be a quaint little town," she said. But she said
Olivares has tried to run it like a dictator, taking "the
19th-century boss model of government and applying it in the 21st
century."</TE>
<TE>   Stoner is so angry at Olivares that she raided her vacation
savings to pay the $400 to print her candidate's statement.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares contended he is the true representative of an oppressed
Latino community. The people trying to get rid of him are just a
bunch of good old boys, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Olivares said his unscrupulous opponents "know if I get my way,
everybody goes to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody has yet landed behind bars, but the Kern County Grand Jury
has handed down three indictments in its ongoing corruption
investigation. City Councilman Julio Perez has been indicted on a
charge of misusing day-care funds. His first trial ended in a hung
jury.</TE>
<TE>   A city electrical contractor has pleaded guilty to improperly
diverting about $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   And former Police Chief Rande Eighmy was convicted of misdemeanor
theft for taking $3,000 set aside for a police awards dinner.
Coincidentally, Eighmy was the one who first called the D.A.'s office
to report corruption in Arvin.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to emphasize we have not completed what we are doing in
Arvin," said Dist. Atty. Jagels.</TE>
<TE>   He refused to say whether Olivares is a target, but both sides can
hardly wait for the next shoe to drop, so convinced are they that it
will squash their opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Robert Brennan said the mayor had used a city credit
card to hire a private investigator to look into Brennan's past, a
charge the mayor denies.</TE>
<TE>   Brennan himself once spent 18 months in prison for writing a bad
check to support his drug habit. Now he says that "getting locked up
was the best thing that ever happened to me."</TE>
<TE>   The former city manager, Tom Payne, was accused of using city
money to buy and install surveillance equipment in City Hall. Payne,
the owner of Taps bar, said he had installed the equipment to spy on
the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had done it at the request of the police chief and the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Payne interrupted a phone interview to say Olivares had just
pulled up behind his bar in his pickup truck. "Can you hear him
revving his engine?" Payne said. "He's giving me the finger now."</TE>
<TE>   Not so, said Olivares, adding: "I choose not to drive by him,
because he had a gun. And he threatened to kill me." Olivares said
the mud slung at him would not stick. His only excesses, he said, are
his 29 cars, among them a classic Corvette.</TE>
<TE>   He also admitted to plastering the inside of his house with happy
faces.</TE>
<TE>   "I try always to be happy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he's not through nettling the good old boys. "I'm going to
make sure Mr. Kovacevich names a peach after Dolores Huerta."</TE>

<HD>Sky Is the Limit for Beach Ads, Cities Say</HD>
<DH>Environment: Ruling may help them stop banner flights, but
FAA claims sole jurisdiction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A battle is brewing along the Southern California coast over
banner-towing planes advertising everything from liquor to software
companies.</LD>
<LD>   The drone of the planes crisscrossing above the beach is a sign of
summer--and a nuisance to many, who complain that engine noise drowns
out the surf.</LD>
<LD>   For years, beach communities have been stymied in their efforts to
curb the plane noise because airspace is controlled by the Federal
Aviation Administration, which has steadfastly supported the right of
banner planes to operate.</LD>
<TE>   But a recent federal appeals court ruling upholding the right of
Honolulu to ban aerial advertising is giving towns from Laguna Beach
to Manhattan Beach hope that they can impose regulations, or an
outright ban.</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach City Councilwoman Connie Boardman has proposed an
ordinance, similar to Honolulu's, that would prohibit all banner
towing and other aerial advertising over the city's beaches. If
approved Aug. 19, it would probably be a test case in California.</TE>
<TE>   The planes "take away from the experience of the ocean," said Toni
Iseman, a Laguna Beach councilwoman, who is considering a similar
ordinance. "You should hear the roar of the surf, not the roar of the
plane. It's the worst kind of billboard."</TE>
<TE>   But Huntington Beach's proposed ordinance is sure to be fought by
banner plane companies and the FAA, which is not ready to cede
authority over airspace to local governments.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a finished deal, as far as the FAA is concerned," FAA
spokesman Jerry Snyder said of the Honolulu case. "We are going to
pursue this. We still believe the authority to control the airspace
is federal."</TE>
<TE>   Pilots whose business is heavily dependent on the advertising
banners said they would be devastated by a ban. They make $1,000 to
$2,500 per flight.</TE>
<TE>   "Most likely, I would ignore [a ban over Huntington Beach] and it
would go to court action," said Jerry Hider, who runs Blue Yonder Air
Ads, based at Whitman Airport in Pacoima. "I don't have a pilot's
license issued by Huntington Beach. I have a license issued by the
FAA, and I'm bound by what they say I can and cannot do."</TE>
<TE>   Honolulu adopted its ban in 1997 after complaints.</TE>
<TE>   SkySign International, which flew a helicopter with a neon sign
advertising products over Waikiki Beach at night, ignored the ban and
was cited by the city for violating the law. SkySign then sued the
city, saying the airspace was outside the Honolulu city and county
limits.</TE>
<TE>   But a federal court judge ruled last year that the state had an
overwhelming aesthetic interest in what happens in the air because
Hawaii's tourist economy depends on the beauty of the islands. A
federal appeals court upheld the ruling in January.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Van Dyke, a professor of constitutional law at the University
of Hawaii who advised the city, said the company's advertising was
"so obtrusive" that it created ill will. Legally, he said, the city
"can't stop the helicopter from operating, but it can stop it from
gratuitous commercialized advertising."</TE>
<TE>   SkySign eventually went out of business. It was the only company
of its kind there, so there is no aerial advertising in Honolulu, Van
Dyke said.</TE>
<TE>   The rulings open the door for other cities to pass similar
ordinances, Van Dyke said.</TE>
<TE>   "Any community that wants to protect its visual assets [is
covered]," Van Dyke said. "Huntington Beach and Manhattan Beach, if
they're trying to get tourists, it's legitimate for them to try to
limit aerial advertising." Manhattan Beach has instructed staff to
look into the possibility of regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Most banner planes hold waivers issued by the FAA that allow them
to fly lower than 1,000 feet. The federal court reviewing the
Honolulu case noted an FAA handbook that says planes seeking to fly
lower than 1,000 feet must take into account local laws and
ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA's Snyder agreed that the handbook's language amounts to
"tacit acceptance by the FAA that there is some local authority over
regional airspace issues."</TE>
<TE>   But that might change.</TE>
<TE>   "If we revise it and it no longer makes that statement, than it
would surely place the authority within the FAA," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in beach cities say residents often complain about noise
from the banner planes. On holidays, residents say they count as many
as a dozen fly-bys an hour .</TE>
<TE>   "For years, people who live close to the coast have complained
about the noise these planes make," said Boardman. "In the past, our
city attorney has said there is nothing we can do about it."</TE>
<TE>   The Honolulu case, she said, gives the City Council "a good reason
to try to [enact] an ordinance."</TE>

<HD>Democrats Shuffle Budget Proposal</HD>
<DH>Government: Hiking car license fees is out, increasing the
cigarette tax is in. But Republican lawmakers still want to reduce
spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers may not have succeeded in passing an overdue state budget
last week, but Democrats did take steps to diminish Republican
opposition and undercut a key GOP criticism of the plan.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) announced that he was
dropping a proposal to raise vehicle license fees and would instead
seek a massive hike in tobacco taxes.</LD>
<LD>   His strategy shift changes the dynamics of the budget debate by
diminishing two key points of Republican opposition: Under Wesson's
plan, the budget would no longer be balanced on the backs of
motorists, and it would lead to smaller imbalances in the future
between revenue and spending.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the proposed one-year increase in vehicle license fees,
raising the state cigarette tax to $3 per pack is seen as a permanent
increase that would bring in $1.7 billion in the current fiscal year.
The sum could rise in subsequent years when taxes are increased on
other tobacco products, including cigars, but could be diminished if
the hikes cause a sharper drop in sales than analysts predict.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly the tobacco tax is one that voters are more sympathetic
to," said Jean Ross, executive director of the California Budget
Project, which weighs the impact of budget decisions on low-and
middle-income Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that you have a larger share of the tax increase that is
permanent will help address the long-term problem."</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Democrats, who voted to make the changes to the tax
package last week, were quick to capitalize on their decision by
arguing that increasing tobacco taxes would not only help get the
state out of the red, but save lives by causing price-sensitive
smokers, such as teenagers, to cut back.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's personal," said Wesson, a self-described addicted
smoker. "I feel it in my heart and soul; we're on the right side of
the issue."</TE>
<TE>   In another development that could diminish the threat of future
budget holes, Gov. Gray Davis' Department of Finance directed state
agencies to prepare plans to permanently reduce spending in ongoing
programs by 20% next year. If carried out, the cuts would have a
ripple effect that saves the state money in subsequent years</TE>
<TE>   Republicans blocked the tax package last week, but for the most
part steered clear of defending smokers. And while they continued to
call for spending cuts, they were no longer able to cite analysts'
predictions of $50 billion in revenue shortfalls over the next five
years as a reason why programs must be diminished this year.</TE>
<TE>   GOP legislators made an issue out of the state's increasing
reliance on smoking to balance the budget, however. They also
questioned whether the cigarette tax would be a reliable source of
revenue, given that it's expected to reduce smoking rates and could
trigger an increase in smuggling. Democrats contend they already have
taken those factors into account.</TE>
<TE>   "Taxes are not the answer," Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine)
said during a floor debate last week. "Reduced spending is the
answer."</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, nothing in this budget has changed," said
Peter DeMarco, a spokesman for Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox of
Fair Oaks. DeMarco said the spending plan would leave the state's
books out of whack. California's nonpartisan legislative analyst,
Elizabeth Hill, has not adjusted her forecast of a $9.8-billion
budget gap next year to reflect the change in the tax package
proposed last week or the fact that revenues are coming in weaker
than anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   As the budget battle enters its seventh week since the new fiscal
year began July 1, attention is likely to turn to the issue of
additional spending cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have called for enough cuts to wipe out the need for
any tax increases.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats want them to make a compromise offer. In the meantime,
efforts continue to woo four Republicans--the minimum needed to
approve a new budget--to break from their party and join Democrats in
voting for the plan. The strategy worked in the Senate, which
approved the spending package June 20.</TE>
<TE>   In perhaps a foreboding sign, Senate officials notified their
offices last week that the budget can be taken up any time between
Aug. 31--the date the Legislature is scheduled to adjourn--and Nov.
15 without the need for a special session.</TE>

<HD>Hard Times Are Looming for the Caviar Crowd</HD>
<DH>Food: If the import of the overfished beluga is
criminalized, a black market will flourish.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's enough to make a gourmet's stomach turn.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. government may ban prized beluga caviar--the delicate,
shimmery roe once reserved for Russian royalty, the rarest and most
expensive fish eggs in the world.</LD>
<LD>   The fish that lays the eggs--the beluga sturgeon--is on the brink
of extinction. Too many are being pulled from the Caspian and Black
seas and sliced open by fishermen searching for a mother lode of
gunmetal-gray eggs that can sell for $1,500 per pound.</LD>
<TE>   So the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed labeling the
fish "endangered" and banning the import of beluga caviar.</TE>
<TE>   Connoisseurs hasten to point out that beluga is one of three
highly prized Russian caviars and that the other two will still be
available.</TE>
<TE>   Beluga, the mildest, bursts with a crisp, ocean flavor when
pressed against the roof of the mouth. Slightly less pricey than
beluga and lesser known, the other two are ossetra and sevruga, also
named after the sturgeon that bear them. Some enthusiasts prefer the
nutty taste of the ossetra, while others appreciate the tiny-grain
texture of the sevruga.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to compare," said Paul McBride, general manager of the
Petrossian Paris specialty food shop and cafe in West Hollywood.
"It's a lot like wine, where it's all personal taste."</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Americans consumed 15 metric tons of beluga--80% of the
world's legal supply. The illegal harvest is believed to be more than
10 times that.</TE>
<TE>   The eggs can theoretically be removed without harming the fish,
which can grow to 30 feet and more than 2,800 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   But "the most cost-effective way of getting eggs is to kill the
sturgeon," said Pat Fisher, a spokeswoman for the federal wildlife
agency. "It's hard to tell the males from the females, so they kill
them all."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed protecting the fish
last month. The public may comment until late October; the government
is expected to make a decision by August 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Caviar enthusiasts, though disappointed, largely understood why
the move is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "They're raping the Caspian Sea," said Judi Latkin, manager of
Wally's, a Westside wine shop that's one of a few places in the Los
Angeles area to stock the three types of Russian caviar.</TE>
<TE>   At Wally's, jars and tins of high-grade caviar are kept in a
freezer set to 35 degrees. The beluga goes for $68 an ounce. Nearby
are displays of mother-of-pearl spoons and plates for serving the
caviar. It can't be eaten with metal--other than gold, of
course--because it gives the salted roe a tinny taste.</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring that this experience isn't lost forever drives some
caviar enthusiasts to support the ban. "Otherwise, we're not going to
have beluga for our kids or our grandchildren," said Adolfo Alvarega,
deli manager at Wally's. He hopes that once the species rebounds, the
ban will be lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists agreed, noting that the sturgeon population is
so depleted that some scientists believe the fish are no longer
reproducing in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "They're circling the drain," said Lisa Speer, a senior policy
analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council's New York office.</TE>
<TE>   Until the late 20th century, the Soviet Union controlled a
monopoly on the Caspian caviar fishery. "They exerted total control
over the fish," Speer said. "You stuck your thumb in the Caspian Sea
and you were exiled to Siberia for the rest of your life. That
disintegrated when the Soviet Union fell apart."</TE>
<TE>   Now a patchwork of nations claims fishing rights.</TE>
<TE>   Beluga sturgeon, slow to mature and produce eggs, are protected by
an international treaty. But wildlife officials, environmentalists
and the caviar industry itself acknowledge that there is a gross
amount of over-harvesting that feeds the massive black market for
beluga caviar.</TE>
<TE>   It's that black market that worries environmentalists. If the
import of beluga is criminalized in the United States, many people
believe the black market will expand exponentially.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Wilson, executive sous chef at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna
Niguel in Dana Point, said several chefs and vendors have told him:
"If they put a ban on beluga there would still be plenty.... The
black market's so big, they would never not have it."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson is among the chefs who prefer ossetra. But, he said, people
who would rather eat beluga will be disappointed if the proposed ban
becomes reality. "I don't think it's going to cause the demise of the
hospitality industry, but it will affect our clientele," he said.</TE>

agency. "It's hard to tell the males from the females, so they kill
them all."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed protecting the fish
last month. The public may submit comments until late October; the
government is expected to make a decision by August 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "If listed as endangered ... commercial imports, exports ... and
interstate commerce of beluga sturgeon would be prohibited," the
agency announced July 31.</TE>
<TE>   Caviar enthusiasts, though disappointed, largely understand why
the move is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "They're raping the Caspian Sea," said Judi Latkin, the manager of
Wally's, a Westside wine shop that's one of a few places in the Los
Angeles area to stock the three types of Russian caviar.</TE>
<TE>   At Wally's, jars and tins of high-grade caviar are kept in a
freezer set to 35 degrees. The beluga goes for $68 an ounce. Nearby
are displays of mother-of-pearl spoons and plates for serving the
caviar. It can't be eaten with metal--other than gold, of
course--because it gives the salted roe a tinny taste.</TE>
<TE>   Ensuring that this experience isn't lost forever drives some
caviar enthusiasts to support the ban.</TE>
<TE>   "Otherwise, we're not going to have beluga for our kids or our
grandchildren," said Adolfo Alvarega, the deli manager at Wally's.
He, like other caviar lovers, hopes that once the species rebounds,
the ban will be lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists agreed, noting that the sturgeon population is
so depleted that some scientists believe the fish are no longer
reproducing in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   "They're circling the drain," said Lisa Speer, a senior policy
analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council's New York office.
The council, the Wildlife Conservation Society and Sea Web petitioned
the federal government to take action on the beluga sturgeon. "The
question is whether we can rescue them in time," Speer said.</TE>
<TE>   She said a strong management plan to bring back the stock is
necessary. But that is out of American hands.</TE>
<TE>   Until the late 20th century, the Soviet Union controlled a state
monopoly on the Caspian caviar fishery. "They exerted total control
over the fish," Speer said. "You stuck your thumb in the Caspian Sea
and you were exiled to Siberia for the rest of your life. That
disintegrated when the Soviet Union fell apart."</TE>
<TE>   Now a patchwork of nations claims fishing rights.</TE>
<TE>   Beluga sturgeon, slow to mature and produce eggs, are protected by
an international treaty. But wildlife officials, environmentalists
and the caviar industry itself acknowledge that there is a gross
amount of over-harvesting that feeds the massive black market for
beluga caviar.</TE>
<TE>   It's that black market that worries environmentalists the most. If
the import of beluga is criminalized in the United States, many
people believe the black market will expand exponentially.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Wilson, executive sous chef at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna
Niguel in Dana Point, said several chefs and vendors have told him:</TE>
<TE>   "If they put a ban on beluga there would still be plenty.... The
black market's so big, they would never not have it."</TE>
<TE>   Wilson is among the chefs who prefer ossetra. But, he said, people
who would rather eat beluga will be disappointed if the proposed ban
becomes reality.</TE>
<TE>   "For those people who do enjoy it, obviously, it will be missed,"
he said. "I don't think it's going to cause the demise of the
hospitality industry, but it will affect our clientele."</TE>
<TE>   McBride of Petrossian Paris said customers who eat caviar
regularly will probably try the other types. But those who enjoy
caviar rarely--only four or five times a year--are likely to be the
most disappointed if the ban is adopted, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They buy beluga because it's what they know.... They're going to
be the ones who say, 'There's no beluga caviar? Forget it, I don't
want anything.' "</TE>
<TE>   McBride cautions concerned beluga fans not to try to stockpile the
delicacy by freezing it. The eggs' shells will disintegrate, leaking
a goopy black marmalade-like substance.</TE>
<TE>   He added that while he expects the ban to affect business, "I
don't think it's going to kill the market."</TE>
<TE>   "In the industry, we've been talking, and we think it's a good
idea in the long run. Five, 10 years from now, there will still be
caviar to have a business."</TE>

<HD>Bond Effort Revives Valley Theater Plan</HD>
<DH>Culture: If the measure passes in November, a major
performance venue is envisioned.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For decades, Cal State Northridge has kept a plan in the wings to
build a premier performing arts center for the San Fernando Valley.
Now, those plans are moving toward center stage.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's decision by the county Board of Supervisors to put a
$250-million bond measure on the November ballot has resurrected the
long-dormant proposal to open a 1,600-seat center on campus that
would rival other Southern California performing arts venues, such as
those in Thousands Oaks and Cerritos.</LD>
<LD>   The bond is intended to pay for earthquake and fire safety
improvements to museums and arts facilities, and includes $15 million
for the proposed center. University officials said the money would
jump-start an aggressive fund-raising drive to build the $75-million
facility.</LD>
<TE>   If the measure passes, Cal State Northridge and other recipients
would be required to find matching funds from non-government sources.</TE>
<TE>   Campus officials said they would seek higher-education bond money
in future ballot measures to cover most, if not all, of the rest of
the center's cost.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a geographic entity of 1.6 million people, and there is
no major performing arts facility here. I think we need that," said
William Toutant, dean of the arts college at Cal State Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   While there are no blueprints yet, the university envisions a
center that includes not only a theater, but a recording studio, a
lighting lab and design studio, a 130-seat lecture hall, facilities
for the campus radio station and a smaller, 250-seat theater.</TE>
<TE>   Cultural arts advocates are excited by the prospect of a Valley
venue capable of accommodating large-scale musicals, Broadway plays,
national dance companies and symphonic recitals.</TE>
<TE>   But they also caution about potential pitfalls of marketing and
programming.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like in baseball--'If you build it, they will come,' "
said Edmund Gaynes, president of the Valley Theatre League and a
former Broadway actor. "Someone's got to know what they're doing to
get them to come."</TE>
<TE>   Because of its size, the center will likely be able to attract
shows like "Riverdance" or "Tap Dogs" that depend on larger
audiences, Gaynes said, adding that such a venue would not compete
with existing Valley sites, including three small theaters he owns.</TE>
<TE>   "Theaters don't put other theaters out of business," Gaynes said.
"We welcome theaters large and small."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Bianconi, a consultant who does marketing and fund-raising
for commercial theater companies, agreed. "The more people attend
theater and love it, the more they're going to attend other
theaters," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The largest performing arts venue in the Valley is already on the
campus, which has a nationally ranked music program and a highly
regarded theater curriculum. But the market has outgrown it.</TE>
<TE>   "Even now, with our 500-seat theater, our five major attractions
last year were all sold out," Toutant said.</TE>
<TE>   To attend large productions, Valley residents must travel to
places like Royce Hall at UCLA, the Cerritos Center for the
Performing Arts or the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, each of which
contains 1,800 seats.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 6,000-seat Universal Amphitheatre is in the Valley,
it is viewed by theater and classical music fans as a pop concert and
public events stage, rather than a performing arts venue.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't fill that house," Bianconi said. "It's a different
market."</TE>
<TE>   Cal State Northridge's master plan has long envisioned a large
performing arts center. "This is my 28th year at the university, and
this has been on the discussion block since I came here," Toutant
said.</TE>
<TE>   The university's goal, Toutant said, is to bring national and
high-caliber productions to the Valley, to serve the community and
enrich students' education.</TE>
<TE>   He has opened discussions with the dean of the business college to
develop an arts management program that would teach marketing and
promotion.</TE>
<TE>   He sees the performing arts center as a laboratory for the
program.</TE>
<TE>   And, officials hope that the touring groups that pass through
campus will open doors for performing arts students. Alumni who have
made it in show business include opera singer Michelle DeYoung and
Grammy winner Daryl Dragon (of the Captain and Tennille).</TE>
<TE>   "The university serves as one of the major forces for nurturing
the cultural life in the San Fernando Valley," said university
President Jolene Koester. "This performing arts center would be a
gift to the university and to the community."</TE>

<HD>Makers Seek to Recycle TV Sets</HD>
<DH>Waste: Sony and others want to avoid government fees and
rules for disposing of old televisions and computer monitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As California considers imposing a recycling fee on new computers and
televisions to combat a worsening electronic waste problem, three of
America's biggest television manufacturers are stepping up efforts to
devise a private-sector solution.</LD>
<LD>   In response to legislation pending here and in other states,
Panasonic, Sharp and Sony are teaming up with municipalities in
California, Utah and Idaho this fall--and offering to pay to recycle
their products. Participating cities include Los Angeles and San
Diego, and although local governments are free to impose a small
surcharge for collection services, the brunt of the costs will be
borne by the television companies.</LD>
<LD>   With the temporary Electronics Recycling Shared Responsibility
Program, the manufacturers hope to demonstrate that they are capable
of doing their part to safely dispose of televisions and computer
monitors carrying their brand names without what they characterize as
heavy-handed government fees and requirements. The companies, which
have been experimenting with similar programs in the Northeast and
Midwest, are also hoping to learn what it would cost them to finance
a national recycling effort.</LD>
<TE>   "Around the world and increasingly in the U.S., we are facing
potential mandates to collect our products and recycle them" or face
new government recycling fees, said David Thompson, who manages
Panasonic's American environmental division in New Jersey. "What we
are trying to do is to work with other manufacturers and figure out
what the real challenges are."</TE>
<TE>   The move by the television makers comes amid growing political
interest in addressing the nation's electronic waste problem.</TE>
<TE>   In California alone, studies have shown that more than 10,000
televisions and computer monitors are being discarded every day, each
containing 4 to 8 pounds of lead and other potentially toxic
materials. Television makers dispute those figures, citing data from
their own recycling experiments, but acknowledge that the numbers are
substantial.</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the environmental threat, the state last year banned
landfills from accepting any more monitors and televisions, but there
is still no alternative for getting rid of them.</TE>
<TE>   Much of America's electronic waste now makes its way to Asia,
where computers and TV sets are crudely taken apart and scrapped for
parts, polluting ground water and creating public health problems,
environmentalists say.</TE>
<TE>   Legislation by Democratic state Sens. Byron Sher of Stanford and
Gloria Romero of Los Angeles would impose a fee of up to $30 on every
new television and computer monitor sold to pay for recycling. The
bills, SB 1523 and SB 1619, would also require labels on computers
warning consumers of the hazardous materials inside. Similar measures
have been introduced this year in several states and in Congress by
Rep. Mike Thompson (D-St. Helena).</TE>
<TE>   Although it has generated strong support from cities and
environmental groups, the California legislation has garnered stiff
opposition from computer makers and electronic industry trade groups,
and its future is in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the television makers say they realize that they will
soon face fees or have to take a role in recycling their products and
that they want to be part of the solution.</TE>

<LD>Three California Department of Forestry firefighters were injured
Sunday when their firetruck plunged 60 feet down an embankment in San
Bernardino County, according to officials.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the men had critical injuries, and a third firefighter's
injuries were described as moderate, said Officer Karen Faciane, a
spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   The accident occurred about 5:45 p.m. on Interstate 15, south of
the California 138 junction, Faciane said.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the southbound lanes were closed, tying up traffic for
thousands of people, many of them returning from Las Vegas, Faciane
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night traffic was backed up about five miles, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The truck tumbled down the right shoulder of the freeway, breaking
in half, said Steven Roi, who saw the accident. One firefighter was
tossed on the ground and the other two were pinned in the truck, he
said. The firefighters extricated from the truck were airlifted to
hospitals.</TE>

<HD>New Dog Learns Old Tricks</HD>
<DH>Oxnard Police Use Car Dealer's $8,500 Donation to Replace
the K-9 Officer That Was Killed in the Line of Duty</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four months ago, Rudy, an Oxnard police dog, died from a stab wound
after subduing a knife-wielding fugitive.</LD>
<LD>   The dog's death resonated across the community. Hundreds of people
attended his memorial service. Schoolchildren scribbled letters of
condolence. Phone calls poured in from dog lovers.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Thomas felt a need to do more.</LD>
<TE>   A longtime supporter of law enforcement, Thomas, who owns a BMW
dealership in Camarillo, offered to give the department $8,500 to
replace Rudy.</TE>
<TE>   "He just came to us and said, 'I want to buy you a new dog,' "
said Senior Officer Steve Kawaguchi, coordinator of the Oxnard Police
Department K-9 Unit. "Without hesitation, he cut us a check."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a male 3-year-old Belgian Malinois purchased with
Thomas' money began work on the streets of Oxnard, after earning
certification in patrol work and narcotics detection.</TE>
<TE>   Officers named him Beemer in recognition of the luxury car
seller's gift.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tough dog," said Officer J.R. Perez, Beemer's handler.
"He's going to be a good street dog."</TE>
<TE>   The department's K-9 Unit was formed in 1980 and now has six
officers and six dogs. Each pair works four 10-hour shifts a week.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say the dogs, which live with their handlers, play a
vital role by sniffing out drugs and helping apprehend suspects,
often in situations that would require numerous human officers.</TE>
<TE>   The animals, kept in top physical shape, are fed once a day after
their shifts and rewarded with play--not biscuits.</TE>
<TE>   "These dogs are like pro athletes," Perez said. "They love to
work."</TE>
<TE>   Beemer, 78 pounds of taut muscle and quivering energy, showed his
eagerness for the job during a recent training session. Crouched
beside Perez, the dog whined like an engine and fixed his eyes on a
Dodge van used by officers to practice vehicle searches.</TE>
<TE>   "Auto!" Perez yelled. On command, Beemer exploded from his stance
and leaped into the van through an open door. The dog quickly located
an officer disguised as a suspect. Perez shouted a command in
French--one of three languages Beemer responds to--and the dog
returned to his side.</TE>
<TE>   It is a bittersweet pose for Perez, who was Rudy's partner. On
April 19, Perez and Rudy were on patrol when officers were advised to
be on the lookout for Timothy Knight, 20, of Oxnard, who was wanted
on a felony warrant.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, Knight had run from police during a
traffic stop earlier that day and was last seen with a woman in a red
sport utility vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   When Perez pulled over a vehicle matching the description, Knight
got out, allegedly brandished a knife and ran. Perez testified that
he drew his gun and ordered Rudy to apprehend the suspect.</TE>
<TE>   As the dog lunged, Knight allegedly thrust the knife into Rudy's
chest. The dog was rushed to a veterinary hospital but could not be
saved.</TE>
<TE>   At a preliminary hearing in June, Knight's lawyer questioned
whether the dog could have jumped onto the knife. But Perez said that
given the location of the wound, it was not possible.</TE>
<TE>   Knight is awaiting trial on charges of harming a police dog,
resisting arrest, brandishing a weapon at a police officer and
violating probation. He remains in Ventura County Jail in lieu of
$510,000 bail and faces up to six years and eight months in state
prison if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy was the first Oxnard police dog to die in the line of duty.
Pictures of him fill Perez's home.</TE>
<TE>   "There are reminders all the time," he said. "I think of him
pretty much daily."</TE>
<TE>   After Rudy's death, Perez was uncertain whether he wanted to
continue his assignment. But when the initial shock wore off, he
decided to take on a new partner.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks after the incident, Rodney Spicer, who trains dogs for
the department, flew to Belgium to find a replacement. It was no easy
task.</TE>
<TE>   An ideal police dog requires a blend of athleticism, courage, and
hunting and social skills, Spicer said. He looked at 50 dogs before
finding Beemer at a private home near the French border.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to find the good dogs," Spicer said. "You're
looking for Michael Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas downplayed his donation, which covered the price of the
dog, transport and training costs.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt really bad," Thomas said. "We hate to lose any kind of
animal, but especially police dogs. They are so valuable."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Thomas' gift, Oxnard's K-9 Unit has received other
donations since the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo investment manager Kevin Bernzott purchased two
bulletproof vests for the dogs and has offered to buy three more,
Kawaguchi said.</TE>
<TE>   A local dog obedience club raised $2,000 for the unit, and a
second club bought a vest for Beemer.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Kevlar vests are heavy, the dogs probably will not
wear them on patrol. But Kawaguchi said they could be valuable in
SWAT situations and building searches.</TE>
<TE>   "These dogs, they put their lives on the line for us," Kawaguchi
said. "We owe it to them to give them as much protection as you
can--just as you would a regular police officer."</TE>

<HD>Brush Fire Reaches 500 Acres</HD>
<DH>Blaze: About 100 homes in Riverside County are threatened
by the flames, which officials say are out of control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An out-of-control brush fire in Riverside County had grown to about
500 acres Sunday evening, leading to the voluntary evacuation of
about 150 residents and threatening about 100 homes, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The fire was reported about 2 p.m. and was burning near Cherry
Oaks and Calimesa, about 30 miles west of Palm Springs, said Michelle
McClelland, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry.
Three firefighters suffered minor injuries, including heat
exhaustion, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "This fire is growing, and now we're anticipating winds of between
10 to 20 mph," McClelland said. The fire was fueled by dry scrub oak
but officials expected to fully control the flames by Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   The origin was still under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was one of several blazes burning in the state as
temperatures soared above 100 degrees in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   The wildfire that started two weeks ago in eastern San Diego
County was 85% contained. Full containment of the Pines fire was
expected Monday evening instead of Sunday as previously predicted,
said Forestry Department spokeswoman Audrey Hagen.</TE>
<TE>   The Pines fire has destroyed dozens of homes and burned nearly
62,000 acres since it broke out July 29 near the town of Julian. It
spread through parts of Los Coyotes Indian Reservation near the
Cleveland National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   The fire started about 60 miles northeast of San Diego when a
National Guard helicopter looking for marijuana plants clipped a
power line.</TE>
<TE>   More than 35 firefighters suffered minor injuries fighting the
stubborn blaze, which officials said had claimed 37 homes, 116
outbuildings and 169 vehicles. It was 80% contained Aug. 5 before it
jumped a containment line and quickly spread.</TE>
<TE>   Close to 2,500 firefighters remained on the scene, and the cost of
fighting the blaze was estimated at more than $16 million.</TE>
<TE>   Mandatory and voluntary evacuations were ordered for parts of Pine
Hills, North Peak and other areas, but some families were allowed to
return to their homes over the weekend. Those who live in the
northeast portion of the Los Coyotes Indian Reservation were still
being kept away.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, firefighters said they contained the 785-acre Pope fire
in Napa County on Saturday afternoon. Officials cited a man suspected
of starting the blaze with a spark from his gasoline-powered lawn
mower.</TE>
<TE>   No structures were damaged.</TE>

<HD>A Mission Never Accomplished</HD>
<DH>Charity: A Santa Paula family has been feeding and helping
Ventura's homeless for over six years. And it has no plans to stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing fancy about Chamalene Johnson's dining room. There's
a stretch of freeway overhead, a dirt patch underneath and a few
wind-whipped dust clouds.</LD>
<LD>   But then it's really the food that matters.</LD>
<LD>   Every Tuesday for the past year, Johnson, 53, and her family have
used this spot under the freeway overpass at the end of Olive Street
in downtown Ventura to serve hot meals to the homeless.</LD>
<TE>   On a recent afternoon, Johnson, her son Jed and a family friend
went to work setting up a table. Several people who had been awaiting
their arrival quickly shuffled into line, allowing two children and
their mother to get in front.</TE>
<TE>   "Here comes the grub!" one man called out.</TE>
<TE>   The meal that day included chicken, mashed potatoes and
vegetables, with juice and bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   "She serves really good food, and it's homemade," said Justine
Wright, 36, who has been living in her SUV for the last several weeks
with her daughter, Hillery, 10, and son Conrad, 8. "We always look
forward to getting something nourishing."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson does more than just feed the homeless of Ventura, whom she
calls her "children." She also helps them do their laundry once a
month and is always on call to transport them to and from the
hospital, detox center, court or anywhere else they might need to go.</TE>
<TE>   "What she does is really a blessing. Sometimes she brings clothes
and blankets to us," said James Fields, 47, hunched over a plate of
chicken.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's family has been feeding and assisting the homeless in
Ventura for six years.</TE>
<TE>   "Some call me Mom," said Johnson, an ordained minister. "They are
my extended family. If they never had a mom, I want them to feel that
they have one now. Or if they did, I want them to remember what it
was like."</TE>
<TE>   Though the people she helps praise Chamalene's efforts, not
everyone shares her enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Tuesday, police officers arrived at the meal site on
two separate occasions, saying that they had received complaints
about a large gathering of homeless people who were drinking and
urinating in public.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said she's been forced to move four times in six years,
and expects it to happen again. She's been working with Sharon Troll,
a member of the Westside Community Council, to find a new location.</TE>
<TE>   "You'll probably find differences of opinion even among people who
work in social services," Troll said of Johnson's work. "I personally
don't think people should be eating out on the streets."</TE>
<TE>   While plans are in the works to build a permanent, year-round
shelter and service center for the city's homeless, it could be years
before it becomes a reality. No one is certain exactly how many
people are living on Ventura's streets.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Johnson remains committed to her mission.</TE>
<TE>   Before moving to Ventura County in 1996, she and her husband,
Dick, and their children lived in a 3,600-square-foot home on an acre
in Wrightwood. Johnson was happy.</TE>
<TE>   But Dick, who helps run an automotive supply business in Ventura,
wanted a change. "I'd had enough of spending my life working for
something I couldn't afford. I wanted to live simpler," he said. That
meant trading in the big house for a motor home and moving to
Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Chamalene resisted the idea. But after praying about it,
she agreed. It was also at this time, she said, that she felt a
special calling to help the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't easy. One encounter with a transient scared Johnson so
badly that she ran from the person. So she tried a different tack.</TE>
<TE>   She prepared sack lunches, attached a note with some encouraging
words and left them on park benches downtown.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long before she made friends with the people she wanted
to help. Eventually, she began serving meals to the homeless in the
parks.</TE>
<TE>   At first, she served food three times a week, but expenses forced
her to scale back to one meal. She prepares enough for about 50
people. Johnson and her husband estimate that they spend about $100
to $150 on food each week.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the money for the meals program comes directly out of
their own pockets.</TE>
<TE>   "The money that we'd use for house payments or whatever, we can
use for feeding and taking care of people," said Dick Johnson, who
lives with his wife at an RV park in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the expense and the work, Chamalene said she will continue
to feed the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that I'm going to be able to save them," she said,
"but I'm here to love them just the way they are."</TE>

<HD>Rescuers Still There for Maimed 9-Year-Old</HD>
<DH>Recovery: Fire crew remains involved in the life of a girl
who lost her arm. Help includes contact with a prosthetic program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The faces of her rescuers are seared in the memory of 9-year-old
Genesis Avila.</LD>
<LD>   On a Friday afternoon in June, Genesis was waiting for her mother
in her aunt's butcher shop in South-Central Los Angeles when she
became curious.</LD>
<LD>   Her aunt, who was looking after her that day, had warned her
repeatedly to stay away from the meat grinder. But, Genesis said
later, she decided she could be helpful and make hamburger.</LD>
<TE>   When her aunt wasn't looking, Genesis climbed on a bench and put
meat into the chute. It didn't go down, so she tried to push it in
with her hand. The machine grabbed her arm.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers screaming and a platoon of firefighters descending
on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   There was the tall, blond, brown-eyed one ''with the pokey nose.''
He gave her morphine for the pain and fed her oxygen with a ''masky
thingie.'' There was the bald one who told her to be calm, not to
cry, and who laid her on the ambulance bed.</TE>
<TE>   And there was the firefighter who told her in Spanish as they sped
to the hospital that everything would be OK.</TE>
<TE>   ''He was nice, and he was cute.</TE>
<TE>   ''They were all around me. They were all running around to help
me.''</TE>
<TE>   Genesis lost her arm below the elbow that afternoon two months
ago.</TE>
<TE>   The fourth-grader who had shagged balls in the outfield for her
softball team, endured shin kicks for her soccer team and knocked
pins for a bowling team lay in a hospital for 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   The firefighters who had rescued her visited several times,
bringing books and a stuffed Dalmatian named Lucky.</TE>
<TE>   ''You're a very strong girl, and lucky too,'' she remembers one
firefighter told her. Among the frequent visitors was fire Capt. Marc
Segal, 49, who saw the stress in Genesis' mother. Maria Zepeda, 30,
who is single, has an autistic son, a 7-month-old girl and no
insurance. She worried about her daughter's recovery and about her
future--even if Genesis is determined to be upbeat.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, at home in Artesia, Genesis entertained her mother
and a visitor, pretending to be a snake charmer and swaying her arms
as she hummed. She showed her mom she could scratch her head with the
bandaged arm.</TE>
<TE>   ''I am more worried about her future than she would be,'' Zepeda
said. ''She's just a child. She doesn't know what's coming.... What
kind of future will it be?</TE>
<TE>   ''I know she's trying to cheer everybody up, and she hates to see
me cry, but I feel bad for my baby.''</TE>
<TE>   Segal and the rest of the South-Central-based firefighters wanted
to help.</TE>
<TE>   ''I decided to make some calls,'' Segal said. He contacted
Shriners Hospital in Los Angeles, which agreed to accept Genesis into
its Child Amputee Prosthetic Program. The medical care, counseling
and physical therapy will be free and will last until Genesis turns
18, said Cecilia Barrios, director of patient care services.</TE>
<TE>   Genesis ''can't wait to get her hand,'' her mother said, although
she worries how it will look, that it will be too mechanical.</TE>
<TE>   ''I thought it was going to be like a robot hand,'' Genesis said.</TE>
<TE>   Once, she asked: ''Mom, am I going to have nails I can paint in my
new hand like in the other one?''</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Yoshio Setoguchi, medical director of Shriners' child amputee
clinic, said that while some children grieve over the loss of a limb,
others act with a kind of bravado, even joking about it. But when the
prosthesis is fitted ''and it doesn't look anything like what they
were hoping for, reality sets in,'' he said, emphasizing the
importance of counseling.</TE>
<TE>   ''Within reason, we try to make a child believe they can live a
normal, enjoyable, fruitful life and have the same aspirations any
other child would have,'' Setoguchi said.</TE>
<TE>   Genesis remains frustrated that she can't hang from her favorite
monkey bars at the park. Or hold her baby sister very well. She cries
at night from the pain. And she worries about going back to school
''because kids make fun of handicapped kids,'' she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Genesis is trying to learn to do things with her left hand.
She can dress herself and maneuver her bike deftly, a point of pride.</TE>
<TE>   ''She has a lot of inner strength,'' Zepeda said. '' I guess she's
trying to make herself, not just others, feel better. I just hope she
hasn't built up expectations about her hand. But she's strong.''</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters generally try not to become emotionally involved with
victims, Segal said, because cases that end badly could sap morale.
But they are rooting for Genesis.</TE>
<TE>   ''She's a really beautiful child, an independent thinker,'' he
said. ''From what I've seen, she seems to be settled in for the long
haul to overcome this.''</TE>

<HD>2 Abducted Sisters Are Found in Mexico, Unharmed; Man
Arrested</HD>
<DH>Crime: The girls and their mother are reunited. Suspect is
her boyfriend, police say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A San Joaquin Valley man accused of abducting the two young daughters
of his girlfriend was arrested Sunday in Mexico, where the two girls
were found unharmed, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Martin Ruiz, 32, of Coalinga was arrested by Mexican police
working with several U.S. law enforcement agencies, Coalinga police
Lt. Frank Steenport said.</LD>
<LD>   Police traced Ruiz through telephone calls to his brother's house
in Ensenada, where they found him and Ashley and Cindy Campos, 8 and
10.</LD>
<TE>   By Sunday evening the girls had been reunited with their mother at
the border.</TE>
<TE>   The incident triggered an "Amber alert," but the warning system
played no crucial role in finding the girls because they were not
discovered missing for eight hours, Steenport said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident began Saturday at about 5:30 a.m., when the girls'
mother, Josephina Campos, left for work, authorities said. Ruiz, who
had been living with Campos for six years, then allegedly fled with
her daughters.</TE>
<TE>   Steenport said Ruiz and Campos had a history of domestic violence.
Campos was kidnapped by Ruiz last year, but she did not press
charges, Steenport said.</TE>
<TE>   "Something happened at the home, basically, that made him return
to Mexico," Steenport said. "She wanted to end the relationship."</TE>
<TE>   The girls' mother did not discover them missing until she returned
from work in the early afternoon, Steenport said. The Amber system
was activated by the Fresno County Sheriff's Department most likely
after Ruiz had crossed into Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Crash Leaves '90210' Star in Serious Condition</HD>
<DH>Sports: Actor turned race-car driver Jason Priestley hit
two walls during a practice lap.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Priestley, heartthrob of the 1990s TV teen drama "Beverly Hills
90210," was in serious condition Sunday after his car slammed into
two retaining walls during a practice lap at a Kentucky auto race.</LD>
<LD>   The actor's Indy-style car, traveling at nearly 180 mph, hit an
outside wall coming out of the second turn of the final practice lap
for the Kentucky 100 at Kentucky Speedway in Sparta, then spun and
hit an inside wall.</LD>
<LD>   Priestley, 32, was airlifted to the University of Kentucky Medical
Center in Lexington, a trauma center about 82 miles away, suffering
from a concussion, a non-paralyzing spinal fracture, fractures to
both feet, facial lacerations and a broken nose.</LD>
<TE>   Priestley was sedated, but responding to questions, and was placed
on a respirator as a precaution, according to Dr. Henry Bock, medical
services director of the Indy Racing League, the sanctioning body for
the Infiniti Pro Series in which Priestley raced.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no indication that his spinal cord has been damaged in
any way," Bock said. He added that it was not clear whether Priestley
would require surgery to the spinal fracture, which occurred at about
chest height, to the T8 vertebra.</TE>
<TE>   "He did suffer some damage to his face," Bock said. "He broke his
nose during the crash. Again, that's all being evaluated for further
treatment at this time."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley has been a serious race-car driver for 10 years and had
managed to shake the image of a Hollywood dilettante, earning the
respect of race veterans as a competent driver eager to learn the
ropes. His sponsor expressed optimism for his driver's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason's a strong guy, and we have all the confidence when it
comes down to who's going to fight and who's not," said Ronald
Hunter, chairman and chief executive of Standard Management, the
parent company of Priestley's car sponsor, HomeMed Pharmacy. "Jason's
going to be a fighter. As the days unfold, we'll be very anxious to
make sure he's OK. He's a great person, he's good for the sport, and
he's in all our prayers."</TE>
<TE>   Annett Wolf, publicist for the actor, who maintains homes in the
Hollywood Hills and Manhattan, said the injuries won't interfere with
any entertainment projects. "He was in between projects," Wolf said.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anything he was supposed to do that this would
affect."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley's car was last in a train of four cars on the 1.5-mile
oval when his right rear tire hit a patch of "oil dry," an absorbent
used to soak up fluids from the blown engine of driver Ryan Hampton,
according to Roger Bailey, director of the race series.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers had been cautioned by radio to avoid the patch, Bailey
added.</TE>
<TE>   "The car turned immediately right, and he went right into the
wall," Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   After posting speeds of up to 178 mph in previous laps,
Priestley's car had sufficient energy after the first, nearly head-on
impact to rotate, slide across the track and slam head-on into the
inside wall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of those very unfortunate things," Bailey said. "It
could have happened to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   The Dallara chassis, powered by an Infiniti Q45 engine that
produces about 450 horsepower, reacted exactly as it should by
dissipating the energy and protecting the driver, Bailey said.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing took an incredible impact and [the car] did its job
admirably," Bailey said. "The area around the cockpit was relatively
intact."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley was wearing the Hutchens device, an optional head and
neck restraint system in the series.</TE>
<TE>   The race went on as scheduled, and was won by A.J. Foyt IV.</TE>
<TE>   Priestley started racing in the rally and sports-car divisions,
and had been doing well in his first foray into the faster Indy-style
racing series, considered a developmental step for the next
generation of Indy-car drivers.</TE>
<TE>   He had qualified second for Sunday's race, and was considered a
contender in a field that included Foyt, grandson of the four-time
Indianapolis 500 winner.</TE>
<TE>   Priestley finished second at the season-opener at Kansas Speedway,
sixth at Nashville and 13th at Michigan. Despite missing the race, he
is seventh in the series standings, 89 points behind leader Foyt, but
only 38 points out of second place.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the handicap of being a TV actor known for making
sideburns chic again, Priestley's driving record gained him entry
into the close-knit fraternity of race-car drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great guy," said Ed Carpenter, who finished second to Foyt
on Sunday. "He's gotten to know everybody, changed everybody's
opinion of him. He's shown he's a good racer. He qualified second,
he's been running up front [with the leaders]. He's just a good guy."</TE>
<TE>   Off-track, Priestley ran into trouble when he was arrested for
driving under the influence after wrecking his Porsche in the
Hollywood Hills in 1999, for which he paid a $700 fine, served three
months in an alcohol treatment program and received three years'
probation.</TE>
<TE>   Priestley's newly chosen field--the open-wheeled, open-cockpit
racers that are kid brothers to Indy cars--was demanding, with speeds
around 180 mph and little room for error.</TE>
<TE>   "To say I do this as a hobby is disrespectful to the other
drivers, to other teams," Priestley told The Times in an interview
last month. "This is professional racing. We race for money. I've got
another job I do as well, but for a lot of people, this is how they
make their living."</TE>
<TE>   Priestley joined a growing list of Hollywood celebrities who've
tried their hand behind the wheel, including Paul Newman, Gene
Hackman, Robert Carradine, Tim Allen and the late Steve McQueen.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not Jason Priestley the actor, this was Jason Priestley
the race driver, a very competent driver," Bailey said. "To say he
was an actor and shouldn't be driving is absolute [hogwash]."</TE>
<TE>   As for the risk in what he considered a second job, Priestley told
The Times: "When you look at the statistics, I have a better chance
of being injured in my rental car getting to the track than I do in
the race car."</TE>

<CX>   Priestley crash--In a story in Monday's California section about the
crash during the Infiniti Pro Series race that injured "Beverly Hills
90210" star Jason Priestley, information about which driver's car
spilled fluid on the Kentucky Speedway was incorrect. The fluid came
from the car of Ronnie Johncox, not Ryan Hampton.</CX>

<HD>Funds Gap Shows GOP Disarray</HD>
<DH>Voting: Democrats, who hold power, have war chests 10 times
the size of their rivals'. Internal strife, Simon's flagging effort
are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As the California Republican Party struggles to right itself,
Democrats seeking statewide offices other than the governorship have
amassed 10 times as much cash as their GOP counterparts.</LD>
<LD>   Experts cite a variety of reasons for the Republican candidates'
anemic fund-raising, ranging from strife within the party to the
tendency of donors with interests in Sacramento to side with the
party in power.</LD>
<LD>   Several said Republican businessman Bill Simon Jr.'s faltering
campaign is souring contributors who otherwise might send money to
candidates down the ballot.</LD>
<TE>   It all adds up to this: Democrats running for attorney general,
treasurer, lieutenant governor and other statewide offices had a
combined $17.7 million in their campaign accounts, compared with $1.8
million held by Republicans running for those posts, according to
midyear campaign finance statements filed with the California
secretary of state's office.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney helped Republicans by raising money in
the state last week. Visits by President Bush could boost the party's
fortunes further. But the California GOP is in a deep hole. It
reported having $2.8 million in cash, while the California Democratic
Party reported $11.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Money is not the only predictor of a candidate's success. But it
is vital in a state where 30-second television ads often sway the
electorate, and a candidate needs $1.5 million to air a spot for a
week.</TE>
<TE>   "The [California] Republican Party as an institution is in rather
sad shape right now," said a longtime GOP strategist, Ken Khachigian.
"The party and its contributor base are in a state of great
disorganization."</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, the race for treasurer.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic incumbent, Phil Angelides, has $6.11 million in
cash. His Republican opponent, Greg Conlon, a former California
Public Utilities Commission member, who describes himself as a senior
partner at the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, reported having
$28,205.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the race for attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Given the GOP's law-and-order reputation, a Republican could be
elected "top cop," at least in theory. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, the
Democratic incumbent, received 51.5% of the vote four years ago, a
number that suggests he could be vulnerable. But in the money race,
Lockyer is trouncing his Republican opponent, state Sen. Dick
Ackerman of Irvine, with $6.36 million to Ackerman's $61,993, as of
their midyear reports.</TE>
<TE>   Within Republican circles, including among some candidates, there
is a feeling that Simon's recent campaign setbacks have dried up
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that our races are not fully funded, the sneezes
[by the Simon campaign] will affect the 'down-ticket' races,"
Ackerman said. If Simon "is having problems raising money, that would
translate down to the down-ticket races."</TE>
<TE>   Some Republican strategists, speaking on the condition that they
not be identified, were more direct.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon is making it very, very difficult for some of the
lower-ticket candidates to raise money," one top GOP strategist said.
"People are beginning to get the sense that he is a train wreck in
the making. That poisons the well for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   Angelides, Lockyer and Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante are
widely thought to be contemplating running for governor in 2006. If
so, impending changes to campaign finance law add to their motivation
to raise large sums now. New restrictions will kick in after the Nov.
5 election, capping individual donations at $20,000 for gubernatorial
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, however, they can take donations of unlimited size and
use any money they have left over at the end of this campaign for
future statewide races. Campaign finance reports show that the three
Democrats are all accepting donations that would be barred after Nov.
5.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides accepted a $250,000 check earlier this year from a
Sacramento developer, Angelo Tsakopoulos, who has been a longtime
patron of the treasurer and major donor to other Democrats. Lockyer
received $100,000 from Ameriquest Capital Corp., a financial services
firm that has been a significant donor to Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer has also taken large sums from gambling interests--some of
which he regulates--including $36,000 from the California Commerce
Club, $25,500 from the Bicycle Club and $37,500 from the Rumsey band
of Indians, which plans to expand its casino outside Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "Lockyer's philosophy is that he be prepared for this election and
have as many options available as possible in the future," said his
spokesman, Nathan Barankin.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Bustamante took $85,000 from the Operating Engineers
union local based in Alameda and $80,000 from the Viejas Indian
tribe, a casino operator in San Diego County.</TE>
<TE>   Among the incumbent Democrats, Bustamante has the smallest
campaign account, at $2.17 million. And several Republicans contend
that his opponent, state Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz), has at
least a chance of victory.</TE>
<TE>   McPherson, a political moderate running on a slate of generally
conservative Republicans, has raised more money this year than other
"down-ballot" Republican candidates, at $879,000. But Bustamante
still has 2 1/2 times as much cash on hand as McPherson.</TE>
<TE>   While Democrats harbor visions of a November sweep, Republicans
face the task of convincing potential donors that they have a chance
of winning.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates may have a hard sell, at least with donors such as a
San Mateo investor, Sam Bamieh. During the 1990s, he gave hundreds of
thousands to the GOP nationally and in California. He was the largest
individual donor to Gov. Pete Wilson's 1994 reelection campaign at
more than $200,000. But in an interview, Bamieh said a combination of
health problems and discouragement over the party's direction had
prompted him to slow his donations to a trickle.</TE>
<TE>   "We have very serious problems in the party in California," Bamieh
said, adding that, although he will vote, he will not open his
checkbook in 2002. Still, candidates advance their theories about why
they can win:</TE>
<TE>   * McPherson's campaign manager, Ray McNally, contends that voters
"like checks and balances." If Davis leads in polls heading into
election day, the electorate might like the idea of a Republican
lieutenant governor, who could complicate any attempt by Davis to run
for president or vice president in 2004. State law says the
lieutenant governor becomes chief executive if the governor steps
down.</TE>
<TE>   "Every loser has a theory," shrugged a Democratic consultant,
Richie Ross, who represents Lockyer, Bustamante and Assemblyman Kevin
Shelley of San Francisco, the Democratic candidate for secretary of
state.</TE>
<TE>   * State Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), running for state
controller, is relatively well-known, having sought the post once
before. But he has $75,794 and is facing Steve Westly, a wealthy
former EBay executive who has spent $3.4 million on his campaign so
far.</TE>
<TE>   * Gary Mendoza, the Republican running for insurance commissioner
against former Commissioner John Garamendi, might attract Latino
voters, said his campaign manager, Kevin Spillane. And Mendoza has
moderate credentials as a former Wilson administration official, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   * Katherine Smith, running for the nonpartisan office of
superintendent of public instruction against state Sen. Jack
O'Connell (D-San Luis Obispo), is the one woman among major party
statewide candidates on the November ballot. But Smith is the least
well-funded candidate, having just $6,833 in the bank. O'Connell had
$527,452, after spending $3.7 million on the March primary.</TE>
<TE>   * Former Assemblyman Keith Olberg, running for secretary of state,
boasts that he is the one Republican who has more cash than his
Democratic foe, Kevin Shelley. But Shelley had a tough primary fight,
and has raised $964,000 so far this year, compared with Olberg's
$343,000.</TE>
<TE>   Shelley attributes the Republicans' slow fund-raising to
candidates he describes as significantly more conservative than most
California voters. Lockyer's spokesman, Barankin, attributes the
Democrats' advantage to their control of the Legislature and every
statewide office except one.</TE>
<TE>   "The party in power tends to benefit from campaign contributors,"
Barankin said, although he said Republican fortunes could improve if
Bush decided to focus heavily on California campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans place a darker spin on the phenomenon. Khachigian
called the Democrats' fund-raising evidence of a "pay to play" ethos
in Sacramento. "Democrats are in power, and they wield that power in
very traditional ways."</TE>

<LD>An all-day Sunday concert at Verizon Amphitheater in Irvine was cut
short by police as audience members broke into fistfights and threw
chairs and trash cans at one another, police said.</LD>
<LD>   No major injuries were reported by authorities. It is unknown if
arrests were made.</LD>
<LD>   The Beat 100.3 Summer Jam had been underway for several hours when
the crowd became violent, ignoring hip-hop icon LL Cool J's call for
fans to settle down. The show was stopped in the middle of his
performance, after 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said the violence started after security officers tried
to escort out unruly fans. Headliners Nelly and Ja Rule and his
Murder Inc. had yet to take the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really scary," said Jules Cole, 19, of Toluca Lake.
"People were hiding and crying. Everybody started running outside."</TE>
<TE>   While many fans were able to exit without incident, some were
pushed around in the confusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a peaceful event every year for the past nine years,"
Nancy Leichter, general manager of KKBT-FM (100.3), said in a
statement. "It is sad that a few unruly people were intent on ruining
the day for 16,000 people who wanted to enjoy the event."</TE>

<HD>Heroine of the Valley's Revolution</HD>
<DH>Profile: Hairdresser Myra Ferrante says she will fight
until the area gets its independence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The site of Myra Ferrante's humiliation is a wide stretch of asphalt
cut off from Balboa Boulevard in Van Nuys by a chain-link fence
crowned with barbed wire. Dried glass clippings scud along the
ground. Low weeds grow in pavement cracks. Ghosts man the guardhouses
beyond the fence.</LD>
<LD>   If, however, Los Angeles voters on Nov. 5 free the San Fernando
Valley to become its own city, this barren spot might one day be
memorialized as the site of the catalytic event in the new city's
founding.</LD>
<LD>   It was here, at the old Air National Guard site at Van Nuys
Airport, that city officials on July 18, 1998, ejected Ferrante and
more than a dozen others from the Van Nuys Aviation Expo for
collecting signatures on a petition for a feasibility study of Valley
secession.</LD>
<TE>   It was Valley secession's Boston Massacre. Although bloodless (if
you don't count the blood that rose in Ferrante's cheeks), it
inflamed separatist passions and embarrassed the city's power
structure. More practically, it resulted in the city paying $45,000
to the cash-starved, fledgling secessionist group Valley VOTE, in
settlement of a federal lawsuit. It also prompted the state
Legislature, in compensation for the petitioners' lost chance to
canvass the scores of thousands who attended the air show, to give
Valley VOTE an extra three months to collect signatures, which
virtually assured the group would have enough to force a study and,
as matters unfolded, this November's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrante is a 57-year-old hairdresser who lives in Tarzana. Her
native Long Island still inhabits her speech, though she and her late
husband moved to Los Angeles 33 years ago, and to the Valley a year
later.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, her tidy little BMW pulled off Balboa
Boulevard at the fenced airport entrance, and Ferrante climbed out,
wearing the bright red "Valley VOTE" T-shirt she wore that fated
morning four years ago. Her eyes swept the empty tableau. "It looks
so different now," she said. "There were so many people here then."</TE>
<TE>   Around 11:30 a.m. that day, she arrived to find other Valley VOTE
petitioners milling about the entrance. They told her they'd been
kicked out. Ferrante went inside with a colleague to demand an
explanation from airport police. "The police officers said they had
direct orders that we were not to be on the property, not to take
petition signatures, not to talk to people. We asked what would
happen if we refused, and they said, 'You will be arrested,
handcuffed and placed in jail.' Pretty incredible, huh?"</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, the petitioners tried to collect signatures outside the
gate, she said, "but it was chaotic. We had to be way out here"--she
walked to the edge of the traffic on Balboa Boulevard--"off the
property. Then they said we were blocking the exit and causing a
traffic problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't use the bathroom. We couldn't get water. It was
getting hot. One woman in her 60s asked if she could use the
bathroom, and a police officer told her, 'If you want to come in, you
have to take off that T-shirt.' She said, 'But, I've only got a bra
on underneath.'</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm a pretty tolerant person, but I got ticked off when
they told me to leave. I got ticked off when they wouldn't let me
exercise my constitutional rights that my forefathers fought for
hundreds of years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrante's secessionist convictions have roots, however, not in
constitutional considerations, but in grievances that are more
concrete, in some cases, literally.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the morning, as a breeze mussed the leaves of the ash
trees in her neighborhood four miles from the airport, Ferrante stood
in the middle of Etiwanda Avenue and probed the dilapidating pavement
with the toe of her running shoe. An asphalt chunk about the size of
a baseball lifted from the surface.</TE>
<TE>   She pointed out a large ash in front of her carefully maintained
house. Its roots had badly upheaved the sidewalk. A large limb had
parted ways with the trunk during a storm. City workers had simply
carted the fallen bough away and left the splintered stump sticking
out from the trunk like an imploring hand.</TE>
<TE>   Ferrante strode up Etiwanda alongside well-kept homes and neat
lawns. She stopped at a vacant lot between two houses, and walked
onto it, past dry, waist-high weeds that rattled in her wake, past a
torn black-and-white loveseat, past a rusted bed frame, a toppled
artificial Christmas tree, a stack of concrete blocks, a pile of old
wood, some of it charred. Burrs stuck to her slacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've called the city, the Fire Department, Building and Safety,"
she said. "I've called and called and called. No one notifies the
owner. No one can seem to catch the dumpers.</TE>
<TE>   "If this is happening in a middle-and upper-middle-class
neighborhood, what's happening in the poor neighborhoods? I feel
sorry for them, I really do."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrante is unconvinced by the recent flurry of city-maintenance
activity she's noticed in the Valley lately--streets being swept on
Saturdays, trees being trimmed on Sundays, bushes being cropped along
freeway exits "for the first time in 15 years." All this she called
"icing on a bitter-tasting cake." If voters defeat secession, she
predicted, things will return to the "same ol' same ol'."</TE>
<TE>   When Ferrante and her husband first came to the Valley, they
bought a ranch in Chatsworth. Those days are an idyll in her memory.
"My daughter used to ride her pony to school," she said. "It was
safe, quiet, no graffiti, no trash."</TE>
<TE>   Beneath her concerns beats something not uncommon among longtime
Valley residents as they consider breaking ties with Los Angeles. It
is a feeling that the city, grown immense, its authority structure
calcified and beset by numberless urban woes, has lost all regard for
the care-taking ethic that has been the soul of suburban life in the
Valley for 2 1/2 generations.</TE>
<TE>   Secession, she has become convinced, is the only plausible remedy
left. "And if it doesn't succeed this time," she said, "it will come
back again, and I'll be out working hard and collecting signatures
all over again."</TE>

<HD>South Pasadena Hopes to Create Town Square</HD>
<DH>Redevelopment: City hires a design firm to plan the
transformation of a downtown parcel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With its still-working corner soda fountain, historic Craftsman homes
and "festival of balloons" parade on the Fourth of July, South
Pasadena has always been a quaint, cozy suburb.</LD>
<LD>   But one thing has always been missing from the city snuggled at
the western end of the San Gabriel Valley: a town square.</LD>
<LD>   Plans are underway, however, to transform land in downtown South
Pasadena into a sort of central piazza.</LD>
<TE>   The district, bounded by Fair Oaks Avenue, Mission Street, Mound
Avenue and Oxley Street, was included in a larger redevelopment zone
created in the late 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the city of 25,000 has floated a number of proposals
for the district--including one that would have involved razing the
entire area and another that would have built a 150-room hotel on the
site. But none has taken off.</TE>
<TE>   City officials hope that, this time, things will be different.</TE>
<TE>   They have hired the Ratkovich Co., a Los Angeles-based urban
design firm. With Ratkovich's "reputation for urban renewal, we are
hoping that we can get something going here," said Mayor Harry Knapp.</TE>
<TE>   The Ratkovich Co. envisions transforming the area, now a series of
open-air parking lots bordered by different styles and types of
businesses, into something akin to the One Colorado development in
Old Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   But don't expect South Pasadena to become a teeming destination
for out-of-towners.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a development which is intended to primarily serve the
citizens of South Pasadena, not a regional attraction like Old
Pasadena," said Wayne Ratkovich. "It will be focused on South
Pasadena." The new area, he said, will be "the village center for
South Pasadena ... a kind of core and heart to the city."</TE>
<TE>   The project is in the first of three phases. Still to come are a
feasibility analysis and a final plan. The project would be financed
by bond money and tax revenue from the redevelopment area.</TE>
<TE>   One goal is to safeguard the city's past, and historic structures
within the redevelopment zone would be preserved or restored. Eminent
domain--the government condemnation of private property for the
public good--will not be used, Knapp said. Businesses would decide
whether to participate in the redevelopment.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to leave as many of the existing structures as
possible," Ratkovich said, "and focus on areas where open space can
be converted to a village or courtyard area."</TE>
<TE>   The Ratkovich Co. hopes that the village would include retail,
residential and office spaces. "It would be like the corner of Main
and Main," said Ratkovich Vice President Clare De Briere. "Something
that would be a community meeting place and would provide services
and product that aren't there now: things like restaurants, a men's
haberdashery, an upgraded movie theater. A great bookstore."</TE>
<TE>   The developers said they would listen carefully to the needs and
expectations of the city.</TE>
<TE>   At a June meeting, City Council members expressed concerns about
the density of the development and the kind of parking proposed by
the company. A four-level structure with three levels above ground,
one councilman said, was not in keeping with the small-town character
of South Pasadena.</TE>

<HD>City's Having a Field Day Over Its New Green</HD>
<DH>Sports: Hundreds in San Juan Capistrano cheer the
renovation of its Depression-era park, in heavy demand by local
soccer players.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 500 mostly Latino residents of San Juan Capistrano showed
up at Stone Field on Sunday, surprised to see that the once-scroungy
playing area--so full of rocks that their children often got
hurt--was a flat swath of soft, green grass.</LD>
<LD>   "It looks so good, it's hard to believe it's real," said Heliodoro
Ortiz, whose 8-year-old son was among the many young soccer players
christening the playing field.</LD>
<LD>   Swarms of boys and girls joined soccer clinics run by local
coaches with help from Los Angeles Galaxy forward Isaias "Chi"
Bardales and Andrew Kartunen, goalkeeper for the U.S. Soccer
Federation under-18 team. While they played, adults were treated to a
variety of tamales donated by 12 area restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   The renovation of the city's Stone Field, built during the
Depression in the shadow of the city's historic mission and used by
about 1,200 soccer players a week, was seen as a welcome recognition
of the growing Latino influence in this southern Orange County city.</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they were pleased to work with the Latino
community on the project. On Sunday, Mayor Diane Bathgate thanked
them in Spanish. Among the city's roughly 34,000 residents, there are
at least 10,200 Latinos, an increase of 84.9% since 1990, according
to the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the well-groomed field, new restrooms replaced the
portable toilets. And for the first time, fans and players have a
drinking fountain.</TE>
<TE>   The $767,500 worth of improvements were funded mostly by a grant
from Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo.</TE>
<TE>   Although happy with the new field, some community leaders are
concerned that it might become too popular among soccer aficionados.</TE>
<TE>   "This is graduation day," exclaimed Eleazar Gonzalez, vice
president of the San Juan Youth Soccer League. "We're so happy that
our field looks so good. But we are also scared. There's a lot of
fear it won't stay this way long."</TE>
<TE>   League officials worry that eager soccer players, who have so few
places to play, may overuse the field if regulations are not adopted
to limit its use. City employees will be enforcing a schedule that
will be determined by them and league leaders.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to create a system that people will respect and that
will ensure that the field is not destroyed," said Juan Pena, the
founder of the youth soccer league, who used to water the field
himself.</TE>
<TE>   The field has been closed for nearly a year while crews put in
irrigation systems, drainage, athletic turf, goals, trees, restrooms,
a shaded picnic area, bleachers and security lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "We've done everything we can with the design, and we'll work on
scheduling to make sure it holds up," said Joe Mankovich, a city
engineer who oversaw the renovation.</TE>
<TE>   Already, there is talk of limiting or even banning adult players.
A meeting between league and city officials is scheduled for this
month.</TE>
<TE>   And the results could change the way soccer is played in the
mostly working-class Villa Capistrano neighborhood across the street
from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Friends who sought pickup games there could be turned away if
their games are not scheduled in advance. And the field will be
closed two days a week so the grass can recuperate from hard play.</TE>
<TE>   No one is complaining too loudly.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love to play here, but if they let us, I really fear the
field will not last two months," said Manuel Pedraza, a Villa
resident who plays soccer on the days he's not working at a Santa
Margarita factory. "This is a community asset, and we want to protect
it."</TE>

<LD>In California's calendar of natural risk, January and February bring
to mind floods, not wildfires.</LD>
<LD>   Yet last February in San Diego County, fire destroyed 45 homes and
scorched nine square miles. In January 2001, also in San Diego
County, a tossed cigarette exploded into a blaze that gutted six
homes.</LD>
<LD>   Given such rainy-season fires, it makes no sense to state Sen.
Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) that, from December through March, the
state typically pulls its firefighting planes back to Sacramento for
maintenance.</LD>
<TE>   He has written a bill that would require the California Department
of Forestry and Fire Protection to keep two air tankers--the hulking
planes that can drop five tons of fire-choking retardant at a
time--based in Southern California through the winter and ready to
attack at a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow said he shouldn't have to pass legislation to accomplish
what he thinks the department should be doing as a matter of good
policy.</TE>
<TE>   The $1.6-million annual cost of keeping two air tankers at ready,
he said, "is nothing for something that is a matter of public safety,
lives and property."</TE>
<TE>   But state firefighters, who protect much of California's private
wild lands, say that, while two to six air tankers are typically
based in Southern California from April through November, the number
of acres burned in the region each winter does not warrant keeping
active a crew of 14 people to service, load and fly the planes. Air
tankers would not have helped in the initial attack on the two San
Diego County fires because it was too windy for aircraft, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "Our experience is, we're able to put out the fires in the winter
with the resources available to us," said Louis Blumberg, the
Department of Forestry's deputy director for communications and
legislation. "We think it's not the best use of the state's
resources."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials also view Morrow's bill as an unnecessary intrusion
by the Legislature into the specialized job of deploying people,
planes and helicopters around a flammable, populous state.</TE>
<TE>   They say they fear a precedent that would have lawmakers jockeying
to dedicate some of the state's 23 air tankers, nine helicopters and
13 tactical planes to their districts.</TE>
<TE>   "These are statewide assets, and they have to move where they're
needed," said James M. Wright, the department's deputy director for
fire protection. "We've got to be able to run our fire department. We
appreciate all their support, but we also want their understanding
that this is our business."</TE>
<TE>   Morrow's bill, SB 2020, passed the Senate Natural Resources
Committee on a 6-2 vote Tuesday and goes next to the Senate
Appropriations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   It would dedicate $1.6 million each year from the state budget to
keeping two air tankers and one tactical plane, used to direct aerial
firefights, based somewhere between Santa Barbara and the Mexican
border.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pay now or pay later," said Dianne Jacob, a San Diego County
supervisor. "What we're saying is, put up the money, station the air
tankers here for those extra four months. It's a good fiscal
decision, and it may save lives and property."</TE>
<TE>   Blumberg said air tankers can always be flown from Sacramento to
Southern California in an hour and a half, and pilots are on call,
even in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, air tankers aren't always the best way to attack a fire,
he said, and cannot be flown safely on days when winds exceed 35 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Late-season fires in Southern California tend to be driven by wind
rather than a tinder-dry landscape, said Matt Mathes, a spokesman for
the U.S. Forest Service, which protects the one-fifth of California
designated as national forest.</TE>
<TE>   "In general, our contracts for air tankers and helicopters run
from June 1 until about mid-November," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If fire conditions warrant, on a case-by-case, year-by-year
basis, we can bring them on early or keep them late."</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 10, the day a brush fire swept through avocado groves and
mansions in Fallbrook, it was too windy to use an air tanker on the
initial attack, Blumberg said, although a tanker arrived from
Sacramento the following day.</TE>

<HD>DUI Arrest Follows Tustin Crash Killing Two</HD>
<DH>Roads: A van ran three red lights, police say. Witnesses
say they knew the crash would be fatal.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two women were killed near Tustin on Sunday night when a drunk
driving suspect ran a red light and plowed into their car, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the suspect's van was northbound on Newport Boulevard
and had already run two red lights when it ran a third red light and
broadsided a Toyota Corolla at Cowan Heights Drive and Rockhurst
Avenue in Cowan Heights about 6:40 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The two women in the Toyota, which was hit as it turned onto
southbound Newport Boulevard from Cowan Heights Drive, died at the
scene, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Police withheld the victims' names until their next of kin could
be notified, but they described the driver as a 24-year-old from
Whittier and her passenger as a 38-year-old from Garden Grove. The
passenger had three children, according to California Highway Patrol
spokeswoman Colleen Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said the sister of the Toyota's driver was driving
behind her and saw the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson said the driver of the van was arrested on suspicion of
felony drunk driving. Police were trying to identify him and his
passenger late Sunday night. Both were treated for minor injuries at
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Felde, 37, said he was driving behind the van and witnessed
the collision.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a direct broadside to the driver door," he said. "When I
watched the car get hit, I knew the driver could not survive."</TE>
<TE>   Felde said he saw the van run two red lights before the crash and
that he was frantically honking his horn to try to make it stop.</TE>
<TE>   After the collision, Felde said, he ran to the van to turn the
motor off and saw what he described as a very young driver lying
between the two captain's chairs in the front, looking around
vacantly. He said the driver and an older passenger appeared to be
intoxicated.</TE>
<TE>   Dionne Watkins, 19, said she was riding in a truck with her
brother on their way home from church when the van crashed into the
Toyota, spun out, then hit their car.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the scariest thing I have ever seen," she said. "When we
saw it, at that point we knew those ladies were dead."</TE>
<TE>   A portion of Newport Boulevard was closed during the police
investigation.</TE>

<HD>Separated Twins Increasingly Alert</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Guatemalan twins born joined at the head and separated last week
during a marathon operation were more alert Sunday with both girls
moving their hands and legs, UCLA hospital officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Maria de Jesus Quiej and Maria Teresa Alvarez were in critical
condition with stable vital signs in the pediatric intensive care
unit of UCLA's Mattel Children's Hospital, said Roxanne Moster,
hospital spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   "Maria de Jesus is much more alert and actually looking around,"
Moster said. "Both are now receiving intravenous nutrition and are
tolerating it fairly well."</LD>
<TE>   Physicians took more than 22 hours to separate the heads of the
1-year-old girls who shared bone and several key blood vessels but
had separate brains. On Sunday their heads remained heavily bandaged.</TE>
<TE>   Physicians theorized that Maria de Jesus might be making more
progress than her sister because she hadn't undergone five extra
hours of surgery that Maria Teresa endured to remove a buildup of
blood on her brain, Moster said. Both girls had opened their eyes and
responded to stimuli.</TE>
<TE>   The girls have begun to move their hands and legs and have become
more alert as physicians steadily reduced their sedation, Moster said</TE>
<TE>   The parents, Wenceslao Quiej Lopez, 21, and Alba Leticia Alvarez,
22, brought the twins from Belen, Guatemala, an impoverished town
about 120 miles from Guatemala City with limited electricity and no
running water.</TE>
<TE>   They arrived in Los Angeles on June 7 and celebrated their first
birthday July 25. The surgery that began last Monday and ran into
Tuesday required a team of 50 people, UCLA officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Doctors say [the girls] still have a lot of hurdles to overcome,
but they are cautiously optimistic about their recovery," Moster
said.</TE>

<HD>Colleges to Share Federal Grant</HD>
<DH>Education: Funds will benefit Latino students at Ventura,
Santa Maria schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA BLANCHARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura College again has been awarded a five-year federal grant to
enhance its educational programs for Latino students and improve its
bilingual student outreach.</LD>
<LD>   The grant of nearly $3 million will be shared with Allan Hancock
College in Santa Maria. Under the terms of the grant, the two schools
will cooperate on projects to better serve their respective Latino
populations.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura College, which was awarded a similar grant last year, will
receive about $250,000 a year from the new grant. College officials
at both campuses are excited about the opportunity to expand their
"distance education" programs, which allow more students to study
from home or other off-campus locations by participating in Web-or
television-based courses.</LD>
<TE>   "The distance education program, which is fledgling now, will
really start to blossom," said Gary Van Meter, a resource development
coordinator for Ventura College. "We're behind the rest of the
education world in offering that."</TE>
<TE>   Distance education courses could be offered jointly by the two
colleges and would allow them to offer a wider variety of classes.
For example, there might not be enough interest at either campus to
offer an advanced French course. But by offering it as a distance
education course, students from both campuses could participate.</TE>
<TE>   College officials also have earmarked funds to create
Spanish-language versions of their Web pages, develop a promotional
cable television video to generate interest in the Latino community
about attending college and expand dual-credit enrollment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Through dual-credit enrollment, high school students can sign up
for a college course and earn both college and high school class
credit at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Funding for the federal grant came from a pool of $86 million
allocated for the Title 5 program, which aims to help colleges with
large Latino populations better serve their students. A little more
than 30% of Ventura College's 12,581 students and 30% of Allan
Hancock College's nearly 15,000 students are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Competition for the Title 5 grants is fierce; the cooperative
arrangement grant won by Ventura College and Allan Hancock College
was among only six such grants to be awarded this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing everything pretty much through a joint effort," said
Cheryl Dettrick, director of institutional grants at Allan Hancock
College.</TE>
<TE>   Budget woes caused Ventura College to search for grants to
supplement state funding, Van Meter said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't have the discretionary funding to be able to
provide all the things we'd like to and need to do," he said. "Grants
and contributions are about the only way we can start up new programs
and replace old technology."</TE>
<TE>   A five-year, $2.1-million Title 5 individual development grant
awarded to Ventura College last year has allowed the school to work
at improving Latino students' academic performance and expand
programs at its east campus in Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Using funds from the new grant, college officials plan to create a
full-time grant writer position. The college also plans to look into
grants from corporations and foundations.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to keep the grant money rolling in, according to Van
Meter.</TE>
<TE>   "Our budget gets tighter and tighter each year, and grant money is
increasingly important," he said.</TE>

<HD>Ad Campaign Will Discourage Over-Watering of Lawns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid a Southern California heat wave, the Metropolitan Water District
has launched a conservation campaign aimed at urging people not to
over-water lawns and plants.</LD>
<LD>   "Our focus is to try to make people conscious about how we use
water outdoors," said Adan Ortega, a district spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   "We're loving our plants to death by over-watering them," Ortega
said.</LD>
<TE>   Excessive watering is especially harmful because the region is
experiencing its driest year in history, Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Southern California is not in a drought, the record low
amount of rain has raised concerns about supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Officials stress, however, that the region has enough water
reserves to see it through three dry years, if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea now is to keep our reserves high," Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   The focus on outdoor water waste is a slight shift from the
tactics used during the early 1990s, when officials urged people to
reduce indoor water use by replacing inefficient toilets and turning
off faucets while brushing teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Newspaper advertisements and television, radio and movie spots
will appear in the coming weeks. Slogans will include "Don't drown
your plants" and "Conservation can be beautiful," Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   The ads will direct people to the district's Web site,
www.mwdh2o.org, for tips on how to save water and keep lawns and
plants alive.</TE>
<TE>   The site also offers information about how to create an attractive
landscape using native Southern California plants, which need less
water than popular nonnative varieties such as ivies and ice plants,
Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   The average resident could save $225 a year by not over-watering.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd save enough water to supply a medium-sized city like San
Diego," he said.</TE>

<HD>Hospitals Seek Share of Blood Industry</HD>
<DH>Health: Across the U.S., rising prices lead to regional
challenges of Red Cross control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>With health-care costs soaring and hospitals looking for ways to cut
expenses, skirmishes are being fought from California to the
Carolinas for control of a $2-billion industry: the collection and
sale of blood.</LD>
<LD>   The need for blood remains fairly constant in the U.S., at about
34,000 pints a day. But the price has escalated dramatically, to
nearly $200 a pint in some areas, and supplies are unsettlingly low
in many regions in the wake of a traditionally slow summer donor
season and a patriotic rush to donate, which turned out to be
unneeded, after September's attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade
Center.</LD>
<LD>   In protest against rising prices, 10 Charlotte-area hospitals last
month took an unusual step that is likely to heighten competition and
aggressive marketing in the blood business. They said they were
breaking away from their traditional supplier, the American Red
Cross, and forming their own center for collecting and processing
blood in an 11-county area with a population of 1.5 million.</LD>
<TE>   The decision, hospital administrators said, was largely a business
one, because the price per pint had almost doubled in the region
since 1999. They believe they can market blood for $150 a pint,
saving $3 million a year. They also want to keep control of the
community blood supply in the community, and they said decisions made
in Washington or St. Louis by a large, bureaucratic organization such
as the Red Cross were not always in the best local interests.</TE>
<TE>   "In today's climate, hospitals have to watch costs in all facets,"
said David Anderson, vice president for ambulatory and ancillary
services at Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill, S.C. "Blood is a
product like anything else. We shop around to get the best price on
everything. But with blood there was nowhere we could shop. It turned
out the only way to compete was to do it ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The last time a group of hospitals took such a step was in
Springfield, Mo., seven years ago. The Red Cross responded by suing
the new facility, charging theft of trade secrets and improper
business practices. The case was settled confidentially in 1999 and
the Community Blood Center of the Ozarks has emerged as the
predominant supplier in southwest Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   Battles also have been fought in California, where HemaCare Corp.
of Sherman Oaks--a for-profit company in a health-care sector still
dominated by nonprofits--sued the Red Cross in 2000, alleging it
undercharged for blood products in Los Angeles, where there is
competition, and overcharged in areas where it had a monopoly. The
Red Cross called the suit meritless; the case is pending.</TE>
<TE>   In Albany, N.Y., St. Peter's Hospital recently contracted with
Coral Blood Services, a subsidy of HemaCare, ending a long
relationship with the Red Cross. North Carolina hospitals in Raleigh
and Winston-Salem are considering following Charlotte's lead in
setting up community blood banks.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours was the first long-term move away from the Red Cross for
many years, but I think this is just the beginning," said Tom
Hassett, vice president of Carolinas Healthcare System in Charlotte.
"We talked with the Red Cross and said the escalating prices were
unacceptable and the product selection was not what we wanted. They
basically said, 'Tough. You're free to seek blood elsewhere.' "</TE>
<TE>   Red Cross spokesman Rick LeGrand said the agency's average charge
for a pint of blood last year was $182 nationally. He said the Red
Cross supported moves that would get more people to donate blood but
feared that Charlotte's blood center might just move donors from one
group to another, thus not increasing the donor base. He also said
blood collected in one of the agency's 36 regions was first offered
to meet regional needs before consideration was given to moving it
for out-of-area shortages.</TE>
<TE>   "Blood products represent less than 2% of a hospital's overall
operating costs," he said. "If you start questioning $30 to $40 per
unit of blood, when you may need three units for a $25,000 open-heart
procedure, it seems a little out of context."</TE>
<TE>   What the nation's major blood suppliers--the Red Cross and
America's Blood Centers, a network of 75 independent blood banks--do
agree on, however, is that there is room for competition because the
donor base is so small. Although 60% of the U.S. population is
eligible to donate, only 5% does so on a yearly basis.</TE>
<TE>   Typically donors are middle-age or elderly; 94% are registered
voters, according to surveys. But as traditional donors die or give
blood for their own surgeries, younger Americans are not rolling up
their sleeves to fill the gap, though in most states anyone who is 17
or older, in good health and weighs at least 110 pounds is eligible.
The reasons they most often give are "never thought about it" or "too
busy," a poll by America's Blood Centers found.</TE>
<TE>   Though hospitals like to have a three-to five-day supply on hand,
some have found themselves this summer with only a one-day supply.
Shortages have forced some hospitals in New England to cancel
elective surgeries and have affected about half of the Red Cross'
regions and a third of America's Blood Centers locations. With blood
having a shelf life of only 42 days, the nation's major blood
organizations issued an appeal for more donors in June, saying the
shortage was significant and increasing.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago the Red Cross publicly proclaimed its desire to
capture 65% of the blood industry's market share. Earlier, it had
been criticized by the federal Food and Drug Administration for
quality and safety problems in its blood supply and had spent $287
million to overhaul its processing facilities. The overhaul included
new testing for a host of blood-borne diseases and providing only
leukocyte-reduced blood. The process of filtering out the white cells
can add as much as $40 to a pint of blood.</TE>

<DL>GRANTS PASS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Higher humidity and favorable wind Sunday helped firefighters trying
to corral the northern end of Oregon's largest wildfire in more than
a century.</LD>
<LD>   Northeast winds helped crews set controlled fires during the night
to remove fuel from the path of the 333,890-acre blaze.</LD>
<LD>   "It's kind of burning back onto itself on the slopes," U.S. Forest
Service spokesman Nigel Baker said. The fire was about 25% contained,
said Carol Tocco of the Northwest Interagency Coordination Center.</LD>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the Northwest, a fast-moving fire just across the
Columbia River Gorge near Murdock, Wash., was under control,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Murdock's 400 residents were evacuated Saturday night, but
residents were allowed to return Sunday morning. Four houses, three
outbuildings and some vehicles burned.</TE>
<TE>   While the weather helped fire crews on the northern side of the
Oregon fire, conditions were less favorable on the eastern flank,
where hot, dry weather was forecast into the week.</TE>

<HD>Scientist Angrily Denies Role in Anthrax Attacks</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Steven J. Hatfill denounces FBI for its
handling of his case. He is not an official suspect, but a 'person of
interest,' bureau says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GETTER and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A bioterrorism specialist whose home has twice been searched for
clues to last fall's anthrax killings lashed out at the FBI and
publicly declared his innocence Sunday, saying he had "never ever
worked with anthrax in my life."</LD>
<LD>   In a news conference outside his lawyer's office, Steven J.
Hatfill affirmed his loyalty to America, and his horror when the
tainted letters killed five people and made at least 13 others ill.
In strained tones, he also described the nightmare he has endured
since his name surfaced in the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "I acknowledge the right of the authorities and the press to
satisfy themselves as to whether I am the anthrax mailer. This does
not, however, give them the right to smear me and gratuitously make a
wasteland of my life in the process. I will not be railroaded,"
Hatfill said.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a loyal American and I love my country. I've had nothing to
do in any way, shape or form with the mailing of these anthrax
letters."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has never identified Hatfill as a suspect in the case,
though it has called him "persons of interest." Nevertheless, agents
recently have ratcheted up their interest in the 48-year-old
bioweapons researcher, who worked at the Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases at Ft. Detrick, Md., from 1997 to
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing publicly for the first time Sunday, Hatfill described
how FBI searches of his home--one voluntary, one with a warrant--were
turned into media circuses, complete with helicopters and television
cameras, and how FBI agents "manhandled" his girlfriend when her
apartment was searched.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill's attorney, Victor M. Glasberg, also alleged that the FBI
leaked to ABC News information collected during one of those
searches: Hatfill was writing a novel about bioterrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service and other federal law
enforcement agencies involved in the investigation had no official
comment Sunday in response to Hatfill's news conference.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all part of an ongoing case. Nobody has been charged. Beyond
that, there is nothing we can say," FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said.</TE>
<TE>   While Hatfill's is the only name that has been mentioned in the
media, one senior federal law enforcement official said he was among
about 20 scientists who are considered "persons of interest" based on
their specific scientific knowledge and access to facilities where
anthrax is grown or studied. The official, like others, spoke on the
condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   But officials at several law enforcement agencies acknowledged
that while they may not have singled Hatfill out as a suspect, they
have aggressively investigated him to determine whether he mailed the
letters.</TE>
<TE>   One said that while the number of "persons of interest" has
remained constant in recent months, many people have been cleared,
only to be replaced by others. But Hatfill has remained on the list
the entire time and has been investigated perhaps more extensively
than anyone else, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have said this is our guy, but others have not. But
if there was anything significant, we would have moved on to the next
stage," including further searches and taking Hatfill in for
questioning and possible arrest, said the official, who stressed that
nothing has been found to merit such scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, we don't have anybody that is real good. That is
why so much energy has gone into Hatfill--because we didn't have
anybody else. There is a feeling of 'where do we go now?' A lot of
other people already have been crossed off the list."</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill said Sunday that he was not going to be "railroaded"
because the FBI's case was going nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   "If I am a subject of interest, I'm also a human being," he said.
"I have a life. I have, or I had, a job. I need to earn a living. I
have a family and, until recently, I had a reputation, a career and a
bright professional future."</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents, who had searched Hatfill's Frederick, Md., apartment
with his permission on June 25, returned Aug. 1 with a criminal
search warrant. They also searched a Dumpster where he had recently
tossed bags of belongings--items his attorney said he was throwing
away in preparation for a move to Louisiana, where he was about to
start work as associate director of Louisiana State University's
biomedical research center.</TE>
<TE>   The university suspended him with pay the day after the search,
which was televised nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement sources said privately that they found an unusual
type of glove in the Dumpster, as well as "other items associated
with laboratory paraphernalia," but that testing for anthrax
subsequently proved negative.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill's lawyer also acknowledged that the FBI found a copy of a
manuscript of a novel about bioterrorism that Hatfill was writing.</TE>
<TE>   Standing before dozens of reporters and sporting an American flag
pin on his lapel, Hatfill expressed shock Sunday at the notion that
he had attracted federal scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   "I am appalled at the terrible acts of biological terrorism that
have caused death, disease and havoc in this great country starting
last fall," he said. "But I am just as appalled that my experience,
knowledge, dedication and service relative to defending the United
States against biological warfare has turned against me in connection
with the search for the anthrax killer."</TE>
<TE>   He said his specialty was viral illnesses, such as the deadly
Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and not bacterial diseases, such as anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill said he first was contacted by the FBI last fall. Two
agents interviewed him briefly, he said, and told him that the agency
was offering polygraph tests to a number of scientists. He said he
readily agreed to take one and did so at the FBI's Washington field
office. The examiner told him he passed, which federal law
enforcement sources confirm.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's profile of the suspected anthrax killer describes a male
scientist with access to anthrax who had been vaccinated against the
disease. Like many of the scientists at the Army research institute,
Hatfill was inoculated against anthrax; he said Sunday that his last
vaccination was in December 1999. Yearly boosters are required for
the vaccine to remain effective.</TE>
<TE>   "I am as susceptible to anthrax as any of you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had become "the designated fall guy" by the FBI, even
though there was not a "shred of evidence" linking him to the deadly
letters.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had told the FBI that agents were free to search his
home, his car and a storage facility he maintained in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI promised me that the search would be quiet, private and
very low-key," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in fact, television cameras were there as the agents entered
his home.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Murray, FBI spokesman for the Washington field office, which
is leading the investigation, responded Sunday: "We do not alert the
media to searches."</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill also complained about the FBI's search of his girlfriend's
home.</TE>
<TE>   "Her apartment was wrecked, while FBI agents screamed at her that
I had killed five people and that her life would never be the same
again," Hatfill said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the FBI and media reports had focused on discrepancies in
his past, questioning details on Hatfill's resume. Without addressing
specifics, Hatfill said that while he had not "lived a perfect life,"
things he did 10 or 20 years ago had no bearing on the anthrax case.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill took no questions after reading his statement.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, there have been conflicting camps among
investigators as to how strong a suspect Hatfill was, said one
federal law enforcement official familiar with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Some agents were suspicious, in part, because of Hatfill's
outsized personality, his apparent padding of his resume and the many
comments he had made about the dangers of biological attacks against
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities also were concerned about Hatfill's murky background
in Africa, where he spent about 15 years. He boasted of having fought
with the Selous Scouts, a mercenary force that fought black rebels in
an unsuccessful effort to maintain white rule in Rhodesia, which
became Zimbabwe in 1980. Hatfill received his medical degree from the
University of Zimbabwe in 1983 and did postgraduate work in South
Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular interest to authorities was the fact that two of the
anthrax letters used "Greendale School" as a return address; a
neighborhood in Harare, Zimbabwe, near where Hatfill once lived is
known as Greendale.</TE>
<TE>   But according to Hatfill's lawyer, the name was purely
coincidental: "I think there are several hundred or thousand
Greendales in the United States," Glasberg said Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Glasberg compared the FBI's treatment of Hatfill to that of
Richard Jewell, the security guard named as a suspect in the 1996
Centennial Olympic Park bombing during the Atlanta Games, and that of
scientist Wen Ho Lee, accused of espionage at the Los Alamos, N.M.,
research facility.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's treatment of both men led to stinging rebukes and formal
apologies.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyer also said he was going to file a formal complaint with
the Justice Department about leaks in the case. He said, for example,
that the FBI was the only possible source for ABC News' report on
Hatfill's novel, which was written and stored on Hatfill's computer.</TE>
<TE>   Murray, the FBI spokesman, said that "credible allegations of the
mishandling of evidence will be investigated."</TE>

<HD>Democrats' $28-Million 'Soft' Money Monument</HD>
<DH>Headquarters: Building will be prepaid with donations
before they become illegal on Nov. 6.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK FINEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>When Democratic Party chairman Terry McAuliffe unveiled the final
drawings of his $28-million "arsenal" of brick, mortar and high-tech
before party stalwarts in a casino meeting room here over the
weekend, it was anything but a gamble.</LD>
<LD>   The plans for the party's Washington headquarters were embraced as
a win-win deal for Democrats--a recipe, its backers say, for the
party's very survival.</LD>
<LD>   But the 51,000-square-foot bastion in the heart of the nation's
capital also will be a singular monument to "soft" money--a concrete
endgame for unregulated campaign dollars that will be illegal as of
Nov. 6.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, Federal Election Commission records show--and key party
operatives who gathered here in the desert for the Democratic
National Committee's summer meeting this past weekend confirmed--that
McAuliffe, who once mastered the fine art of raising soft money, has
now perfected a way to permanently preserve it for decades beyond the
Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act that outlaws those
contributions later this year.</TE>
<TE>   He will be using the soft money--unregulated contributions to
political parties from labor unions, corporations and wealthy special
interests--that Democrats raise before the deadline to build the
block-square building, complete with state-of-the-art TV and radio
studios, and to buy the computers that will fill it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to get hundreds of millions of dollars of hard
donations with an investment of just $28 million in soft dollars,"
McAuliffe proudly proclaimed in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and campaign-reform activists have condemned the
project--which is being financed in part by $12 million in soft money
from Los Angeles mega-millionaires Haim Saban and Stephen L. Bing--as
violating the spirit behind the campaign finance reform law that most
Republicans opposed and that Democrats themselves pushed through
Congress this year.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a last-minute amendment by Republicans that soft money
cannot be spent after Nov. 6 is forcing Democrats to pay every dime
of the construction costs up front--before contractors even begin the
project Dec. 16. The three-story structure on prime downtown real
estate isn't scheduled for completion until August 2003.</TE>
<TE>   At stake for the Democrats, McAuliffe says, was nothing less than
the future of the party itself: "If we had not done this--but for two
members who live in Los Angeles, but for their contributions--there's
a good chance you could have just shut the front door to this party."</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe insists that the headquarters project, rather than
exploiting a loophole in the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform
law, far predates the bill's passage, in timing and intent. The
project, he says, was well underway a full year before the act passed
Congress in February. McAuliffe says he launched it soon after he was
elected chairman of the DNC in February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The battle plan behind it grew out of the basic arithmetic of 21st
century U.S. politics: a vast technological gap that had grown
between the Republicans and Democrats in increasingly costly,
high-technology campaigns, and the clear advantage that technology
had given the Republicans in drawing the individual "hard money"
donors who are the future of national politics.</TE>
<TE>   "We had 400,000 donors when I was elected, and Al Gore got 50
million votes. We'd obviously been doing something wrong," said
McAuliffe in explaining the chasm between donors and voters.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe's first step was to use some of the soft money in the
party's coffers to hire former DNC communication
staffer-turned-consultant Laura Quinn to design a strategy for the
party to close the technology gap, which, she said, had left the
Democrats "light-years behind." And Peter O'Keefe, McAuliffe's senior
advisor, was hired to raise the soft-money war chest that would fund
it.</TE>
<TE>   Among Quinn's initial findings: In the 2000 presidential election
that Vice President Al Gore lost by a whisker, the Democratic Party's
electronic database of voter and potential donor e-mail addresses
totaled just 70,000 nationwide. The Republicans' hard-money donors
list topped a million, Quinn said.</TE>
<TE>   In his keynote speech to the DNC here Saturday, McAuliffe
acknowledged that his party was "stuck in the horse-and-buggy era."</TE>
<TE>   "Eighteen months ago, we didn't have enough e-mail addresses to
fill a modern football stadium," McAuliffe said.</TE>
<TE>   "Today, we can, with the push of a button, send information almost
instantly to 1 million Democratic activists all over the country."</TE>
<TE>   At the core of the gap, Quinn soon discovered, was that the
Democrats had entered the new millennium with a vintage-1980s IBM
database and mainframe computer system she said "was like having a
tractor-trailer holding a ream of paper."</TE>
<TE>   While Quinn became the project's virtual general contractor,
orchestrating a multimillion-dollar spending spree on leading-edge
software, hardware and a new staff of young "gear heads" to design
and run it, O'Keefe had little trouble finding a handful of key
people to bankroll the project.</TE>
<TE>   Saban's record $7-million cash contribution to the "DNC Building
Fund" made headlines in March, when the party officially reported it
in FEC filings. But O'Keefe said the "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"
guru, who made a cool $1.5 billion selling his share of Fox Family
Worldwide Television, had committed the funds at a Washington dinner
in July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond his generous gift, Saban, whom Gov. Gray Davis named to the
University of California Board of Regents this year, also assumed the
position of official chairman for the new headquarters building fund.</TE>
<TE>   Bing, the 37-year-old publicity-shy heir to a real estate empire
estimated at $600 million, weighed in with two hefty contributions
for the project in January. He gave $3 million to the building fund
and $2 million to a separate DNC fund to comply with current campaign
finance laws. Those laws allow 100% soft-money purchases only for
computer hardware but require a 60-40 split of hard and soft money
from the DNC account for software.</TE>
<TE>   Other key donors to the building fund this year include Houston
trial lawyer John O'Quinn, with a $1-million gift; millionaire New
Jersey Sen. Jon Corzine, with a $250,000 donation; and the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Co.--the privatized national mortgage company
better known as Freddie Mac--with $100,000, FEC records show.</TE>
<TE>   Among the selling points party operatives said they used to coax
the contributions was the pitch that they would be the last. Their
onetime investments in the centerpiece of a new system would replace
their handful of big donations with a new database and political bank
of small, hard money donors.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new law, individuals can give $2,000 to individual
candidates and $25,000 to a political party each year.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, key party stalwarts such as chief counsel Joe Sandler
argued, the building's biggest benefactors represent none of the
special interests that the reform bill's sponsors say have corrupted
the political system.</TE>
<TE>   "Haim Saban doesn't even have a job," Sandler said.</TE>
<TE>   "So where's the special interest corruption?"</TE>
<TE>   Throughout last year's intensive planning, fund-raising and
high-tech spending spree, McAuliffe insisted, "I didn't even think
McCain-Feingold had a chance of passing." Neither, in fact, did most
political analysts on Capitol Hill--not until Enron Corp.'s messy
bankruptcy in December exposed a vast array of special interest
politicking and the corporate millions that lay behind it.</TE>
<TE>   But McAuliffe and other party strategists concede that the reform
law, which had been looming for nearly a decade in various forms over
a political system seen as increasingly corrupted by huge special
interest money, was among the party's key motivators in pursuing the
new building plan.</TE>
<TE>   It was only a matter of time before Congress got around to banning
soft money, they said. And McAuliffe recently described the effect of
that ban in a word: "Drastic."</TE>
<TE>   "From Nov. 6 on, there's no soft money allowed within the federal
party system. Period," he said, conceding that his party has relied
far too heavily on it. "What that means is, we had $100 million in
2000 that we're not going to have in 2004. That's dramatic."</TE>
<TE>   It could have been much worse. In fact, House Republicans
attempted to add eleventh-hour amendments to the reform bill that
would have specifically targeted and scuttled McAuliffe's
headquarters plan.</TE>
<TE>   The riders, dubbed "poison-pill" or "anti-McAuliffe" amendments by
several Democrats, came up for debate literally under the darkness of
night--at 1 a.m. Feb. 14, the day the House passed the reform bill.</TE>
<TE>   One of those amendments would have banned outright the party's
ability to use any soft money raised this year to fund a building or
buy infrastructure it would use after Nov. 5. That one failed. But a
milder amendment narrowly passed. It added the provision that banned
political parties from spending any soft money after Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   The original bill would have permitted the parties to spend soft
money raised before the deadline indefinitely. And it was the
last-minute amendment that has forced the DNC to prepay all contracts
on a building it won't see for a year from now.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe's strategy dodged another major hurdle in June, when the
bill reached the politically divided FEC. The six-member regulatory
body adopted a series of controversial amendments in setting the
rules and regulations that will implement the reform law, which the
act's congressional authors say weaken it.</TE>
<TE>   But FEC Commissioner Bradley A. Smith, a conservative Republican,
introduced one amendment that would have toughened the act--but only
for Democrats. Smith's proposed rule change was nearly identical to
the House amendment that would have torpedoed the new DNC
headquarters building. In a recent interview, Smith said he
ultimately decided to withdraw the amendment to avoid "the appearance
of partisanship" on the part of the FEC.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on the political minefield that he so far has navigated
en route to his party's future soft-money citadel, McAuliffe insisted
that he bears his opponents neither ill will nor bitterness.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, it all worked out," concluded the often brash and
always aggressive entrepreneur.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame the Republicans. If I were them, I, too, would want
to stop the Democrats from building an arsenal that will obliterate
them for the years to come."</TE>

<HD>Hearings Sought on Cause of Flood That Trapped Miners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SOMERSET, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The miners union and the former head of a federal mine safety agency
say public hearings are needed to determine what caused a flood that
trapped nine coal miners underground for more than three days.</LD>
<LD>   But the current head of the Mine Safety and Health Administration
said a public hearing, which would give investigators the power to
subpoena witnesses and documents, wouldn't reveal any more
information than the routine investigation already underway into the
accident at the Quecreek mine.</LD>
<LD>   In calling for hearings, Joe Main, national health and safety
administrator for the United Mine Workers, said the number of U.S.
coal miners killed on the job has risen each of the last three years.</LD>
<TE>   "This year started out worse than last year, and we came as close
as you can come to another disaster at Quecreek," he told the
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. "It has to raise questions about what's
going on in coal mine safety in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Federal statistics show that 29 U.S. coal miners were killed in
1998, 34 in 1999, 38 in 2000, 42 in 2001 and 17 so far this year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of Black Wolf Mining Co. say their workers hit a
flooded, abandoned mine because 50-year-old maps of the adjoining
mine were inaccurate. The company says maps of its own mine were
accurate, noting that rescuers used those maps to pinpoint the
miners' location.</TE>
<TE>   David Lauriski, assistant secretary of Labor for mine safety and
health, said hearings won't yield any more answers than the routine
mine administration probe already underway.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the federal probe, a routine state investigation
has begun, and Gov. Mark Schweiker has announced formation of an
independent panel to study the accident.</TE>
<TE>   J. Davitt McAteer, who held Lauriski's post for seven years, said
federal officials should invoke a clause of the Federal Mine Safety
and Health Act of 1977 that provides for public hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Lauriski disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everybody forgets our mission is to reduce injury and
illness, not to write citations," he said.</TE>

<HD>Newspaper Finds 9 'Missing' Florida Kids</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Child welfare agency is under fire for losing
track of those it's supposed to protect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Using law enforcement profiles, public records and interviews with
relatives, a newspaper found nine children that had been declared
missing by Florida's beleaguered child welfare agency.</LD>
<LD>   The South Florida Sun-Sentinel examined 24 cases involving
Broward, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade county children primarily younger
than 14 whose profiles were available through the Florida Department
of Law Enforcement.</LD>
<LD>   Although the newspaper did not have access to detailed Department
of Children &amp; Families files, it found more than one-third of the
children in four weeks--two in less than three hours, it reported
Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The state's child welfare agency has been under scrutiny since
officials acknowledged in April that it had lost track of 5-year-old
Rilya Wilson, who had been missing since January 2001.</TE>
<TE>   No caseworker checked on her for 15 months. She is still missing.</TE>
<TE>   As of last month, the department could not account for 532
children it said had run away from foster homes or had been abducted
by parents against court orders.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun-Sentinel said it was possible--and in a few cases easy--to
locate some of the youngsters, including these instances:</TE>
<TE>   * Two sisters missing since 1997 have been living in Wisconsin
with their mother, whose phone number is listed in directory
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   * Four Miami brothers listed as missing since January have been
routinely seen in their neighborhood, a mile from state offices.</TE>
<TE>   * A boy reported missing in February was found with his mother in
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   * A boy who the state has been unable to find for almost eight
years was located in the Dominican Republic with calls to two
relatives and a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Department of Children &amp; Families administrators said they do look
for missing children.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe we treat [the cases] seriously enough, but it's
apparent there are efforts that we haven't made or could be making,"
said Mary Allegretti, the department's deputy district administrator
in Broward County.</TE>
<TE>   The agency's limited resources make searching for children
difficult, said Jack Moss, a department official in Broward County.</TE>
<TE>   Agency officials in Tallahassee and Miami did not return phone
calls seeking comment Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   An agency statement given to the Sun-Sentinel on Friday said it
already knew the locations of four children tracked by the newspaper.</TE>

<HD>Upgrades in Emergency Care Cut Assault Deaths, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Crime: Data covering 40 years find rate that victims died
dropped nearly 70%. A side effect was fewer murder cases, the
researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Improvements in emergency care over the last 40 years have helped to
dramatically lower the death rate among assault victims by nearly
70%, and in the process decrease the nation's murder rate, according
to a study.</LD>
<LD>   "People who would have ended up in morgues 20 years ago are now
simply treated and released by a hospital, often in a matter of a few
days," said Anthony R. Harris, a sociology professor at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Harris headed the statistical
study in connection with Harvard Medical School that looked at crime
data from 1960 to 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The study was published in Homicide Studies, an international,
interdisciplinary journal devoted to the study of homicide.</LD>
<TE>   Deaths from criminal assaults dropped almost 70% over the 40 years
studied, with annual declines of 2.5% for firearm and knife assaults
and 3.5% to 4% for other assaults, including poisoning and arson, the
researchers found.</TE>
<TE>   In 1960, police nationwide recorded 9,110 homicides and 154,320
aggravated assaults. That translates into 5.1 homicides per 100,000
people and 86.1 assaults per 100,000 population.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found 5.6% of those assaults resulted in death.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, police in 1999 recorded 15,522 homicides, a rate of
5.7 per 100,000, and 911,740 aggravated assaults, a rate of 334.3 per
100,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   But only 1.67% of the 1999 assaults resulted in death.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers noted that there was an uptick in deaths from
assaults in 2000 and 2001, and they said they were studying it.</TE>
<TE>   Their study of the 40-year period credited a variety of medical
advancements in the improved death rate: the development of 911
emergency services, rapid stabilization and transportation of trauma
victims, better training for emergency medical technicians and
increased numbers of hospitals and trauma centers, particularly in
rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   Using statistical analysis, the researchers figured that, without
medical advances, 45,000 to 70,000 homicides would have been recorded
annually nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The changes have not gone unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "The ambulance service and trauma facilities in this city have
improved tremendously over the years," said Det. Lt. William Noonan,
a 26-year police veteran who heads Springfield's homicide division.</TE>
<TE>   The results are consistent with common sense, said Dr. Stephen R.
Thomas of Harvard Medical School, a specialist in emergency medicine
who worked on the study. Advances in trauma care since the Vietnam
War have boosted survival rates for a wide array of injuries, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said the study's findings could raise additional questions
about the use of murder rates in analyzing crime statistics.</TE>

<HD>Move Urged of Lab's Uranium, Plutonium</HD>
<DH>Security: A New Mexico facility where nuclear materials are
stored is called 'at high risk' if attacked. U.S. proposes transfer
to Nevada.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Pending a final environmental review, the Energy Department is
expected to move as much as several tons of plutonium and
weapons-grade uranium from a federal research laboratory in New
Mexico to Nevada because of security concerns, according to
documents.</LD>
<LD>   In a department memo, John C. Browne, director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory in New Mexico, called the proposed move "the best
overall decision to meet the post-Sept. 11 challenges for the
long-term security of nuclear activities."</LD>
<LD>   An Energy Department spokesman, Bryan Wilkes, said that although
no final decision has been made, moving the material to the Nevada
Test Site is the preferred option being studied to increase security.
The environmental study is being reviewed, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Several tons of highly enriched uranium and plutonium, which could
be used to make an atomic bomb, are kept at Technical Area 18 at the
Los Alamos lab, where critics have said it cannot be adequately
protected.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that that facility was at high risk. They
simply could not defend it," said Pete Stockton, an analyst for the
Project on Government Oversight, a private watchdog group that Sunday
released a copy of the Browne memo and other documents involving the
expected move.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the 1940s, Technical Area 18 is at the bottom of a steep
canyon, where the high ground and an adjacent highway make the site
difficult to defend.</TE>
<TE>   In repeated security exercises, troops have been unable to protect
the material. In a 1997 exercise, Army Special Forces posing as
attackers wheeled away a garden cart full of props representing the
nuclear material. In another test, attackers obtained access to the
facility where they could have detonated an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Had actual material been stolen, it would have been enough to make
several weapons, said Stockton, who three years ago was chairman of
an Energy Department team that recommended to then-Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson that the material be moved. Richardson ordered the
environmental studies into moving the material.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a frequent critic of security at
federal weapons facilities, urged the department to complete the move
as quickly as possible and safeguard the material from potential
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The Project on Government Oversight, which has criticized Energy
Department security of nuclear weapons material, obtained a draft
press release from the National Nuclear Security Administration, an
agency within the department, that indicated that plans are going
forward to move the material to Nevada with a decision anticipated
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Everett H. Beckner, deputy administrator of the nuclear security
agency, has given his approval to begin design activities and other
steps to implement the move, according to a memo obtained by the
government watchdog group.</TE>
<TE>   The material is part of a research project in which scientists
examine how electronic components of nuclear weapons respond to
small, short-lived nuclear detonations.</TE>

<LD>For vacation this summer, me and the boys did skate parks and
ballparks. Which means that on alternate days we collected bruises
and autographs. And in between we learned a few things about what
changes, and what endures, in sports, in families and in America.</LD>
<LD>   The setting was California. The crew was me and two sons, 12 and
8. The plan was to visit the baseball stadiums in San Francisco,
Oakland, Anaheim and San Diego (the Dodgers were on the road), and to
stop off along the way at skate parks where the kids could practice
their best X Games routines.</LD>
<LD>   Skate parks and ballparks bounce to very different rhythms.
Baseball is built on continuity: strands of comparisons and
statistics that wind back a century. The skate world operates with
the metabolism and attention span of a 15-year-old: It is forever
young.</LD>
<TE>   Baseball isn't immune to change. At Pacific Bell Park in San
Francisco, you can get marinated jalapenos with your tacos and
there's a docking station where they will beam updated baseball
trivia into your Palm Pilot. Along the lower decks, there are ads for
brokerage firms, which may reflect the widening presence of the stock
market in our society, and the narrowing funnel of who can afford a
game at a time of $40 box seats.</TE>
<TE>   But before the game, little boys are still squeezed against the
side of the visiting team dugout pleading for autographs. "Sh-a-awn,"
they wail, as Shawn Green, the Dodgers' splendid splinter of a right
fielder, comes by. (Shawn, quickly judged a good guy, stops to sign
for kids on both sides of the dugout.) It's a scene white-haired
Bobby Thompson, there for a ceremony to memorialize his miracle 1951
New York Giants, would instantly recognize.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium itself, with all its nooks and crannies, seems both
new and old, out of time. It's a breathtakingly beautiful place. Half
an hour before game time on a Sunday afternoon, the grass is as green
as hope, the sun is warm and the thermometer on the scoreboard says
67 degrees. Vintage blues pumps through the sound system. The players
are stretching, or playing catch, and there's the
thwack-thwack-thwack of balls leaving the cage in batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, it is difficult to imagine anyplace else I would
rather be. Leaning over the dugout, I look at the little one and say:
"I love baseball." He squints into the sun under his new Giants cap
and looks back at me. "How could you not love baseball?" he says.</TE>
<TE>   The pleasures of skate parks aren't so placid. For one thing the
soundtrack tends to the Strokes and Blink-182. Baseball is languid;
skating is frenetic. It's also slouchy and pierced and tattooed.</TE>
<TE>   Yet I confess: I like the skate park culture. I like the way the
big kids, no matter how grungy, are almost always respectful and
protective toward the little kids. I like the way the skaters and
skateboarders flop and fly and fall; and when they fall they laugh at
each other, or themselves, and get up and do it again. At a skate
park in Orange County, I saw one kid try the same trick for about two
hours until he finally nailed it. (I wonder if he displays the same
persistence at math, but that's another story.) Failure doesn't carry
the same weight at the skate park as it does in baseball; it's less a
step back than a necessary crossing on the road to success. Which may
accurately reflect the way today's teens, raised in the affluence of
the 1990s, view the world. We'll be in good hands if they're still as
resilient when they're running the country in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   It's the combination of continuity and change that makes America
so unique. Many societies do tradition well. Some are good at change.
We blend the two as effortlessly as the kids mixing Coke and root
beer at the soda fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Tradition's greatest value here is to create a common identity in
a nation formed from so many divergent parts. One night in Anaheim we
screamed for the Boston Red Sox's Pedro Martinez, who was impassive
and invulnerable, as he alternately overpowered and baffled the
Angels. Someday, sitting with their kids, watching a star pitcher now
in grade school, my kids will tell their children about the great
Pedro the way my father told me about seeing Sandy Koufax. One is an
immigrant from the Dominican Republic, the other a Jew from Brooklyn,
yet for millions of fans they will forever define part of what it
meant to be an American at a certain time and place. More than blood
or religion, that is what holds this country together: common
memories linking us in a chain that extends beyond our vision,
forward and back.</TE>
<TE>   Yet openness to the new has been equally important to America's
success. It wasn't that long ago that skating was vaguely
disreputable. Now kids skate at airplane hangar-size parks in
shopping malls, which come complete with their own name-brand shoes,
shirts and backpacks. Purists may complain about a loss of
authenticity. But it is that capacity to mainstream cutting-edge
ideas so quickly that makes American society and culture so
innovative.</TE>
<TE>   At our best, we cherish the past and seize the future and
improvise new combinations as we go. By some strange generational
convergence, the soundtrack for our trip was provided by new CDs
released on the same day by Bruce Springsteen and Linkin Park (now
the No. 1 and 2 albums in the country). The two couldn't sound more
different: Springsteen, the baby boom icon, belting out anthem rock;
Linkin Park, the twentysomething art students, mixing metal and rap
into an edgy hybrid.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they share a commitment to expressing, and even crystallizing,
the emotions of their audience. For all their clamor, Linkin Park
sings with surprising tenderness about insecurity and the search for
a place in the world--the emotions young people feel every day. On
his rousing and haunting album, Springsteen's post-9/11 message
strikes closest for an audience a little older: Life is fragile and
happiness fleeting, so grab it while you can.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling 10 days with two growing boys isn't all Martha Stewart
moments; at various points, each member of the troupe wanted to
throttle the other two. But there are also moments, many more--when
we rise with the crowd as the batter steps in on a soft summer night,
when the big brother tenderly helps up the little one after he wipes
out on the half pipe--when I understand what Springsteen is singing
about so clearly that it aches.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks Bruce. Thanks boys.</TE>

retaining wall on a ramp leading to Interstate 4 in Orlando, Fla. Two
people were killed and five injured as several drivers on the roadway
beneath the crash lost control of their vehicles trying to avoid
chunks of concrete and other debris falling from the crash site. The

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WACO, Texas</DL>
<LD>Message from McLennan County to George W. Bush: Yes, it's still the
economy that matters, but this isn't your father's recession.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 10 years after Bill Clinton invited experts to Arkansas to
diagnose the wobbly economy he inherited from the first President
Bush, his successor is summoning smart people to Texas this week to
assess the economic conundrum that he now faces.</LD>
<LD>   Here in Bush's backyard, many people say there's no comparison
between the latest downturn and the one that may have cost the elder
Bush his job: This one seems a whole lot worse.</LD>
<TE>   "The last time the bottom kind of dropped we hardly even noticed
it, because we didn't have all those CEOs ripping us off," said
72-year-old Betty Ritthaler of Hewitt, a Waco suburb. "This time,
it's just obvious in your face."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's White House economic forum couldn't be held on
friendlier territory. The 250 participants will gather on the campus
of Baylor University in Waco, about 20 miles from the 1,600-acre
ranch that Bush calls home. The carefully screened roster of Cabinet
secretaries, business leaders, economists, academics and other big
thinkers will split into eight groups to discuss issues from
corporate accountability to health-care security.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents of McLennan County speak fondly of Bush as a
favorite son, and they give him generally high marks for the job he
is doing as president. But even if they don't hold him personally
accountable for corporate America's financial scandals, their outrage
over executive misconduct underscores the peril facing politicians of
both parties as they try to respond to a different kind of economic
cycle. It will take more than recycled proposals, boilerplate
rhetoric and a presidential forum to assuage their anger. They want
their money back.</TE>
<TE>   "Across the board, almost everyone has lost at least a third of
what they had, and some a lot more," said Diane Jamison, a Waco
investment advisor who helped many people take positions in the
bubble market of the late 1990s. "You've got a lot of angry people
out here."</TE>
<TE>   Many of them are older, more affluent Americans who are more
likely to vote Republican, rather than blue-collar workers who
traditionally lose their jobs in recessions. That makes the current
downturn particularly treacherous for Bush, whose credentials as a
business executive have suddenly become more of a liability than an
asset.</TE>
<TE>   "The people it really affects are retirees and near-retirees,"
said David Wyss, chief economist for Standard &amp; Poor's, a financial
analysis and information service. "You're looking at rich old people.
That's pretty much the definition of the core Republican."</TE>
<TE>   Using the conventional yardsticks of job loss and contraction of
the gross domestic product, Wyss noted, the recession of 2001 was
(assuming it doesn't stage a double-dip encore this year) the
second-mildest in postwar history. However, in terms of value lost in
the nation's financial markets, it was the second-worst.</TE>
<TE>   Roughly $7.4 trillion in stock market wealth has evaporated since
the bubble was pricked in early 2000. Of that, $4.4 trillion has
disappeared since Bush took the oath of office in January 2001. Not
since Herbert Hoover and the crash of 1929 has the market fallen so
far during the first 18 months of a president's term.</TE>
<TE>   The damage is not only deep, it is also broad. About 50% of
American households now own stock, up from 37% in 1992 and 19% in
1962. For the millions of Americans who have 401(k) and other
defined-contribution retirement plans, falling stock prices show up
immediately as shrunken nest eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a nation of stockholders now, and it's hard to find a
person who's not affected," said Baylor finance professor John
Martin, a specialist in corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   The casualty list includes many of Bush's 215,104 McLennan County
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Scott, 66, and his wife, Bunny, 65, depend on stock
investments for about a quarter of their retirement income, and the
market slide has cost them about $40,000. Jerry Scott, who spent 20
years in the Air Force and 19 at McDonnell Douglas Corp., blames
crooked chief executives for most of the carnage.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 "was nothing compared to what we're going through now,"
Scott said. "Enron, WorldCom, all these other companies stealing the
money, carting it off. The conniving and the cheating have really
destroyed confidence, not only in the companies but in the federal
government, which we thought was overseeing all of that."</TE>
<TE>   Scott said he voted for Bush in 2000, and he will probably do so
again in 2004. But he thinks the White House and Congress need to do
more to restore integrity to the executive suite. "I think both
parties are equally responsible," he said. "If the Democrats try to
pin all of this on Bush, that's not good. They need to be looking at
how to solve these problems, rather than create more."</TE>
<TE>   Dorothea Jones, 80, is upset too. Like Scott, her anger is
directed at corporate bigwigs, not Bush. "Anybody that does the
things that they've done ... ought to be ridden out of town on a
rail," she said. "Or tarred and feathered."</TE>
<TE>   Jones has been widowed for 19 years and lives with her 49-year-old
daughter, Margaret Lou, in the little town of Lorena. She sold the
family farm three years ago and gets about $1,300 a month from stock
and bond funds, Social Security and an annuity left behind by her
husband.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to keep all my stuff together so I can leave my
one and only grandson something when I go," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Innmon, 60, and her husband, Earl, 67, decided to retire from
day-to-day management of their Chicken Express fast-food restaurant
off Interstate 35 south of Waco and put their son, Randall, in
charge. Now she's not so sure her working days are over. She recently
signed up to do volunteer work for the local school district, to get
her foot in the door for possible future employment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the stock market about 10 years," Innmon said. "One
reason we turned the business over to my son is that stocks were
doing so well."</TE>
<TE>   The market's freefall has caused Jamison, the Waco investment
advisor, to reconsider her own retirement plans. Fueled by
fast-moving Nasdaq stocks, her investment account was worth $165,000
at the market's peak in March 2000. Today, it's worth slightly more
than half that, about $85,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I was planning to retire in five years, around age 60. But I
would say now it might be 10 years because of the amount of money I
have lost," she said. "For a corporate CEO, this wouldn't be a drop
in the bucket. But for the rest of us, it's real money."</TE>
<TE>   Polls suggest that for many Americans, the effect of the economic
downturn on their college savings and retirement accounts has
eclipsed their concerns about job security. That appears to be the
case in McLennan County, where only a few large employers, such as
Raytheon Co., have had big layoffs. The county's jobless rate was
5.4% in June, compared with 5.8% for the state and 5.9% for the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   Waco veterinarian Charles Anderson said the recession hasn't left
a scratch on his practice, which keeps growing about 5% a year, good
times and bad. But it put a big dent in his retirement account, which
is down about 60%.</TE>
<TE>   "Good Lord willing, I'll practice another 10 years, maybe 15,"
said Anderson, 57. "We still have faith in the system. We still have
time to regroup. We'll have an opportunity to sell the practice. But
this certainly isn't something we wanted to see happen."</TE>
<TE>   The market decline has taken an indirect toll on Baylor, a
13,000-student, Baptist-affiliated university. The school's endowment
has fallen to about $650 million from $700 million at the market's
peak, and new donations have slipped to $45 million from $52 million
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The shrinkage will reduce the annual draw by about $2 million,
relatively small change in a $300-million operating budget. "We take
a very long view," said David Brooks, Baylor's chief financial
officer. "We expect the market to turn around. If people are just
patient, it will come back."</TE>
<TE>   The political implications of the current economic cycle have
become the subject of intense speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Because stock ownership is more concentrated at the upper end of
the income spectrum and Republicans are perceived as having closer
ties to big business than Democrats, some observers believe GOP
candidates are more vulnerable to voter retribution in this year's
midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   "If the stock market continues to nose-dive between now and
November, I think you could see some shifting politically," said Waco
insurance agent Ron Keener, who has been busy selling low-risk
annuities to people who have soured on stock investments.</TE>
<TE>   Bush appears to be on safer ground, at least here in McLennan
County.</TE>
<TE>   "This has been going on for more than just the last year or two,"
said Mike Hataway, who manages a Waco eatery called Buzzard Billy's.
"Most people realize he's not the one who's been cooking those
books."</TE>

<LD>Question: How and why does our hair turn white as we age?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Hair color is the result of melanin, a pigment produced by
melanocyte cells in the root of the hair. The activity of these cells
decreases with age, revealing the true base color of hair: white or
gray.</LD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A team of Australian scientists has proposed that the speed of light
may not be a constant, a revolutionary idea that could unseat one of
the most cherished laws of modern physics: Einstein's theory of
relativity.</LD>
<LD>   The team, led by theoretical physicist Paul Davies of Sydney's
Macquarie University, says it is possible that the speed of light has
slowed over billions of years. Davies and astrophysicists Tamara
Davis and Charles Lineweaver from the University of New South Wales
published the proposal in the Aug. 8 issue of the journal Nature.</LD>
<LD>   The suggestion that the speed of light can change is based on
research collected by New South Wales astronomer John Webb, who posed
a conundrum when he found that light from a distant quasar had
absorbed the wrong type of photons from interstellar clouds on its
12-billion-year journey to Earth.</LD>
<TE>   Davies said that, fundamentally, Webb's observations mean that the
structure of atoms emitting quasar light was slightly but ever so
significantly different from the structure of atoms in humans. The
discrepancy could only be explained if either the electron charge or
the speed of light had changed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A thriving Bronze Age drug trade supplied narcotics to ancient
cultures throughout the eastern Mediterranean as balm for the pain of
childbirth and disease, proving a sophisticated knowledge of
medicines dating back thousands of years, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   Ancient ceramic pots, most of them nearly identical in shape and
about 5 inches long, have been found in tombs and settlements
throughout the Middle East, dating as far back as 1400 BC, said Joe
Zias, an anthropologist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</LD>
<LD>   When turned upside-down, the thin-necked vessels with round bases
resemble opium poppy pods. If there was any doubt about what was
inside, the round bases have white markings, designs that symbolized
knife cuts made on poppy bulbs so the white opium base can ooze and
be harvested, Zias said.</LD>

<LD>The Yupik language, once common among Inuit communities on the
Alaskan coast, is now spoken solely by adults. Children learn only
English, making it probable that Yupik will be lost in the next
generation.</LD>
<LD>   Yupik is one of thousands of languages that are expected to die
over the next century. While linguists struggle to keep the languages
in these small communities alive, a group of researchers in San
Francisco is determined to save some record of current linguistic
diversity for thousands of years into the future--long after its
speakers are gone.</LD>
<LD>   Their brainchild is the Rosetta Disk--a 3-inch disk containing
micro-etched translations of the Book of Genesis in 1,000 languages.</LD>
<TE>   The original Rosetta Stone, discovered in 1799, contains the same
text in Egyptian hieroglyphics, Greek and Demotic, an everyday form
of ancient Egyptian. The parallel organization of the basalt slab,
inscribed in 196 BC, became the key in deciphering hieroglyphics.</TE>
<TE>   The contemporary Rosetta Disk packs even more of a linguistic
punch than the ancient original. Squeezed onto the small disk are
many linguistic elements--pages of words and pronunciations, as well
as examples of native texts.</TE>
<TE>   The project is sponsored by the San Francisco-based Long Now
Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded in 1996 by computer
pioneers Danny Hillis and Stewart Brand to support long-term thinking
in a fast-paced world.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's other main project is the creation of a clock
designed to tick once a century for 10,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   The lasting perspective is especially crucial in linguistics,
where languages are becoming extinct faster than they can be
documented. James McCloskey, a professor of linguistics at UC Santa
Cruz, said: "There is a real sense of urgency ... the majority of
languages have only a few hundred speakers."</TE>
<TE>   The disk, which should last for more than 2,000 years, is made of
nickel and requires only a microscope to be read. Each page of text
is miniaturized and etched onto the disk as an image.</TE>
<TE>   This simplicity guards against the threat of changing
technologies, which could make a digital disk unreadable by computers
in the future.</TE>
<TE>   The disk is protected against the elements in a stainless steel
and glass orb, which also acts as a magnifying lens. Stowed in the
bottom of the orb is a metal ribbon, where owners can inscribe their
names as a pedigree of the object.</TE>
<TE>   The design itself has a functional significance: "It implies the
instructions of the disk," said Jim Mason, director of the Rosetta
Project. The eight major languages around the outside of the circle
are English, Spanish, Russian, Hindi, Chinese, Hebrew, Arabic and
Swahili.</TE>
<TE>   The text spirals down into rings of text that taper to microscopic
scale. The final level requires a 1,000-power microscope to read. An
image of the Earth at the center of the disk radiates spokes that
indicate the geographical origin of each language.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at the Long Now Foundation have data on 1,500
languages. Before production of the first-edition disk this fall, the
top 1,000 languages will be selected for inclusion. Candidates will
be chosen based on which have the most complete data, the most
diverse elements and the widest geographic distribution.</TE>
<TE>   But language collection won't stop there. Mason hopes to have data
on 3,000 to 4,000 of the world's 5,000 to 7,000 languages in the next
few years. And the project will include as many as possible in
upcoming editions of the disk.The project has been funded through a
$350,000 grant from the nonprofit Lazy Eight Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   What was meant to be a piece of long-term preservation has become
a much larger project, said Alexander Rose, director of the Long Now
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   When collecting information for the disk, the Rosetta team came up
against a problem: No one knew all the languages. So they created an
online database to house the information.</TE>
<TE>   Linguists and the public can now see the data and make comments
and additions.</TE>
<TE>   Users have pored over the Web site, correcting annotations of the
wrong language, the wrong dialect and even the wrong orientation of a
piece of text, Rose said.</TE>
<TE>   People can help get their favorite language included by making a
$100 donation to the project.</TE>
<TE>   And true language aficionados can order a first-edition Rosetta
Disk--at $25,000 a copy.</TE>
<TE>   Mason and Rose hope to distribute the disks globally--to archives,
museums and representatives of each language--as soon the production
process becomes economically feasible.</TE>

<HD>A Beacon in Cosmos</HD>
<DH>Space: Voyagers I and 2 have logged 14 billion miles in 25
years. And they're still going, revolutionizing our knowledge of the
solar system.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the far reaches of our solar system, amid the emptiness of solar
wind and cosmic rays, are two tiny markers of humanity's dream to
reach to the stars.</LD>
<LD>   Voyagers 1 and 2, the intrepid spacecraft originally launched in
1977, have traveled more than 14 billion miles, visited four planets
and surveyed dozens of moons. And they are still flying.</LD>
<LD>   In the next few weeks, the twin Voyagers will celebrate their 25th
year in space. Voyager 1 is now the most distant human-made object in
the universe, with Voyager 2 close behind.</LD>
<TE>   Originally built to last five years, the spacecraft have been so
successful that scientists extended their missions. Now bound for
interstellar space, the Voyagers will endure for 20 more years, until
their power is spent and human contact with the spacecraft is no
longer possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty-five years is a tremendously long time but is still only a
little past the half-way point of what the spacecraft is capable of,"
said Tim Hogul, a Voyager systems engineer and mission director who
has been working on the project for 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   The missions began Aug. 20, 1977, with the launch of Voyager 2,
followed by the launch of Voyager 1 on Sept. 5. The first 25 years of
the twin spacecraft have revolutionized the understanding of the
solar system.</TE>
<TE>   "Voyager showed us that the solar system is more diverse than
anyone imagined--the magnetic fields, rings, moons and winds are all
different," said Ed Stone, project scientist of the Voyager mission
since 1975 and previous director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   Stone is still amazed at Voyagers' flood of discoveries:</TE>
<TE>   Scientists now know that moons are very active, he said. There are
hot volcanoes on Jupiter's Io and icy volcanoes on Neptune's Triton.
"There is more volcanic activity on Jupiter's little moon than here
on Earth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The spacecraft discovered that the great red spot on Jupiter is
actually an enormous storm. The solar system's fastest winds are on
Neptune. And Titan, a moon of Saturn, is smaller than we thought,
made to look deceptively large by a haze of organic smog raining down
on its surface.</TE>
<TE>   Two decades past their original lifetime, some may think the
Voyager spacecraft are past their prime. But they have proved to be
remarkably resilient. Their new mission to the edge of the solar
system may bring a new wealth of astronomical data.</TE>
<TE>   The Voyagers will likely be the first spacecraft to explore beyond
the limits of the sun's influence.</TE>
<TE>   Voyager is currently flying within the bubble of solar wind
created by the sun's atmosphere. Inside the bubble, also known as the
heliosphere, all material comes from our sun. Outside the bubble is
interstellar space, swirling with particles from exploded stars.</TE>
<TE>   As the solar wind approaches the heliopause--the boundary of the
bubble--it must slow down from speeds of a million miles per hour to
about 250,000 mph, Stone said. This abrupt change is the termination
shock. The Voyagers should reach the termination shock in just a few
years.</TE>
<TE>   Ten to 12 years after the shock, both probes will pass through the
heliopause, about 5 to 14 billon miles from the sun.</TE>
<TE>   During their race to interstellar space, Voyagers 1 and 2 will
collect data on the sun's magnetic field, solar wind particles and
interstellar cosmic rays, said Ed Massey, the current project manager
on the Voyager mission.</TE>
<TE>   After passing through the heliopause, the craft can then sample
the environment outside the heliosphere--"We can find out what kind
of galactic particles carry from other stars," Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, the spacecraft fly steadily on. "The warranty is
over, and they're working well," Massey said.</TE>
<TE>   Voyagers 1 and 2 are so far way--7.96 billion miles and 6.31
billion miles from the sun, respectively--that a command signal sent
at the speed of light to Voyager 1 takes almost 12 hours to reach its
target.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, a signal to a spacecraft orbiting Mars takes 15
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Massey's team must make special considerations for such delayed
communication, and have even orchestrated spacecraft repairs from
billions of miles away. But he doesn't view this as the program's
biggest challenge. "It's keeping a team together to operate Voyager
as long as we can," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Massey works with a current operating team of 12 people, compared
with 600 in the mission's heyday in 1977. Funding cuts could reduce
the team's numbers even more, so scientists may have to look at new
and riskier ways to cut costs, Massey said.</TE>
<TE>   The operation budget isn't the program's only dwindling resource.
Energy generated by the Voyagers' plutonium power source is in steady
decline.</TE>
<TE>   As the power decreases, different instruments are turned off and
scientific capabilities of the spacecraft diminish.</TE>
<TE>   The Voyagers' slow progression to old age started in 1990, when
most imaging instruments were shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Voyager 2 had one last hurrah, as it turned around toward Earth to
take a "family photo" of the solar system.</TE>
<TE>   In about 10 years, their primary orientation mechanisms will be
turned off. The spacecraft will then have to rely on the sun sensor
and star tracker to orient toward Earth, Massey said.</TE>
<TE>   And about 10 years after that, about 2020, Voyagers will no longer
have enough power to operate their instruments and will stop sending
data back to Earth.</TE>
<TE>   At this point their interstellar mission will end, but what then?</TE>
<TE>   "The Voyagers can drift forever, whether they have power or not,"
Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   In about 40,000 years, Voyage 1 will come within 1.6 light-years
(9.3 trillion miles) of a star in the constellation Camelopardalis.
"This will be the first time Voyager is nearer another star than they
are to the sun," Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   And 250,000 years later, Voyager 2 will pass Sirius, the brightest
star in our sky, at a distance of 4.3 light-years (25 trillion
miles).</TE>
<TE>   Each spacecraft carries a gold-plated copper disc with greetings,
music and 115 images, including the Golden Gate Bridge, the Great
Wall of China, rush hour on an Indian highway and a human fetus.Tim
Hogul, who has worked with the Voyagers so long that he views the
spacecraft as his children, sees the project as a time capsule of our
generation.</TE>
<TE>   "Voyager is a beacon for mankind into the cosmos," Hogul said,
"lasting well past the fate of Earth."</TE>

<HD>A Big Year? Palmer Is Certain of It</HD>

<LD>It looks as though Carson Palmer is ready to go out the same way he
came in--with a strong start.</LD>
<LD>   He did it with a touchdown drive in his first series as USC's
quarterback four years ago, when he was a true freshman. Now, as a
fifth-year senior, he's doing it with his words.</LD>
<LD>   He didn't waste much time getting to the candid comments assessing
himself or the state of the program during USC's media day Sunday:</LD>
<TE>   "This is the best team I've been on, by far, since I've been
here."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the aura about SC that it had in the past. We
definitely have lost that over the years. But we're definitely not
the underdogs. I don't feel like we have to go into the season
feeling like we're Cal or somebody that just needs to scrap by and
can hopefully knock some of the top teams off. I think we have a
legitimate chance to knock Washington State off, to knock Oregon and
Washington off."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great university and we should have great talent every
year, we should have a great team every year. We haven't lived up to
those expectations, I haven't lived up to my expectations. It would
be easy to sit around and complain about it, but that's not the way
to handle it. The way to handle it is you try to exceed those
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Words alone won't get it done. But what they do provide is an
insight to his preparedness. The questions about Palmer were always
his mind more than his body anyway, so if his head's right, he could
really take off.</TE>
<TE>   It looks as though CP version 2K2 is comfortable with where he is
right now. He knows where he went wrong and knows how to fix it. (He
also looks as if he's in great shape, with only a little cut on his
knee from a bicycling accident.)</TE>
<TE>   At USC there has been a shift away from emphasizing Palmer as the
program's only ticket to greatness. Safety Troy Polamalu is on the
cover of the media guide. Polamalu's name was the first running back
Justin Fargas mentioned when he talked about team leaders. Much of
the offensive talk focuses on the running-back crew of Fargas, Sultan
McCullough and Malaefou MacKenzie.</TE>
<TE>   Now Palmer is portrayed more as a buoy that could rise with the
tide, rather than the captain of the ship.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have a good season, if we play the kind of football that
we're capable of, then I think Carson's going to be recognized as one
of the best players in America," Coach Pete Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone was ready to hang that tag on him four years ago, after
he started the last five games of his freshman year. Trouble is, he
believed the hype.</TE>
<TE>   "I was 19 years old," he said. "I was like, 'Oh, I am [a star]?
We're going to go the Rose Bowl next year? I'm going to do this? All
right, that sounds good.'</TE>
<TE>   "I took it the wrong way. I didn't handle the situation right. I
didn't work as hard. I started listening to it. I thought, 'Oh, if I
could do all that as a freshman, I'm obviously going to do it this
year and I don't need to work that hard.' I didn't realize that
you've got to work five times harder."</TE>
<TE>   His sophomore year was cut short when he broke his collarbone in
Game 3 and he redshirted for the rest of the season. The next season
was his most productive to date, then last year he had to adjust to
the new coaching staff and offensive coordinator Norm Chow.</TE>
<TE>   It appears Chow has had to make some adjustments as well. Last
year he just figured his quarterback would pick up the offense, so he
waited until the start of spring practice to start teaching it.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't work for Palmer. So this year they got together to
watch game film, then spent more time reviewing edited clips from
practice once spring ball began.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Palmer says, "As far as knowing our offense, knowing
the personnel groupings, I feel comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   So there are no excuses now. The expectations are there from
teammates and fans alike.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing is, they want him to be great so bad," McCullough said.
"So he's got to live up to that. You work to be great, but they want
him to be great. He's got to finally show it."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer has done well enough to complete 618 passes for 7,876
yards, which puts him within sight of Rob Johnson's school records of
676 and 8,472. But he also has thrown as many interceptions as
touchdowns (39), and the Trojans haven't won a bowl game under his
watch.</TE>
<TE>   So there's been plenty of criticism. Palmer read that too.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a lot to read," he said. "I think I learned from that
situation. I read all the good stuff, which wasn't true, obviously, I
didn't work as hard to get where I needed to be. I read all the bad
stuff, and that's where I am now."</TE>
<TE>   There's one last set of clips to produce, and Palmer knows he's
responsible for its content.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fired up," he said. "I'm so excited to get this thing going.
I'm just fired up to give it one last shot with these guys."</TE>
<TE>   "Carson's finally a senior," Carroll said. "He's finally in that
position the players are where they make their notoriety. He's been a
noticed football player since his fast start as a freshman. But now
he has the opportunity to bank on his experience and the wisdom that
he's gained through the years. He's prepared himself perfectly to get
ready for this season."</TE>
<TE>   It sure sounds that way.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Ride Soriano's Coattails</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Second baseman has three hits, including 29th
homer, and New York beats Oakland, 8-5, to avert sweep.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The New York Yankees needed a jump start. Again, Alfonso Soriano
provided the spark.</LD>
<LD>   Soriano homered and scored three times, and the Yankees roughed up
Mark Mulder to defeat the Oakland Athletics, 8-5, Sunday and avert a
three-game sweep.</LD>
<LD>   "He does a lot of things," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said. "He
certainly did a nice job today."</LD>
<TE>   Soriano's leadoff single started a three-run first as the Yankees
broke their 17-inning scoreless streak. He doubled with two out to
key a two-run second.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my job is to get on base, not to hit home runs," Soriano
said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but he hit his 29th homer in the sixth, when the Yankees
tagged Mulder (13-7) for a season-high eight runs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Soriano homer, I thought it was a pretty good pitch," Mulder
said. "That was the only pitch all day where I made the pitch I
wanted and they hit it. He just got to it."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi drove in three runs against his former team, helping
the American League East leaders maintain a four-game advantage over
Boston and avert their first three-game losing streak since May
22-24.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Mussina (14-6) continued to struggle, yet wound up with the
victory. In his last three starts, he has given up 16 runs and 36
hits in 16 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a lot to improve on," he said. "I'm working hard at it
and the guys have been out there supporting me offensively quite a
bit."</TE>
<TE>   Terrence Long homered and made another excellent catch in center
field for the Athletics. But he also grounded into two rally-killing
double plays.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees finished 5-4 this year against the wild
card-contending Athletics. New York eliminated the A's from the
playoffs in the last two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Behind Mulder, the Athletics hoped to finish off their first
three-game sweep at Yankee Stadium since July 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Soriano, Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams opened up with
singles for a run, and Giambi followed with a bad-hop grounder over
second baseman Mark Ellis for a two-run single.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder recovered to strike out the next four batters, but Williams
and Giambi hit run-scoring singles in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Jeter, who began the day in a two-for-19 skid, had a run-scoring
single in the fourth for a 6-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, they finally got some knocks out of the top of the order,"
Manager Art Howe said. "The first two games, we were able to keep
those guys off base."</TE>
<TE>   Shane Spencer homered on Mulder's first pitch in the sixth, and
Soriano connected one out later. Soriano is one home run shy of
becoming the first second baseman with 30 homers and 30 steals in a
season.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Dye hit a run-scoring single, and Long followed with his
ninth homer to tie the score, 3-3, in the second.</TE>

<HD>Liefer's Return Is Seattle's Downfall</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't take long for Jeff Liefer to shake off any rust against the
Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   Liefer, in the starting lineup for the first time in six days, hit
a three-run homer and doubled to help the Chicago White Sox defeat
Seattle, 6-5, Sunday at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The left-handed-hitting Liefer was the designated hitter against
Mariner right-hander James Baldwin. Liefer replaced Frank Thomas, who
is in an 0-for-11 slump.</LD>
<TE>   "I definitely felt a little stale," Liefer said. "The first two
strikes pretty much blew right by me. I was just trying to make
contact and [Baldwin] left it out over the plate."</TE>
<TE>   The homer was Liefer's third. He hit 18 last season.</TE>
<TE>   "This year has been tough," Liefer said. "I definitely came into
this year hoping to play a lot more than I have."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Crede and Jose Valentin hit solo homers for the White Sox, who
have won five of seven. Crede's home run was his first in the majors.</TE>
<TE>   White Sox starter Dan Wright (8-10) gave up four runs and six hits
in 6 1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   John Olerud hit his 20th home run for the Mariners, who also got
run-scoring singles from Bret Boone and Edgar Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 3, Minnesota 1--Tim Wakefield (6-4) gave up four hits and
struck out seven in eight innings at Boston for his 100th career
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox, who took two of three from the American League
Central-leading Twins, scored twice in the sixth on Johnny Damon's
double and Shea Hillenbrand's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Texas 11, Cleveland 5--Alex Rodriguez hit his AL-leading 38th
homer, and rookie Travis Hafner nearly hit for the cycle at
Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez had three hits, Rafael Palmeiro drove in three runs and
Frank Catalanotto singled, doubled, tripled and scored three times.</TE>
<TE>   Hafner, who made his major league debut Tuesday, went four for
five with three runs batted in. Needing a triple for the cycle, he
was thrown out at third trying to stretch a double in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, Baltimore 1--Steve Sparks gave up four hits in
seven-plus innings at Detroit, and Damian Jackson and George Lombard
had run-scoring singles.</TE>
<TE>   Sparks (7-11) earned his second consecutive victory and third in
four starts with a 65-mph knuckleball that kept the Orioles
off-balance.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 10, Tampa Bay 0--Rookie Runelvys Hernandez (3-1) and
three relievers combined on a two-hitter, and Joe Randa hit a
three-run homer at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Eckstein's Calling Card Is Production</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>As the Angel leadoff hitter, David Eckstein is supposed to lead the
team in runs scored, and he does. But he is rapidly developing into
one of the toughest outs in the American League, as proficient at
driving in runs as he is at scoring them.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein has driven in 53 runs this season, third in the majors
among leadoff hitters behind Alfonso Soriano of the New York Yankees
and Jacque Jones of the Minnesota Twins. He is hitting .322 with
runners in scoring position, better than any Angel except Tim Salmon.</LD>
<LD>   "He doesn't let any situation affect him," Darin Erstad said.
"He's the most fundamentally sound player I've ever played with."</LD>
<TE>   Eckstein set a professional career high Sunday with his seventh
home run, one more than he hit at double-A Trenton in 1999. The home
run accounted for the only run in the Angels' victory over the
Toronto Blue Jays and All-Star Roy Halladay, a 14-game winner who
went the month of May without giving up a home run.</TE>
<TE>   "Halladay is throwing the ball arguably better than any
right-hander in the league," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia was reminded that Pedro Martinez is still in the league.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why it's arguably," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Salmon sitting out because of a bruised left hand, Scioscia
once again put outfielder Orlando Palmeiro in the No. 3 spot in the
lineup. The move is unorthodox, since the No. 3 spot traditionally
belongs to the best hitter on the team and Palmeiro has three home
runs in 1,374 career at-bats, but there can be no argument with the
results: When Palmeiro bats third, the Angels are 8-1.</TE>
<TE>   "What's important is that, when the main guys are missing, we can
continue to win," Palmeiro said, "whether it's me or somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia likes to keep his regulars comfortable in their usual
lineup spots, and he believes Palmeiro's ability to get on base can
put pressure on a pitcher faced with retiring three pests--Eckstein,
Erstad and Palmeiro--or facing Garret Anderson with a runner on base
in the first inning.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia does not take the move to extremes; he has used Jeff
DaVanon and Julio Ramirez to pinch-hit for Palmeiro in the No. 3
spot. Still, in a season in which the Angels average 5.1 runs per
game, they have averaged 5.7 with Palmeiro batting third.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were looking for a long-term solution, I think we would
look for other things," Scioscia said. "But, if Tim is going to miss
a couple days, I think lining up this way will help us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In what General Manager Bill Stoneman described as a one-year
trial, the Angels have canceled their fall instructional league,
where top prospects get advanced work after the season, in favor of a
February mini-camp for those prospects. Stoneman acknowledged the
move would save some money but said the primary purpose was to see
whether instruction might be better received when players were fresh
in February as opposed to tired after a long minor league season.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: One inning from first shutout, Washburn teams
with Percival for a three-hitter in 1-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Baseball, circa 2002: Your starting pitcher is throwing the game of
his life. He has breezed through the first eight innings in 87
pitches. He is pitching a shutout and, but for a little tough luck,
he would be tossing a no-hitter. The other team has an
injury-depleted bench, with no pinch-hitters available to challenge
your pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   What do you do? If you're Angel Manager Mike Scioscia, in this era
of the closer, you yank Jarrod Washburn three outs away from the
first shutout of his career so Troy Percival can record the save.</LD>
<LD>   Percival was as impressive as Washburn. The Angel closer worked a
perfect ninth inning, striking out two and throwing as hard as 98
mph, in securing a 1-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   With David Eckstein's fourth-inning home run supporting the
three-hit artistry of Washburn and Percival, the Angels crept within
2 1/2 games of the Seattle Mariners in the American League West and
retained their half-game lead over the Boston Red Sox in the AL
wild-card standings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels (69-48) tied the 1989 team for best record after 117
games in club history.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, the Angels' ace, supported Scioscia's decision to use
Percival for the final inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not second-guessing that at all," Washburn said. "I think he
made the right decision. Obviously he did, because we won."</TE>
<TE>   Toronto ace Roy Halladay (14-5) lost for the first time since June
28. Washburn, who has won starts by scores of 10-6, 9-7 and 7-5 this
season, was well aware he needed to be finer Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "A trait of a winning pitcher is knowing the type of game you're
in," pitching coach Bud Black said. "You've got that instinctive feel
of whether it's going to be a low-scoring game or a high-scoring
game, and you can pitch to win it either way. That's what Washburn
does."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, 15-3 overall and 15-1 since April 13, needs to win five
of his nine remaining starts to become the Angels' first 20-game
winner since Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan won 22 in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn started the day with an upset stomach--"I was almost
throwing up on the mound," he said--but got stronger with each zero
he put up on the scoreboard. Although he fights a tendency to make
too many pitches--he made 115 through six innings in his previous
start--he walked none and had one three-ball count Sunday, in a game
Scioscia acknowledged was "probably the best game I've seen him
pitch."</TE>
<TE>   One Angel said he wasn't surprised to see Percival replace
Washburn for the ninth inning, citing the caution of Scioscia and
Black with regard to high pitch counts. Informed that Washburn's
pitch count was 87, the player shrugged and said, "It worked out."</TE>
<TE>   These were the hits Washburn had given up: an infield single, a
flare over the head of the shortstop, Eckstein, and another flare
just beyond the reach of second baseman Adam Kennedy. The Blue Jays
did have the top of their lineup scheduled to hit in the ninth
inning, but this was their bench: Jose Cruz Jr., who was unavailable
because of injury, and Eric Hinske, who would not have pinch-hit
against Washburn since he was benched against him.</TE>
<TE>   In explaining his use of Percival, Scioscia cited the toll of the
86-degree day and the upset stomach upon Washburn. The pitcher said
he could have worked another inning.</TE>
<TE>   More important, Scioscia said, was the presence of Percival. The
closer had not pitched since last Monday and was "as fresh as he was
ever going to be," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "With a dominant closer, it can make your staff stronger,"
Scioscia said, "sometimes at the expense of a starting pitcher who
wants the ball from start to finish.... It's not like having Percival
is an albatross around our starters' neck."</TE>

John Henry Williams, persuaded their father to cut her out of the
family business that included ownership of 2,000 autographed bats,
the Boston Herald reported Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint came weeks before Claudia agreed with her brother's
decision to keep the remains of their father, who died July 5,
cryonically preserved in an Arizona lab. Their sister, Bobby-Jo
Williams Ferrell, is fighting them over those plans.</LD>

<HD>Local Star Finally Makes Good</HD>
<DH>Beach volleyball: Teaming with Holdren, Fonoimoana, 33,
wins a championship for first time in his hometown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a teenager, Eric Fonoimoana used to be part of the set-up crew at
the Manhattan Beach Open, making sure the nets were tight and the
sidelines were straight before the tournament began.</LD>
<LD>   It was a good summer job for a kid who lived three blocks from the
Manhattan Beach pier. And he always had a sweet seat to watch legends
Mike Dodd and Tim Hovland win year after year the tournament dubbed
the "Wimbledon of the sand" by beach volleyball fans.</LD>
<LD>   But Fonoimoana never really envisioned winning one himself, even
after a stellar career at Mira Costa High and UC Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   Making matters worse: In 11 seasons on the Assn. of Volleyball
Professionals tour, Fonoimoana had never won his hometown tournament.</TE>
<TE>   He won at Hermosa Beach. At Huntington. Heck, he even won a gold
medal at the Sydney Olympics with Dain Blanton.</TE>
<TE>   It all changed Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana and Dax Holdren defeated Mike Whitmarsh and Canyon
Ceman, 21-15, 21-18, before an estimated crowd of 6,000 at Manhattan
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana, now 33, compared it to winning the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   "This one is one I will cherish for the rest of my life as well,"
Fonoimoana said. "Real close to the gold medal. It hits home. I would
say my career wouldn't be complete without wining here."</TE>
<TE>   Like past winners, Fonoimoana and Holdren will have their names
engraved on a bronze plaque shaped like a volleyball on the pier.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be able to show it to my kids [someday]," said Fonoimoana.</TE>
<TE>   The match, the first AVP event televised live on NBC since 1997,
was delayed almost 30 minutes because the preceding NASCAR race on
NBC ran later than expected.</TE>
<TE>   But Fonoimoana and Holdren came out strong on the way to a 15-8
lead. Fonoimoana had seven kills and no errors in nine first-game
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Whitmarsh, one of the top blockers on the beach, was frustrated
after getting only one block in the first game.</TE>
<TE>   "They were on fire.... It was like I wasn't even up there
blocking," Whitmarsh said. "We're not going to win if I'm not
blocking balls."</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana and Holdren held onto a slim 17-16 edge to gain the
sweep and turn the tide on a recent inability to finish strong.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's our turn to win some of these tight games," Holdren
said.</TE>
<TE>   Whitmarsh and Ceman were good enough to defeat Karch Kiraly and
Brent Doble in the semifinals, 21-14, 17-21, 15-13.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble couldn't keep a 9-8 lead in the third game and
were thrown off balance by a late switch in strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "They served Brent a couple balls and that surprised us a little
because I was getting every serve," Kiraly said. "From that point on,
we were down one or two points."</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble lost to Whitmarsh and Ceman by the same
third-game score for the third time this season.</TE>
<TE>   The other two losses were in semifinal matches at Huntington Beach
and Belmar, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   "It'd be nice not to go to a third game against that team," Kiraly
said. "I need to start playing better in the first game, and I'm not
doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana and Holdren swept Eduardo Bacil and Frederico Souza in
the other semifinal, 21-17, 21-18.</TE>

<HD>Bears Not Being Good Soldiers About This</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune has little sympathy for the
Chicago Bears' complaints about having to go on the road for all
their games this season. While Soldier Field is being renovated, the
Bears will play home games at the University of Illinois in
Champaign, about 140 miles south of Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "It's hard to figure out how we won World War II, what with it
being fought on the road and all," Morrissey writes. "Not even a
home-beach advantage on D-Day. How did we ever pull it off?...</LD>
<LD>   "After listening to people carry on about the rigors of getting to
Memorial Stadium, about the nastiness of the playing surface and the
unpleasantness of the local barnyard scents, you'd swear this was
hard labor at Rikers Island. And you'd swear this was the most
godforsaken place on the planet, if not Nebraska....</LD>
<TE>   "I pity the person who has to tell Dick Butkus about all this
wussiness."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: In what sport did Paul Sunderland, who was the
Lakers' play-by-play announcer last season while Chick Hearn
recuperated from heart and knee surgeries, win an Olympic gold medal
in 1984?</TE>
<TE>   Clothes call: Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle,
recalling Hearn as being quick with a needle and "the funniest guy
I've ever been around in sports":</TE>
<TE>   " 'You keep wearing that sport coat,' Chick told a sportswriter,
with genuine admiration and sincerity. 'It'll come back into style
someday.'</TE>
<TE>   "Only rarely was he topped. On a postgame TV interview, he
presented Elgin Baylor with a gift certificate for a clothing store.
Baylor handed back the certificate, saying, 'Here, Chick, you need
this worse than I do.' "</TE>
<TE>   In a class by himself: Safety Brock Marion of the Miami Dolphins,
asked by Dan Le Batard of the Miami Herald to identify the most
overrated player in football today:</TE>
<TE>   "I've got two actually. [New York Giant and former USC cornerback]
Jason Sehorn. He does all this stuff off the field, and he isn't that
good.</TE>
<TE>   "And I should say [Tampa Bay Buccaneer defensive tackle] Warren
Sapp too, but I've got to take that back. He talks a lot, but he
produces, so let's leave Sehorn alone there."</TE>
<TE>   Flying south: Shaun Powell of Newsday writes that the New Jersey
Nets, who last week traded Keith Van Horn to the Philadelphia 76ers,
never really got the player they expected after trading up to take
the former Diamond Bar High and Utah forward with the second overall
pick in the 1997 NBA draft:</TE>
<TE>   "They ... bought into the insane hype that said Van Horn would
become another Larry Bird. Well, Van Horn can never be Bird. Not the
Bird who led the Celtics to championships, and not the Bird who's
going on 46 and shooting hoops in his driveway."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Volleyball.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post, on Redskin
Coach Steve Spurrier's reluctance to commit to one quarterback:</TE>
<TE>   "How many times at Florida did we see him yank a guy after one or
two series, and bench him for the rest of the game?</TE>
<TE>   "A friend of mine suggests that Spurrier sees quarterbacks like
neckties: You might have to wear one to work each day, but you don't
have to wear the same one each day."</TE>

<HD>Sosa Completes Demolition</HD>
<DH>Baseball: With grand slam and five RBIs in Cubs' 12-9 win
over Rockies, he sets National League record with 14 RBIs in two
games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>However Sammy Sosa decided to leave Denver--on the team charter or,
more likely, a private jet--the Colorado Rockies were glad to see him
go.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa hit a grand slam and drove in five runs Sunday, and the
Chicago Cubs beat the Rockies, 12-9.</LD>
<LD>   With nine runs batted in Saturday, when he hit three three-run
homers in a 15-1 victory, Sosa set a National League record for RBIs
in consecutive games with 14.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of Sammy over the weekend," Colorado Manager Clint Hurdle
said, shaking his head.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa went eight for 12 in the three-game series.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be happy about having a series like this one," Sosa
said. "I haven't had a series like this in a long time.</TE>
<TE>   "I got good pitches to hit. I'm glad the Rockies pitched to me.
Right now, I'm feeling comfortable at the plate and I'm not swinging
at so many bad pitches as I used to."</TE>
<TE>   Sosa, who feels the Cubs' charter plane is unsafe, chartered a
private plane for the trip from San Francisco to Denver on Thursday
night. He wouldn't confirm if he planned to do the same thing for the
trip to Chicago on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   "Get away with those bad questions," Sosa said.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Patterson hit two homers and drove in three runs for the
Cubs, and Fred McGriff had a two-run homer and three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa's grand slam, the seventh of his career, increased his major
league-leading home run total to 39. The slam, a 435-foot drive to
center field in the seventh, gave the Cubs an 11-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything is possible with him," Cub Manager Bruce Kimm said.
"He's one of the most prolific home-run hitters of all time.</TE>
<TE>   "Any time he goes to the plate, fans don't dare go to the
concession stand or the restroom. We're fortunate to have him."</TE>
<TE>   The Cubs, who had six homers Saturday, belted five Sunday. Four
came against starter Denny Stark (7-3), the most given up by a
Colorado pitcher this season.</TE>
<TE>   Stark, unbeaten in his previous six starts at Coors Field, gave up
seven hits and seven runs in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Smyth (1-0), making his second major league start, gave up
four hits and three runs in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies scored four times against Antonio Alfonseca in the
ninth, highlighted by Todd Zeile's two-run double.</TE>
<TE>   "It almost got away from us," Kimm said. "This place is known for
making leads shrink quick."</TE>
<TE>   Patterson put the Cubs ahead, 1-0, with a two-out homer in the
second, his 10th.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies scored three runs in their half, highlighted by Gabe
Kapler's two-run triple. Todd Helton led off the inning with a double
and went to third on Zeile's single. Kapler tripled to left-center
and scored on Juan Uribe's sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   McGriff's two-run homer in the fourth tied the score. Bill Mueller
led off with a walk, and McGriff hit a 437-foot drive to center, his
26th.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's second homer keyed a three-run sixth, giving Chicago a
7-3 lead. Mueller doubled and scored on Sosa's double to left-center.
With two out, Patterson homered to right.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>If This Keeps Up, Grissom Might Leave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Outfielder Marquis Grissom has not thought much about next
season--"There's too much at stake this year to worry about it," he
said--but it seems the more productive he is in 2002, the less are
the chances of his returning to the Dodgers in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Grissom, in the last year of a five-year, $25-million contract, is
batting .289 with 13 home runs and 45 runs batted in while platooning
with Dave Roberts in center and filling in occasionally for Brian
Jordan in left.</LD>
<LD>   He has five fewer RBIs in 211 at-bats than Jordan--who has 13
homers and 50 RBIs--has in 369 at-bats. Despite limited playing time,
Grissom has more homers than Paul Lo Duca (seven) and more RBIs than
Mark Grudzielanek (43). Grissom's .529 slugging percentage is the
second-highest on the team behind Shawn Green (.577).</LD>
<TE>   But Grissom, who homered in his first at-bat Sunday night, wants
to be an everyday player, and if Jordan returns next season--as a
player traded in the middle of a multiyear contract, Jordan can
demand a trade this winter--it's doubtful Grissom's role with the
Dodgers would change in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   It's also doubtful the Dodgers, who have $89.5 million committed
in guaranteed contracts to 12 players in 2003, would want Grissom
back at his current price tag, $5 million a year. And the more
Grissom hits, the more likely he'll find a regular job elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking for at-bats; I want to play every day for somebody,"
Grissom, 35, said. "I rate myself as a player every year, and I think
my arm and my speed are still above average, and my hitting is still
there."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, a 13-year veteran who has played in three World Series,
filled in for the injured Jordan and homered twice in Friday night's
7-6 victory over Philadelphia and had the game-winning hit Saturday
night, a two-run single in the seventh that gave the Dodgers a 10-8
victory. His first-inning homer Sunday night gave the Dodgers a 1-0
lead.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been a better player for us this year than he was last year,
by far," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He has discipline in the strike
zone, he's back to using the whole field, his average is up [67]
points over last year, he's creeping up on 50 RBIs ... he's doing OK
for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Grissom grumbled about platooning with Tom Goodwin in 2001, but
his acceptance of his role this season has been a key factor in his
success.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm around a bunch of good guys, and this has been fun for me,"
Grissom said. "I'm focused. It's just me and baseball. I'm not taking
anything personally, I have no animosity toward anyone. And after 13
years, nothing tricks me, nothing surprises me. I'm feeling good. I'm
relaxed, yet aggressive at the same time. That's a fine line."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After returning home to Georgia today as his kids begin school,
pitcher Kevin Brown, who made his second rehabilitation start Friday
night for triple-A Las Vegas, will join the Dodgers Tuesday in
Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, who threw in the bullpen Sunday, will throw another bullpen
session Tuesday, after which the Dodgers will decide on his return.
Brown, who had surgery June 11 for a herniated disk in his lower
back, most likely will pitch Friday night in New York. Brown said
he's having "no problems health-wise" and that his stamina "won't be
an issue."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Ashby will start the opener of a three-game series in
Montreal, but Tracy hasn't announced a starter for Wednesday or
Thursday because he may use today's off day to skip Kazuhisa Ishii or
Omar Daal in the rotation. One of the two left-handers would pitch
Wednesday and be followed by Hideo Nomo Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, who sat out his third consecutive game Sunday, will
undergo a precautionary MRI test on his lower back today. Doctors
believe he has a muscle strain but want to rule out the possibility
of a bulging disk, an injury that sidelined Jordan for two-thirds of
the 1997 season.... Left-hander Jesse Orosco was unavailable Sunday
because of stiffness in his lower back, but the reliever should be
ready by Tuesday's game in Montreal.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Lightning may strike twice on occasion, but rarely three times. There
were no thunderbolts left in Dodger bats, which produced stunning
come-from-behind victories in two previous games, and the forecast
for reliever Paul Shuey remained cloudy.</LD>
<LD>   The result Sunday night was a dreary 6-3 loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies before 38,517 in Dodger Stadium, a defeat that ended the
Dodgers' four-game win streak, dropped them seven games behind
Arizona in the National League West and trimmed their wild-card lead
over San Francisco to a half-game.</LD>
<LD>   Summoned to preserve a 3-3 tie in the top of the eighth, the
struggling Shuey gave up three hits, two walks and three runs to
absorb his second loss in nine appearances since being acquired from
the Cleveland Indians for top prospect Ricardo Rodriguez on July 28.
Shuey's earned-run average in 6 2/3 innings as a Dodger: 10.80.</LD>
<TE>   Compounding the loss was an injury to hot-hitting second baseman
Mark Grudzielanek, who suffered a mild sprain of the medial
collateral ligament in his left knee while fielding Travis Lee's
grounder in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who homered in the second inning Sunday--his third
homer in three games--and is batting .355 (38 for 107) since the
All-Star break, was pulled after the seventh and will be reevaluated
today, but the injury is not believed to be serious. He left without
speaking to reporters but walked out of the clubhouse without a limp.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who have the fourth-best fielding percentage in the
NL, also committed a season-high four errors, two contributing to an
unearned run in the second and two aiding the Phillies' three-run
eighth. But all three eighth-inning runs off Shuey were earned.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest with you, I just don't feel like I'm making that
many bad pitches," said Shuey, who has had trouble adjusting from the
American to the National League. "But the results are what they are.
I'm not making the key pitch to get out of a jam, and maybe I'm in
too many jams to start with. It's been a while since I've struggled
like this.... I don't have too much pride, but what pride I have is
shot right now."</TE>
<TE>   Tomas Perez singled to start the eighth and advanced to second
when second baseman Alex Cora, attempting to catch Perez after a wide
turn at first, hit him with the throw, the ball bouncing into foul
territory. Marlon Anderson grounded to third, and pinch-hitter Jeremy
Giambi walked.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Glanville flied to right for the second out, but Jimmy
Rollins slapped an opposite-field single to left--his career-high
fifth hit of the game. Left fielder Marquis Grissom charged and
short-hopped the flare, but his throw home, which appeared strong
enough to get Perez by several steps, took a wicked hop over the head
of catcher Paul Lo Duca.</TE>
<TE>   Perez scored the go-ahead run, and both runners advanced on
Grissom's error. Shuey walked Bobby Abreu intentionally to load the
bases for Pat Burrell, who hit an eighth-inning grand slam off Shuey
Friday night. Shuey kept Burrell in the park this time, but the left
fielder lined a two-run single to center for a 6-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had an answer," Manager Jim Tracy said when asked to
explain Shuey's struggles. "I can tell you this--we need Paul Shuey.
We still have a [wild-card] lead, but we need this guy. The outs in
the eighth inning are his and Paul Quantrill's to get."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Odalis Perez, who hasn't won since July 5, gave
up three runs--two earned--and nine hits in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom's 13th homer of the season and third in two days, a laser
over the center-field wall in the first, gave the Dodgers a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek's throwing error and pitcher Randy Wolf's RBI
groundout in the top of the second gave the Phillies a 2-1 lead;
Grudzielanek tied it with his homer to right in the bottom of the
inning.</TE>
<TE>   Perez led off the fifth with a ground-rule double to right-center,
took third on Dave Roberts' grounder to second and scored on Adrian
Beltre's sacrifice fly to center for a 3-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies tied it in the seventh when pinch-hitter Jason
Michaels walked, took second on Glanville's sacrifice bunt, third on
Rollins' single and scored on Abreu's double off the wall in center.</TE>

<LD>The magnitude of the loss of John C. Argue to the business and sports
community of Los Angeles may be best represented by his role in the
events leading to this city's bid for the 1984 Olympic Games. Even
more so, by what he did after those Games had been awarded.</LD>
<LD>   Argue, who died Saturday at 70 after an eight-month battle with
leukemia, was a lawyer, businessman and educator.</LD>
<LD>   One of his closest sports and business associates, Pat Haden, the
former USC and Ram quarterback, called Argue "a doer, somebody who
got the ball advancing. You'd meet with him, and then, at the next
meeting, two, three, sometimes five steps had been taken."</LD>
<TE>   For Los Angeles to get the Olympic Games, it needed a doer. And
Argue, as longtime chairman of the Southern California Committee for
the Olympic Games (SCCOG), was that doer. His SCCOG raised the money
and did the legwork for the bid effort. Then Argue worked the
politics of the International Olympic Committee. The result was a
successful bid, in 1978, for the Games to come here in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   But what few knew, and what nobody addressed publicly until
Sunday, was the vital and selfless role that Argue played in the
aftermath of that successful bid.</TE>
<TE>   When L.A. was awarded the '84 Games, They came with a provision.
The IOC demanded that there be a public component to the proposed
private operation of the Games. That public component was to be a
commitment from city officials, and then-Mayor Tom Bradley, that
taxpayer money would cover any operating shortfalls.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley and Argue knew that that wouldn't work in L.A. When the
IOC proposed a contract that had taxpayer liability in it, Argue
responded by saying, "We're not going to sign that.... It is
absolutely not acceptable in its present form."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after, Bradley made it clear that, with this additional
provision, Los Angeles would pull back on its bid. The negotiations
continued, and to lead the way for the Los Angeles cause, Bradley
appointed a committee of seven, composed of lawyer Paul Ziffren,
industrialist Justin Dart, utilities official Howard Allen, labor
leader Bill Robertson, TV producer David Wolper, oilman Rodney Rood
and Argue. Argue was the chairman of the committee.</TE>
<TE>   It immediately became clear that, were the Games to go forward in
Los Angeles, somebody from this group would be in charge. And it
seemed likely it would be Argue. The history of Olympic bids in the
United States, then and now, most often put the person behind the
successful bid directly into the top chair of the organizing
committee. That's what happened when William May Garland brought the
first Games to L.A. in 1932, and it is what happened in '96 in
Atlanta with Billy Payne, and in 2002 in Salt Lake when Tom Welch led
the bid charge and became the organizing committee president until
scandal touched him and the Games.</TE>
<TE>   But once Bradley and Argue got the IOC to blink and agree to a
privately funded L.A. Olympics, Bradley had to pick a leader. The
politics of that, and how Argue handled it, were not only critical to
the success of the L.A. Olympics, and the Olympic movement in
general, but also spoke volumes about John Argue.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley decided that Ziffren, a widely respected liberal lawyer,
would become chairman of the L.A. Olympic Committee, not Argue, a
widely respected conservative lawyer. That decision was described
Sunday by Anton Calleia, then a key aide to Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   "John Argue was part of the old line, exclusive Olympic
establishment," Calleia said, "and Bradley wanted a more inclusive
Olympics for Los Angeles that would include all parts of the
community in the effort."</TE>
<TE>   That meant that Argue was a member of the exclusive downtown
California Club, in which the predominantly white membership
routinely excluded other races and females. Bradley had made it a
policy never to go to the club.</TE>
<TE>   Argue, who later served as president of the California Club and
accepted a movement that has changed that policy of exclusion, would
have had grounds for loud and public protest. Nobody could dispute
that he, more than anybody else, had brought the Games back to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the man who made a career out of fairness,
consensus-building and behind-the-scenes work, went along with the
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Ziffren's widow, Mickey, said Sunday: "John and Paul became
friends. They had huge political differences, but Paul had a high
regard for him."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, the labor leader, said: "With every move John made and
every suggestion he put out there, he proved his leadership. There
was no showboating on his part."</TE>
<TE>   Shortly, it became time to select an operational chief, the L.A.
Organizing Committee president, who would be the hands-on person, the
one who would truly get the credit or blame for the success of the
'84 Games. Argue's choice was a little-known travel business
executive named Peter Ueberroth.</TE>
<TE>   "He fit. He was young, healthy, vigorous," Argue said later. "He
knew accounting. He knew management. He'd been down and dirty in
every aspect of business. It also had to be somebody who loved
sports, knew something about them. Had a feel for them."</TE>
<TE>   Also in the picture was Edwin Steidle of the May Company. A vote
needed to be taken on whether to allow Steidle more time to negotiate
a severance with May; were the vote to be against allowing that
additional time, Ueberroth would effectively be elected.</TE>
<TE>   According to Calleia, the vote of the existing L.A. Olympic
Organizing Committee was preceded by a conversation between Bradley
and committee member Rafer Johnson, the former Olympic decathlon
champion. So impressed had Bradley been by the way Argue handled the
Ziffren situation, the mayor felt he owed Argue. So Bradley asked
Johnson to vote for Ueberroth, which he did.</TE>
<TE>   The final vote was 9-8 for Ueberroth, who went on not only to run
the most financially successful Olympic Games and become Time
magazine's Man of the Year, but also to choose, as the final
torchbearer and lighter of the Olympic caldron at the opening
ceremony, Rafer Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Perelman, a vice president of media relations for the
LAOOC and an Olympic historian, remembers running into Argue near the
end of the L.A. Games.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran into him in the street between the Coliseum and the Sports
Arena, and by then it had become obvious what a huge success our
Olympics would be," Perelman said. "During the Games, John had been
chief of protocol for the Coliseum, which was nice but not exactly
president of the organizing committee. So I asked him if he felt bad
that he hadn't demanded a higher position because I believe to this
day he could have gotten anything he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "But he just seemed happier than I've ever seen him and he said,
no, that he was just delighted the way things had turned out. He
said, 'Why would I have wanted to get in the way of what I knew would
turn out to be such a great success even without me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Perelman said that it was Argue who figured out the basic problem
with Olympic cost overruns before 1984 and was able to address that
in getting the attention of the IOC, and eventually the bid for L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Every Olympics since World War II, he found, had made money on
operations, but lost overall because of construction costs," Perelman
said. "He quickly showed the IOC how little construction was needed
in Los Angeles, how much we already had here."</TE>
<TE>   Perelman also noted Argue's ability to sense the direction of the
prevailing winds and play to that.</TE>
<TE>   "He made sure that the first sentence on one of the bid proposal
documents read: 'Arrangements are to be spartan.' Remember, this was
happening right after the Montreal Olympics, where cost overruns had
been huge."</TE>
<TE>   Perelman said he hopes that Olympic history will eventually find a
special spot for Argue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that the Olympic movement will ever fully understand
how important John Argue was to it," Perelman said.</TE>
<TE>   For Haden, who has served on various boards with Argue and has
worked with Argue in Argue's capacity as chairman of USC's board of
trustees, the loss is much more than an Olympic matter.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked for an obit in the New York Times, because I thought he
was that big," Haden said. "I don't know if people who haven't been
around here for a while fully understand how big a loss this is. I'll
tell you one thing. Every business person in downtown L.A.
understands.</TE>
<TE>   "Last week, so much attention was on Chick Hearn and his loss. And
rightfully so. But we've lost another of that stature with John, He
was as big behind the scenes in L.A. as Chick was in front of it."</TE>
<TE>   David Simon, president of the L.A. Sports Council, of which Argue
was the founding chairman, said that almost all business decisions he
made, either involving the Sports Council or other matters, would
prompt some sort of blessing from Argue.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, there would be six or seven of us at a table," Simon
said, "and we would brainstorm for hours and reach a decision and
feel very good about it. Then everybody would say, 'Better bounce
that off John.' And sure enough, in the first 10 seconds of our talk
with him, he would see something obvious and important that we had
missed."</TE>
<TE>   Simon also said: "I don't think anybody has accomplished more for
Los Angeles and gotten less credit for it than John Argue."</TE>
<TE>   Anita DeFrantz, influential IOC member and president of L.A.'s
Amateur Athletic Foundation, was an active Olympic rower in 1977 when
she first saw Argue.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. and New York were fighting for the USOC approval to try for
the '84 Games," DeFrantz recalled, "and there was a meeting about
that. I was there as a member of the athletes' advisory council, and
John Argue stood up to speak. I remember how much energy he had, and
how much passion he had for making sure the Olympics would be great
for the athletes."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, Argue had been chairman of DeFrantz's AAF, and she
said that brought both friendship and friendly disagreements.
Politically, DeFrantz was on the other side of the world from Argue.</TE>
<TE>   "One time, he asked me why we had so much news about women
athletes in the Sports Letters we put out," DeFrantz said. "I told
him that we did that because the general makeup of the world was
about 50% men and 50% women. He paused for a while and then said,
'OK, but just don't make it any more than that.'</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't stop laughing."</TE>
<TE>   Among Argue's idiosyncrasies was his tendency to send off short,
handwritten notes to friends and associates, not to mention sports
editors of newspapers, about anything and everything.</TE>
<TE>   The problem was, his handwriting was indecipherable. So his
longtime administrative assistant, Connie Gray, would send along a
typed translation with the original note.</TE>
<TE>   His Argue-grams were so much a part of his existence that Randy
Harvey, veteran Olympic writer for The Times and now a senior
assistant sports editor, used them as a measure of Argue's health.
When one arrived in February at The Times' Olympic office in Salt
Lake, shortly after word had gotten out of Argue's illness, Harvey
surveyed the scribble and its translation, encouraging The Times to
give better placement to USC basketball over UCLA. Then Harvey said,
"I feel better now. This means he's fine."</TE>
<TE>   Haden thought the same thing when he received an Argue-gram
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "The Times ran a picture with me and George Allen in it," Haden
said. "John wrote one of his notes, chiding me about being shorter
than George Allen."</TE>
<TE>   Haden said he had written back, but obviously too late.</TE>
<TE>   As in most things with Argue, he had quietly, effectively, without
much of a ripple, gotten the last word.</TE>

<CX>   John C. Argue--In an Aug. 12 Sports story remembering the late Los
Angeles Olympic organizer John C. Argue, no implication was intended
that Olympic President Peter V. Ueberroth's selection of Olympic
decathlon champion Rafer Johnson to light the torch at the Los
Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1984 had anything to do with Johnson
casting the decisive vote to select Ueberroth as president of the
organizing committee in 1979.</CX>
<CX>      Johnson also says that he was only "joking" when he declared to
others at a public gathering that the late Mayor Tom Bradley asked
him to vote for Ueberroth. Johnson said he cast his deciding vote for
Ueberroth independently, without any urging by Bradley.</CX>

<HD>Woods Wins, PGA Next on the List</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods has won the PGA Championship two ways: by playing the
previous week and by practicing and resting.</LD>
<LD>   Now he will attempt to win the year's final major off a victory.</LD>
<LD>   Woods shot a two-under-par 70 Sunday to win the Buick Open at
Grand Blanc, Mich., by four shots at 17 under. It was his 33rd PGA
Tour victory and fourth in his last eight starts.</LD>
<TE>   "You want to feel like you're playing well going into a
championship," Woods said. "And any time you win, you feel good."</TE>
<TE>   Although he missed a chance to win the Grand Slam with his
28th-place tie at the British Open three weeks ago, Woods has an
opportunity to do something no other golfer has, beginning Thursday
at Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who won this year's Masters and U.S. Open, will be the
first to win three majors in a year twice if he wins the PGA
Championship. Ben Hogan did it in 1953 and Woods, who has won seven
of the last 12 majors, did it two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "That would rank right up there," said Woods, who was to fly
Sunday night to Minnesota. "Hopefully I can add that to my list. It's
already been a successful year and I would like to make it even more
successful."</TE>
<TE>   Esteban Toledo, who began the final round one stroke behind Woods,
stayed with the world's best golfer through 12 holes, but then
collapsed with three consecutive bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo shot a one-over 73 to finish at 13 under, tied for second
with Mark O'Meara (68), Brian Gay (68) and Fred Funk (71). It matched
Toledo's best finish and moved him from 118th to 85th on the money
list.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't at nervous at all," Toledo said. "He's the best player
and I tried to put some pressure on him. It just didn't work."</TE>
<TE>   Woods won $594,000 to raise his total this year to more than $4.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   If Woods wins the PGA Championship, he would be the first player
to win a major after winning a tournament the previous week since
Sandy Lyle won the Greater Greensboro Open and the Masters in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is 25-2 in PGA Tour events when leading or tied for the lead
after 54 holes. Since 1958, only 16 of 38 players who have at least
shared the lead after 54 holes have won the Buick Open.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb overcame a three-shot deficit with a six-under 66 at
Turnberry, Scotland, to win a record third Women's British Open and
complete the LPGA's Super Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Webb finished at 15-under 273, defeating Australia's Michelle
Ellis and Spain's Paula Marti by two strokes and claiming her sixth
major in four years.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Australian completed the Grand Slam by winning the
du Maurier, the Nabisco Championship, the U.S. Open and the LPGA
Championship. By adding the British Open, she completed the Super
Slam in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Webb also became the first player since Mickey Wright in 1964 to
win a major four years in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin, who lost in playoffs two of the last three weeks, shot
a four-under 68 and defeated Hubert Green by three strokes in the 3M
Championship at Blaine, Minn., his tour-leading third senior victory
of the year. The bogey-free final round at the TPC of the Twin Cities
gave Irwin a 12-under 204 total and the first-place check of
$262,500. It also ended his five-month victory drought on the Senior
PGA Tour.</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: De Seroux helps guide Azeri to fifth victory
in a row as Astra is poised for her fourth straight on Saturday.</DH>

<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Trainer Laura De Seroux kept one winning streak alive on Sunday and
she'll try to keep another going this Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Azeri, the top female main track performer in the country, toyed
with her four rivals in the $300,000 Clement L. Hirsch Handicap for
her fifth graded stakes win in a row and her eighth victory in nine
career starts.</LD>
<LD>   In six days, Astra, the best female turf runner in the U.S., will
try for her fourth consecutive victory in the $500,000 Beverly D.
Stakes at Arlington Park.</LD>
<TE>   The overwhelming 1-10 favorite, Azeri, a 4-year-old Jade Hunter
filly owned by the late Allen Paulson, took the lead heading into the
first turn of the Hirsch and from there it was only a matter of not
whether she would win, but by how much.</TE>
<TE>   At the wire, the 126-pound highweight had two lengths on Angel
Gift, the longest shot in the field at 23-1, but jockey Mike Smith
had her geared down at the wire, so the margin was deceptive.</TE>
<TE>   She completed the 1 1/16 miles in 1:42 3/5 and the $180,000 check
put her over $1 million in earnings. Azeri, who spotted her opponents
10 to 12 pounds, stands now at $1,057,240.</TE>
<TE>   "She was pulling a little bit going into the first turn and I'm
glad it opened up the way it did for Mike and that he could let her
gallop on," said De Seroux. "That seems to be developing into her
style, where she seems to be the happiest, and when she gets to the
lead, she's very relaxed.</TE>
<TE>   "Carrying that amount of weight, I have a feeling, the way this
race set up, it won't take a lot out of her. I'm very relieved. I
just want to go hug her now."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Gift, who had never before finished second in any of her
previous seven races on dirt, wound up two lengths clear of 13-1 shot
Se Me Acabo, then came Queen Of Wilshire and 6-1 second choice Irguns
Angel, who faded badly in the stretch after being closest to the
winner for six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   She finished 17 1/2 lengths behind Azeri.</TE>
<TE>   De Seroux indicated Azeri will start once more before the
Breeders' Cup Distaff on Oct. 26 at Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   The options are the $500,000 Ruffian Handicap on Sept. 14 at
Belmont Park or the $200,000 Lady's Secret Breeders' Cup Handicap on
Oct. 2 at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to a pair of $200,000 show bets on Azeri, there was a minus
show pool of $130,262 in the Hirsch. There was $764,201 bet to show
in the Grade II and $725,656 was wagered on the favorite. One of the
$200,000 bets was made at the Meadowlands in New Jersey and the other
was at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The career of Left Bank, who defeated a quality field in the
Whitney Handicap at Saratoga nine days ago, is almost certainly over.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-year-old son of French Deputy underwent emergency surgery on
Saturday night at Tufts New England Veterinary Medical Center's
Hospital for Large Animals after coming down with colic earlier in
the day.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Michael Tabor, Left Bank had knocked off Street Cry,
defending champion Lido Palace and Macho Uno in the Whitney, equaling
a 28-year-old track record for 1 1/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   He has won 14 of 24 and earned more than $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Orientate, the 2-5 favorite, led wire-to-wire for his third
consecutive stakes victory, taking the $200,000 A.G. Vanderbilt
Handicap by two lengths over Say Florida Sandy.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis and trained by Wayne Lukas, the
4-year-old Mt. Livermore colt won more easily than the margin of
victory would indicate. He was never challenged after clearing
through a 22 4/5 opening quarter mile.</TE>
<TE>   Giving Jerry Bailey his sixth stakes win of the meet, Orientate
won for the eighth time in 17 starts and he'll try for his first
Grade I win in the $250,000 Forego on Sept. 1 at Saratoga.</TE>

<LD>Besides being 2-year-old fillies, five of the six entrants in today's
$150,000 Adirondack Stakes at Saratoga have something else in common.</LD>
<LD>   They all enter the Grade II unbeaten. Only Crimson And Roses, who
was a distant fourth in the Schuylerville on the first day of the
meet at Saratoga, has experienced the agony of defeat and she has
lost three times.</LD>
<LD>   Holiday Runner has the most experience of the rest as she has won
all three of her races for owner S J Bee Stable and trainer Wayne
Lukas. A daughter of Meadowlake bought for a mere $35,000 at
Keeneland about a year ago, Holiday Runner has won at three different
tracks. She broke her maiden at Keeneland, won the Three Chimneys
Juvenile on the Kentucky Derby undercard at Churchill Downs, then
held on to win the Fashion at Belmont Park as the 3-10 favorite.</LD>
<TE>   Perfect in two races, Awesome Humor will make her first start for
Elliott Walden after being bought privately by Winstar Farm after her
second win. Like Holiday Runner, she earned her first victory at
Keeneland, then went to Churchill and took the Debutante. Pat Day,
who became the sport's all-time leading money earner among jockeys,
has the mount on the Distorted Humor filly.</TE>
<TE>   The other unbeatens all enter the 6 1/2 furlong race 1-0. Ella
Bella graduated at Belmont Park last month, Stellar won her first
start at Saratoga on July 28 and Just Call Me Angel tallied on a
sloppy track at Laurel on July 26.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Trainer Bob Baffert will seek his third win in
the last seven years in today's $100,000 Real Good Deal Stakes. The
seven-furlong race is restricted to 3-year-olds bred in California,
and Baffert will be represented by 5-2 morning-line choice Modernist.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Gamblin Town. The 4-year-old Town Caper filly has won
four of her last five--her loss came by a head on June 21 at
Hollywood Park--and she'll try for another victory as she steps up in
class in today's second at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Racing in Northern California. The quality is worse
than normal at both the Bay Meadows Fair and Ferndale.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Like Magic and Gamblin
Town in the first, using Sonoita, Reluctant Hero and Sunday In Moscow
in the second and singling Daisyago in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/37. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $5.60/$211.80. Total money bet: $292.</TE>

<HD>Almost Down to Last Strike</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Weekend talks produce little progress, but
negotiations could heat up if players' union sets strike date today,
as expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The uneven pace of labor talks could quicken again if the Major
League Baseball Players Assn. sets a strike deadline as expected
today, potentially spurring the sides to address core economic issues
and complete an agreement before the sport's ninth work stoppage
begins.</LD>
<LD>   The union's executive board will meet here after negotiators made
little headway in weekend collective bargaining discussions, failing
to accomplish enough to persuade players to return to the table
instead of planning a possible walkout. Owners and players, although
making progress on ancillary matters, have not bridged gaps on
revenue sharing and the contentious issue of a payroll tax. They have
mostly talked around the two items that might prevent them from
reaching a deal.</LD>
<LD>   "I know everyone's been reading about negotiations being all
positive and going great, and some things have moved quickly, but
that's not totally right overall," said catcher Paul Lo Duca, the
Dodger player representative. "The two big issues are still revenue
sharing and the luxury tax, and those aren't exactly moving real
fast. It's more like a snail's pace right now."</LD>
<TE>   The big issues, avoided for weeks, were raised in a three-hour
bargaining session Sunday. Negotiations are scheduled to resume
Tuesday in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Owners have said they would not initiate a work stoppage this
season, vowing not to lock out players through the World Series, but
could unilaterally implement new work rules after the postseason if
negotiations continue to lag. That possibility is expected to prompt
the union to play its main bargaining chip. The union is likely to
set a strike date of Sept. 1 or Sept. 16 in a meeting attended by
player representatives of all 30 clubs, putting an industry that last
year generated a record $3.55 billion in revenue on the verge of
another shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   The union last set a strike date July 28, 1994, triggering a work
stoppage that lasted 232 days and wiped out the playoffs and World
Series. The owners implemented, but a federal judge found owners
guilty of illegal labor practice, prompting players to return to
work.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have any deadline for something to get done, you'll
take your sweet old time to get it done," said pitcher Scott
Schoeneweis, the Angel representative. "That's true with everything
in life. If you need to pay a bill by Aug. 15, or you can pay it
whenever, you'll wait to pay the bill until you actually feel like
it."</TE>
<TE>   Players said they hope setting a date would not adversely affect
negotiations characterized by a civility and sincerity absent in
previous labor talks, but they feel compelled to consider taking the
risky step that could result in a backlash against them by fans.
Owners have downplayed the significance of the union's probable
action, maintaining their optimistic tone about talks.</TE>
<TE>   But setting a timer on the process would turn up the heat.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, Monday is nothing but a date that the union picked
for a meeting, and I can only feel so much pressure as a result of
that," said Rob Manfred, baseball's lead labor lawyer. "It has
significance only because [union chief] Don [Fehr] has scheduled a
meeting that day, and I just can't try to get an agreement around
that schedule. As far as I'm concerned, it's just another day that
they're not going to be able to be at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   "This strike date issue is an internal union matter. I just have
no way to predict what their dynamics are on that issue. It's really
based on the [union's] evaluation of how they see the process, as
opposed to how we see the process. We are having the kind of
discussions that you would hope, if people stick with it, would
eventually produce an agreement in the foreseeable future."</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations have at times moved steadily since resuming in
earnest after the All-Star break. Agreements have been reached on
minor issues such as increasing the minimum salary to $300,000
starting next year, and the sides are moving closer to finalizing a
plan for steroid testing after the union made a major policy shift in
ending its long-standing opposition to mandatory drug testing.</TE>
<TE>   However, clearing those hurdles is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the last year and a half to get this done," Dodger second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "Now, time is a limited resource."</TE>

<LD>Carlos Moya is back.</LD>
<LD>   Showing the form that once had him ranked No. 1 in the world, Moya
upset Lleyton Hewitt, 7-5, 7-6 (5), Sunday in the final of the
$2.95-million Cincinnati Masters Series at Mason, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   "I knew my hardcourt game was not bad, but I didn't expect to win
this tournament," Moya said. "It is a big surprise for me."</LD>
<TE>   Moya, the French Open champion in 1998, was ranked No. 1 in the
world briefly in 1999, then injured his back. The journey while he
recovered made him reflect on his career.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have bad moments, you have to think that the good ones
are going to come soon," Moya said. "The most important thing is to
be healthy."</TE>
<TE>   He worked his way up the rankings to No. 41 in 2000 and to No. 19
last year. He was No. 13 in ATP points going into this tournament,
and jumped to No. 5 by beating Hewitt, the current No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Moya, who won $392,000, did not lose a set in six matches in the
tournament and beat Hewitt in the final with powerful forehand
strokes that the Australian could not reach.</TE>
<TE>   The sky darkened and the lights came on early in the match. After
one break apiece and the first set tied, 4-4, play was suspended for
2 hours 18 minutes because of rain.</TE>
<TE>   When play resumed, Moya held serve twice and broke Hewitt in the
12th game to take the set.</TE>

<TE>   Qualifier Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia defeated Denisa Chladkova
of the Czech Republic, 0-6, 6-3, 7-6 (2), to win the Nordic Light
Open at Espoo, Finland.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first WTA final for Kuznetsova, who turned 17 in June.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Racing</TE>
<TE>   Driver Tony Stewart took his aggression to the track and rolled to
a NASCAR victory at Watkins Glen International in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart was racing for the first time since being put on a
season-long probation for the second year in a row and fined $60,000
for punching a photographer Aug. 4 at the Brickyard 400 in
Indianapolis. He said he is seeking professional help for his temper.</TE>
<TE>   He had little competition at Watkins Glen, and his Pontiac was the
class of the field over the waning laps on the 2.45-mile road course.
Stewart won by 1.636 seconds for his 15th career victory and third
this year, matching Matt Kenseth for the most on the Winston Cup
circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, 31, hounded rookie Ryan Newman, who took the lead on the
63rd of 90 laps, trying him inside and outside on the serpentine
course. Finally, Stewart made his move on the 10th turn, and
completed it on the 11th and final corner on the 72nd lap.</TE>
<TE>   Robby Gordon was third. P.J. Jones, in his first start for A.J.
Foyt, finished fourth in a Pontiac. Polesitter Ricky Rudd, hoping to
tie Jeff Gordon's record with a seventh road-course victory, was
fifth in a Ford.</TE>
<TE>   Defending race champion Jeff Gordon, seeking to win for the fifth
time in six years on the track, wound up 22nd.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Carpentier left it all on the track in CART's Mid-Ohio
Grand Prix at Lexington, Ohio. Right down to his checkered-flag
underwear.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the pole Saturday, Carpentier said he might run
around the racetrack naked if he won the race. He politely declined
to back up the boast after the victory, but about three hours later,
he stripped to his boxers and stood on the track to pose for
pictures.</TE>
<TE>   The French Canadian driver won his second consecutive CART race in
Ohio, averaging 106.680 mph to hold off Christian Fittipaldi by 3.2
seconds. Michael Andretti was third.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Maverick assistant coach Del Harris said he is no longer a
candidate to become the Denver Nuggets' coach because he could not
reach an agreement with the team, becoming the fourth candidate to

<LD>Seattle Seahawk starting quarterback Trent Dilfer is out indefinitely
because of a sprained ligament in his right knee.</LD>
<LD>   Team officials would not say Sunday when Dilfer could return.
Dilfer and Coach Mike Holmgren were both unavailable for comment.</LD>
<LD>   Dilfer injured the medial collateral ligament in his right knee
during the second quarter of the Seahawks' 28-10 exhibition loss to
the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   Dilfer signed an $8-million, four-year contract in the off-season
and Holmgren selected him as the starter last spring.</TE>

<HD>Schilling's 19th Win Is No Sweat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On his third try, Curt Schilling hardly broke a sweat while becoming
the season's first 19-game winner.</LD>
<LD>   Schilling pitched seven scoreless innings Sunday and the Arizona
Diamondbacks completed a three-game sweep of the Florida Marlins with
a 9-2 victory at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   He gave up five hits, struck out eight, walked none and threw only
89 pitches, 61 for strikes.</LD>
<TE>   "We jumped out early and I thought we kept the pressure on them
offensively all day," Schilling said. "That certainly changes the way
you pitch. It feels good. We had a good homestand."</TE>
<TE>   While most of the Diamondbacks go to South Bend, Ind., for an
exhibition game today against Arizona's Class-A affiliate, Schilling
is headed to the players' union meetings in Chicago, where a strike
date could be set.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no idea," he said when asked what he expected in Chicago.
"I want to hear that we've got something solved, something done."</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (19-4) was the fastest to reach 18 victories since Randy
Jones of San Diego in 1976, but had failed to get No. 19 despite two
strong outings--a 2-1 complete-game loss at Montreal on Aug. 1 and a
no-decision in Arizona's 4-3, 13-inning loss to Atlanta on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the Diamondbacks supported him with 14 hits through
seven innings, and he left with an 8-0 lead. Manager Bob Brenly said
Schilling easily could have continued to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a couple of guys down there in the bullpen that needed
some work," Brenly said. "We had a comfortable lead, so we got him
out of there at that point and hopefully saved some pitches for later
on."</TE>
<TE>   Every Arizona starter had a hit, including Luis Gonzalez, who
ended an 0-for-24 skid with a run-scoring single in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 5, Pittsburgh 4--Pinch-hitter Ramon Martinez singled
home the winning run in the bottom of the 11th inning at San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent homered and drove in two runs for the Giants, who won
for the sixth time in eight games even though closer Robb Nen blew a
4-3 lead in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 13, Houston 3--Chipper Jones had a career-high five hits
and scored three runs at Houston, and Kevin Millwood (11-6) won for
the ninth time in 10 decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta had a season-high 20 hits in winning for the 10th time in
12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 9, San Diego 7--Aaron Boone hit a two-run homer in the
12th inning at Cincinnati to lift the Reds, who blew a late five-run
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Boone hit three homers in the series opener Friday night, then
helped complete the three-game sweep by connecting against Brandon
Villafuerte (1-1) with one out in the 12th.</TE>
<TE>   The Reds led, 7-2, after six innings, but their bullpen let it
slip away.</TE>
<TE>   Bubba Trammell hit a solo homer in the seventh against Scott
Williamson and a two-run shot in the ninth against Danny Graves that
tied the score, 7-7.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 6, Montreal 2--Ben Sheets (6-14) gave up five hits in
eight innings, and Matt Stairs and Richie Sexson homered at
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Stairs' 420-foot drive to right-center in the fifth gave Milwaukee
a 2-1 lead, and Sexson's 24th homer, a 430-foot shot to left field
leading off the seventh, put the Brewers on top for good, 3-2. Jose
Hernandez hit a solo homer, his 21st, later in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 9, New York 0--Scott Rolen hit his first home run with
St. Louis and a two-run triple, lifting Chuck Finley (3-2) and the
Cardinals at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, who had been in a two-for-32 slump, homered in his 42nd
at-bat since arriving in a trade with Philadelphia on July 29.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with three hits, two walks and three runs batted in.
Albert Pujols had a two-run double.</TE>

<HD>At the PGA, It Takes a Village</HD>
<DH>Golf: Woods, fellow pros play year's final major this week,
but the real big-money action will be in the corporate tents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHASKA, Minn.</DL>
<LD>There are supposed to be 10,000 lakes in this state, but the
operative number this week is 10 million. That's roughly how many
dollars the PGA of America expects to put in its pockets from the 35
corporate hospitality tents at Hazeltine National Golf Club.</LD>
<LD>   Oh and they're not tents, they're "chalets." And they're situated
in "villages."</LD>
<LD>   And if you think anything called a chalet and found in a village
is going to be some plain vanilla deal, think again.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, think soft sofas and cushy chairs, lounges and buffets,
wide-screen color televisions and decor handled by a vendor specially
provided by the PGA of America.</TE>
<TE>   There are 19 chalets in the Jacklin Village (Tony Jacklin won the
1970 U.S. Open at Hazeltine) to the left of the seventh hole, and 16
more at the Stewart Village (Payne Stewart won the 1991 Open here) to
the right of the 18th fairway. Each chalet costs between $135,000 and
$150,000 and can accommodate 100 people who love good air
conditioning as much as they love good golf.</TE>
<TE>   A record 160 companies, about three-fourths of them from
Minnesota, have reserved space in the chalets, each of which measures
1,600 square feet and has a 450-square-foot patio.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the corporate village.</TE>
<TE>   "Our aim is to continue to listen to what our clients enjoy and to
act accordingly," said Kerry Haigh, the PGA of America's senior
director of tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "The corporate sponsors, they're bringing their best customers,
and we want to give them the best experience," said Jim Awtrey, chief
executive officer of the PGA of America.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Phil Mickelson and Sergio Garcia are all
here to try to win the 84th PGA Championship, the fourth and final
major of the year, which starts Thursday. But until they start piling
up their birdies on the golf course, there is another compelling
story being told off it.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a tendency to damn the PGA Championship with faint
praise, for its status as a seemingly lesser major played on inferior
courses with poor fields. But that's starting to look like a
misguided notion.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Hazeltine a major league layout--as are Atlanta
Athletic Club and Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester, N.Y., the sites
last year and next year--but barring a late withdrawal, the PGA
Championship will be the first tournament in history to have all of
the top 100 players in the world rankings.</TE>
<TE>   Several steps have been taken to boost the standing of the PGA
Championship. The first major to offer a $5 million purse was the
2000 PGA Championship at Valhalla in Louisville. To answer criticism
that fields were diluted, the PGA of America cut the number of club
pros from 40 to 25. The host courses, which included duds such as PGA
National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., and Oak Tree in Edmond, Okla.,
now routinely include prestigious venues such as Baltusrol in
Springfield, N.J., in 2005, Medinah in Chicago in 2006, and Oakland
Hills in Birmingham, Mich., in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the PGA of America perfected the art of the
corporate massage.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by the tented villages first seen in majors at the
British Open, the PGA of America got on board in 1990 and has been
beefing up its corporate stance since. The full-blown "chalet"
experience began at the 1995 PGA Championship at Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to make sure we had more control over our own assets,"
Haigh said.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, both the USGA at the U.S. Open and the PGA of America
contracted with the host club, which ran the events.</TE>
<TE>   Hazeltine's 35 corporate chalets are not a record--there were 41
last year at Atlanta Athletic Club--but there is much money to be
made in this golf business, even beyond the $10 million profit the
chalets are expected to yield.</TE>
<TE>   There are the 8,000 customers who have bought weeklong passes for
$350 to the exclusive Wanamaker Club, which amounts to another $2.8
million in revenue--and that doesn't include whatever is spent on
food and beverages.</TE>
<TE>   Last year at Atlanta Athletic Club, the concession workers sold
181,446 cups of beer, 16,800 pounds of turkey breast, 8,200 pounds of
salmon, 37,500 pounds of hamburgers and 85,000 pounds of hot dogs.</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted that there were also 500 portable toilets.</TE>
<TE>   Ticket sales have topped out at 40,000 for the week, at $250
apiece, for another $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Television rights on CBS are worth about $12 million to the PGA of
America.</TE>
<TE>   At the Ryder Cup in 1999, the last time the PGA of America hosted
the event, the organization reportedly netted $17 million, the
biggest profit in the history of golf.</TE>
<TE>   These are big league numbers, but the most significant step the
PGA of America took in elevating its showcase tournament into a major
major happened 44 years ago, in 1958, when the tournament abandoned
match play for stroke play.</TE>
<TE>   From 1916 through 1957, the PGA Championship followed a match-play
format that was basically a 36-hole qualifying round followed by five
rounds of match play. Even though the game's greatest players--Walter
Hagen, Gene Sarazen, Tommy Armour, Henry Picard, Byron Nelson, Ben
Hogan and Sam Snead--became PGA champions in the match-play format,
television dictated a switch to stroke play to give the biggest stars
better chances of making it to the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "They made the change for television," said Nelson, who won in
1940 and 1945 and was runner-up in 1939, 1941 and 1944. "The way
things were going, it was both the right decision and the only
decision they could make."</TE>
<TE>   Lanny Wadkins, the 1977 PGA champion, said most players enjoy
match play and would like to have more events in that format, but
agrees that the switch made all the difference for the PGA
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   "As TV became bigger, more and more stroke play just works
better," he said. "Just the whole deal of match play, because it was
such a grind, a grueling test. A lot of us played six or seven rounds
of match play in tournaments when we were amateurs, but we were a
hell of a lot younger then."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcaster Jim Nantz of CBS said the PGA Championship really
entered the big time when John Daly got into the field as an
alternate and won the 1991 event at Crooked Stick in Carmel, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   "He caught lightning in a bottle," Nantz said.</TE>
<TE>   While the world's best golfers try to do the same this week, the
16 Stewart Village chalets and 19 Jacklin Village chalets and the
sparkling Wanamaker Club will cast their giant shadows over the
proceedings, electronic cash registers beeping in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Awtrey, who became chief executive officer in 1988, said the PGA
Championship isn't all about making money--although that's a nice
part--nor is it about saving par. The PGA of America doesn't mind
players shooting low scores, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't set up a policy to protect par," Awtrey said. "There is
an organization that does that.</TE>
<TE>   "We let players decide history. We don't want the golf course
set-up to decide. We don't want to remove par fives or make some
holes borderline unfair. We don't do that."</TE>
<TE>   It's an interesting approach. Along with Tiger's swing and Phil's
quest for a major and Sergio's waggles, it might even be another hot
topic for discussion at the Wanamaker Club or in the chalets ...
between bites of roast beef, shrimp cocktail and smoked turkey
breast, of course. Bon appetit! And fore!</TE>

<HD>Chivas Can't Deny Club America</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico national team goalkeeper Oswaldo Sanchez played one of the
games of his life Sunday, making a series of spectacular saves, but
he was unable to prevent defending Mexican league champion Club
America of Mexico City from defeating Chivas of Guadalajara, 1-0, at
a packed Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez's most stunning save came when he threw himself to his
right and batted away a penalty kick by Club America's Chilean
striker, Ivan "Bam Bam" Zamorano, in the 24th minute.</LD>
<LD>   World Cup referee Felipe Ramos Rizo awarded the controversial kick
when Cuauhtemoc Blanco fired a shot that struck a defender on the arm
as he lunged to tackle Blanco. Chivas protested the call in vain, but
Sanchez defused the situation with his save.</LD>
<TE>   He also denied Christian Patino when the forward broke through
one-on-one, diving at his feet and snatching the ball away and made
several other exceptional saves against Blanco and Patino. Other
shots flew barely high or wide.</TE>
<TE>   With a 0-0 tie looking inevitable, Club America Coach Mario
Carrillo sent forward Marcelo Lipatin into the game in place of
Zamorano in the 82nd minute. Within seconds, Lipatin scored, taking a
through pass that eluded the error-prone Chivas defense and using the
outside of his left foot to chip the ball over the on-rushing Sanchez
and into the open net.</TE>
<TE>   Ramon Ramirez was Guadalajara's lone scoring threat, with Ramon
Morales and Omar Bravo looking dangerous occasionally, but Club
America's season-opening victory was well deserved.</TE>
<TE>   The game, regarded as the classic in Mexican soccer, was the 168th
between the teams, with Club America holding the all-time edge,
63-56-49.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Guadalajara club is the target of an audacious bid
by Mexican businessman Jorge Vergara Madrigal, who has offered to buy
the team for $80 million from its current 196 owners and build it a
state-of-the-art 100,000-seat stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Jalisco Stadium was site of historic World Cup games in 1970, when
England's Gordon Banks made what is regarded as the best save of all
time, against Pele, and in 1986, when France edged Brazil on penalty
kicks in a memorable quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   But Vergara has called the stadium "obsolete in every area" and
has said that he is "sure that by next May I'll be the owner of
Chivas."</TE>
<TE>   O'Brien Wins With Ajax</TE>
<TE>   United States World Cup midfielder John O'Brien, who won the Dutch
league championship and the Dutch Cup last season with Ajax
Amsterdam, Sunday completed a trio of titles when he helped Ajax
defeat PSV Eindhoven, 3-1, to win the Dutch SuperCup in front of
40,000 at Amsterdam.</TE>
<TE>   The game marked the debut of PSV's new coach, Guus Hiddink, who
led South Korea to fourth place in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Silva Leads Arsenal</TE>
<TE>   Gilberto Silva, who won the World Cup with Brazil in June before
joining defending English league champion and F.A. Cup winner Arsenal
from Atletico Mineiro two weeks ago, Sunday earned his new team its
first honor of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Silva's 69th-minute goal gave Arsenal a 1-0 victory over Liverpool
in front of 67,337 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales, in
the Community Shield, the traditional curtain-raiser for the English
season, which begins Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The match pitted Arsenal's Senegalese-born captain, Patrick
Vieira, against Liverpool's new Senegalese acquisition, striker El
Hadji Diouf, for the first time since the World Cup opening game, in
which Diouf's Senegal upset Vieira's France, 1-0, in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   Vieira brought Diouf crashing to the turf three minutes after
Silva's goal, but no penalty was called by referee Alan Wiley,
angering Liverpool's Michael Owen, a standout for England's World Cup
team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a penalty," Owen said. "Just because he [Diouf] made a
meal of it, doesn't mean it wasn't a foul."</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal was the better team, however, and might have won by a
larger margin but for several spectacular saves by Liverpool's Poland
national team goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal Coach Arsene Wenger called Silva "a bright, intelligent
boy" who "was maybe a little surprised by the physical side of the
fight" but said he would quickly adapt to the more rugged English
style.</TE>
<TE>   Wenger revealed Saturday that he had been offered the chance to
take over as coach of former world champion France but had declined.</TE>
<TE>   "I never considered taking the job," he said. "I want to be
successful again this season because I have worked hard to put this
team together."</TE>
<TE>   Ferdinand Injured</TE>
<TE>   Rio Ferdinand, the world's most expensive defender who joined
Manchester United on July 21 in a $47-million transfer deal, will
miss the team's first European Champions League qualifying match on
Wednesday and the start of the English Premier League season on
Saturday after spraining an ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The injury occurred in Manchester on Saturday during United's 2-0
victory over Boca Juniors of Argentina in a benefit game for UNICEF,
the United Nations' children's fund. Dutch striker Ruud van
Nistelrooy scored both goals in the match, which turned ugly in the
second half and saw Boca's Carlos Tevez ejected.</TE>
<TE>   China on the Rise</TE>
<TE>   China might not have had the best of World Cup debuts, losing all
three of its games, but 21-year-old Chinese striker Qu Bo did enough
during a two-week trial with Tottenham Hotspur to earn a roster spot
with the club.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Glenn Hoddle Sunday acquired the forward from his Chinese
club, Quingdo Yizhong, for $3 million, subject to Qu getting a work
permit to play in the English Premier League. Spurs also is chasing
Spanish striker Fernando Morientes, but Real Madrid wants nearly $30
million for him.</TE>
<TE>   Also joining new clubs were free agents Valery Karpin, the Russian
national team midfielder who returned to his former Spanish team,
Real Sociedad, and Australia national team captain Paul Okon, who
joined Leeds United in England.</TE>
<TE>   Ivory Coast national team defender Cyril Domoraud was sent on a
one-year loan from AC Milan in Italy to Espanyol in Spain.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mwadi Mabika had 16 points as the Sparks defeated the Minnesota Lynx,
69-58, Sunday in front of 11,822 at Minneapolis.</LD>
<LD>   The Sparks (24-7), who have won two in a row after an emotional
home loss to the Houston Comets, can clinch home-court advantage
throughout the WNBA playoffs if they win their regular-season finale
at Phoenix on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Against the Lnyx, the Sparks went on a 23-4 run late in the second
half.</LD>
<TE>   "Defense was the key to everything," Spark Coach Michael Cooper
said. "We threw a few different looks at them and were able to play
good [defense] while putting up a few points."</TE>
<TE>   Katie Smith and Georgia Schweitzer each had 13 points for
Minnesota (10-21), which clinched the worst record in its four-year
history.</TE>
<TE>   Leading by two at halftime, the Sparks scored nine points in a row
to start the second half. Lisa Leslie keyed the run with six points
and finished with 13.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected them to have three or four runs, but once they caught
back up, we took it up a notch," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota answered with five three-point baskets and took a 47-46
lead with nine minutes left, before the Sparks' run put the game
away.</TE>
<TE>   "Anytime we tried to make a move, they had an answer," Schweitzer
said. "They went to a zone defense a few times and changed the way
they were guarding Katie and that really affected how smoothly our
offense ran."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks got a team-best six rebounds from Nikki Teasley, and
Tamika Williams had six rebounds for Minnesota.</TE>

<TE>   In other games:</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 74, Utah 57--Lauren Jackson matched her career high with
27 points as the Storm clinched their first-ever playoff berth with a
victory in front of 11,448 at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   The Storm (17-14), the fourth-seeded team in the Western
Conference, will play either the Sparks or Houston in the first round
of the playoffs. Seattle was 2-1 against the Sparks this season and
0-3 against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Amanda Lassiter, acquired by the Storm earlier this season from
Houston, scored a season-high 14 points. Adia Barnes and Kamila
Vodichkova each had 11 points. Sue Bird was held scoreless, but
dished out eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Azzi and Marie Ferdinand led the Starzz (19-12) with 10
points each.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix 73, Portland 70--Gordana Grubin scored 17 points and
Susanna Bonfiglio had 10 as the Mercury ended a league-record 21-game
road losing streak in front of 10,548 at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The Mercury's last road win was July 27, 2001 at Seattle. Phoenix
(11-20) avoided becoming the first team in league history to go 0-16
on the road.</TE>
<TE>   DeMya Walker led the Fire with 10 points. Portland was eliminated
from the playoff race when Seattle defeated Utah. The Fire (16-16)
finished with the best record in its three-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Orlando 71, Detroit 58--Nykesha Sales scored 19 points to help the
Miracle (15-16) keep its playoff hopes alive with a victory over the
Shock (9-22) in front of 7,286 at Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Sales scored six consecutive points early in the second half,
highlighting an 11-0 run and giving Orlando a 41-36 lead with about
16 minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   To make the playoffs, Orlando needs to win its regular-season
finale Tuesday at home against New York and Indiana has to lose its
last game.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 60, Cleveland 54--Chamique Holdsclaw had 18 points and
17 rebounds in front of 11,042 at Cleveland to lead the Mystics
(17-14) to only their second victory in 10 games.</TE>

have home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana 77, Miami 63--Tamika Catchings scored 20 points in front
of 15,488 at Indianapolis as the Fever moved within one victory of
its first-ever playoff berth.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana (15-16) will make the playoffs for the first time in its
three-year history if it wins at Cleveland on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sheri Sam scored 20 points for the Sol (14-17).</TE>

<HD>Rubin Writes Surprise Ending to Comeback</HD>
<DH>Tennis: She upsets No. 3 Davenport in final featuring two
players coming off surgery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was there before Martina Hingis, Venus and Serena Williams and
found herself in the same age group as Grand Slam winners Jennifer
Capriati, Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport.</LD>
<LD>   It may seem a distant memory, but Chanda Rubin was once considered
the logical successor to Zina Garrison as the next great African
American star.</LD>
<LD>   Her story certainly isn't as drama-filled as Capriati's trip
through the wilderness years; nor is she as recognized by one name,
like Serena or Venus.</LD>
<TE>   The Rubin story is too tame for something like a "Behind the
Music" saga on VH1. But what happened along the way is nothing short
of inspirational. To record her setbacks, surgeries and broken body
parts, tour officials put out a long list of her injuries before
Sunday's final at the JPMorgan Chase Open.</TE>
<TE>   The final at Manhattan Beach was jokingly called the battle of
wounded knee, as No. 12-seeded Rubin defeated fellow surgery
survivor, No. 3 Davenport, 5-7, 7-6 (5), 6-3, in 2 hours 19 minutes,
rallying from a 4-5 second-set deficit before a crowd of 4,819.</TE>
<TE>   This may have been Rubin's second championship in 2002, but it was
a career highlight for the 26-year-old who had knee surgery in Vail,
Colo., days after Davenport in January. In the span of three days
last week, she eliminated players who have won a combined six Grand
Slam singles titles, beating Serena Williams and Davenport.</TE>
<TE>   Williams is the No. 1-ranked player in the world, and Davenport is
actually No. 1 too, with a footnote. The WTA gave her a special
ranking of No. 1 because she was ranked that when she suffered a knee
injury in November.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin wasn't buying that oddity, though.</TE>
<TE>   "I really didn't think she was No. 1," she said of Davenport. "Can
you have two No. 1s? There's only No. 1. That's why it's No. 1."</TE>
<TE>   She laughed.</TE>
<TE>   The numbers usually don't lie. So Rubin was brutally honest when
she was asked how she was feeling when Davenport served for the title
in the second set, leading 5-4, at the Manhattan Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought my chances were pretty dismal," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   After all, she had lost to Davenport six consecutive times before
Sunday, a streak dating to 1996. This time Davenport came within two
points of adding a title to her comeback story. Suddenly, Davenport
unraveled, double-faulting, hitting a backhand wide and a backhand
long to fall back into a 5-5 tie in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   From afar, it might have looked unusual, but Davenport had
struggled to close out victories in three other matches while Rubin
had unveiled a fighting spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, Rubin came back from a 1-4 third-set deficit to upset
reigning French Open and Wimbledon champion Serena Williams in the
quarterfinals, ending Williams' 21-match winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, after Rubin got by the 10th game, the players stayed on
serve, with Davenport saving two set points, to reach the tiebreaker.
Rubin took the tiebreaker's first four points, and held on, winning
on her fourth set point when Davenport netted a forehand return.</TE>
<TE>   The defending champion, Davenport, playing in her third tournament
since her knee surgery, lamented her lost opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this could be the third time here losing in the finals
serving for the match," she said. "I was thinking about that before.
I think I served for it against Serena once and maybe even Monica one
year and lost them both."</TE>
<TE>   The final, while high in drama, had its ups and downs. The players
combined for 132 unforced errors and 13 service breaks. Rubin had
eight aces, and 10 double faults. Davenport had 12 aces and 11 double
faults.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport struggled with her serve throughout the tournament. "I'm
a little bit disgusted, I don't want to say I am, but I really am,"
she said. "A lot of my game revolves around my serve, and I had
absolutely zero rhythm. I just didn't hit the big serves when I
needed to or felt confident I could."</TE>
<TE>   The third set also was a roller-coaster ride. Davenport's movement
appeared to slow in the heat, and Rubin took a 3-1 lead. They
exchanged service breaks, again, before Rubin held to go up 5-3. With
Davenport serving, at 3-5, 15-40, Rubin reached her first match point
and was frustrated when a Davenport overhead was called good.
Davenport erased another match point but lost it on the third,
hitting a forehand long.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin was asked if she was grinning about the bad call.</TE>
<TE>   "Was I grinning? That was probably a grimace," she said. "I don't
think I was happy at that point. There's not much you can do. It was
a close call and everything is tense."</TE>
<TE>   The long months of rehabilitation have made her stronger,
especially since she had been through knee surgery twice in two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "I think so. It's not something I wanted to go through, and I
would have loved to have been perfect with my first surgery," said
Rubin, who also had a serious hand injury that required surgery in
1996. "It wasn't meant to be. I used it to motivate me more. I feel
like I've worked. I've worked overtime twice to get myself back into
shape and be fit. I deserve that chance. I worked for it, and I
deserve to win these matches."</TE>
<TE>   She is confident without being overly so, believing she can break
into the top five.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin was ranked as high as No. 6 but that was in 1996, which
might as well be a different era, considering neither Williams sister
played then.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Rubin will savor her success before the U.S. Open, having
won 21 of her last 25 matches and two titles. She returned to the

<HD>USA Network Has Open Agreement</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Cable service and USTA agree to six-year extension
of domestic TV rights for year's final Grand Slam event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Tennis Assn. and USA network today will announce a six-year
extension of the cable programmer's domestic rights for the U.S.
Open. The deal will start in 2003 and is believed to be worth
slightly more than $125 million, according to industry sources.</LD>
<LD>   The money represents about a 40% increase over the previous deal.
It also is expected that, as part of the new contract, USA will air a
handful of North American hard-court events leading up to the Open. A
commitment is in place for at least three tournaments, possibly more,
sources said, though specific events have not been selected.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is in line with the USTA's effort to streamline
television coverage and build a marketing campaign around the lead-up
to the Open.</LD>
<TE>   The patchwork nature of the sport's broadcast schedule--it is
televised by numerous outlets, cable, network and local, during the
course of the year--can be confusing for even avid fans.</TE>
<TE>   "The real goal is to create something that is comprehensible to
more fans in a sense that you have a series of events building up to
the U.S. Open," said Gordon Beck, senior vice president of sports and
production at USA.</TE>
<TE>   USTA officials view this as another piece in a larger puzzle--to
elevate the sport, using the Open as a centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   "Pro tennis has always been accused of having a fractured TV
schedule throughout the summer and through the year," said Arlen
Kantarian, the USTA's chief executive of professional tennis.
"Hopefully, this will set the stage for a more cohesive summer
package. What we've got is a firm commitment from USA to televise
x-number of summer tennis events that lead into the U.S. Open.</TE>
<TE>   "Ratings last year were up 35-36% versus the prior year on USA.
The [Andre] Agassi-[Pete] Sampras match was the highest-rated cable
television match ever. There's tremendous momentum for the Open.
They've seen the gain. They've added a lot. They've been in a
position to telecast tennis in a more entertaining way.</TE>
<TE>   "In a difficult television market, the top three, four, five major
sporting events of the year do tend to have more resiliency than
others."</TE>
<TE>   As in previous years at the Open, USA will have live weekday and
weeknight coverage and weekend night coverage on Labor Day weekend.
CBS provides the coverage on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   In all, USA will offer about 92 hours of live coverage at the Open
each year of the new deal.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Ready to Come of Age</HD>
<DH>College football: Enthusiasm over senior leadership and
experience will be tested by challenging schedule.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As they prepared for the start of training camp today, USC football
players on Sunday pointed to senior leadership as a key to improving
the Trojans' national profile and bettering last season's 6-6 finish.</LD>
<LD>   USC, ranked 19th in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll and 20th in
the Associated Press media poll, will spend the next three weeks
preparing for its Labor Day opener against Auburn at the Coliseum.
The Trojans will don full pads for the first time Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   All-American safety Troy Polamalu cited the growth and collective
experience of quarterback Carson Palmer, receiver Kareem Kelly and
running back Sultan McCullough--all fellow seniors--as a reason for
optimism.</LD>
<TE>   "We all know how to be successful," Polamalu said. "All we need to
do now is bring it all together</TE>
<TE>   where we can make our whole team successful. Having</TE>
<TE>   that leadership is a big advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Experience alone won't be enough to overcome a schedule regarded
as one of the most challenging in the nation. After playing Auburn,
the Trojans travel to Colorado and Kansas State before opening their
Pacific 10 Conference schedule against Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   Several players said last season's performance, including a 10-6
loss to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl, could work to the Trojans'
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the right to be cocky," sophomore defensive lineman
Shaun Cody said. "Last year we had a suspect year.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think we're going to surprise a lot of people. They aren't
going to see us coming and I think that's where we're going to sneak
up on people."</TE>
<TE>   Familiarity with second-year Coach Pete Carroll also should aid
the Trojans, who have not had a winning season since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "He expects nothing less than the Rose Bowl from us," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The main competition during training camp will probably come at
running back and cornerback.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors McCullough, Justin Fargas and Malaefou MacKenzie are vying
to become the Trojans' workhorse in the backfield. Last season, USC
averaged a conference-worst 87.7 yards a game.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, who gained 1,163 yards as a sophomore, rushed for 410
yards in the first six games in 2001 but missed the rest of the
season because of a strained abdominal muscle. Fargas transferred to
USC after three seasons at Michigan, redshirted last season and was
impressive in spring drills. The NCAA granted MacKenzie a rare sixth
year of eligibility after injuries and the death of his father wiped
out his 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned about the competition between us," Fargas said.
"We're trying to get better as a group. As long as we push each
other, we're all going to help with our main focus--winning."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Junior Marcell Allmond, attempting to make the switch from
receiver to quarterback, is nursing a calf injury suffered during a
workout. Allmond also is having soreness after being struck by a car
last week, Carroll said.... Sophomore offensive lineman Joe McGuire
will miss the season while recovering from shoulder surgery.
Sophomore defensive lineman A.J. Single will undergo shoulder surgery
this week and will miss the season.... Two highly regarded recruits
from Long Beach Poly High, safety Darnell Bing and defensive tackle
Manuel Wright, did not qualify for admission to USC.... Junior Sandy
Fletcher has switched positions, moving from wide receiver to
safety.... Defensive end Austin Jackson and cornerback Justin
Tolliver left the team during the off-season.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Second-seeded Prakash Amritraj of Encino defeated No. 8-seeded Doug
Stewart of Malibu, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4, to win the singles
championship match of the U.S. Tennis Assn. Boys' 18 Super National
Hard Court Championships on Sunday in Kalamazoo, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   The match featured two Southern California players for the first
time since Kevin Kim of Fullerton defeated Bob Bryan of Camarillo in
1996.</LD>
<LD>   Amritraj, a serve-and-volley player, turned the match in his favor
when he began approaching the net more after Stewart, a baseliner,
pinned him in the backcourt throughout the first set.</LD>
<TE>   With the victory, Amritraj earned a wild-card entry into the
upcoming U.S. Open in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't ask for anything more," Amritraj said. "This is a great
way to end your junior career, but the best thing about it is the
chance to play with the big boys."</TE>
<TE>   Amritraj, 18, said he plans to test the professional Challenger
and Futures circuits rather than return to USC for the fall semester,
but may still play for the Trojans next spring.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth-seeded Robert Yim of Glendale defeated top-seeded Brian
Baker of Nashville, 7-6 (5), 3-6, 6-4, to take the boys' 18
third-place playoff.</TE>
<TE>   In the final of the USTA Girls' 14 Super National Hard Court
Championships in College Park, Ga., second-seeded Krysty Marcio of
Palm Coast, Fla., defeated ninth-seeded Sarah Fansler of Laguna
Niguel, 6-3, 6-3.</TE>
