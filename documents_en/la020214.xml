<HD>U.S. Shouldn't Indulge China's Taiwan Fantasy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL C. LYNCH</AU>
<BD>Daniel C. Lynch is an assistant professor at the School
of International Relations at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just in time for President Bush's trip to China next week, Beijing
unveiled a new Taiwan policy. The Bush administration should remain
levelheaded and resist the temptation to reduce diplomatic and
military support for Taiwan in exchange for improved Sino-American
relations.</LD>
<LD>   This latest policy still insists that Taiwan is a part of China
and eventually must be annexed, using roughly the formula that was
applied to Hong Kong and Macao. But now Chinese leaders express a
conviction that increasing economic integration will bring about a
kind of "natural unification." To hasten the process, they may soon
remove lingering obstacles to direct transportation links and even
invite formerly shunned members of Taiwan's ruling Democratic
Progressive Party to visit.</LD>
<LD>   The new policy is certainly an improvement over the previous
vicious name-calling and saber-rattling. Its tenets sound reasonable.
But in fact the concept of natural unification is a self-serving
delusion bound to disappoint those in Beijing who see reunification
on the horizon.</LD>
<TE>   The new policy sounds reasonable because cross-strait economic
integration is unquestionably taking place. Since 1988, about 40,000
Taiwanese firms have invested more than $50billion in China. Several
hundred thousand Taiwanese citizens now live at least part of the
year in Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou, where they run
their own schools, stores, restaurants and factories. Meanwhile,
young Taiwanese back home look increasingly to China as a new
economic frontier.</TE>
<TE>   But these developments don't herald a natural political
unification. The collective identities of the Taiwanese and Chinese
people remain too distinct. Contrary to popular myth, Taiwan never
really has been a part of China. True, it was an outpost of the Qing
Dynasty from 1684 to 1895, after which it became a colony of Japan
until 1945. But the Qing Dynasty wasn't the same political or
cultural entity as China.</TE>
<TE>   The country that today we call China came into being in the 20th
century. Its construction was marked by violent civil war and foreign
invasion, unspeakable exploitation and cultural revolution. Taiwan
was shielded from this chaos under Japanese occupation and later
gradually became prosperous.</TE>
<TE>   Collective identities don't change overnight. It is highly
unlikely that economic integration will convince the Taiwanese people
that they're Chinese. Their historical experiences are too different
from those of people in China. In fact, since economic integration
began in 1988, Taiwan's sense of its distinctiveness has increased.
It is more like a process of natural separation.</TE>
<TE>   Sooner or later, Beijing will be disappointed in the natural
unification doctrine. When that day of reckoning arrives, it's
essential that the option of attacking Taiwan militarily to achieve
unnatural unification is denied by U.S. resolve.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush should certainly use the upcoming summit to try to
improve Sino-American relations, but not at the cost of recklessly
embracing self-serving Chinese fantasies about Taiwan.</TE>

<HD>Parks Proved His Leadership</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK RIDLEY-THOMAS</AU>
<BD>Mark Ridley-Thomas, who represents the 8th District on
the Los Angeles City Council, is a former vice chairman of the
Council's Ad Hoc Committee on Police Reform.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the tenure of Police Chief Bernard Parks, I have been neither
his most staunch supporter nor his harshest critic. We have agreed on
some matters and we have disagreed on others, but on balance I
believe he has what it takes to continue the now thankless job of
transforming the Los Angeles Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   My working relationship with the chief is defined by the issues we
both deem top priorities: improving public safety and enhancing the
quality of life for Angelenos. To be sure, we have debated some of
the ways to realize those changes, but the discussion has been
constructive, candid and one hopes beneficial to the community.</LD>
<LD>   During his first term as chief, Parks has been accessible to the
entire city. He supports the efforts to improve public safety through
neighborhood walks for nonviolence and against violent crime,
citywide community town hall gatherings and meetings with civic,
religious and business leaders to ensure that crime fighting and
prevention remain our priorities.</LD>
<TE>   Parks has confronted the issues of objectionable police tactics
and street crime head-on and that has made a significant impact on
how many residents throughout the city view the Police Department. I
now hear more testimonials from my constituents that they are less
likely to be harassed by officers.</TE>
<TE>   The culture of discriminatory policing does not change quickly.
Parks not only has laid the groundwork but has aggressively pushed to
achieve a zero-tolerance policy in this area. For this, he is damned
as inflexible by some and heralded as resolute by others.</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, two of Parks' most important qualities have been
devalued or forgotten in this highly politicized environment of
chief-bashing. We must be reminded that his work ethic is unmatched
and his competence unparalleled. You can't kick a 37-year veteran to
the curb.</TE>
<TE>   Many educators, health professionals and religious leaders believe
that a critical value in public safety should be a commitment to
crime prevention and crime intervention. But too often these concepts
are left out of typical one-dimensional approaches. Parks has
championed prevention efforts, such as the LA Bridges gang
prevention/intervention program and the LA's BEST after-school
program. If one accepts the FBI projections that crime will increase
in the near future, then we must invest in such programs, not just
crime suppression.</TE>
<TE>   Without a doubt, Parks is a proven leader whose efforts to improve
public safety have at the very least been hampered by the overbearing
campaign by the Los Angeles Police Protective League to drive him out
of office. The league's ugly attacks on the chief only serve to
undermine the very officers it claims to represent.</TE>
<TE>   According to recent reports, many LAPD officers have indicated
that they would prefer being represented by another union. But even
in the face of the league's hypocritical evaluation, Parks has
continued to push forward to create a new and improved LAPD. Sadly,
he has had to do this without the assistance of the Police Protective
League.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing systemic problems in the LAPD does not happen
overnight. Change may not be popular when it means being held
accountable for one's actions. It must be worked toward consistently
and over the long term. Parks has taken the difficult stance of
remaining true to providing leadership for that change. He is to be
commended for not attempting to win a popularity contest with the
unbridled police union, the entity that historically has resented
reform.</TE>
<TE>   We have to place a premium on the progress we need to make in
public safety over the next five years, and a hard-working, capable
and well-regarded leader can help further those goals. None of us
should underestimate the need for continuity in leadership. That is
why terminating Chief Parks' service to the city of Los Angeles is
not only preemptive and untimely, it is unwise and may ultimately set
back public safety and police accountability.</TE>

<HD>Did Justice Move to Wonderland?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN TURLEY</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Turley teaches constitutional law at George
Washington University in Washington, D.C.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Alice in Wonderland," the Queen of Hearts dispensed justice with
an even hand. For all accused, she insisted on "sentence first,
verdict afterward." The queen was keen on the ends of justice and saw
the means as a tiring inconvenience. Increasingly, the U.S. Justice
Department seems to be taking a lead from the jurisprudence of the
Red Queen and, if the case of Lotfi Raissi is any indication, it is
rivaling Lewis Carroll in its ability to spin a tale.</LD>
<LD>   This week, Raissi was released by a British court after five
months of incarceration during which the U.S. Justice Department
sought his extradition. The U.S. government now stands accused of
misleading the court and withholding exculpatory evidence. In the
ultimate reversal of fortunes, the man once identified as the
"mastermind" of terrorists has emerged as a sympathetic character.</LD>
<LD>   Raissi was accused of training Hani Hanjour, who is believed to
have piloted the airplane into the Pentagon. Extradition should have
been a perfunctory matter given the clarity of his alleged
involvement and the accommodating stance of English courts.</LD>
<TE>   In its appearances before British Judge Timothy Workman, the U.S.
government assured the court that there was a "web of circumstantial
evidence" revealing Raissi as a co-conspirator and an Al Qaeda
operative. Workman held six hearings to try to induce the U.S.
government to support its claims with this evidence. Finally, the
U.S. admitted that it had no such evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, there was good reason to suspect Raissi, who attended
the same flight training school with one of the Sept. 11 trainers.
However, with time, the government appeared unwilling to reconsider
the evidence, particularly after it publicly identified him as a key
figure in the conspiracy behind that day's tragic events.</TE>
<TE>   It now appears that the FBI had found no credible evidence to
confirm the claims made before Workman. In the initial hearings, for
example, the government claimed to have a videotape of Raissi with
one of the hijackers and extensive telephone records of calls to the
hijackers. It was later revealed that the videotape was actually
Raissi and his cousin at Raissi's apartment and the government
mysteriously dropped the claim that it had incriminating telephone
records.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, Raissi's lawyer produced an affidavit from an FBI
agent stating that the FBI had determined that there is "no evidence
to suggest that Raissi and Hanjour had ever trained together." A
pilot who allegedly flew on a particular day with the two men denied
that Hanjour was on the flight with Raissi. Logs indicate that
Hanjour flew on a different day than Raissi.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Raissi's family denied any connection to terrorism and
submitted evidence of a long anti-terrorism stance of the family. His
wife insisted that if Raissi were an Islamic fanatic, she probably
would have noticed since she is a cabaret dancer and a Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. government, however, did not go quietly into the night.
It is now seeking Raissi's extradition based on the fact that he
failed to mention that he had a bad knee (from a tennis injury) to
the Federal Aviation Administration and failed to disclose an earlier
conviction for petty theft in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Again, the U.S. government has been accused of misleading the
court. It appears that Raissi had disclosed his knee injury to the
FAA doctor in a prior examination and that FAA rules apparently do
not require disclosure of a petty theft conviction in Britain.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft publicly has admitted to casting a broad
net in gathering suspects and witnesses. This strategy is defended as
increasing the chances that an actual terrorist might be immobilized.
Justice, however, demands more than the law of averages. Unlike
dropping a 500-pound bomb on a gathering of Afghans in the hope of
nailing a few terrorists, justice does not allow us the luxury to
prosecute them all and let God sort them out.</TE>
<TE>   In its misleading statements and its failure to correct the
record, the government fulfilled the stereotype of a vengeful nation
unhinged from its most fundamental legal principles. A nation of laws
is defined not by the ends of justice but by the means used to secure
it. This is why our conduct in Britain deserves investigation to
determine if the world's greatest democracy returned to the courts of
our ancestors and adopted practices that would make the Red Queen
blush.</TE>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few creatures are more detestable, more verminous, than the special
interest bureaucrat. He is the banal quintessence of evil. With his
sniff of sedentary power, he is that most craven of all schlumps,
always and everywhere just following orders, mindless and industrious
as a louse, implacable as a meter maid. When challenged on his fierce
illogic, he merely parrots the shopworn slogan, "I just work here."</LD>
<LD>   Today in America, such flacks are almost exclusively the property
of the complainant left, which has homogenized and mass-produced
them, wound them up and marched them, like Energizer bunnies, into
the loop of public discourse.</LD>
<LD>   Special interest lobbies such as the National Organization for
Women, the Feminist Majority Foundation and the Gay and Lesbian
Alliance Against Defamation are home to battalions of these fanged
pink fuzzies.</LD>
<TE>   In her recent book, "The New Thought Police: Inside the Left's
Assault on Free Speech and Free Minds," Tammy Bruce fingers these
groups and others such as the National Assn. for the Advancement of
Colored People, exposing them as bureaus of intimidation bent on
silencing anyone who deviates from the party line, bastions of
hypocrisy where principle has become a casualty of power politics.
That this argument comes from a lesbian former president of L.A.'s
chapter of NOW makes Bruce's book an inside job--wickedly satisfying
and full of priceless opinions such as this one about NOW's
unwillingness to condemn O.J. Simpson and specious quibbling over
President Clinton:</TE>
<TE>   "NOW is able to overlook wife-beating ... in the case of someone
who's a role model for young black men and the sexual exploitation of
subordinates in the case of someone who can help the organization
politically and financially."</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Bruce's recounting of GLAAD's campaign against
conservative radio shock jock Dr. Laura Schlessinger. GLAAD put the
kibosh on Schlessinger's short-lived television show by intimidating
its advertisers into rescinding their sponsorship. And, as if Bruce
weren't already taking on the whole circus, she rightly slams Julian
Bond of the NAACP, who accused President Bush of choosing nominees
from the "Taliban wing of American politics."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from her spot-on assertion that left-wing McCarthyism and
Nixonian scare tactics are standard fare among advocates of the
so-called disenfranchised, what's interesting about Bruce's book is
the lack of attention it's getting in the liberal-leaning mainstream
press, which goes a long way toward affirming the thesis of Bernard
Goldberg's new book, "Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media
Distort the News."</TE>
<TE>   As Bruce told me: "When I was with NOW, I could get an interview
on anything anywhere. With the media's complicity, I knew I could
move any issue and make it work. Now they don't even return my phone
calls. I've found out what it's like trying to get your message out
when you're on the 'wrong' side of an issue."</TE>
<TE>   According to Bruce's publicist, aside from her appearance on ABC's
"Politically Incorrect," no major liberal media outlet, either print
or broadcast, has discussed or reviewed Bruce's book. Meanwhile,
conservative venues such as the National Review, the Washington Times
and Fox News have given it the attention that its controversial
subject matter and considerable sales (40,000 copies since its
publication in October) deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Are the illiberal apparatchiks having their way again, dispensing
their chits of pillory and slander? You can bet on it. After all, you
don't have to shoot the messenger if you can make her
disappear--which, of course, just proves Bruce's point.</TE>

<LD>Jennifer Lopez may still have trouble getting critics to take her
seriously as a pop singer, but she continues to come up with hits.
Her new "J to tha L-O!: The Remixes" entered the national album chart
at No. 1 on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The album, which sold 156,000 copies last week, offers revamped
versions of the songs from her previous album, "J.Lo," which entered
the chart at No. 1 last February, according to SoundScan.Lopez ended
Alan Jackson's three-week reign at No. 1. The country singer's
"Drive" finished second this week after selling 150,000 copies. That
brings the album's four-week total to 992,000.</LD>
<LD>   The only other debuts in the top 10 this week were by two pop
veterans. Barry Manilow's "Ultimate Manilow," a retrospective,
claimed the No. 3 spot by selling 113,000, while Sade's live album,
"Lovers Live," finished No. 10 with sales of 66,000.</LD>
<TE>   The remaining artists in the top 10, in order: Creed, Linkin Park,
Ludacris, Nickelback, Ja Rule and Pink.</TE>
<TE>   Presumably thanks to its Super Bowl halftime performance, U2's
"All That You Can't Leave Behind" jumped from No. 66 to No. 25. The
album has sold 3.4 million copies since its release in November 2000.
B2K's "Uh Huh" remains the No. 1 single.</TE>

<LD>5pm Festival</LD>
<LD>   It's time to party like it's 4699. L.A.'s Chinatown will welcome
in the Year of the Horse 4700 with a three-day celebration that has
something old--the 103rd annual Golden Dragon Parade--as well as
something new--Chinatown's first car show. Plus entertainment, games,
carnival rides, cultural booths, crafts and even the Laker Girls.
Mayor James K. Hahn will be the grand marshal of the parade scheduled
for 2 p.m. Saturday. (See story, Page 51.)</LD>
<LD>   Year of the Horse 4700 Chinese New Year Celebration, 727 N. Hill
St., between Alpine and Ord streets, 5 to 9 p.m. Friday; noon to 10

Ann Hampton Callaway, Maiden Voyage Big Band, Bill Cunliffe, Gerald
Wiggins, Anthony Wilson and many more of the Southland's best players
will converge in Orange County this weekend for the Newport Beach
Jazz Party. The music starts at 2 p.m. today and will be practically
nonstop from 10 a.m. until closing time on Saturday and Sunday.</TE>

<TE>   9pm Performance</TE>
<TE>   With her graphic and, er ... insistent invitations to, um ...
romance, the raunchy rapper known as Peaches could be an invention of
taste-testing film director John Waters. So it's somehow fitting that
the two provocateurs would team for a Valentine-time mixed bag, with
the Kurosawa of camp delivering his autobiographical monologue "Shock
Value," and Peaches laying down her industrial-strength come-ons.</TE>
<TE>   John Waters and Peaches, El Rey Theatre, 5515 Wilshire Blvd.,
L.A., 9 p.m. $28.50 and $35 ($75 ticket includes meet-and-greet with
Waters). (323) 936-4790.</TE>

<TE>   SnoCore, the winter sports/lifestyle/music caravan, is a

first the more mellow version, the SnoCore Icicle Ball, lays down its
grooves at the Wiltern Theatre Friday. Saxophonist Karl Denson and
his group Tiny Universe headline, joined by Michael Franti's
Spearhead, Blackalicious and Saul Williams.</TE>
<TE>   SnoCore Icicle Ball, Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., L.A.,

<TE>   8pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   In its "Black Choreographers Showcase, 2002," the Los Angeles
Cultural Affairs Department has assembled an array of talent that
ranges from 16-year-old Landry Barb to such established figures on
the local African American dance landscape as Winifred R. Harris.
Indeed, the only really conspicuous absentee on a list of 19 worthies
is Lula Washington, currently battling the city over its seizure of
land it had previously approved for her long-awaited community dance
center. Did the city sponsors deliberately ignore Washington when
planning this showcase or did she scorn their invitation? Inquiring
minds want to know....</TE>
<TE>   "Black Choreographers Showcase, 2002," Los Angeles Theatre Center,
514 S. Spring St., downtown L.A. 8 p.m. Also Saturday, 3 and 8 p.m.;
Sunday, 3 p.m. $10. (213) 485-1681.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   midnight Movies</TE>
<TE>   "Open Your Eyes (Abre los Ojos)," the 1999 Spanish film by
director Alejandro Amenabar (who went on to make "The Others"), was
so inspiring to Cameron Crowe that he remade it disappointingly in
English as "Vanilla Sky" with Tom Cruise. Check out the superior
original this weekend at the University Village 3 (near USC). Though
both feature Penelope Cruz, Amenabar's film, rarely seen in this
country, is a classic of futuristic creepiness, an unnervingly spooky
romantic drama that takes the notion of what is reality and what
isn't into new and startling directions. From its opening scene, when
protagonist Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) has an experience that turns into
a dream without our knowing it, this film--a major hit in its native
Spain--is a puzzle picture, a tricky artistic head trip that is
always daring us to figure out exactly what is going on at any given
moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Open Your Eyes," Cool Weekend Late Show, University Village 3,
3323 S. Hoover St., L.A. Friday and Saturday, midnight. $4.75 to
$7.75; USC students, $5.25. (213) 748-6321.</TE>

12th year, Trinity performs everything from traditional Celtic steps
to contemporary experiments, including choreography by the
unpredictable and often uproarious Sean Curran, a dancer who

and unleashed his wilder side in the Broadway cast of "Stomp!" The

the program.</TE>

results of Ireland's new prosperity. The United States premiere
production features a respected national and international cast,

<LD>   For photographer Nick Ut there is no escaping the legacy of his
1972 photograph of 9-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc, who ran naked and
screaming down a Vietnamese road after being burned by napalm. The
image still haunts. A new exhibition opening today looks at Ut's
career beyond that Pulitzer Prize-winning image, however, as ''From
Hell to Hollywood by Nick Ut'' surveys Ut's 35-year career as a
photojournalist.</LD>
<LD>   ''From Hell to Hollywood by Nick Ut,'' the Perfect Exposure
Gallery, 3513 W. 6th St., L.A. Tuesdays to Saturdays, 11 a.m. to 4
p.m. Ends April 12. Free. (213) 381-1137.</LD>

<TE>   8pm Theater</TE>
<TE>   Using a fusion of video, theater and puppetry and a haunting score
by Laurie Anderson, Quebec's Robert Lepage and his Ex Machina
company's "the far side of the moon" explores the vastness of outer
and inner space. The U.S.-USSR space race serves as a metaphor in the
tale of two competitive brothers and the struggle between ambition
and idleness and the ordinary and other-</TE>
<TE>   worldly. Yves Jacques per-</TE>
<TE>   forms the multimedia epic.</TE>
<TE>   "the far side of the moon," Freud Playhouse, 405 Hilgard Ave.,
Westwood, today to Sunday, 8 p.m. $35. (310) 825-2101.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Performance</TE>
<TE>   Meredith Monk is a maker of music and movement, a unique
poly-artist whose music theater is a spiritual journey though
elemental emotions. Ann Hamilton is a maker of profoundly ornate
installation art that produces its own spiritual energy, flowing,
say, across a floor covered in honey with 750,000 pennies stuck to it
or along a sea of horsehair. Together these intense and powerfully
engaging artists have come up with a new work for Monk's
interdisciplinary company: "mercy," a mediation on a news clip about
a Palestinian boy caught in the cross-fire on Israel's West Bank.
They examine human nature through what they describe as "a mosaic of
gestures, music and visuals," which includes miniature video cameras
positioned in the singers' mouths and on the dancers' fingertips
projecting the images onto large screens.</TE>
<TE>   "mercy," Royce Hall, UCLA, Westwood. 8 p.m. $14 to $40. (310)
825-2101.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Comedy</TE>
<TE>   When comedian, actor and raconteur Billy Connolly performs at the
Wilshire Ebell Theater, the Scottish performer will give L.A.
audiences a rare but healthy sampling of his off-the-cuff one-man
shows, which he has toured for many years in Britain, Scotland and
Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Connolly, tonight and Friday, 8 p.m., Wilshire Ebell
Theater, 4401 W. 8th St. $45, $35. (323) 939-1128 or Ticketmaster,
(213) 480-3232.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   8pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   The doldrums-bound country music field is casting about for a
savior, and many have pegged Brad Paisley as the white knight who can
kick-start the genre commercially while upholding its classic
traditions. The West Virginian, impressive at the House of Blues in
December, makes a quick return to town.</TE>

<HD>'Burning's' Timeless Theme Skewers Prejudice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Extricating Christopher Fry's "The Lady's Not for Burning" from its
original setting--amid the witch trials of 15th century Europe--and
dropping it into New England in the late 1940s is not as much of a
conceptual stretch as it might appear. Despite the faux Shakespearean
homages in this witty, intricately constructed verse comedy, Fry
penned the play in 1949, and its anachronisms and subtextual modern
sensibilities feel quite at home in the later era.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, in the Road Theatre Company's well-performed and
gorgeous-looking period staging, director Matt Kirkwood finds a valid
thematic parallel in the witch-hunting paranoia of the McCarthy era,
as a puritanical small-town mayor (Barry Thompson) acquiesces to mob
rule in meting out harsh justice to an outspoken, free-spirited
alchemist's daughter (Kelly Godfrey).</LD>
<LD>   The resetting conceit is not without compromises, however. Less of
a parable from the distant past, the play's broader satirical swipes
at timeless prejudice and hypocrisy are hemmed in by the specificity
of the political climate, especially in the somewhat labored initial
setup.</LD>
<TE>   The production hits its stride in the second act as a charming
romantic comedy, with the fateful convergence of the witch's fate
with that of a world-weary soldier (K.C. Marsh) demanding to be
hanged for a murder he claims he's committed.</TE>
<TE>   The chemistry between them makes a convincing case for the power
of charm and intelligence to ease the burdens of humanity, with the
story's theme of spiritual alchemy embodied in the production itself.</TE>

<TE>   "The Lady's Not for Burning," Road Theatre Company, 5108

<HD>A Warning to the Brew Crew</HD>
<DH>Here's how to tell when a comfortable bar is on the brink
of going Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE GORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day it's a dive, a pleasantly musty dungeon reeking of old-school
charm. Then, seemingly overnight, it becomes a Hollywood scene,
packed with people shouting, "Dude, you've got to be here!" into cell
phones.</LD>
<LD>   The regulars get crowded out by nouveau hipsters, twentysomethings
who discovered Lounge Culture via the DVD edition of "Swingers." They
roost in faux thriftwear from Macy's, soaking up the atmosphere until
it's evaporated like the smoke from a strategically poised cigarette.</LD>
<LD>   Few are able to see it coming. But local barfly Frank Mulvey,
author of "The 101 Best Bars of Los Angeles," knows the warning signs
that a hideaway is about to be invaded by celebrity-obsessed poseurs,
or, worse yet, be scrubbed and mopped.</LD>
<TE>   "Good bars have a good mix of people," he says, meaning old and
young, rich and poor. When that mix begins to give way to strictly
younger clientele, it's time to watch the door. "Like lemmings, they
all march in dressed in black, talking on cell phones."</TE>
<TE>   Another big giveaway: real estate developers in the 'hood.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1942, the legendary Hollywood dive Boardner's has been a
humble place, friendly to Vietnam vets, serious drinkers and the
occasional movie legend. Then, three months ago, the Hollywood &amp;
Highland retail complex opened. A slew of nattier bars arrived in
anticipation of upscale traffic, offering gimmicks with their drinks,
like manicures or vintage shoes for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Boardner's is changing too. Co-owner Tricia La
Belle says she's dolling up the place in hopes of attracting more
celebrity parties. La Belle scored a lease on the 2,500-square-foot
space immediately to the north. She plans to carve arches into the
dividing wall and, by April, to add two lounges, double the size of
the VIP loft, build a new deejay booth and add a larger dance floor.
"We really want to be part of the new Hollywood," she says.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, she promises that the Boardner's bar will remain its old
self, with only a minor cleanup planned and the old and new spaces
clearly separated.</TE>
<TE>   "People are not here to sit and point fingers and say, 'Look who
is sitting over there,'" La Belle says of the original bar. "It's a
place for everybody to come who is a Hollywood-ite." In other words,
the new space will attract the glitter while the old bar keeps its
dust--at least, figuratively. The question: Can Boardner's have it
both ways?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure it won't change," says Reuben Jones thoughtfully
over a bottle of beer. A longtime customer and former employee,
Jones, 46, expects that the pretty people will inevitably drift into
the old space. And that's no small change. "Whenever I leave town for
business, my one concern is, 'Will I come back to Boardner's?' And I
mean in a philosophical sense, not a physical sense: for the
fraternity. I wonder if the fraternity will still be here," he says.
Worried patrons like Jones also should keep a bloodshot eye on the
bartenders, Mulvey says. When bartenders start to look less
comfortably rumpled and more downright unwashed and underpaid, the
bar is more than likely in financial straits. A bar simply can't
bleed cash forever, Mulvey points out, so if it doesn't close, owners
will resort to all types of trendy, hipster-luring promotions.</TE>
<TE>   A classic move, La Belle says, is hiring a bouncer to create a
line outside of a bar's door when only a handful of people are
actually inside. Passersby assume the place is hot so it gets packed
for real. The skin-deep make-over may not last, but it usually hangs
in long enough for a bar owner to make a pretty profit, close the
place and move on.</TE>
<TE>   Conversely, rich bar owners can afford to nettle the poseurs until
they either leave or get over themselves. Take T.K. Vodrey, owner of
Tom Bergin's Tavern, also known as the House of Irish Coffee, on
Fairfax Avenue. His restaurant-bar has a long tradition of
unpretentious sports fanaticism and no-nonsense whisky snarfing.
Fancy drinks are mostly frowned upon. Merely asking what a Pimm's cup
is--supposedly a favorite among Britain's sexy young nobility--can
earn a patron a withering lecture on how to order a real drink.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone comes in and asks for a mojito or one of those drinks,
I tell them I can give them directions to Beverly Hills, where
someone might make it for them," bartender Michael O'Dwyer, 65, says.</TE>
<TE>   O'Dwyer can afford to be snarky because Vodrey, 69, has earned a
comfortable living in the past as a newspaper and magazine publisher.
"I am not in there to make a lot of money," Vodrey says. "I am here
to keep the tavern what it was and is."</TE>
<TE>   Bar regulars in other parts of town may not fare so well in coming
months, especially if Mulvey is right about another telltale sign of
coming change: the aspiring actor. The logic goes thus: Would-be
celebrities want to be seen by the right people, so they congregate
in spots where looking overtakes drinking as the primary activity.
Ergo, ambitious actors eager to be seen can be a sign that a bar is
teetering on the edge of a vat of gloss.</TE>
<TE>   Right now Mulvey's money is on a restaurant and bar called the
Silver Spoon on Santa Monica Boulevard, between Fairfax Avenue and La
Cienega Boulevard as the next to collapse into popularity. The site
is within spitting distance of an acting studio or two, Mulvey notes,
and lately, he's seen more young thespians at the Silver Spoon after
rehearsals, plays or lessons, making the place ripe for rediscovery.</TE>
<TE>   "[The actors] have been going there forever, but now, more and
more are going in there," Mulvey says. "I would think that somebody
would come along and make an offer, get rid of the old-timers and
make it a hip bar."</TE>
<TE>   But at least for now, the owner says, it's not for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Mulvey promises that all these hints are rock-solid. But
sometimes, he says, a bar changes without warning.</TE>
<TE>   Take the Coach and Horses on Sunset Boulevard. According to local
lore, some time in the 1990s, a klatch of British ex-pats spotted the
Union Jack flag on the bar's awning, walked in and started downing
pints. A young woman named April replaced the mean bartender and
began serving apple martinis. "Who knows? It just kind of clicked ...
and I was out of debt in a year," owner Bob Grant says.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, babes in black were sighted in low-slung pants,
pouting, and the invasion was complete.</TE>

<HD>Spark a Little Romance With Some Tea</HD>
<DH>Traditional and fantasy settings can help set a variety of
moods for Valentine's Day.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA BURUM</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tea suggests the sort of high romance you read about in Victorian
novels. English tearooms, festooned with lace and chintz, were an
ideal setting for decorous flirtation over a table of savories and
pastries.</LD>
<LD>   Many L.A. hotels have perfectly fine places for romantic afternoon
teas, but the following tearooms offer an escapist's dream. Their
owners have created elaborate English fantasy settings suggesting
Beatrix Potter's books or "Vanity Fair."</LD>
<LD>   A few hours in any one of them--especially on Valentine's Day--is
bound to inspire romantic thoughts.</LD>
<TE>   The Vintage Tea Leaf in Long Beach goes all out for Valentine's
Day. Festivities include a candlelight tea dinner today, a Victorian
friendship Valentine's tea with lyrical musical entertainment at 2:30
p.m. Sunday and a Valentine's afternoon tea menu is served today
through Sunday. This massive tearoom holds dozens of shabby-chic
overstuffed chairs to sink into. Victorian bric-a-brac is everywhere
and there is intimate seating on a quirky mezzanine.</TE>
<TE>   A long menu offers 11 tea service combinations as well as luncheon
and a la carte items. Many are wonderfully original: scone pudding
with lemon curd and whipped cream, sandwiches on herb-seasoned scones
with fillings such as chicken and homemade jam or souffle-like creamy
spinach.</TE>
<TE>   The finger sandwich list includes smoked salmon-ricotta mousse,
artichoke and Parmesan on pumpernickel and tuna-currant salad with
champagne-pepper jelly.</TE>
<TE>   Tea service is fanatically proper. The house serves only
whole-leaf teas brewed in warmed cozy-covered pots and poured into
bone china cups that patrons select from the house teacup collection.</TE>
<TE>   The skillful proprietary blends, numbering more than a dozen, are
a vast improvement over anything obtained off a shelf. They include
Friendship Blend (teas from three countries) and Tango-Spice Blend,
with orange peel, rose petals and spices.</TE>
<TE>   * The Vintage Tea Leaf, 969 E. Broadway, Long Beach, (562)
435-5589. Afternoon tea, $12 to $20; candlelight supper and Victorian
teas, $30 (including tax and tip); Valentine's tea menu, $26. No
alcohol. Street parking. All major cards. Open 11:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Thursdays though Mondays.</TE>
<TE>   At the Four Seasons Tea Room in Sierra Madre, antique linens and
chinaware collections lend an air of gentility to the cozy dining
rooms.</TE>
<TE>   As the name suggests, the seasons rule here. The tea menus change
throughout the year. Winter always brings a Valentine's candlelight
supper. On sunny days, you can take tea on the lattice-covered patio.</TE>
<TE>   Tea sandwiches--five are served with the afternoon tea and the
sandwich tea--change seasonally. Pumpkin bread with cream cheese,
chicken salad with rosemary and golden raisins and roasted pepper
with sun-dried tomato sandwiches may be among them.</TE>
<TE>   Delicate scones with cream and jam, moist lemon-blueberry cake, a
rich, chocolaty fudge brownie and butter-infused shortbread squares
complete the menu. The salad tea features mixed greens with dried
cranberries, almonds and blue cheese. The only teas offered are a
house blend of Assam and Darjeeling and a decaf Orange Pekoe. Teas
tend to be brewed on the weak side unless you request otherwise.
Reservations are essential.</TE>
<TE>   * Four Seasons Tea Room, 75 N. Baldwin Ave., Sierra Madre; (626)
355-0045. Afternoon tea, $11.50 to $16; Valentine's candlelight
supper, $35. No alcohol. Street parking and public lot. All major
cards. Open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays.</TE>
<TE>   The Gilded Rose Manor in Northridge takes up an entire
Colonial-style house that's been painted a passionate shade of
lavender. You may take your tea in one of several themed rooms: the
Blue Parlor, the Rose Salon or the Atrium, whose walls are covered by
a seashore mural.</TE>
<TE>   As you settle back on slipcovered chairs, you're handed menus and
a list of teas and infusions affixed to a quaint Victorian paper fan.</TE>
<TE>   You can choose the cream tea, the afternoon tea or the all-out
royal tea. The sandwiches--curried chicken, cucumber and cream or egg
salad on lavender bread with a hint of dill--look impressive on the
tiered pastry servers.</TE>
<TE>   The scones are tender and feathery, the not-too-sweet lemon curd
is homemade too, as are sweets, which include raspberry-chocolate bar
cookies and fluted cups made from good chocolate and filled with
fresh berries and cream.</TE>
<TE>   Theme tea parties and children's teas are welcomed here, and there
will be a Valentine's candlelight dinner tea from 7 to 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   * The Gilded Rose Manor, 17114 Devonshire St., Northridge, (818)
831-0511. Afternoon tea, $7.95 to $19.95; candlelight supper, $30. No
alcohol. Parking lot. All major cards. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Tuesdays through Saturdays, noon to 5 p.m. Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   Grab your hat (and boa) and leave your worries at the doorstep at
ColletTea.</TE>
<TE>   This sweet neighborhood place, just a block from the ocean in
Redondo Beach, provides a selection of boas and floppy, wide-brimmed
Victorian hats for patrons to wear while they immerse themselves in
the teatime experience. Damask-and-lace-draped tables, Victorian
gewgaws and cozy-covered teapots provide the proper English
cottage-by-the-sea ambience.</TE>
<TE>   Tea menu items change frequently. A huntsman tea, served on a
wooden plank, includes homemade soup (the chicken and dumpling soup
is very fine) or a salad--perhaps the mixed greens with fresh
raspberries, bleu cheese and caramelized pecans--plus cheese and an
individual loaf of bread, such as thyme-rosemary.</TE>
<TE>   Soup and salad come with the full ColletTea, after which arrive
finger sandwiches (tea-poached chicken salad on potato bread, egg
salad or European cucumber) and freshly baked scones with imported
Devonshire double cream and lemon curd for spreading.</TE>
<TE>   A plate of assorted fruit pieces and a little sweet, rich
shortbread or a carrot bar round things out. Several lighter tea
services are offered here too.</TE>
<TE>   The favorites on Collet's long tea list, all brewed with loose
leaves, are the citron-infused green tea and the "courtship" black
tea spiked with ginger.</TE>
<TE>   * ColletTea, 320 S. Catalina Ave., Redondo Beach, (310) 372-0348.
Afternoon tea, $6.25 to $20.95. No alcohol. Street parking and public
lot. All major cards. Open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesdays through
Sundays.</TE>

<DH>Wine tastings around L.A. attract experts and novices,
sippers and schmoozers.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Of all the tastings held at wine retailers around the city, the
Friday night soirees at the Wine House are by far the biggest party.
Brash and dimly lit, the affairs attract plenty of pretty women and
hunky guys. By 6 p.m., there is usually a line of a hundred or so
people snaking out the door and down the sidewalk waiting to get in.
It's wine tasting gone MTV.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, crowd enough people into a room and there's sure to be
energy, especially when you add alcohol to the mix. Though not all
the 30- and 40-something professionals who make up the bulk of the
attendees are single, many are.</LD>
<LD>   "I was telling my mother this might be a good place to meet
someone," said Sara Adler, a 33-year-old nurse who attended January
Cab-O-Rama at the popular West Los Angeles wine retailer. "This might
be slightly less shallow than going to a bar. Not that going to a bar
is a bad thing."</LD>
<TE>   The Wine House affair is just one of dozens held each week in a
city rich with tasting options. We're a serious wine town in a
serious wine state. Make that the wine state. California's 900 or so
wineries produce 90% of all U.S. wine. As for Los Angeles, often
maligned by our Northern Californian brethren for our lack of culture
and taste, the metropolitan area is the No. 1 wine market not just in
California but in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "More wine both in tonnage and in dollars is sold in Los Angeles
than in any other city," says Roger Rogness, general manager of Santa
Monica's Wine Expo shop. "This is also the most exciting and
consumer-friendly wine market in the world," a result, he says, of
the vast numbers of retailers and a volatile distribution system.
"The moral is, if you're a consumer in Los Angeles, you can buy
extraordinary wine for small money."</TE>
<TE>   It helps to know a little something about wine to reap the full
benefits of being here. And judging by the number of book titles
devoted to wine demystification--the "Dummies" and "Idiots" series
alone feature half a dozen--it's safe to say a lot of people feel
pretty ignorant when it comes to wine.</TE>
<TE>   This is where tastings come in. Most take place at wine shops,
others in restaurants. A mix of socialization, education, commerce
and hedonism, the tastings attract everyone from wine novices to
mid-level wine connoisseurs. (The hard-core generally prefer to taste
in a more rarefied environment.) And they are a relative bargain. The
cost to sample five to 20 different wines is usually well under $50,
and some are less than $10. Often the price of a single bottle
exceeds the total tasting cost.</TE>
<TE>   Not that tastings are the only path to knowledge. There are wine
classes, wine books, wine magazines. One could just go on a buying
spree and pull a few corks at home. But none of these options is as
fun as the informal, organized tasting, which is increasingly
popular.</TE>
<TE>   Because Cabernet is such a beloved grape varietal, the January
tasting of California Cabs at the Wine House was an especially hot
ticket. Quite a few people didn't even get in. Those who did paid the
usual $20 admission fee. In return, they were given a glass, a list
of the night's offerings and nine raffle-style paper tickets, one for
each wine being poured. Once they were inside the tasting room, the
frenzy began. Some people grabbed a seat at one of the half-dozen
banquet tables. (Seating is at a premium here.) Others swarmed the
food table.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how it is when something's free or perceived as such in
terms of food," offered store manager JB Severin, who was policing
the display of bread, cheese, salami, quiche and gumbo, trying to
discourage hoarding. The majority of attendees made a beeline for the
bar. Here, a couple of guys were furiously pouring wine, trying to
keep up with the crush of people.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the wait at the bar and the fact that the experts pouring
didn't have much time to talk about the various wines--they were too
busy being bartenders--most everyone was in good spirits. Those
intent on studying did so on their own, or with friends. Theresa
Totani, for instance, a Friday night regular, stood at one corner of
the bar swirling and smelling and scribbling notes on her tasting
sheet as she tried each wine. "I love tasting wine," said the
44-year-old self-proclaimed wine connoisseur. "It's a nice way to end
the week."</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the room, 26-year-old Michelle Bailey of Long
Beach and her friend, Tina Shoepe, 28, debated whether the sweet note
in a particular wine was caramel or molasses. "We're amateurs,"
confessed Bailey. "But we aspire to be more," added Shoepe. They were
also soliciting the opinions of those around them. "I don't know how
many times we've gone up to people and asked, 'What do you think?'"
said Shoepe. The happy-hour atmosphere encourages this kind of open
discussion. "It's not like the old-style tasting where people are so
serious," said Bailey.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone, however, was happy. Artist Terry Harper, a hip
58-year-old who made a New Year's resolution to "learn Shakespeare
and wine" and was tipped off to the Friday night tastings by his
lawyer, was unimpressed. "It's more intimate getting your bags
checked at LAX," he said. "This is just a crowded bar. It's more like
a college-type atmosphere. It's loud, boisterous. This is not a place
to learn wine. It's more sociable than scholastic." Even the Wine
House's Severin admits the Friday night tastings are mainly social.
"A lot of these people could care less that they're drinking wine,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   There's slightly more emphasis on learning at the monthly tastings
at Beverly Hills' trendy Reign restaurant, but only slightly. When
participants enter the VIP room where the tastings are held, they are
handed a pamphlet with descriptions of each wine in the night's
lineup and ample space for note-taking. Pencils are proffered. But
few accept. Co-sponsored by Wine Brats, a nonprofit group that
spreads the gospel of wine to the under-40 set, these tastings skew a
bit younger than those at the Wine House. And while the weeknight
event is hardly dressy, it's clear that many of the guests have taken
pains to look sharp. It's a swanky restaurant. It's a chic room. Why
not?</TE>
<TE>   About 40 people showed up to January's "How Sweet It Is to Be
Sipped by You" event, a tasting of dessert wines, complemented by
miniature sweet potato pies, fruit tarts and cheese and crackers. The
usual turnout is twice that. Dessert wines just aren't the draw, of
say, Pinot Noirs, at least not on this night. Still, the fruity
floral wines were getting high marks.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one that was really light and smooth," said Angela Harvey,
34, flipping through the pamphlet to recall the name. Harvey was
ensconced in a booth with three friends, all members of a book club
(perhaps the only book club around with its very own group business
card). The foursome was shortly joined by 33-year-old Jacquie
Sargent, an outgoing business analyst who was working the room, and
whom they had just met. Most groups, however, kept to themselves.
Perhaps this is why Shoepe deemed a recent Wine Brat event--one of
the occasional tastings the group holds at different venues--"kind of
snobby. You have to go with friends. People don't intermingle."</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, it depends who shows up on a given night. Certainly
the Wine Brats volunteers present at Reign's dessert tasting made an
effort to mingle. And several people did exchange phone numbers. But
Shoepe has a point: While big on style, the Reign event was short on
warmth.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday afternoon tastings at Mission Wines in South Pasadena
offer a cozier atmosphere. At a Merlot event earlier this year, there
were no more than eight people at any one time gathered at the
counter in the rear of the boutique shop. Though no big-city tasting
can approximate the rich sensory experience of tasting at a
winery--surrounded by barrels, the sweet scent of earth in the air,
vineyards spilling out in every direction--the gatherings at Mission
Wines do at least approximate the comfort level and lack of
pretension that characterize the very best wine country tastings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is sort of our Cheers," said tasting veteran Valerie Hines,
58, between sips of an Australian Merlot. "Some of my best friends
are people I met here. It brings together a very diverse group of
people with one thing, or actually two things, in common: an
appreciation for good food and wine." Manning the bar on this day was
psychology doctoral student and part-time store employee Steve Ball.
At other times, it's a winemaker or winery representative.</TE>
<TE>   Who is pouring can make a huge difference. Having someone explain
in easy-to-understand terms the characteristics of a wine and why it
exemplifies a certain region is analogous to walking through a museum
with a fabulous docent. Ball was a natural. He tailored the
information he shared to each individual's knowledge and interest
level and managed to avoid snobbishness altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Alyson Beecher, a 40-ish preschool director from Mount Washington,
has been attending the Saturday tastings regularly for about three
months. "I can actually hang with the conversation now and not feel
stupid," she said. "When I started, I had zero knowledge. I knew you
had red, white and pink wines. Coming here really helped. I learned
about different grapes. And we taste wine from all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday afternoon tastings at Santa Monica's diminutive
Epicurus wine shop are equally intimate. But they are best suited to
people with at least some prior tasting experience as the wines are
tasted blind, or actually, semi-blind. The six wines featured each
week are wrapped in brown paper bags and numbered 1 to 6. The same
six wines are displayed unwrapped on the counter. So while
participants know they are drinking one of these wines, they don't
know which wine is which until the end, when manager Mark Fitzmorris
hands over a cheat sheet.</TE>
<TE>   There are compelling reasons for tasting this way, which is why
the pros often taste blind. According to Fitzmorris, it ensures
"people will enjoy wines based on what they're tasting versus what
they're seeing." In other words, all the extraneous factors that
might predispose one to liking or disliking a particular wine--the
price, the label, etc.--disappear. People are forced to rely on their
own palates.</TE>
<TE>   For those without any tasting vocabulary, tasting blind can be
daunting. But it can also be liberating. At a January tasting of 1999
California Zinfandels, people freely shared their assessments: "This
one's not too peppery." "This tastes like raspberry soda." "Icky." It
quickly became apparent that there was no consensus. The same wine
one taster dumped into a bucket another promptly declared his
favorite. "I like the most expensive wine," announced John
Castellanos, 40, after reviewing the list. "It never fails." No
sooner did he say this than one woman confided to her friends her
consistent knack for selecting the least expensive wine.</TE>
<TE>   The tight space in the rear of Epicurus where the tastings are
held is a bit awkward, especially when it fills up. And it usually
does, given the friendly $5 price tag. But it's a surprisingly good
feeling, albeit an unfamiliar one, rubbing elbows and chatting with
your fellow Angelenos.</TE>
<TE>   "Wine tastings are good from a lot of different angles," says
Anthony Dias Blue, wine and spirits editor at Bon Appetit magazine.
"Obviously you're not going to get the comprehensive knowledge of a
course at UCLA. But you're going to have a good time. ... You're
going to learn something. And you'll meet some people who have
similar interests."</TE>
<TE>   Of course there's no proven correlation between wine appreciation
and the degree of sophistication you'll find among those drawn to the
sip and mingle scene. However, a night of tasting--with its promise
of new and interesting wines--is usually satisfying enough, as
Totani's experience suggests. "Unfortunately, I've met some
ne'er-do-wells," she said over a glass of 1999 Pine Ridge Rutherford
Cabernet. The wine, on the other hand, she pronounced "outstanding."</TE>

<LD>Leave the Clutch Bag at Home</LD>
<LD>   You want to be hands-free in order to hold your wine glass and a
hunk of brie on French bread at the same time. So women should opt
for a shoulder bag.</LD>
<LD>   Skip the Cologne and Perfume</LD>
<TE>   No one wants a noseful of English Leather or Chanel No. 5 when
sniffing that cabernet. Best to go au naturel. If you end up seducing
someone, you can always dab on a little once you get home.</TE>
<TE>   Hold On to Your Glass</TE>
<TE>   At most tastings, you get only one, so don't let it out of your
sight. Otherwise you might end up grabbing someone else's glass ...
eeewww!</TE>
<TE>   Talk the Talk</TE>
<TE>   By all means, if you know the lingo, use it. But don't abuse it.
No one wants to hear your malolactic fermentation speech. Conversely,
if you're an absolute beginner, don't pretend you're Robert Parker.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Stupid Questions</TE>
<TE>   If not now, when?</TE>
<TE>   Swirl 'n' Sniff</TE>
<TE>   All that swirling and sniffing isn't just for show. A wine's nose
can be very revealing. And swirling brings the nose front and
forward. Place your glass on an even surface. Put the pads of your
index and middle fingers firmly on the base. Then move your fingers
in small, smooth circles on the table. Hey, Ma. You're swirling. Now
stop, put your nose in the glass, and take a big sniff.</TE>
<TE>   Write It Down</TE>
<TE>   Unless you're one of those freaky photographic-memory types,
chances are you aren't going to remember everything you wanted to,
like the name and vintage of that wine you liked so much. It doesn't
take long to jot a few notes. Plus, it gives you an intellectual air.</TE>
<TE>   Have a Nosh</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean inhale the cheese plate. Remember, this isn't
dinner. It's a tasting. But it is a good idea to eat a little
something to counter the effects of the alcohol.</TE>

<LD>Most of us get by with one set of wine glasses for everything from
Chardonnay to Cabernet. Not serious wine people. Connoisseurs demand
different glasses for different wines. Coke tastes the same in a
Baccarat tumbler or a Styrofoam cup, but the taste of wine,
especially good and great wine, can be dramatically altered by the
shape of a glass.</LD>
<LD>   "Each wine has different characteristics, everything from its
aroma to its acidity to its tannins, fruits and phenols," says
Margaret Stern, spokeswoman for Riedel Crystal of Austria, one of the
world's leading manufacturers of stemware. "Someone once said there
were 3,000 elements in a wine. Therefore, if you serve all wines out
of one standard glass, you're not maximizing qualities that are in
the wine."</LD>
<LD>   There's no need to purchase dozens of different glasses, although
you certainly could. Riedel's Sommelier line, for example, features
about 30 highly specified wine glasses. A few qualities, however, are
essential. Glasses should be clear, in order to appreciate the color
of a wine. And their stems should be long enough to hold. You don't
want to cup the bowl with your hand unless you are intentionally
trying to warm a wine.</LD>
<TE>   Here are four basic wine glasses. We asked Chris Angulo, wine
steward at the Water Grill restaurant in downtown Los Angeles, to
give us the lowdown on each one.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The idea behind this glass is that you don't want to lose the
sparkle in the wine. The tight cylindrical shape maximizes the
contact of the wine to the interior surface of the glass and
consequently the number of bubbles, which flow upward in a pleasing
column, all the better to appreciate the shape of the individual
bubbles, a favorite activity of wine aficionados.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The principal wines one would drink in this glass, cabernet
sauvignon and merlot, need quite a bit of air to be best appreciated.
The shape of this glass, widest at the center, ensures that much of
the wine's surface is exposed to air. In addition, the narrowing at
the top centers aromas and allows the wine to move up the glass when
swirled without spilling over.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perfect for pinot noir, the burgundy glass directs the flow of the
wine to the tip of the tongue, the sweet zone. This is important
because traditionally, pinot noir is high in acidity. By playing up
the natural sweetness, the wine becomes more balanced.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Typically slightly smaller than the bordeaux glass, the white wine
glass works especially well with chardonnays, viogniers and
roussanes. It directs the wine to the center of the tongue, resulting
in a good balance of fruitiness and acidity. The gentle narrowing of
the mouth focuses aromas.</TE>

<LD>For years anyone driving south on La Cienega Boulevard from the
Sunset Strip would be sailing along until they reached the corner of
Sherwood Drive, halfway between Santa Monica Boulevard and Melrose
Avenue. There, in front of Cafe Maurice and piling up at the corner
was the predictable snarl of fancy cars and frantic valet parkers
that created a notorious traffic hazard. The crowd, cell phones glued
to their ears, spilled out onto the sidewalk, and from inside you
could hear a globe-spanning mix of languages in rapt conversation.</LD>
<LD>   Cafe Maurice closed its doors late last year, and suddenly the
hundreds who frequented this wildly popular, mediocre cafe had
vanished. Where did they go? Have they all gravitated to some new
spot?</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, after a much-needed renovation, the Belmont has just
opened in the same space. It's almost too discreet, hard to spot from
the street. Open for just over three weeks, it's struggling to find
an audience. None of the old crowd has been back to check it out, I
guess.</LD>
<TE>   Inside, it's now better looking (and much more brightly lighted)
than Cafe Maurice regulars could have ever dreamed it could be.
Welcome to the Belmont, an American restaurant and bar outfitted with
C-shaped leather booths, polished wood paneling and a style
reminiscent of '30s ocean liners.</TE>
<TE>   Yet when my friends and I dropped in recently, we were the lone
table, until finally, halfway through dinner, another table was
seated in the wake of a visitation by one of the owners. The staff
tries to put a brave face on the lack of customers. The bartender
struggles to stay awake behind the bar, all his expertise going for
naught. I can only imagine how the cooks must feel with no one to
cook for.</TE>
<TE>   Not that they get to do much that's innovative or exciting.</TE>
<TE>   The food is familiar contemporary American fare--crab cakes,
shrimp cocktail, fried calamari, a decent Sirloin burger with or
without cheese, grilled salmon filet , an acceptable New York strip
with a Jack Daniel's peppercorn sauce for under $20. Not to forget
the ever-popular chopped salad, which the svelte young women at the
larger table order.</TE>
<TE>   None of it would make a foodie's heart beat faster. The Belmont
isn't pitched to that sort of person anyway. But if you're in need of
a swell-looking, intimate place for a drink, the bartender will be
forever grateful. Who knows, it may be the start of something.
Anything would be appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont, 747 N. La Cienega Blvd., Los Angeles; (310) 659-8871;
Fax (310) 659-8743. Appetizers $8 to $11; main courses $12 to $22.
Open 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week; dinner served until
midnight. Valet parking.</TE>

<DH>Desaparecidos protests the unchecked spread of suburbs and
a bleak, creeping uniformity in some communities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something going on in Omaha, and judging by the fever pitch
at which the band Desaparecidos describes it in the new album "Read
Music/Speak Spanish," it's something you need to know about.</LD>
<LD>   It's about urban sprawl and loss of a community's character, about
creeping uniformity and people trapped in suburban houses staring
down an empty future.</LD>
<LD>   The song "Greater Omaha" describes the inexorable march of the
franchises ("I have been driving now for 100 blocks, saw 50 Kum and
Go's, 60 parking lots"). Supplementing its aerial views, the group
(which plays the Troubadour tonight and the Glass House on Friday)
also goes inside those homes like a documentary crew. "I would start
an argument but you can barely even talk," one character says to her
husband, summarizing the stressed-out, alienated lives being played
out in this new wasteland.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a major underlying idea as you grow up that you need to
just save your money and get that affordable housing at the edge of
town where you're away from the city where all the crime happens or
whatever," says Conor Oberst, the band's leader and lyricist. "I
don't really feel like I'm saying anything new or that isn't pretty
obvious to anyone that would consider what living in this way would
do to someone."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe not, but few have propelled these observations with such a
brutal kick. As if compelled to spread their warning before they,
too, are swamped by outside forces, the quintet mounts a headlong
rush of rock that's hard and heavy, but also tuneful and spiked with
guitar hooks. It pushes Oberst's voice to a shredded scream, and is
made dense and relentless with layers of dialogue and other sounds
that don't permit an instant of silence through the album's
concentrated 31 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to say which is more surprising, having an album this
urgent and confident from a rookie band, or having an album this
enraged and outer-directed from a principal songwriter known for
quiet introspection. Even though Oberst turns 22 today, he's been
writing and performing since age 13, and has been a cult hero in
indie-rock circles for years as the leader of the collective Bright
Eyes, which has released three albums and two EPs.</TE>
<TE>   Bright Eyes associates Ian McElroy (keyboards) and Matt Baum
(drums) are part of Desaparecidos (named for the "disappeared"
dissidents of Argentina, to indicate the band's role as social
critic), along with bassist Landon Hedges and the group's main music
composer, guitarist Denver Dalley.</TE>
<TE>   They formed as a casual teaming last year, quickly got more
serious and recorded "Read Music/Speak Spanish," which came out this
week on the Saddle Creek label..</TE>
<TE>   While the album's social studies use the specifics of their
hometown situation (the artwork even reproduces a city planning
department report on a housing development), its commentary resonates
through an entire stratum of contemporary America--mid-sized cities
whose young adults were forged in the high-pressure 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it's just living, and there's something sad about it to
me" says Oberst. "It's just the way it is. I don't look down on
people that do that. It's just kind of sad that people feel trapped
in it and can't live out what they really want to do because they
feel pressure from their family and their own desires to acquire
property. It's the reverse of what I see as important in my life. I'd
much rather trade, like driving a [crummier] car to [have] more time
to walk around outside or whatever.... To me it's like, 'God, you're
wasting your time, get to what's important.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

Santa Monica Blvd., West Hollywood, 8 p.m. $10. (310) 276-6168. Also

<DH>No Barney songs here. 24th Street aims for more
sophistication in family performances.</DH>

<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fairy tale capers and clownish pablum don't cut it at the 24th Street
Theatre. "We decided that wacky hat stuff is not where it's at," said
Debbie Devine, co-founder and family programming director.</LD>
<LD>   At this nonprofit USC-neighborhood venue, the mission is to give
young audiences the real thing--professional, adult-quality family
theater. In pursuit of that mission, Devine and husband Jay Mc-
Adams, co-founder and executive director, are making forays into
unexpected, some might say risky, territory.</LD>
<LD>   Take a look at what's in store in the return of the theater's
5-year-old annual Saturday Explorer Series, opening this weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Performance artists, those scourges of the public arts-funding
debate, have a hefty presence in this free, six-week slate of family
shows. So do a Bulgarian pop star, a piano-bar sophisticate and the
Campers, a Pennsylvania-based physical theater duo in a "Camping Trip
From Hell."</TE>
<TE>   Consider series-opener Krassimir, the single-monikered Bulgarian
male soprano.</TE>
<TE>   "We've seen him at the Acropolis singing, with 10,000 teenage
girls screaming, clawing at his clothing--he's the Ricky Martin of
Bulgaria," McAdams said. But before Krassimir found his voice as a
pop star, he was a renowned mime artist and mime teacher in Eastern
Europe. (Now an L.A. resident, he began teaching pantomime in January
at the Colburn School, where Devine heads the drama department.)</TE>
<TE>   So he will show off his four-octave vocal range, but mainly, with
classic Marcel Marceau acts, his own physical material and live
musical accompaniment, Krassimir will enact the tale of an old mime
who lives through his memories; he is sure that children will
identify with the emotional layers.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are afraid of [performing for children]," he said.
"They don't know how they will react. But children are the real
audience. You can see what they think. They express themselves so
easily: They cry, they laugh. They want to find the kind of light
that makes them happy, that warms them."</TE>
<TE>   Professional lounge singer Cindy White is no kiddie act, either.
Her repertoire ranges from Cole Porter to the Beatles.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what her sets are going to be," McAdams said. "We
don't want her to do Barney songs. What we thought was interesting
about her [dinner club act] is that she really worked the room. We
want kids to see that." To that end, White will perform in a club
setting, with mood lighting, piano and tip jar. Apple juice will be
served.</TE>
<TE>   The crossover artists, hailing from such frankly adult venues as
Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, are Dan Kwong and Sara
Felder--she a gentle but pointed social satirist and juggler
extraordinaire, he an intrepid multimedia explorer of male Asian
American identity.</TE>
<TE>   And while kids may recognize Beakman, the Emmy-winning star of
"Beakman's World," in his "Personal Beakman" show, this wacky science
guy is also a Highways veteran: the edgy-funny, off-the-wall
puppeteer Paul Zaloom.</TE>
<TE>   'A Human View, Not</TE>
<TE>   Just an Adult View'</TE>
<TE>   Devine is confident that young audiences will respond to
performance art's highly visual one-on-one quality. The challenge,
she said, is to convince the artists--who may be more accustomed to
incurring the ire of Congress than to doing family shows--"that what
they have to say is a human view, not just an adult view."</TE>
<TE>   She's being aided by family theater convert and Highways regular
Jude Narita, critically acclaimed for her one-woman shows about Asian
and Asian American women. Narita performed in the first Saturday
Explorer series in 1998, though only after "a lot of cajoling."</TE>
<TE>   "They had to drag me into it. I was terrified," Narita said. "'My
work is very much text-oriented, dark, very political,' I said. 'You
don't understand. I talk, that's all I do is talk. It would be
boring.'"</TE>
<TE>   But "it was wonderful." Young people of all ages responded not
only to comic elements but to the "rough emotional journeys" of a
girl in Hiroshima and women of Cambodia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a lesson to me," she said. "Your expectations of children
can be limited or condescending without meaning to be [but] the kids
are right there. I found out that I can create something that is true
to me, and I don't feel that I'm cheating my characters."</TE>
<TE>   The series will be terra incognita for Sara Felder, whose Jewish,
lesbian identity fuels her work, but her family-friendliness won't
surprise those who have seen her signature mix of astonishing
juggling, humor and humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Times theater reviewer F. Kathleen Foley called Felder's one-woman
show, "June Bride," "a veritable tribute to family values."</TE>
<TE>   Still, if she hadn't heard of Narita's enthusiastic conversion,
Felder wouldn't be taking the plunge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's challenging to think about what's appropriate, not just in
the gay material, but in the Jewish material also," Felder said.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, I'm going to treat it like a vaudeville. I have some
just really fun routines, it's very visual and there's a lot of stuff
that is pure shtick," with hula-hooping, manipulations of a crystal
ball, "devil sticks" and boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Kwong was less hesitant, cautioning only that the recommended age
level be 12 and older for his solo play, "The Night the Moon Came Out
on 39th Street," which he calls "the most broadly accessible piece
I've ever done."</TE>
<TE>   The humorous and soulful work is loaded with live and video
projections, music and voice-overs, props and costumes. Based on
Kwong's experiences as a child and young adult, it is interwoven with
anecdotes about the U.S. space program and was created, Kwong said,
to "shine a light on that wonder that children possess about the
world around them."</TE>
<TE>   Even the series finale, with the veteran youth theater, Mark Taper
Forum's P.L.A.Y., defies expectations.</TE>
<TE>   A comic satire of gender stereotyping, it is Scottish theater
company Visible Fictions' adaptation of Anne Fine's novel, "Bill's
New Frock," about a boy who decides one day to wear a dress.</TE>
<TE>   "We're cultivating artists, in a way," Devine said. "Helping them
discover a different audience and a different approach to their art.
[And] there is so much exciting, cutting-edge and avant-garde theater
for youth. We want to be immersed in it, to be a part of it. We want
to bring it here."</TE>

<HD>Revisiting the Dawn of Avant-Garde Films</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It will come as a surprise to many film aficionados that the
filmmakers included in "Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant-Garde
Film, 1893-1941" include Frank Capra, Busby Berkeley, D.W. Griffith,
Edwin S. Porter and Orson Welles.</LD>
<LD>   Curated by film historian Bruce Posner, the traveling exhibition
being presented by the UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive begins today at
the university's Melnitz Hall and continues through Feb. 24.</LD>
<LD>   For decades the party line regarding avant-garde filmmaking in
America was that Maya Deren gave birth to the genre in 1943. But that
conception has changed over the past decade. "Unseen Cinema"
illustrates the various types of avant-garde films made prior to
Deren's.</LD>
<TE>   Between 1893 and 1913, filmmakers frequently experimented with
content and even methods of production. The years from 1926 to 1929
were golden for the avant-garde, which saw impressive experimental
work from such filmmakers as Slavko Vorkapich, Robert Florey, Ralph
Steiner and Robert Flaherty. During the Depression, amateur
filmmakers flourished, and professional directors explored social
issues in ways that would seem almost unfathomable today.</TE>
<TE>   Jan-Christopher Horak, the curator of the Hollywood Entertainment
Museum and a professor of film at UCLA, has written several books on
avant-garde cinema including "Lovers of Cinema: The First American
Film Avant-Garde 1919-1945." He says perceptions of avant-garde
cinema have changed among historians because more material has become
accessible. "Much of the material [in the exhibition] was not
accessible 15 or 20 years ago. It is really to Bruce's credit that he
managed to get viewing prints [from the major film archives] for this
traveling show."</TE>
<TE>   The majority of films in the exhibit had long been forgotten, says
Posner. "Like Edwin S. Porter's 'Jack and the Beanstalk.' He went on
to make 'The Great Train Robbery,' which almost everybody knows, but
they don't know he produced several hundred other films. These were
trained artists and craftspeople. But because time has buried them,
we don't know this. In the last 10 years or so, these films are
finally starting to get out of the museums and archives and
collections. It changes the whole notion of what went on back then,
from one of primitive filmmaking to outstanding visual artists who
are just as strong as people from post-1941."</TE>
<TE>   The only feature-length movie in the exhibit is 1922's "Salome,"
starring Nazimova. Directed by Charles Bryant, the film featured the
exotic sets and costumes of Natacha Rambova--who later married
Rudolph Valentino--that were based on Aubrey Beardsley's designs for
the 1905 opera based on Oscar Wilde's 1894 one-act play. The film is
a wallow in high camp and excess, but it is also gorgeous to behold.</TE>
<TE>   "Salome" screens tonight in a program that includes Frank Capra's
first film, 1921's "Fultah Fisher's Boarding House" and Florey and
Vorkapich's seminal 1927 short, "The Life and Death of 9413--A
Hollywood Extra."</TE>
<TE>   "'Salome' is an amazing film," says Posner. "It was a huge,
colossal flop. [Nazimova] sunk her money into it. It was truly an
independent production. She was one of the biggest stars. When she
came to Hollywood she made 19 films."</TE>
<TE>   With "Salome," he said, "she went over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the criticism when "Salome" was released focused on the
fact that the 43-year-old actress was a bit too long in the tooth to
play a 14-year-old temptress. "But when you see it on the screen, her
eyes--the way they were photographed--are startling," says Posner.
"It carries the film."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seven years before he directed his 1941 masterwork, "Citizen
Kane," a then-19-year-old Orson Welles and a high school buddy
William Vance made the eight-minute expressionist silent "The Hearts
of Age," which screens Feb. 24.</TE>
<TE>   Vance and Welles had been students at a private high school
outside Chicago. "There was a man there named Roger Hill who ran the
theater program," says Posner. "He was encouraging people to make
movies, and he got them a camera. Welles graduated, and the next
summer he came back --there was a theater festival for the
weekend--and they shot this little spoof playing off of 'The Cabinet
of Dr. Caligari' [the 1919 classic German expressionistic thriller]
that was really popular at the time and 'Blood of the Poet' [Jean
Cocteau's avant-garde 1930 French film].</TE>
<TE>   "Welles did an interview [once] with Peter Bogdanovich, and he
said, 'It was just Sunday afternoon fun. It's just nothing.' But the
film is so complex and has everything Orson Welles [did in subsequent
movies]--you have fast cutting, disorientation."</TE>
<TE>   Horak will introduce the Feb. 23 program that includes one of his
favorite films, Charles Sheeler and Paul Strand's "Manhatta (New
York, the Magnificent; Fumee de New York)," from 1921.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a wonderful film as far as I am concerned," says Horak. "I
think it is really in every sense of the term an avant-garde film. It
used to be talked about as this kind of simple documentary, but if
you look at it closely that in point of fact, it reproduces not only
images of New York City in 1920, but reproduces the point of view of
what modern art does. Once you are in the cityscape like that with
very high buildings, you no longer have this open view of things.
Your view is always fragmented, and that is what the Cubists were all
about, the fragmenting of vision. This film very clearly is in that
aesthetic of showing how you can no longer see the city as a whole;
you can only see bits and pieces of it. You get a real sense of
nonstop movement of life in the city."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Screening Feb. 24 is Charles Klein's eerie, expressionistic
version of Edgar Allan Poe's "The Tell-Tale Heart" from 1928. "I was
the one who brought it to this country," says Horak. "I found it in
London at the British Film Institute in the archive. Nobody ever
looked at it before [in the archive]. I knew of it when I was doing
the research on my early American avant-garde book. I was looking for
the film and then couldn't find it anywhere in this country."</TE>
<TE>   Horak believes "Tell-Tale Heart" is a perfect illustration as to
why avant-garde film from 1920s was ignored by critics and filmmakers
in the 1940s. The film, he says, "is very much using some of the
formal devices of German expressionist cinema. A lot of the critics
and avant-garde filmmakers of the 1940s were, of course, tooting
their own horn. They knew about some of this work, but they said
those are simple kinds of reproductions of German expressionist or
European forms, and there is nothing American about them. They were
dismissed as basically not worth looking at."</TE>
<TE>   He believes the exact opposite is true.</TE>
<TE>   "While it may use some of the forms of German expressionism, how
much more American can you get than Poe?</TE>
<TE>   "Second, there is an eclecticism in the way these formal devices
are used that is very American and really ties it into the
avant-garde of the '50s and '60s--the willingness to take forms that
seemingly don't fit together and mesh them in a post-modern
pastiche."</TE>

<LD>Bach's Mass in B minor--J.S. Bach, a sensible man and singularly
rational composer, had no place in his life for opera, no calling for
the stage. But the stage has repeatedly called for his music. His
cantatas and passions have been dramatized by modern directors. Bach
has been background for dance, for theater, for cinema.</LD>
<LD>   Now Los Angeles Opera has mounted a production of the Mass in B
minor. To put a mass on the lyric stage is a moderately eccentric
undertaking for any opera company, slightly more so for a young one
that has still but scraped the surface of the conventional operatic
repertory. But masses are ritual, ritual is stageworthy and German
Achim Freyer's stunning production of the B-minor mass at the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion is altogether mesmeric.</LD>

<HD>Festivities Set for Viet Tet, Asian New Year</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>To the sound of hollow drum beats and wearing a monstrous dragon mask
with a silken red mane, Michael Nguyen maneuvers through a routine
that is a cross between a choreographed dance and ancient
martial-arts movements.</LD>
<LD>   His goal is twofold: to imbue the whiskered, good-luck beast with
irresistible charm and to keep the centuries-old tradition of dragon
dancing alive during Tet, the Vietnamese lunar new year.</LD>
<LD>   "The point of dragon dancing is to bring luck for the New Year. It
makes people laugh, and it strikes awe and fear in some of the little
kids. It's fun," said Nguyen, 17, who will perform with the
Westminster-based Quang Linh Lion Dance Troupe in festivities this
weekend in Little Saigon.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Quang Linh Lion Dance Troupe, rehearsals are in the final
stages throughout the region on the eve of a rich range of Asian new
year celebrations, from the three-day Chinatown party starting Friday
to usher in the Year of the Horse, to the annual Vietnam Tet Festival
in Garden Grove.</TE>
<TE>   The events are aimed to both celebrate and reflect traditions,
according to Frances Nguyen.  "I feel strongly about preserving the
Vietnamese culture for my children's generation," said Nguyen. The
39-year-old will attend the festival with her two daughters, the trio
wearing matching ao dais, traditional Vietnamese dresses.</TE>
<TE>   Its theme titled "Legends of the Spring," the three-day festival
presented by the Union of Vietnamese Student Assn. at Garden Grove
Park starts Friday, showcasing the debut of a chorus-singing contest.
The lineup also has dragon and lion dances, firecracker
demonstrations, children's costume contests, live folk music, art
exhibits, carnival rides, game booths and food.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to keep up these cultural traditions," said Nguyen
Phuong Hung, , treasurer and coordinator of the Tet Parade Assn. The
parade will roll down Bolsa Avenue in Westminster on Saturday with
more than 50 entries--twice as many as last year--and dozens of South
Vietnam's former yellow-and-red-striped national flags.</TE>
<TE>   Grand marshals--Westminster's Mayor Margie L. Rice and famed
Vietnamese songwriter Nguyen Hien--will lead a procession that
includes dragon dancers, Buddhist monks and fire engines.</TE>
<TE>   Ringing in the Asian New Year is traditionally not complete
without advice on what fortunes may be revealed in the coming year.
Hung, who reads tea leaves as easily as aphorisms in fortunes
cookies, says blessings are mixed for people born within the Year of
the Horse, which Vietnamese call "Nham Ngo."</TE>
<TE>   "It's good for a man to be born in this year. He will be rich.
It's not so good for a woman born in this time. Most women born under
this sign must be married at least twice," said Hung, 56. "But since
horses are known for running, the idea is that you have to seize the
opportunities that are coming."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's watching dancing lions and dragons or exchanging
little red envelopes of "lucky money," festival organizers and
participants hope the the events will help keep these cultural
customs alive.</TE>

<HD>'NYPD Blue' Will Have 10th Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a tumultuous preseason ride, ABC has officially picked up "NYPD
Blue" for another season, which will mark the 10th year for the
Emmy-winning detective series.</LD>
<LD>   The show has performed well this year despite moving to an earlier
hour from the Tuesday time slot it previously had occupied for the
duration of its run. "NYPD Blue" is averaging more than 13 million
viewers a week in a highly competitive hour that includes NBC's
"Frasier" as well as the heavily promoted new dramas "24," "The
Guardian" and "Smallville."</LD>
<LD>   ABC angered series co-creator and executive producer Steven Bochco
by initially announcing plans to move "Blue" to Wednesdays versus
NBC's long-running crime drama "Law &amp; Order," then irked him further
by opting not to commit to an additional year at that point.</LD>
<TE>   "Everything was in place. All you had to do was press the button,
and it was done," Bochco noted Wednesday, adding that the show earned
its renewal by virtue of its performance. The series will become the
first from the producer--whose credits include past Emmy-winners
"Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law"--to reach the 200-episode
milestone, which will occur early next season.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the near-total collapse of its prime-time schedule in
the fall, ABC juggled its lineup and brought "Blue" back in November
on Tuesdays at 9 p.m., using it to lead viewers into Bochco's new law
series, "Philly," starring "Blue" alumna Kim Delaney.</TE>
<TE>   "NYPD Blue's" success has continued despite numerous changes, with
star Dennis Franz--whom Bochco called "the heart and soul of this
show"--the lone remaining original cast member. There have also been
past scheduling skirmishes, including ABC's decision to delay the
program in order to launch "Once and Again"--a drama produced by the
network's corporate parent, the Walt Disney Co.--in its time slot.</TE>

<HD>Performance Party Seeks to Be 'Living Comic Book'</HD>
<DH>Late-night show offers a rotating company performing new
stories each Saturday night.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crowd looks exceptionally arty. Leather, black sweaters and
berets seem to be the evening's dress code.</LD>
<LD>   Then the music kicks up, and many of those folks drift toward the
small stages set up around the room. Turns out they're actors, and as
they move into place, "The Strip," a late-night performance party at
the Evidence Room, shifts into high gear.</LD>
<LD>   Described as "a living comic book," the show is envisioned as a
serial that will progress each Saturday night, with new stories and a
rotating company of actors. The roughly one-hour performances take
place in the theater's large lobby and bar area, which, with its
high, open-beamed ceilings and exposed brick walls, has always seemed
the perfect party room. As show time nears, visitors grab folding
chairs and stake viewing spots.</LD>
<TE>   This past Saturday's kickoff featured separate stories by Justin
Tanner, the local writer of such cult hits as "Pot Mom"; Patricia
Scanlon, a veteran of a New York series similar to "The Strip"; and
Michael Connor, whose plays include "Naked Body." All three starred
in their pieces, which fused performance art with sketch comedy--with
riotously funny results.</TE>
<TE>   Tanner introduced fraternal twins Dank, a nerdy gay guy, and his
sister Breezy, a suburban mom who occasionally pays the bills by
hooking--both played by the writer. The episode focused on Breezy,
who was in the process of passing along her poor sense of
self-respect to her 8-year-old daughter, Sunshine, as she snapped
lines like: "God hates you and wants you to suffer, and so do I."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not surprisingly, then, the adorable, pigtailed girl,
played by Tanner regular Laurel Green, proved to be as cheery as her
name one minute and like the little hellion from "The Bad Seed" the
next.</TE>
<TE>   Scanlon's piece, written with Hugh Palmer, focused on Hildy Hildy,
a character she developed off-off-Broadway. From her flip of a hairdo
to her clunky platform shoes, Hildy was dressed mostly in black--a
tip-off that, as her fed-up boyfriend (Palmer) put it, she can
sometimes be "the white noise of depression."</TE>
<TE>   In a different vein, Connor's piece followed the cartoonish
exploits of Count Woodrow, a man of leisure given to wearing a
double-breasted suit with epaulets and racing off to save damsels in
distress. Dashing yet odd, he is James Bond crossed with Dudley
Do-Right.</TE>
<TE>   The stories didn't intermingle on opening night, though they are
supposed to in the future. Additional writers and story lines also
will join the mix. Heaven only knows where all of this is headed, but
the journey should be fun.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Strip," Evidence Room, 2220 Beverly Blvd., L.A. Saturdays, 11
p.m. Indefinitely. $10. No reservations necessary. Information: (213)

<LD>Cozy up with your sweetheart next to a blazing fire and enjoy a
romantic feast.</LD>
<LD>   Chadwick: To the left as you enter this quaint brick house is a
quiet little room with a handsome mantle and a roaring fire. On
Valentine's Day you can get a special four-course menu with three
choices for each. Here are just a few: cured Irish salmon, duck
prosciutto with roasted chanterelles, seared sea scallops with
roasted sunchokes and Roquefort-stuffed beef tenderloin. Dessert
could be a silk mousse made with Scharffen Berger chocolate smoked
with pistachio shells (really) or Meyer lemon angel cake.
(Valentine's Day menu, $85 per person.) Chadwick, 267 S. Beverly
Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 205-9424.</LD>
<LD>   Four Oaks: This little Beverly Glen getaway is a white cottage
partially hidden in the trees, with an intimate dining room with a
fireplace, as well as a clever Valentine menu: "A Prelude to a Love
Affair." It begins with "a glance" (spring asparagus salad with
caviar vinaigrette), moves to "a flirt" (pommes d'amour--a tomato
soup with orange rind and spices), then "an embrace" (glass of
champagne) and then to "the dance" (grilled john dory filet or
rosemary rack of lamb) and "romance" (white almond swans on a
raspberry pond). (A Prelude to a Love Affair, $85 per person.) Four
Oaks, 218 N. Beverly Glen Blvd., Bel-Air, (310) 470-2265.</LD>
<TE>   Saddle Peak Lodge: This retreat in the mountains above Malibu
boasts two fireplaces--one in the cozy library, the other in the main
dining room. (where many a proposal has taken place). The four-course
Be My Valentine menu is full of choices. You might start with Maine
lobster salad with asparagus, parsnip puree and vanilla bean sauce
followed by a foie gras with brandied cherries, toasted brioche and
baby greens. For the entree, perhaps seared elk tenderloin with
porcini, whipped potatoes and black truffle parsley jus, and to
finish it off, a chocolate souffle with Belgian chocolate sauce. (Be
My Valentine, $85 per person.) Saddle Peak Lodge, 419 Cold Canyon
Road, Calabasas, (818) 222-3888.</TE>
<TE>   The Hump: Settle by the fireplace and watch the twinkling lights
come and go on the Santa Monica Airport runway. Special sushi
straight from Japan include tai (red snapper) and kampachi (young
yellowtail). Tataki-style Spanish mackerel comes with vegetables,
sesame and ogo kelp. Tokobushi is sauteed abalone with shiitake
mushrooms and asparagus. For dessert, spicy sweet ginger ice cream.
(Special sushi, $7; Spanish mackerel, $15; tokobushi, $24; ginger ice
cream, $5.) The Hump, Santa Monica Airport, 3221 Donald Douglas Loop
S., Santa Monica, (310) 313-0977.</TE>
<TE>   French 75: This retro bistro has flattering lighting, two
fireplaces and traditional French food. Get a booth near the
fireplace and split an order of escargots. Follow it with trout with
brown butter and almonds, served with wilted frisee tossed in brown
butter vinaigrette, or enjoy duck three ways with wild rice in tart
grape sauce flavored with peach. Then split the chocolate souffle,
served with warm chocolate sauce and Grand Marnier whipped cream.
(Escargots, $11; trout, $27; duck, $28; chocolate souffle, $12.)
French 75, 1464 S. Pacific Coast Highway, Laguna Beach, (949)
494-8444.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel Bel-Air: This hideaway features two fireplaces and two
dining experiences. The second is in a more relaxed setting in their
lounge/bar, one of the most romantic rooms in Los Angeles. The formal
dining room has an early four-course meal which includes lobster
bisque, foie gras terrine and a choice of herb-crusted turbot, guinea
hen or filet of beef. The six-course dinner adds lobster a la nage,
warm goat cheese feuillete, pear and greens, heart-shaped chocolate
marquise cake and pistachio custard. The more relaxed lounge bar menu
includes caviar, smoked salmon and the same three entrees, as well as
a wide range of desserts and petits fours. (Four-course menu, $95 per
person; six-course menu, $180 per person with champagne Laurent
Perrier Rose Brut; caviar, $90-$110; smoked salmon, $20; turbot, $35;
guinea hen, $32; filet, $39.) Hotel Bel-Air, 701 Stone Canyon Road,

<LD>   Marsalis Filling Void With New Record Label</LD>
<LD>   Branford Marsalis, the Grammy-winning saxophonist and bandleader,
is forming a new Boston-based record company, the Boston Globe
reports.</LD>
<TE>   According to the musician, Marsalis Music is a response to the
bottom-line pressures that have forced major labels to reduce or even
eliminate their jazz rosters. Last summer, he negotiated out of his
longtime contract with Columbia Records.</TE>
<TE>   "The consolidation of the record industry into major conglomerates
has turned the business into a mega-hit pop music machine with a very
short-term focus," he said. "Artists who want to be musicians, not
marketing creations, have very few places to record anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Marsalis himself has signed on to the label, which will be
marketed and distributed by Boston's Rounder Records. His next album,
"Footsteps of Our Fathers"--a tribute to John Coltrane, Ornette
Coleman, Sonny Rollins and the Modern Jazz Quartet--is expected in
late summer or early fall. No other artists have been signed yet.</TE>

<TE>   Dylan Tops Survey of Year's Best Albums</TE>
<TE>   Bob Dylan's "Love and Theft," a wry, humorous collection of songs
informed by the heritage of country and blues music, was named the
best album of 2001 in the Village Voice's annual survey of the
nation's pop music critics (numbering 621 this year).</TE>
<TE>   "Love and Theft" was a runaway winner with 3,005 points in the
poll's voting system, easily distancing it from the 1,613 points
garnered by the second-place disc, "Is This It" by the Strokes, the
New York neo-punk band.</TE>

<TE>   Wisconsin Politico Says No Quid Pro Quo</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin Atty. Gen. James Doyle, who is running for governor of
the state, denies that he issued a grant in the name of Hollywood
film producer Jerry Zucker in exchange for a $10,000 donation.</TE>
<TE>   The grant went to the University of Wisconsin's stem cell research
program three weeks before Doyle received the money from Zucker, a
graduate of the school who produced "The Naked Gun" series and
directed "Airplane!"</TE>
<TE>   Zucker, whose 13-year-old daughter Katie suffers from diabetes, is
known to be a supporter of such research as a means of combating the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   "When the only contribution he makes comes within a couple of
weeks of a major grant being made in his name, it raises your
eyebrows," said Mike McCabe, executive director of the Wisconsin
Democratic Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Zucker maintains that he would have contributed to Doyle's
campaign--grant or no grant. "I didn't care whether it was in my name
or not," he said. "It was a sweet gesture. I didn't benefit
personally."</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   The face of Cary Grant, who died in 1986, will appear on a
first-class stamp coming out later this year. ... According to USA
Today, E! Entertainment has made a deal to air "Last Call With Carson
Daly" at 6 p.m. on the same day the late-night talk show runs on NBC,
starting March 4....MTV's "Real World" will tape its 12th season in
Las Vegas.</TE>

<DH>The American Ballet Theatre's performs Kevin McKenzie's
streamlined vision of 'Swan Lake'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a few moments, Kevin McKenzie's new "Swan Lake" ventures into
deep, dangerous and fascinating waters. The American Ballet Theatre
artistic director shows the evil sorcerer Rothbart dominating the
court in Act III through his sexual magnetism, evoking the irrational
power of erotic attraction by luring away the four princesses from
their cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   McKenzie prepares for this moment by staging the introduction to
the ballet, which Tuesday opened a six-day run at the Orange County
Performing Arts Center. We see Rothbart first as a ram-horned
creature who transforms himself into a handsome courtier to attract,
abduct and change the heroine Odette into a swan. (Rothbart the
creature and Rothbart the courtier are danced by two different
dancers.) How much her own desire makes her complicit in the change
may be a moot point. Innocence, as we will also see in the case of
the ballet's hero Prince Siegfried, is pretty helpless in this world
of passion.</LD>
<LD>   McKenzie's other decisions in re-imagining "Swan Lake" are about
timing and steps, not story line. He streamlines the production,
which was first seen in Washington, D.C., in March 2000, mainly by
breaking for only one intermission (instead of the usual three), and
he creates his own choreography for most of Act I and IV. (The rest
of the dancing is traditional: "after" Petipa and Ivanov.)</LD>
<TE>   To shift quickly between the first two acts, he jettisons the
music that usually ends Act I and runs a mime sequence between
Siegfried and his friend Benno to the swan music that opens Act II.
Yes, mime is back in McKenzie's version--most contemporary "Swan
Lakes" delete this element of the original.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, it's welcome for clarifying the action. The
loss of the original music, however, is grievous; it is the only
statement of the swan theme ending in a major key and promising
happiness.</TE>
<TE>   But there are bigger problems with McKenzie's version. In dance
terms, it leaves a lot to be desired. His choreography tends to be
both busy and thin. In Act I, he scrupulously avoids strict classical
symmetries, with the result that the focus keeps shifting,
overlapping and confusing the eye. In the Dance of the Small Swans,
which eases the seamless shift from Act III to IV, the swans really
do nothing much except bend, pose, preen and noodle about. Even
Rothbart's mesmerizing solo, to the Russian Dance, which McKenzie has
added to the usual scheme, is more an issue of dancer personality
than of powerfully assembled steps.</TE>
<TE>   McKenzie's treatment of the prince, however, is the most
problematic of his choices. Siegfried has been made into a playboy
who enjoys the attention he can get from just about any woman he
wants. So his solo in Act I, apparently meant to express his
isolation, doesn't ring true.</TE>
<TE>   At least it didn't with the refined and elegant Jose Manuel
Carreno in the part. Carreno partnered sensitively and showed star
power in his solo variation. But he projected little dramatic
characterization, especially any transformation in personality as a
result of loving Odette.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Kent was a fine and fluid Odette, boneless in arms and
backbend, but she looked more secure and at ease as Rothbart's
deceptive daughter, Odile. At some point in Act III, she apparently
injured her left foot (there was what appeared to blood evident on
the top of the arch, although a company spokesman would not confirm
an injury). During the Black Swan pas de deux, when Odile usually
does a marathon of the quick whipping turns called fouettes, Kent
stopped after just 18 and then made smaller circling turns as she
exited. When she returned for the rest of that act and the short
final act, she danced without problem.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the company looked terrific. The dancers showed speed and
elevation, across the board. Even the national dances in the Act III
divertissement were up off the floor. Herman Cornejo, who was both
Benno, the Prince's friend, and the soloist in the Act I pas de
trois, soared as an incipient Bluebird. Erica Cornejo and Xiomara
Reyes equally sparkled.</TE>
<TE>   Marcelo Gomes was the powerful and magnetic dancing Rothbart.
Brian Reeder was his menacing acting counterpart.</TE>
<TE>   Zack Brown's sets and costumes are lush and gorgeous--Fragonard
pastels in Act I and Byzantine jeweled hues in Act III.</TE>
<TE>   Duane Schuler did the lighting, which oddly dimmed down at the end
of Act I while the Dance of the Cups was reaching its brilliant
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Mogrelia led the Pacific Symphony in a spirited
performance, marred only by tentative trumpet playing in the
Neopolitan Dance.</TE>
<TE>   American Ballet Theatre's "Swan Lake" continues, with cast changes
throughout, today through Saturday at 8 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday
at 2 p.m. at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town
Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $25 to $75. (714) 740-7878.</TE>

<LD>Now We All Know His Mother's Maiden Name: Massimo Ormani has opened
his own restaurant and, like a good son, named it after his mother.
Actually, he used his mother's maiden name. Pammolli, as it's called,
operates in the vacated Mandarette space in Beverly Hills. Ormani and
his wife, Daniela Judah-Ormani, decorated it to resemble a home in
Tuscany, going so far as to nick a wooden credenza and copper pot
from his great-grandfather. Ormani manned the stoves at Locanda
Veneta in Santa Monica from 1990 to 2001, so many diners will be
familiar with his Italian cooking. On Pammolli's menu: pappardelle
with wild boar ragu ($15), spaghetti with lobster ($28), risotto with
crabmeat and Cognac ($18), broiled pheasant breast ($21),
oven-roasted veal shank ($17) and rack of lamb with a balsamic and
black pepper sauce ($28). Tonight only, there's a Valrhona chocolate
box that serves two ($16). Pammolli is open for lunch and dinner
Monday through Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   * Pammolli, 9513 Santa Monica Blvd., Beverly Hills; (310)

<HD>Mailer vs. the Feminists</HD>
<DH>A tribute to documentary makers Pennebaker and Hegedus at
UCLA features the riveting and still relevant 'Town Bloody Hall.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The UCLA Film Archive's "Pennebaker &amp; Hegedus: A Collaborative
Vision" calls attention to the makers of some of the most provocative
documentaries of the past three decades. The series begins Friday at
7:30 p.m. at Melnitz Hall's James Bridges Theater with "Town Bloody
Hall" (1979), a deft account of a famous confrontation between Norman
Mailer and a formidable group of feminists, some of whom were also
eminent literary figures.</LD>
<LD>   By 1979, D.A. Pennebaker was already recognized as a major figure
in documentary filmmaking when he turned to Chris Hegedus to solve
the problem of editing his footage into a viable 88-minute film. She
succeeded so well that their partnership, which includes marriage,
continues to this day.</LD>
<LD>   Mailer's take on women's lib in a Harper's magazine article, "The
Prisoner of Sex," had so offended feminists that he agreed to appear
at New York's Town Hall in April 1971 with Jacqueline Ceballos,
president of the New York chapter of the National Organization for
Women; Germaine Greer, author of "The Female Eunuch"; Village Voice
columnist Jill Johnston; and the late Diana Trilling, a renowned
literary critic. On hand to ask questions from the audience were such
enduring literary lights as Elizabeth Hardwick, Cynthia Ozick and
Susan Sontag, along with pioneer feminist Betty Friedan.</LD>
<TE>   Though expressing different points of view, the women all seem to
agree with Trilling, who had granted him sincere intentions in his
article and called him "the most important writer of our time," when
she says that he failed to allow women their humanity. Trilling is
the panel's august presence, raising the level of debate with her wit
and perspective that revealed both a sympathy with women's liberation
and a determination not to yield her right to speak for herself on
feminist issues. Greer is also eloquent but prickly, quick to take
offense from one and all. Ceballos is not heard from again beyond her
crisp opening speech calling for equal rights for women in the
workplace and marriage, while Johnston offered a chant that began
"All women are lesbians...." When Mailer finally cut off Johnston
after she went over the 10-minute limit for opening remarks, the
columnist disrupted the hall with a perhaps not-so-impromptu lesbian
love-in. Mailer himself scored best when he criticized the feminists
for a lack of humor.</TE>
<TE>   After more than 30 years, "Town Bloody Hall" seems fresh and
pertinent--impertinent is perhaps more apt. While most people would
agree women's liberation has won many victories, that "Town Bloody
Hall" still hits home as strongly as it does suggests women's
struggle for equality with men is far from over.</TE>
<TE>   Pennebaker's "Don't Look Back" (1967), a portrait of Bob Dylan on
tour in England, and "Monterey Pop" (1969), the first major rock
concert film, highlighted by Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin, have
become classics, at once immediate, revealing and durably
entertaining. They are not included in this mini-retrospective
presented with UCLA's Documentary Salon, but Pennebaker and Hegedus'
less frequently seen music films are.</TE>
<TE>   "Town Bloody Hall" will be preceded by the 15-minute "Lambert &amp;
Company" (1964) centering on jazz singer Dave Lambert. "Shake--Otis
at Monterey" (1986) and "Jimi Plays Monterey" (1986) screen Saturday
at 7:30 p.m. Pennebaker and Hegedus will appear following the
screening of "Town Bloody Hall," and participate in a documentary
workshop Sunday at 2 p.m. in Room 2534 in Melnitz Hall.</TE>
<TE>   The series concludes Sunday evening with the Oscar-winning "The
War Room" (1992), a lively chronicle of Bill Clinton's first campaign
for the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   FilmForum will join UCLA's archive in presenting an unprecedented
survey, "Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant-Garde," which commences
tonight at 7:30 in the James Bridges Theater and continues
intermittently through Feb. 24. By far the best-known film in the
opening program is the 68-minute "Salome" (1922), which Alla Nazimova
starred in and adapted from the 1894 Oscar Wilde play, but this time
it will be presented with a restored print from the George Eastman
House.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by Charles Bryant, it features sets and costumes designed
by Rudolph Valentino's second wife, Natacha Rambova, based on Aubrey
Beardsley's famous drawings from the first edition of the Wilde play.
Nazimova's Salome is a haughty, willful princess who lusts after an
exceptionally wraith-like John the Baptist.</TE>
<TE>   "Salome" is bizarre and highfalutin with its aura of stylized,
decadent chic, yet it strikingly anticipates the experimental exotica
made decades later by such underground filmmakers as Kenneth Anger.
Live musical accompaniment will be provided by Michael Mortilla.

<TE>   The Pan African Film Festival, which runs through Monday at the
Magic Johnson Theaters, presents tonight at 8:25 James Slocum's
appealing love story, "The Last Place on Earth," in which a chance
encounter transforms two people who initially clash. When banker Rob
Baskin (Dana Ashworth) gives stranded motorist Ann Field (Tisha
Campbell-Martin) a lift on his way to the High Sierra to spread his
late mother's ashes, the two have a tiff at a taco stand, but as time
passes they discover a surprising rapport. Their effect on each other
is unexpected, and it transforms every aspect of their lives,
especially their priorities, values and goals. Ashworth and
Campbell-Martin are entirely winning in a picture wise enough to
acknowledge that true love never runs smoothly. Look for Phyllis
Diller, Billy Dee Williams and Brock Peters in sharp cameos.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Johnson's "Yolngu Boy" (Saturday at 5:30 p.m.) is an acute
study of three Aboriginal youths, poised between boyhood and manhood
just as they are between their native heritage and modern society.
They embark on a journey through Australia's northeastern wilderness
to the city of Darwin, and their perilous quest requires that they
call upon ancient tribal ways to survive. "Yolngu Boy" is full of
adventure yet is unflinching in its depiction of the challenges
facing young Aboriginal males in the rites of passage. (213)

<LD>Seize the day, Charlie Brown.</LD>
<LD>   The little round-headed boy's feelings for the little red-haired
girl are stronger than ever during the Valentine season. But he just
can't work up the nerve to approach her in "A Charlie Brown
Valentine," tonight at 8 on ABC.</LD>
<LD>   This all-new show, the first in eight years, comes from the
creators of the other, now-classic "Peanuts" specials: executive
producer Lee Mendelson, producer-director Bill Melendez and the
cartoon's beloved creator, Charles M. Schulz, who was working on the
show before his death. Filled with gentle humor and quiet insight, it
arrives two years and two days after his passing--a keepsake
Valentine and a bittersweet reminder, rolled into one.</LD>
<TE>   The half-hour, animated program follows the romantic misadventures
of the whole "Peanuts" gang but focuses in particular on the
pint-sized Everyman, Charlie Brown, as he pines for the little
red-haired girl while letting opportunities to impress her--by
returning a dropped pencil or saving her from a playground
bully--slip through his fingers. At one point, he buys her a gift,
telling the unseen saleswoman: "I'd like to buy a box of candy for a
girl who doesn't know I exist. No, ma'am, nothing too expensive. I'll
never have the nerve to give it to her anyway."</TE>
<TE>   We know just how you feel, buddy.</TE>

<HD>A Heartfelt Hopkins in 'Atlantis' DVD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After eating people's brains in "Hannibal," Anthony Hop- kins plays a
much more benevolent character who may possess unique powers in the
nostalgic drama "Hearts in Atlantis," which arrived this week on DVD
(Warner, $25).</LD>
<LD>   Based on a story by Stephen King, the intimate drama directed by
Scott Hicks ("Shine") finds Hopkins as a sweet stranger who befriends
a fatherless 11-year-old boy (Anton Yelchin).</LD>
<LD>   The DVD includes a nice wide-screen transfer of the film, a stills
gallery and a fascinating interview with Hopkins conducted by the
soft-spoken Hicks. Dressed in a leather jacket and a white T-shirt,
Hopkins talks about his difficulties fitting in as a child in Wales,
especially the problems he encountered learning in school. He talks
about working with young Yelchin and how he never talks down to
children because he has always felt uncomfortable around them--even
his now-grown daughter. Hopkins tells Hicks about how he got involved
in acting and that, though he reads a script several times, he really
doesn't prepare for a role. He just shows up and says his lines, a
lesson Katharine Hepburn taught him on his first film, "A Lion in
Winter" (1968).</LD>
<TE>   Also included on the disc is Hicks' low-key but thoughtful
commentary.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Earl Jones is the perfect host for "Disney's American
Legends" (Disney, $20 for VHS; $30 for DVD), a collection of three
classic animated shorts and a brand-new one that bring to life the
legendary stories of Paul Bunyan, John Henry, Johnny Appleseed and
the Brave Engineer, Casey Jones. However, the sets used for Jones'
introductions are pretty cheesy.</TE>
<TE>   The tales of Bunyan, Appleseed and Casey Jones all previously
aired on "The Wonderful World of Disney," but "John Henry," about the
African American who helped build America's railroads in the 19th
century, will be seen before the new Disney feature "Return to
Neverland." Alfre Woodard narrates this inspiring short film.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD features a trivia game for the kids and Walt Disney's
introduction to the TV airing of "Johnny Appleseed."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jones also is the star of the entertaining 1976 baseball
comedy-drama "The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and Motor Kings,"
which chronicles the exploits of a barnstorming baseball team of
African American players in 1939 who are frustrated with the
dominance and bad business practices of the Negro National League.
Jones, who was about 10 years too old for the part, plays a character
modeled on famed Negro League slugger Josh Gibson. Billy Dee Williams
plays a pitcher who is based on Satchel Paige. And keep watching
Jones' waistline throughout the film--he lost about 30 pounds during
the production.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD (Universal, $20) includes a wide-screen version of the
film that is serviceable, production notes and breezy commentary from
John Badham, who made his directorial debut with the hit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Noted theater director Gregory Mosher (David Mamet's "Glengarry
Glen Ross") made his feature film directorial debut with "The Prime
Gig," an uneven but watchable thriller about scam artists. The DVD
(New Line, $25) of the film that saw very limited release includes
the option of wide-screen or full-screen but no commentary from
Mosher.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Vaughn stars as a small-time scam artist who teams up with a
legendary con man (Ed Harris) to sell shares in a gold mine. Julia
Ormond plays Harris' sexy associate who recruits Vaughn, seduces him
and then cons him. The acting is top-notch with Wallace Shawn,
Stephen Tobolowsky and George Wendt fine in support. The film,
though, loses steam when it shifts to the very R-rated love affair
between Vaughn and Ormond. Though it aspires to be a "Glengarry Glen
Ross"--which looked at crooked real estate agents--it lacks the bite
and dark humor of the Mamet play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine received best actor Academy
Award nominations for their delightful performances in the
entertaining 1972 mystery comedy "Sleuth," which has just arrived on
DVD thanks to Anchor Bay ($15).</TE>
<TE>   Adapted by Anthony Shaffer from his Tony Award-winning play,
"Sleuth" finds Olivier, who did receive the New York Film Critics
Circle honor for best actor, having a field day as a mystery writer
obsessed with games. He invites his wife's lover, a hairdresser named
Milo (Caine), over to his mansion for a little fun and games.
"Sleuth" was the last film directed by the great Joseph L. Mankiewicz
("All About Eve").</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a decent wide-screen transfer of the film, though
the sound quality is a bit uneven. There are two trailers and a
wonderful interview with Shaffer (who died last year at age 75). It
was composer Stephen Sondheim's love of games that inspired Shaffer
to write "Sleuth." He acknowledges that Olivier and Caine were not
his first choice for the roles and that Olivier, then 65, had a
horrible time remembering his lines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Over the past two years, the New York-based Broadway Theatre
Archives has been releasing on video restored vintage theater pieces
that aired on PBS and the three major networks. Now Image is
releasing several of the titles on DVD, including Sidney Lumet's
extraordinary version of Eugene O'Neill's 1939 masterwork "The Iceman
Cometh" ($25).</TE>
<TE>   Originally telecast in two parts in 1960 on what was public
television at the time, the 31/2-hour "Iceman Cometh" looks at the
pipe dreams and failed lives of a group of down-and-outers at a seedy
saloon.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Robards, who took New York by storm in the 1956
Circle-in-the-Square revival, is at the height of his acting powers
as the salesman Hickey. Myron McCormick, James Broderick, Tom Pedi
and Roland Winters also star. This production also introduced a
baby-faced 22-year-old Robert Redford to audiences. Redford turns in
a star-making performance as the weak-willed son of a convicted
revolutionary.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Oedekerk, who is currently starring in "Kung Pow: Enter the
Fist," is the writer and producer of "The Blair Thumb Project"
(Image, $10), the second in his Thumbnation series--movie spoofs
starring thumbs as the character. Last year, Image released the DVD
of "Thumb Wars." In this more silly than funny takeoff of "The Blair
Witch Project," three student filmmaker thumbs go into the woods
without a tripod to film a documentary about an urban legend.</TE>
<TE>   The disc includes trailers for "Thumbtanic" and "BatThumb,"
storyboards, outtakes and two different audio commentaries: "Sane,"
featuring Oedekerk and other crew members talking about the film, and
"Insane," which has to be heard to be believed.</TE>

<HD>Laguna Art Museum Is Losing a Curator</HD>
<DH>Tyler Stallings is leaving to make time for several
independent projects, including two books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VIVIAN LETRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laguna Art Museum announced Wednesday that its exhibitions curator
has resigned.</LD>
<LD>   Tyler Stallings, a recipient of the $50,000 Fellows of
Contemporary Art award, officially resigned Feb. 1. With personal
projects to complete, including two books, Stallings says he wants
the more flexible schedule that being an independent curator
allows."The main reason I'm deciding to move on is that I have all
these  things coming up, and I need the time to do them," Stallings
said.</LD>
<LD>   One book that Stallings is completing is titled "The Fiction of
Whiteness," a spinoff of his upcoming show, "Whiteness or Coloring
Authority," which looks at race and identity. It is scheduled to be
on exhibit at the Laguna Art Museum in 2003. Stallings' second book,
a novel titled "Womazon Winnie," is about a female wrestler, a
modern-day Amazon, who has to deal with her physique and how society
responds to her.</LD>
<TE>   Stallings, who was curator at the Huntington Beach Art Center from
1995 to 1999, when he began working at the Laguna Beach museum, will
continue to work with the Laguna institution as a guest curator to
complete three exhibitions: "Surf Culture--The Art History of
Surfing" in July, the "Whiteness" show scheduled for March 2003 and
"Some Fuzzy Logic: The Joan Simon Menkes Gift" in summer 2003. He
also plans to develop other shows for the museum as an independent
curator.</TE>
<TE>   "Tyler has been a great asset to this museum," said museum
director Bolton Colburn, who hired Stallings. "While we're sorry that
he will no longer be associated with the museum full-time, we are
fortunate to be able to work with him on future exhibitions."</TE>
<TE>   Interim exhibitions curator Susan M. Anderson, who served as
exhibitions curator, acting director and chief curator at Laguna
between 1989 and 1995 and is married to Colburn, will temporarily
oversee Stallings' duties and work with the museum's collections
curator Janet Blake.</TE>
<TE>   The museum will conduct a national search for a curator to replace
Stallings.</TE>

<LD>Compton is a peach-tinted city on pages 734 and 735 of the Thomas
Guide book of maps for L.A. County. It is boxed in by four
freeways--the 105, the 110, the 91 and the 710--and surrounded by
towns with idyllic names like Rosewood, Lynwood and Willowbrook.
Sweet Kevin Costner was born in Compton, and former President George
Bush used to sell drill bits to local oil companies there.</LD>
<LD>   Given the pleasant color of its map-book identity, as opposed to
the washed-out yellows and purples of the surrounding cities, and its
almost nest-like location amid the branches of four freeways, one
would suppose that Compton would exist among twittering birds and
blossoming trees. I'm sorry to report today, that's not so.</LD>
<LD>   The bellow of political rhetoric, like the roar of wounded
elephants, has chased all the birds from the skies and blown away the
blossoms that once adorned a city begun 135 years ago as a Methodist
temperance colony. And there's not a chance they'll be returning in
the near future.</LD>
<TE>   Among a variety of blowhards who have characterized Compton in
recent times, Omar Bradley is the most visible. It is Bradley who
emerges as the fist-shaking icon of a town with such a lousy
reputation that its name has been erased from sections of the
boulevard that run through adjoining cities.</TE>
<TE>   And now, thanks to a hocus-pocus court ruling, the self-proclaimed
"gangster mayor" has returned to power after a brief ouster. The
calamity is bound to continue.</TE>
<TE>   Those weary of the effluents that flow through politics may have
missed the events that have come to identify Compton. Briefly, one
Eric Perrodin, an L.A. County deputy district attorney, was elected
mayor of the city last June, beating Bradley by 281 votes, and
ostensibly ending the political career of the two-term incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   But old Omar, never a good loser, came charging back, not unlike
his namesake, the general in World War II, claiming that the election
was invalid. After a 10-week trial, which ended Friday, Superior
Court Judge Judith Chirlin said he was right and, to the surprise of
just about everyone, didn't call for another election, but restored
Bradley to power.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the sloppy process that bothered her, although that was
naughty too, and it wasn't the perjury committed during the trial
that bothered her, although it also got a good finger-shaking. It was
the technical makeup of the ballot that caused her to give the Bull
of Compton another shot at high office.</TE>
<TE>   We can thank an egghead from Ohio for that.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, candidates in a general election are supposed to
be listed on ballots in a "randomized" order determined by the
California secretary of state. The Compton city clerk failed to
request that determination and listed Perrodin's name first, the way
it had appeared on the primary election ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Krosnick, a political science professor from Ohio State
University, testified during the trial that being first, according to
his calculations, gives that candidate a 2.87% to 3.32% edge over the
others. That amounted to about 306 votes in the Compton election,
said the professor, which were enough to swing the election in
Perrodin's favor.</TE>
<TE>   It was on that basis that Chirlin, huffing with indignation,
overturned the will of the people with a stinging rebuke of City
Clerk Charles Davis, who, later admitting that errors had occurred,
commented, "You show me an election that's perfect, I'll show you a
fixed race." Good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Compton isn't a bad place to live. I strolled through the other
day and got a lot of pleasant hellos and good mornings from people
out walking their dogs the same way they walk 'em in Beverly Hills or
Encino. Well, yes, the dogs may be pit bulls and not fluffy little
Lhasa apsos, but that's a matter of bad taste and not an indication
of a prevailing killer instinct among the people.</TE>
<TE>   Compton's politics are something else. There were all kinds of
charges and counter-charges made in that last election, for instance,
including accusations of death threats. But what stood out for me was
the charge that Perrodin, cursing and using both hands, gave the
double-finger to firefighters at a polling place because they opposed
his election.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with the accusation in court, however, Perrodin replied, "I
didn't think I did two. I think I did one."</TE>
<TE>   By that measure, I suppose, the obscenity of the gesture is
reduced to an acceptable level of physical comment. This is not
unlike the day Bradley swung at Perrodin, but didn't connect, after a
City Council meeting dedicated to harmony. Police stopped him from
reaching Perrodin, but one can't help wondering what would have
happened had one of his roundhouses landed.</TE>
<TE>   A technical error, as seen through a legal microscope, might not
have saved him there.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin, who packs a permit-allowed gun, is vowing to appeal
Judge Chirlin's ruling. But would a gun-toting, one-finger-extended,
obscenity-shouting deputy D.A. be any better than the roaring,
fist-swinging, obscenity-shouting dude they're stuck with now?
Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever finally wins, one can say with reasonable certainty that
it's going to be a long time before the twittering birds start
thinking about returning to Compton.</TE>

<HD>Tips From a Matchmaker</HD>

<LD>Matchmaker Dianne Bennett is running late, held up by her
clients--two soul-mate seekers reluctant to be left alone on their
blind date at Arnie Morton's of Chicago. It's Monday night, just
three days shy of the lonely heart's longest day. She calms,
reassures and gets going. For Bennett, it's business as usual.</LD>
<LD>   This love doctor is more Mae West than blushing cherub. When she
enters a room, her white-blond mane, throaty laugh and forceful
personality get attention. "It's called being an opener," she said.
"I'm here! And life is fabulous!"</LD>
<LD>   Bennett is the owner of Dianne Bennett Matchmaker, Beautiful
Women/Successful Men, a service she founded in 1990. For a retainer
fee in "the thousands," Bennett will introduce men to the women they
choose from Bennett's photographs of eligible models, actresses and
heiresses. She won't name names, but boasts a client list of several
"movie stars," a brain surgeon, two college presidents, a lottery
winner and an Asian head of state. ("Do you know how many unhappy
billionaires there are?" she asks.)</LD>
<TE>   This night appears to be short on billionaires and heiresses. But
Bennett dutifully treks from the date in West Hollywood to a Sherman
Oaks party, where a modest crowd of young, mostly single
professionals are doing their best to mingle over paper plates full
of homemade pasta. Bennett is there to size them up. "Somebody is
going to be a client," she says confidently.</TE>
<TE>   She's greeted with hugs and kisses and immediately is introduced
to an eligible young plastic surgeon. She coos when she hears his
profession, but doesn't linger.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett herself has had a number of professions: Beverly Hills
meter maid, assistant to TV gossip reporter Rona Barrett, caustic
music-industry gossip columnist for the Hollywood Reporter.</TE>
<TE>   Now Bennett works the city's constant parade of movie premieres,
celebrity charity balls and nightclub openings with a different
mission, but a well-practiced technique that might well serve as
advice to others looking to make a match. "You stand by the bar and
you smile until you think your teeth are going to drop out of your
mouth," she says. "You will meet people!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Many Ways</TE>
<TE>   to Warm a Heart</TE>
<TE>   What do women want? According to a poll by Sherman Oaks shopping
mall Fashion Square, mere chocolate won't do. Baubles, clothes and
lingerie top the Valentine's wish list, the purveyor of baubles,
clothes and lingerie found.</TE>
<TE>   Nellie Seddigh, director of Tiffany on Rodeo Drive in Beverly
Hills, is not surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very, very busy around Valentine's Day," she said. "I'm not
saying it because I'm with the company," she added, hesitating, "but
that little blue box does make hearts beat faster." Looking for
furious palpitations? Last week, a customer bought a $270,000 emerald
necklace, Seddigh said. "The message is unique."</TE>
<TE>   *      Heidi's Off the List</TE>
<TE>   Worried Catholics can rest assured that dinner with Heidi Fleiss
will not be on the list of auction items at a Los Angeles area
Catholic high school fund-raiser, as had previously been planned. The
principal of that private school (the name of which must remain
anonymous to protect the innocent) nixed the idea this week after it
raised concerns among parents as well as officials at the Los Angeles
Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   As we reported Friday, the highest bidder at a high school auction
was to win dinner for 10 at Halie in Pasadena with Fleiss and
boyfriend Tom Sizemore, along with a gift basket that included
Fleiss' signature underwear and a copy of her new book.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese officials were so concerned about the auction that
they polled officials at their 57 secondary schools to make sure the
former Hollywood madam was not a scheduled dinner guest there, a
spokesman said. (She wasn't.)</TE>
<TE>   Fleiss, who was released from federal prison in 1999 after serving
21 months for money laundering and tax evasion, was disappointed to
learn she had been dropped as an auction prize. "I wasn't trying to
put myself out there to offend anyone," she said. "I was just trying
to raise money for school ... [but] some people will always view me
as the antichrist."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Less Than a Ghost</TE>
<TE>   of a Chance</TE>
<TE>   You're more likely to see a female ghost or angel on prime-time TV
than a Hispanic or Native American woman, says a study being
circulated by the National Organization for Women.</TE>
<TE>   The 2001 study, by Martha Lauzen of San Diego State University,
found that otherworldly characters such as ghosts and angels
constituted 3% of the female characters shown during prime-time,
while Hispanics constituted only 2% and Native Americans 0.2%.</TE>

<HD>The Quest for Fire</HD>
<DH>What does a guy have to do to get a girlfriend before Feb.
14? You have no idea.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I now have 71 potential wives, all scientifically selected to match
my personality. If I lived in Utah or Saudi Arabia, this would be
perfectly acceptable, but under existing federal law, I have to
narrow it down to just one.</LD>
<LD>   My fiancee collection started around Labor Day, when an on-again,
off-again relationship of four years went permanently off. My
girlfriend said she didn't want to get married, so I released her
back into the wild.</LD>
<LD>   To find a replacement, I decided to test some of the myriad dating
"systems" available. And so, in the name of science, I subjected
myself to five months' worth of seminars, tapes, computer
matchmaking, "speed dating" and even a mass blind date aboard the
Queen Mary. (Or was it the Titanic? I couldn't tell.)</LD>
<TE>   The purpose was to see if a bachelor reporter could find true love
before Valentine's Day. Sparing no expense, The Times authorized a
$283 budget.</TE>
<TE>   As a guy, I faced an immediate disadvantage because men don't have
magazines like Cosmo to guide us with such articles as "Spanky
Panky," "Majoring in Seduction" and "Tips to Manage a Man Monsoon."</TE>
<TE>   So I had to seek courtship advice from another authoritative
source: supermarket tabloids. Luckily, I hit the jackpot. The Weekly
World News taught me how to "Get Any Gal You Want By Listening to
Barry Manilow!" According to the article, "Men who favor the bland
musical stylings of artists such as Barry Manilow, Kenny G, John Tesh
and Yanni are significantly more attractive to women, no matter how
fat, ugly or stupid the guys are."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, I located the world's most effective pickup lines,
including: "You must be Jamaican because Jamaican me crazy," "Here I
am. What were your other two wishes?" and "Hi, the voices in my head
told me to come talk with you."</TE>
<TE>   To my astonishment, none of these techniques worked. Fortunately,
I had backup plans. Next on my list was a $25 seminar on "What Women
Want," hosted by an effervescent dating coach named Renee Piane.</TE>
<TE>   Although I hoped for the best, I sensed doom as soon as the first
panelist introduced herself. "I'm a vital energist," she said. Her
co-panelists also marched to different drummers. They included a pair
of "spiritual practitioners" from the New Age-ish Agape Church of
Religious Science, a chiropractor, a cartoon coach and a mosaic
artist.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, moderator Piane's background seemed almost normal.
Well, maybe "normal" is too strong a word. In 1989, she flitted
around town in an angel costume, "sprinkling blessings of love." She
even accosted then-Mayor Tom Bradley at a black-tie function, asking
him to name her "the official angel of L.A."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such eccentricities, the seminar was entertaining and
occasionally offered flashes of insight. But, overall, I'm not sure
the panel represented a broad cross-section of women. For that, they
would have needed more people from Planet Earth.</TE>
<TE>   My next stop was a "rapid dating" event sponsored by "Queen
of Fun" LeeAnn Webster, a lawyer who founded Single Solutions, a club
that organizes mixers for "high-quality singles" in L.A., Newport
Beach and Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of rapid dating originated with a Los Angeles rabbi.
Others have adapted the gimmick.</TE>
<TE>   Here's the drill: You talk with each "date" for five to seven
minutes, then a bell rings. You jot down whether you liked the person
and rotate to the next date. By evening's end, you've met 15 people,
most of whom are a blur, which is why you have to keep track of
everyone on paper. Finally, you turn in your list of favorites. If
any choose you too, the organizers forward contact information the
next day.</TE>
<TE>   Some liken the process to musical chairs, but I found it more akin
to Russian roulette. For example, one date demanded to know how I
would have handled the events of Sept. 11 if I were President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sorry; I thought this was a dating event, not an interview for
the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   When I later joked about the Sept. 11 question to another date, a
surfer named Heidi, she too grilled me on my national defense
policies: "As a citizen in a democracy, don't you think you should
know the answer to that question?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, now that you mention it, Heidi, I do think it would enhance
national security to imprison all surfers named after a certain Swiss
orphan girl.</TE>
<TE>   My other dates that night included a tennis fan who refused to ask
any questions, a woman whose name tag said "Dog Bite" and a mother
hoping to meet an adult version of her teenage son.</TE>
<TE>   The mom was too Oedipal for my tastes, but I liked Ms. Bite. It
turned out she had just attended a Notre Dame football game, where
she was chomped on the lip by a puppy. She alluded to the incident on
her name tag to keep guys from thinking the blemish on her mouth was
a communicable disease.</TE>
<TE>   I added "Dog Bite" to my list of favorites and was pleasantly
surprised the next day when Single Solutions said we were a match. I
sent her a short e-mail: "I'm not sure what the protocol is for a
rapid-dating match. Do we advance from a five-minute conversation to
10 minutes? My vote is to meet for lunch."</TE>
<TE>   She said that sounded great and asked me to call later in the
week, which I did, but I never heard back. So I had to assume the
wound on her lip developed into a fatal case of gangrene. Or maybe,
because she was a friend of Single Solutions owner Webster, she
agreed to be my (only) match to avoid adverse publicity about rapid
dating.</TE>
<TE>   Oh well. Even if something had worked out, I still wouldn't
recommend the Jiffy Lube approach to dating. As one woman at the
mixer noted, five minutes is enough time to decide if you're not
interested in someone (based on looks), but it's too short to figure
out if you are interested (based on emotional and intellectual
compatibility, which takes longer to assess).</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, the trend seems to be toward
ever-shorter encounters. A Chicago company just introduced three-minute
dating. And the next step is probably "police lineup dating," where single
men and women are lined up like suspects and you identify which
one(s) you'd like to date from behind a one-way windowpane.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid dating probably works best for people who make great first
impressions, which isn't my strong suit. Although my visage doesn't
cause villagers to rise up with torches and pitchforks, neither does
it land me any modeling jobs. And I'm usually too tongue-tied around
strangers (especially cute ones) to sweep anyone off her feet in five
minutes. My personality is the kind that grows on people over time.
Like moss.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it was time to go digital. At first, I resisted. Even
though I could justify an online personal as "journalistic research,"
in the back of my mind a big neon sign was flashing: "LOSER!"
Curiously, several single women friends and co-workers--all gorgeous
and intelligent--confided that they were envious because I had "a
cover" for trying online matchmaking. But the "loser" stigma loomed
large.</TE>
<TE>   What tipped the balance for me was a London Times article that
said even Mel Gibson hired a matchmaker to find the woman who later
became his wife.</TE>
<TE>   Online, there are reams of services to choose from, some catering
to very specific clientele, including scientists, vegetarians,
Stanford graduates, Goths, Iranians, transsexuals, bikini-clad
Russians, millionaires, atheists, Christians, Italian Americans,
soldiers, the overweight and "men and women from the Indian
subcontinent."</TE>
<TE>   I initially tried Match.com, one of the largest services, but it
did a lousy job of tailoring matches to my criteria. So I chose a
service geared to Catholic singles, called--what
else--Catholicsingles.com.</TE>
<TE>   Most online matchmakers are similar. You choose an alias (like
Cahuenga, a street name that always cracks me up), embellish your
vital statistics (age 43, height 5-foot-10, weight 150, eyes green,
hair disappearing), and list your favorite movies ("Groundhog Day,"
"Field of Dreams," "Amelie"), books ("One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest"), music (no Manilow; just Sheryl Crow, Dylan, Beatles, REM,
Shelby Lynne), foods (Italian and Mexican) and hobbies.</TE>
<TE>   Posting photos is optional. I didn't because I never got around to
buying a scanner--and because I feared someone I know would see it
and make the "loser" label official. Pictures reportedly increase
traffic to your profile, but even as a faceless knight in shining
e-mail, I fared OK on the site, which cost $9.95 a month after a free
30-day trial. The essays and profiles provided a decent portrait of
potential soul mates. And I managed to strike up a few e-mail
exchanges and even go out to dinner with a TV producer. Had a fine
time, but I'm not sure we clicked in person. Then again, I can be
pretty clueless at interpreting females.</TE>
<TE>   And so my search continued.</TE>
<TE>   Author Philippa Courtney sent me her cassette tape seminar on "4
Steps to Bring the Right Person Into Your Life Right Now!" But I
barely got into the second tape before pressing the eject button. I
want no part of a system that requires me to chant, meditate or
visualize my perfect mate into existence. If I thought that would
work, I'd visualize a winning lottery ticket and marry Anna Nicole
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   I also attended a seminar by Alexander Avila, author of "Love
Types," a dating method based on the Myers-Briggs personality test.
His presentation was lively and fun--and he made some interesting
points--but I've never put much stock in the Myers-Briggs test, which
tries to lump all humans into just 16 personality types. And Avila's
adaptation seems even shakier, since it relies on a skimpy
28-question test.</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, he also has a new program for shyness, which
employs "a unique blend of improvisational acting, martial arts and
cognitive-behavioral psychology." So if someone turns you down for a
date, I guess you can karate chop them into submission.</TE>
<TE>   In general, it's tough to take dating books and seminars very
seriously. Although most contain at least a shred of wisdom, they're
not gospel. Nobody has a magic formula for finding love. Or do they?</TE>
<TE>   From the 11th floor of a Pasadena office tower, Neil Clark Warren
oversees Eharmony.com, a strange hybrid of Pentium processors and pop
psychology. Warren, 67, has been counseling singles and couples for
35 years. He's done "Oprah" and "Politically Incorrect." But unlike
fellow relationship gurus John Gray and Barbara De Angelis, who have
correspondence-school PhDs and multiple marriages (including to each
other), Warren is Princeton-educated and has been wed 42 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, he wrote "How to Find the Love of Your Life," a modest
bestseller. His thesis: Opposites attract at first, but over the long
haul, they typically want to strangle each other. Better to marry
someone a lot like yourself.</TE>
<TE>   There was just one hitch. Where to find this doppelganger? On the
lecture circuit, people beseeched Warren for help. And that led to
Eharmony. Before launching the site, Warren performed "autopsies" on
400 marriages--half miserable, half happy--to find out what made the
difference between success or failure. He settled on 29 factors, such
as intelligence, ambition, energy level and moral values. Then he
devised a one-hour online test to measure for all 29 and match people
accordingly.</TE>
<TE>   Next, he did something unheard of in online matchmaking. He rigged
the communication process to have matches get acquainted "from the
inside out." That means not starting with photos and favorite-movie
lists. Those come later. Looks and chemistry are important, Warren
said, but too often they cloud people's judgment.</TE>
<TE>   As one Eharmony client from Canada confessed to me: "I would not
have chosen [my fiance] if I had seen his photo right away. But when
you get to know someone from the inside first, they look different to
you." In March, she and her match will become Eharmony's 46th
marriage in its 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   Impressed, I decided to give it a shot. Although the six-month
plan set me back $149, in no time flat I racked up dozens of
potential wives. Alas, most have spurned my advances. Although anyone
can take the personality test and receive free matches, they can't
correspond with those matches until they pay. Of the 205,000 singles
registered in Eharmony's database, only 35,000 are paid members.</TE>
<TE>   The progression from match to matrimony begins with a round of
multiple-choice questions that range from the innocuous (Would you
rather meet Thomas Jefferson or Frank Sinatra?) to the intense (How
do you feel about living together before marriage?). After that, you
trade lists of "must haves" and "can't stands," although the choices
are so universal (must have chemistry, can't stand lying) that the
exercise is somewhat meaningless. From there, things heat up with
essay questions. In the final phase, you can e-mail back and forth
without restraint--and swap photos.</TE>
<TE>   Eharmony is the most intriguing concept I ran across, but I do see
flaws. Some of my matches seemed so out of sync with me that I
eventually retook the personality test, a step that Eharmony allows
when clients feel mismatched. But even after that, I'm not sure the
test has me pegged quite right.</TE>
<TE>   Warren has heard this before. "You may start to think, 'I thought
these people were supposed to be compatible with me!'" says an
Eharmony advisory. "They are compatible with you. They match your
organization, creativity . . . political values and verbal intimacy
skills. But your job is to determine if they match your hobbies and
interests [and] whether there is chemistry."</TE>
<TE>   OK, that eliminates the woman who said the most influential person
in her life was "the songs of John Denver."</TE>
<TE>   Warren insists the personality test is 90% reliable, but admits
compromises were made to keep it breezy enough for the notoriously
short attention span of most Internet surfers. For example,
intelligence is measured with only four questions, all self-rated. I
sympathize with the attention-span dilemma, but I'd wager people
would gladly spend several hours on a questionnaire if they knew it
would truly help find a soul mate.</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, at least for dudes, Eharmony is the "Surf
City" of matchmakers. Like the Jan &amp; Dean song, it has "two girls for
every boy." And the psychological test is designed to weed out people
who are "not emotionally ready," which further improves the gene
pool. I was also pleased that most of my matches were Catholic, even
though the denomination accounts for just 14% of Eharmony's
membership.</TE>
<TE>   But I can't say I found a valentine. I'm in negotiation stages
with several promising prospects, but I have yet to ink any deals.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me to the final dating experiment. On Friday, in a
last-ditch effort to find a valentine, I boarded the Queen Mary for a
mass blind date sponsored by the Grunion Gazette, a Long Beach
newspaper. Now in its 14th year, the event attracts about 2,000
singles at $30 apiece, with proceeds going to cardiac programs at
three hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   I must say it was everything I dreamed it would be. And by
"dream," I mean "nightmare." That's not a slam on the event itself,
which was fine. I'm simply not good at mingling in crowds. However,
in the interest of science, I dutifully affixed a match number to my
lapel--No. 294--and aimlessly wandered the tri-level hall.</TE>
<TE>   The matchmaking process was somewhat haphazard. Advance
registrants filled out a short questionnaire (vital stats, hobbies,
smoking preference, religion) and then a team of volunteers sifted
through the info before the event to assign matches. "We see some of
the same people year after year," said organizer Simon Grieves.</TE>
<TE>   Once aboard the Love Boat, there were big boards with all the
match numbers, so you could see if your "date" had arrived. And
volunteer cupids roamed the hall to help matches find each other. One
pour soul was taking no chances. He spent most of the evening sitting
at a table by the boards, anxiously waiting for his match to check
in. "Last year, I couldn't find the person because I did too much
walking around," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, guests bought drinks, danced to live music and placed
silent-auction bids on handcrafted his and hers golf putters ("a $440
value"), Cirque du Soleil tickets, a dog-grooming session and a trip
to New York.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the long odds, some people do disembark with a successful
match.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, I wasn't one of them. At least not that night. While I sat
at a table, commiserating with a Times photographer, a woman
approached and said her friend had my match number: "But she's not
here. She had a family emergency. But she's really great." So I
pulled out a business card and asked her to have the friend call.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the mystery date left a message at work. A slight drawl
and pleasant manner. But at press time, we were still playing phone
tag. That doesn't bode well for this Valentine's Day, but who knows
about the next.</TE>

<HD>Setting the Valentine Scene</HD>
<DH>Sensuous furnishings can turn the home into a romantic
playground for this day of lovers, or all year-round.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY BRYANT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Think outside the chocolate box this Valentine's Day with sensuous
design for the home. As Ilse Crawford says in her book "The Sensuous
Home" (Rizzoli International Publications, 1998), "the home is our
emotional heartland, a place where the rhythm of events is under our
control, a potential pleasure zone for our sensuous being. The very
word 'home,' derived from the Old Norse heima, describes a state of
being as well as a physical place."</LD>
<LD>   Lightly scented candles, soft pillows and subdued lighting are the
usual ways to make a home more romantic. But here are four other
possibilities to enjoy year-round.</LD>
<LD>   "Fred and Ginger dancing together is a romantic icon. They
mirrored each other in the fluid way they moved," says Palm Springs
furniture designer Mark Newman.</LD>
<TE>   "After I created my multi-function table, where a
cocktail-table-height table slips into an armchair-height one, I
decided to call the design after them. To me it fits perfectly
because the table has classic details, like tapering legs and
scalloped, fluted details, and is a Moderne throwback reminiscent of
the interior design in old Fred and Ginger movies."</TE>
<TE>   Newman admits that he watches those old movies for design
inspiration, since many of their sets were done by important
designers of the time. The "Fred and Ginger" nesting table, which
comes in five finishes, retails for $3,300 and is available at Thomas
Lavin, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Poppy," by German designers Ulrich Beckert, Georg Soanca-Pollack
and Peter Thammer, is a lamp that looks like a curvy piece of
sculpture, with a mouth-blown glass shade, flexible hose and
cloth-covered metal base. When it's turned on, the magic begins.
Slowly, the reflector leaves open, turning the lamp into a flower
within about 30 seconds. "I love this lamp for its whimsy," says Pia
Deleon, co-owner of Plug on Melrose. "The metal on the petals is a
bicarbon that is heat-activated. That's why it blooms." "Poppy" is
available at Plug for $468.</TE>
<TE>   Art furniture designer Christopher Royal finds humor in romance in
his "Loveseat." Royal began by designing miniature chair sculptures
in the early 1990s, and his small versions became so popular that in
the fall of 1998 his miniature designs were translated into full-size
furniture. "Loveseat" is made from brushed aluminum and has a velvet
seat.</TE>
<TE>   "Couples come into the showroom and immediately want to sit on
it," says Cantoni Inc. manager Richard Pabon. "It definitely gets an
emotional response." The chair, available at Cantoni in Irvine,
retails for $2,139.</TE>
<TE>   A more traditional home accessory for Valentine's Day is a
heart-shaped silver box with a mother-of-pearl or black-lip shell
flip-top. "I found this in Bali when I was there at Christmas," says
Liza Robinson Vidal, vice president at Warisan. "We don't usually do
seasonal things, but I particularly liked this box because it has a
simple, understated shape and isn't too frilly."</TE>
<TE>   It retails for $110 at Warisan in Los Angeles and Corona del Mar.</TE>

<HD>Designers Dish Up Some Whimsy</HD>
<DH>Architects bring contemporary flair to the tabletop in a
line of dinnerware called NotNeutral.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Back when architect Mark Rios designed Rock in Marina del Rey, the
spinoff of chef Hans Rockenwagner's eponymous  restaurant in Santa
Monica, Rios steeped the ceiling and walls in cobalt blue, then
splashed on crayon-bright yellow and orange accents. But the plan to
leave no salad plate or soup bowl uncolored hit a snag.</LD>
<LD>   "We did the interiors, graphics, logo, menu, everything," Rios
says. "But when it came to picking the dinnerware, most of what was
available was bland, plain, white and blah. The biggest design
statement was maybe a little blue trim around the edge of a platter.
So we designed all the tableware, too."</LD>
<LD>   Two years after serving up exuberant color and pattern on the
dishes at Rock, Rios and his colleagues at Rios Associates have
translated that experience into their own line of hip, distinctive
and affordable housewares named, appropriately enough, NotNeutral. So
far, the fledgling foray into home accessories includes five-piece
table settings ($64), serving platters and bowls ($36 each), vases
($18) and coasters that double as condiment dishes ($18 for four),
plus cotton table runners and Ultrasuede pillows.</LD>
<TE>   "We've always been a soup-to-nuts operation, doing an entire
project from the building to the interiors to the landscape," says
Julie Smith, an architect with the firm and president of NotNeutral.
"Branching out like this, into a kind of one-stop home design source,
was only natural."</TE>
<TE>   On top of introducing a new dinnerware collection every season,
Rios foresees expanding the furniture offerings beyond the initial
black-lacquered wood beds, end tables and coffee tables, as well as
developing NotNeutral's own selection of candles, soaps and bed and
bath linens.</TE>
<TE>   To showcase the growing line, Rios has opened a NotNeutral retail
store in front of his design studio on 3rd Street, between Fairfax
Avenue and Crescent Heights Boulevard. The glassed-in showroom, a
space once occupied by his conference room, is painted in a crisp,
contemporary black-white-and-lavender format, with merchandise
arranged front and center on pristine white display shelves.</TE>
<TE>   As for the NotNeutral designs themselves, there's no mistaking
them for your grandmother's Blue Willow china. The first collection,
dubbed Links, features bold circular motifs reminiscent of a bicycle
chain. The abstract pattern appears variously as a single image or
repeated images, sometimes centered and symmetrical, sometimes not.
Links comes in high-contrast black and white or brown and white.</TE>
<TE>   The second collection, Circuits, was inspired by the tracery found
on circuit boards. The geometric pattern consists of overlapping
rectangles and lines and is available in a striking purple-and-green
palette; a lavender-and-blue version is due out this spring.</TE>
<TE>   All of the dinnerware is restaurant-weight, microwave- and
dishwasher-safe white porcelain manufactured in Poland. The
NotNeutral designs--a creative collaboration between Rios, Smith,
graphic designer Frank Clementi and others at Rios Associates--are
reproduced on decals made in Japan. The decals are applied to the
porcelain and fired by a company in Santa Maria.</TE>
<TE>   Rios and Smith acknowledge that Circuits and Links might strike
some as retro, much like the shapely vases of ceramist Jonathan Adler
or the color-field pillows of textile designer Angela Adams. Yet they
insist that resurrecting the past was never their plan. Says Smith:
"We were definitely influenced by the British tableware called
Midwinter pottery, particularly what Terence Conran designed during
the late '50s, and its nontraditional use of pattern on ceramics. But
NotNeutral is about now. The designs are drawn from our time."</TE>
<TE>   Rios believes NotNeutral fills an important gap in today's
housewares market. "The dishes at Crate &amp; Barrel, Pottery Barn and
Williams-Sonoma are all very similar. You could walk in any of those
stores blindfolded and not be able to tell one from the other," he
says. "We're more about spirited fun, color and pattern, a sense of
humor."</TE>
<TE>   High style needn't mean high prices, he adds. "Calvin Klein and
Armani are a different audience. We're more like Martha Stewart at
Kmart and Michael Graves at Target. Though our prices are on par with
Crate &amp; Barrel and Pottery Barn, we're trying to have mass-market
appeal."</TE>
<TE>   Toward that end, Rios has struck a deal to create a separate line
of housewares that will be sold exclusively on HSN, formerly known as
Home Shopping Network, starting this spring. That porcelain will be
produced in Bangladesh and bear completely different NotNeutral
designs, and prices will be somewhat lower.</TE>
<TE>   Rios considers both lines opportunities to inject a little whimsy
into consumers' daily lives. "I want people to know that they don't
have to buy a set of dishes and feel like those are the only dishes
they can ever have for the rest of their lives," he says. "This is
everyday stuff. It's OK to change it out and buy something new for
spring or fall. It's the convergence of Eastern and Western tabletop
ideas. With NotNeutral, you can mix and match pieces the way you see
them in a great Japanese restaurant."</TE>
<TE>   So what's next on NotNeutral's plate? "I'd love to do a whole line
of other products--umbrellas, beach ware like chairs, towels,
blankets," Rios says. "I'd also like to create paperware for the
table. And we're in discussions with Blenko about the possibility of
designing a line of glassware."</TE>
<TE>   Today the tabletop; tomorrow the world.</TE>

<LD>COMMUNION</LD>
<LD>   The Female Search for Love</LD>
<LD>   By bell hooks</LD>
<TE>   William Morrow</TE>
<TE>   256 Pages, $24.95</TE>
<TE>   A philosopher, intellectual and writer, bell hooks has never been
afraid to tackle difficult subjects, whether they be the differences
in feminist thought and practice between white women and women of
color, the convergence of race, class and gender in the movies or her
difficult childhood. Across a publishing career that spans almost 15
years and 20 books, hooks has consistently challenged conventional
ways of thinking and being while attempting to illuminate the
everyday lives of a legion of women.</TE>
<TE>   Although usually touching on love in her books and essays, hooks
did not write her first book-length exploration of the topic until
2000's "All About Love." Part self-exploration, part critical
analysis of popular self-help books, "All About Love" was a general
discussion of love in American life and culture, from familial love
to romantic attachments. It laid the groundwork for a second volume,
last year's "Salvation," which critiqued the ways in which African
Americans are victims and perpetrators of rigid, patriarchal modes of
love that repress their humanity and capacity for emotional
connection. The third book in what has become a trilogy, "Communion"
extends the themes of the first two by considering the challenges and
rewards of loving in midlife.</TE>
<TE>   Though discussions of love by feminists might strike some readers
as an oxymoron, hooks is the perfect person to synthesize a
generation's worth of scholarship, self-help books and women's
personal experiences on the subject of self-development, intimate
relationships and love. For hooks, the beginning of understanding the
tremendous opportunity women have to love is to acknowledge the debt
women owe to the feminist or women's liberation movement. "By
challenging sexist ways of thinking about the body," hooks asserts,
"feminism offered new standards of beauty, telling us plump bodies
were luscious and big bellies sublime.... It created new
possibilities of self-actualization in both our work lives and our
intimate lives." And though many can remember the gains achieved
during the feminist movement regarding equal pay for equal work or a
woman's right to control her body, few recall the battle for equality
in loving relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for the reader, hooks does and recounts, through personal
experiences in consciousness-raising sessions and the bedroom, her
intellectual and sexual awakening during the women's movement that
seems almost like an Everywoman story for certain groups of
college-educated baby boomers. A Southern Baptist girl away from home
at Stanford University, hooks was dazzled by the heady atmosphere of
questioning and experimentation that went along with the feminist
movement of the 1970s, especially when it came to love. "Radical
feminism encouraged women to question our obsession with love," hooks
remembers. "In extreme cases, individual women urged us to forget
love and get into power." And though feminism had its greatest
triumphs in the workplace, it is on an emotional level that hooks
believes feminism failed to show ways that women and men could throw
off male-dominated modes of thinking and relating to each other to
embrace fuller, more authentic relationships.  "Communion," then, is
hooks' quest to get at the root causes for the lack of intimate,
loving relationships between women and their partners and find ways
in which women can break the cycle of thinking that has retarded
their emotional growth. In addition to chapters that emphasize coming
to terms with and loving oneself "right where you are," hooks does a
masterful job in critiquing the envy among women (mothers, daughters
and friends) that destroys their self-esteem and capacity for
trusting relationships as well as the ways in which some men's
emotional withholding and distancing are barriers to true intimacy.</TE>
<TE>   Equally important and moving are chapters that explore the search
by women at midlife for partners to love and the importance of
platonic "romantic friendships" that help extend the circle of love
beyond an all-consuming, primary connection.</TE>
<TE>   In an era when Americans are reassessing the meaning and value of
the great social movements (civil rights, women's rights, gay rights)
and what they have to teach future generations, pioneering feminist
hooks' insights on the appropriate place of love in women's lives
comes as a refreshing tonic in a discourse that has grown stale and
bitter between men and women and between the generations. Call it a
midlife manifesto or just a thought-provoking read, "Communion" is a
thinking woman's (and man's) valentine--more nourishing than candy,
more enduring than the floweriest language Hallmark has to offer--and
a fitting conclusion to hooks' groundbreaking work on love in
American life.</TE>

<LD>   In the shade near the coast, tuberous begonias provide the
brightest colors and biggest flowers. One way to plant is from tubers
available now. Start them in a flat filled with soil amendment,
leaving the upper half above the soil. Transplant them when they have
a few leaves. 'Non stop' varieties have slightly smaller flowers but
bloom well into fall.</LD>

<LD>Candy and Sweets</LD>
<LD>   Hi, kids. Happy Valentine's Day! I'm Pyramid Pal, and I just love
this day. It is so much fun to give valentines to my friends. And I
like to get them, too. As nutrition champion of kids, I am here to
tell you a little bit about the candy and sweets that you will
probably eat today.</LD>
<LD>   Candy and sweets are part of a group of foods in the Food Guide
Pyramid called fats, oils and sweets. This group sits way at the top
of the pyramid and also includes other kid-favorite foods like soft
drinks, cookies, cakes and chips. It is different from the other food
groups of the pyramid, and it is important to understand the
difference. Do you know why this group is different?</LD>
<TE>   When a food sits at the top of the Food Guide Pyramid, it means
that your body only needs a tiny amount of that food. Foods at the
top have only small amounts of nutrients and usually lots of
calories. The calories of these foods are often called "empty"
because they provide mainly fat and simple carbohydrates for quick
energy, but few other really important nutrients.</TE>
<TE>   Foods in the other groups--grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy and
meat, poultry, fish--all give you more nutrients than foods in the
fats, oils and sweets group. A nutrient is something that your body
needs to live and grow. Carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals,
fats (not too much) and water are some of the important nutrients
your body needs.</TE>
<TE>   With sugary foods, the Food Guide Pyramid tells you to eat
sparingly, meaning only a little bit or not very often. To help you
remember this important fact, try this funny little rhyme I wrote:</TE>
<TE>   With candy and sweets and sugary treats,</TE>
<TE>   I promise myself I won't overeat.</TE>
<TE>   Eating less of these foods, it is my plan,</TE>
<TE>   Eating smart as a kid, I know I can!</TE>
<TE>   Authors' note: The Food Guide Pyramid was introduced by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture and the U. S. Department of Health and
Human Services in 1992.</TE>

<HD>The Day the Dragon Danced</HD>
<DH>Part 4 The story so far: Grandma and grandson have gone to
the Chinese New Year's Parade to see the dragon dance. But Charles is
getting impatient to see it really dance.</DH>

<LD>I watched the dragon's feet carefully. It had white shoes with black
trim, black shoes with white trim, white shoes with red trim, black
shoes with red trim, red shoes with black trim, plain black shoes,
plain white shoes and even plain red shoes.</LD>
<LD>   What a long, long, long dragon he was. His bright red, green and
yellow cloth back curved like a really long parasol held up by poles.</LD>
<LD>   The cymbals crashed again, but he couldn't keep time. Some of his
feet came down before the drum. Some came down after. The dragon was
not dancing. He was stumbling. I watched the shoes carefully.</LD>
<TE>   Boom! Boom! Boom! went the drums. The dragon's back went up, and
his back went down. But it was bumpy, not smooth like a dragon should
be. Gongs clanged, drums banged, feet went up, feet went down--all at
the wrong times.</TE>
<TE>   "Why doesn't he dance, Grandma? He isn't even walking very well,
and I can't tell which shoes ..." I frowned at Grandma. She frowned
back.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," I said, "all his feet are doing different things."</TE>
<TE>   Then the dragon stopped. His tail was right beside us, and there I
saw Daddy's shoes. Now I remembered. He had red shoelaces. They were
dragging on the pavement. All the feet went up and down in place.
"Look, Grandma, there are Daddy's shoes, and his laces are untied."</TE>
<TE>   "Run quick," Grandma said. "Go tie them."</TE>
<TE>   Running into the street I slipped under the dragon and tied
Daddy's shoelaces. Then, quickly I smiled at Daddy, and he smiled at
me.</TE>
<TE>   Both of his hands were on a stick holding up the dragon's tail.
His mouth said thanks, but he made no sound. When I ran back to the
curb, the dragon started again. The fringe on his body shook as if he
was getting ready to do something.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will the dragon be able to dance now?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kay Haugaard loves Chinese dragons. Their bright colors and
dancing make her happy. This story will be on The Times' Web site at

<LD>In the jittery aftermath of Sept. 11, city officials ordered streets
near Los Angeles City Hall closed to traffic and installed concrete
barricades and checkpoint kiosks. Five months later, the nation
continues to wage war against shadowy enemies. The FBI warned law
enforcement agencies and the public just Tuesday of another possible
attack, the fourth such alert in as many months. So is this the time
to reopen the streets, as City Controller Laura Chick and some City
Council members suggest?</LD>
<LD>   Yes, although not because the threat has gone away. What's changed
is that there's been time to think rather than just react, to weigh
risks and consider where to allocate always-scarce resources.</LD>
<LD>   No one is suggesting a return to "normal," at least not to the
casual sense of invulnerability we once had. Before Sept. 11, Los
Angeles City Hall security was decidedly relaxed in comparison with
that of New York and many other cities. San Francisco, for example,
has high security that dates back at least to 1978, when Mayor George
Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk were murdered by a disgruntled
former supervisor, a reminder that threats are not limited to foreign
terrorists.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles has, as it should, joined these and other cities in
requiring employees and visitors to pass through metal detectors.
City workers have to display ID cards. More security guards patrol
the hallways. Sidewalk barricades line the building's perimeter. (If
the sidewalk barricades are going to be permanent, how about
something a little more aesthetic, maybe with flowers?)</TE>
<TE>   If City Hall once was a picnic in the park, it is edging toward a
fortress. Closing streets around city offices and police headquarters
may or may not stop a terrorist but it does discourage all but the
most determined citizens by snarling traffic and causing
confusion--not good symbolism for city government.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond symbolism, the city needs to ask where resources are needed
most. In South Los Angeles, Luis Gamez was killed and his brother,
Oscar, was wounded last month when they tried to stop a teenager from
spraying graffiti; he sprayed them with bullets instead. Residents of
the apartment where the brothers worked as security guards are afraid
to let their children play outside. International terrorism is a real
threat; local terrorism a daily reality. The city needs to allocate
its public safety efforts accordingly.</TE>

<LD>Not long ago, Americans' support for capital punishment was
rock-solid. That was before they knew how many people on death row
were wrongly convicted. In recent years, 99 across the United States
have been exonerated and released, some just hours before a state
executioner would have killed them with gas, electricity or an
injection.</LD>
<LD>   Support for the death penalty has always been based on the belief
that defendants are guilty and got a fair trial. What happens when
facts shake that confidence? Public support has dropped nationally,
from 77% five years ago in one poll to just over 63% last year, the
lowest level in 20 years. Support drops to 46% when pollsters list
life without parole as an alternative to death.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes Columbia Law School professor James S. Liebman with data
showing that mistakes in death penalty cases occur with horrifying
frequency. His measure is the reversal rate--the frequency with which
death sentences are thrown out on appeal for grave errors (which does
not necessarily mean that a defendant was exonerated).</LD>
<TE>   In a study released this week, Liebman reviewed more than 5,000
cases over 23 years and found that in the states that most often
handed out the death penalty, nearly 70% of those sentences were
ultimately reversed. Mississippi led the pack with a staggering
reversal rate of 92%. In other words, Liebman concluded, "heavy and
indiscriminate use of the death penalty creates a high risk that
mistakes will occur ... including execution of the innocent."</TE>
<TE>   California, which has the most people on death row--602--is not
among Liebman's top 10. But just in the past two weeks, California
judges reversed death sentences in two separate cases. In one case
the court ruled that the defendant's Miranda rights were violated,
and in the other an appeals panel cited the "egregious failure" of
the defense lawyer to competently represent his client.</TE>
<TE>   Liebman found such mistakes over and over as he examined data from
other states. The major causes for the high reversal rate include
mistaken identification, post-conviction discovery of exculpatory
evidence, including evidence from DNA tests, misconduct on the part
of the prosecutor or incompetence of the defendant's attorney.</TE>
<TE>   That's where legislation would help. The proposed Innocence
Protection Act, introduced by Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), would
encourage states to set higher standards for lawyers who represent
death penalty defendants, increase compensation for defense lawyers
in state and federal capital cases and establish national guidelines
for the preservation and testing of DNA evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Leahy's worthy measure has more than two dozen co-sponsors, but
nearly a year after its introduction the bill still awaits its first
hearing. Envision those 99 wrongly convicted individuals being led
into prison death chambers and the importance of such reform becomes
clear.</TE>

<LD>Mass murder trials, with their litanies of death, are not for the
squeamish. But they are often the only way to clear the political and
psychological ghosts that can haunt a nation's killing fields for
generations.</LD>
<LD>   This week, in grim opening statements, United Nations prosecutors
are recounting how soldiers in the former Yugoslavia slaughtered
innocents, burned victims to death and picked off children with
high-powered rifles. The objective is to prove that former Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic was responsible.</LD>
<LD>   This is the most important tribunal since World War II victors
brought justice to the leaders of Germany and Japan. In contrast, the
U.N. seems ready to stop trying to prosecute the Khmer Rouge
murderers in Cambodia. The world should not let that happen.</LD>
<TE>   The Hague proceedings, at which authorities will take an estimated
two years to try Milosevic for alleged crimes against humanity in
Croatia and Kosovo, and genocide in Bosnia-Herzegovina, demonstrate
the international community's resolve. Hundreds of thousands of
Muslims, Bosnians and Croats were killed during the wars in what
prosecutors charge was Milosevic's attempt to create a Greater
Serbia.</TE>
<TE>   Serbia remains the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, and Kosovo is
its main province. Many Serbians resent The Hague tribunal and
contend that they are on trial along with their former leader. Hague
prosecutor Carla Del Ponte insists they are not. She is correct. But
Serbians do need to be confronted with the facts about how Milosevic
operated. This will shed light on the tacit complicity of Serbian
civilians in murders committed by troops fighting in their name.
Although painful, bringing this into the open will help build a
stronger society, as happened in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, seeing Khmer Rouge torturers brought to justice would
help fix responsibility for the nearly 2 million Cambodians whom Pol
Pot and his underlings butchered in the 1970s, while attempting to
create an agricultural utopia. Cambodians have largely refused to
revisit the years of death, though many in Phnom Penh can point to
men and women on the street who did the Khmer Rouge's bidding. Pol
Pot died in 1998, but other top Khmer Rouge leaders survive,
including former head of state Khieu Samphan.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the U.N. effort to establish a special tribunal to try
these former leaders has lasted nearly as long as Pol Pot's reign of
terror. Cambodian leader Hun Sen and his cohorts have resisted U.N.
efforts to make sure that tribunal judges are competent, fair and
free from political influence. The United States, France and other
countries--most of which turned away from the Cambodian genocide
while it was occurring--have urged the United Nations to continue
negotiations with the Phnom Penh government.</TE>
<TE>   Cambodia's leaders need to realize that a trial without U.N.
involvement would be seen as a whitewash. They, like the Serbians,
need to understand that international assistance to build schools and
clear mines will never lead to real progress so long as the past
remains unexamined--or, worse, mass murderers stroll the streets.</TE>

<LD>Re "Lay's Silence Draws Wrath From Senators," Business, Feb. 13: As I
watched the Senate and House hearings in which former Enron Chairman
Kenneth Lay and his sleazy subordinates at Enron scurried away from
their responsibilities to their employees and stockholders, I found
myself thinking about the police and firefighters who on Sept. 11
charged up the stairwells of the World Trade Center to rescue people
they did not know, with no promise of enormous wealth and no lawyers
at their sides to hold their hands.</LD>
<LD>   I also thought of Enron's intimate friends in the Bush
administration cowering behind claims of executive privilege while
trying to wrap themselves in the stolen heroism of those police and
firefighters. It's too bad we cannot respect and admire those who
control the nation's wealth and run the nation's government the way
we respect and admire the men and women who bravely did their duty on
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Marvin A. Gluck</LD>
<TE>   Topanga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Since everyone at Enron seems to suffer from amnesia and claims to
have no knowledge of any wrongdoing, maybe the government needs to
freeze their assets until it is proven that nothing illegal occurred.
Maybe this will help jar their memories.</TE>

<TE>   So Enron lobbyist Edward Gillespie suggested "Carterizing" the
Democrats by making them "the 'eat your peas' party" (Business, Feb.
11). If that characterization is correct, then we can all sigh a
breath of relief, because now, instead of being made to eat boring
peas, the Republicans and their friends just might let us eat cake!</TE>

<TE>   Why has The Times exiled the Enron story to the Business section?
Doesn't the biggest bankruptcy in American history warrant a
front-page story, or has the newspaper bought the Republican Party
line that this is a business--not a political--scandal?</TE>

<TE>   I have seen enough to know that the time for appointing a special
counsel to oversee the Enron investigation has come. If the American
people are to have any guarantee that these white-collar criminals
are going to be brought to justice, we cannot have Larry Thompson at
the Justice Department and Harvey Pitt at the SEC in charge of the
investigations. Their ties to Enron and Arthur Andersen are now well
known to all and will make any resolution of this massive corporate
fraud highly suspect. They must step aside immediately. If not, we
may have to wait a very long time until our confidence in our
corporate practices and our government is restored.</TE>
<TE>   It is also high time for the Enron-appointed chairman of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to resign.</TE>

<TE>   In the 1860s, Karl Marx wrote "Das Kapital." At one point, he
discussed the capitalistic system "with emphasis on its
self-destructive tendencies." Most fair-minded people would agree
that in the last century and a half, American capitalism--tempered by
the necessary restraints--has been a resounding success, particularly
for Americans. Enron's Lay, Jeffrey Skilling and their
co-conspirators (beneficiaries) in this colossal scam have
accomplished an incredible feat. They've made Marx look good.</TE>

<HD>What to Call a Valley That Becomes a City</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Valley Secession Group Drops a Few Names" (Feb. 11), on the
creation of a name for a proposed new city should the San Fernando
Valley secede: Why not take the simple, honest and forthright
approach? Both "Valley City" and "City of the Valley" smoothly roll
off the tongue and are simple monikers that embrace the history and
identity that is the Valley. Why trump up some hokey new name?</LD>
<LD>   As a native of Studio City and Van Nuys, I say it's time to come
out of the closet and say we're proud. What other valley is there
(and we're surrounded by them) that has the distinction of being
recognized nationally through print, film, TV and folklore as the
original one-and-only true valley? Although ambivalent about the
breakup of Los Angeles (nostalgia aside, it could actually prove
positive on both sides of the hill), I feel that any future entities
must build on their existing strengths rather than trying to recreate
themselves as something they are not.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've lived in the San Fernando Valley my whole life. I've seen it
grow and change from a quiet suburb to an exciting, diverse community
to live and work in. My suggestion for a new city name is Los Encinos
Valley. This would reflect the oak-covered hills surrounding the
valley, the original Spanish name (El Valle de Santa Catalina de
Bononia de los Encinos), honoring its large Hispanic population, as
well as the Ventura Boulevard feel echoed in "Encino." Even the "Los"
continues the connection with Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Mandell</TE>
<TE>   Studio City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The logical and geographically appropriate name for the new Valley
city is North Los Angeles. The new municipality would comprise what
is now the northern part of the city of Los Angeles. Let's call it
what it is. And by keeping the appellation "Los Angeles" in their
name, the Valleyites would send the message that there is no ill will
in their bid for secession and that they are not running away from
their neighbors south of Mulholland Drive. They would also hold on
to--and profit from--a place name known the world over.</TE>

<LD>Joseph Wambaugh's Feb. 11 commentary, "Ours Is Not to Wonder Why He
Fumbled the Ball," on the LAPD police chief squabble, is a gem. His
experience, common sense and talent blend to convince responsible
people. Los Angeles in past years has been blessed with the likes of
William Parker and John Alderson as police and fire chiefs. Their
leadership helped make their departments the very best in the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps Mayor James Hahn is showing us he is more than just a chip
off the old block. It took courage to be outspoken. A smoother
politician may have been quietly influential. Those who are rankled
now may find they voted for a diamond in the rough--and be proud to
say so down the road. Let us see if the Police Commission and City
Council can understand and appreciate Wambaugh's approach and move
onward and upward.</LD>

<LD>Re "U.S. Forces Beat Afghans After Deadly Assault, Ex-Prisoners Say,"
Feb. 11: The U.S. government's negligence to aggressively investigate
and hold accountable those responsible for alleged war abuses such as
the reported killings of Taliban prisoners--many with their hands
bound--in a fort near Mazar-i-Sharif, or the recent killings of 21
innocent Afghans in the village of Oruzgan, suggests a shameful
duplicity in an effort to cover up war crimes committed by U.S.
forces. The rule of law and our basic principles of justice cannot be
sacrificed in a blind war against terrorism. If we allow that to
happen, we have already lost the war.</LD>

<LD>In supposedly describing the state of free speech on university
campuses, the cliche that Caroline Gina Miranda ("Campus Liberals Get
Taste of Own Medicine," Voices, Feb. 9) falls back on is that of
faculty members and administrators isolated from society, sitting in
their proverbial ivory towers. At Cal State Long Beach, with a
student population of 33,000 who live, work and play in the "real
world" and who come from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, there is
hardly the segregation Miranda describes.</LD>
<LD>   In this context, students and educators alike recognize that
tolerance, free speech and the exchange of ideas are vital to higher
education. Rather than reflect a segregation from American society,
campus life reflects the diversity and openness of that society at
its very finest. To that end, students make the school in the same
way that people make society. I would not want it any other way.</LD>

<TE>   Miranda's somewhat vaporous case for indicting campus liberals for
suppressing free speech doesn't hold a candle to the long history of
censorship and book burning by religious and political conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   Things that have been banned by conservatives include
Shakespeare's plays and many books considered classics. Some
conservatives even banned all the Tarzan books in Los Angeles in 1929
because it was reasoned that the fictional character Tarzan was
living in the jungle with Jane without the benefit of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   And lest you think that censorship on the part of conservatives is
ancient history, remember that some conservative groups are now
banning the best-selling Harry Potter books because they allegedly
promote witchcraft and Satanism. (At the same time, the Harry Potter
books have been credited for getting thousands of children interested
in reading for the first time.)</TE>
<TE>   And the last word: Webster's New World Dictionary has even been
banned by some conservative teachers because it contains some
"objectionable words."</TE>

<HD>Tape-Delayed Olympics Nothing to Cheer About</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When was the last time you saw the words "previously recorded live
event" plastered on a TV screen more than on NBC's coverage of the
Olympics? Oh, wait, I know the answer--the last time NBC covered the
Olympics. What is so difficult about putting the Olympics on live?
Are "Days of Our Lives" or "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" more important
than events that take place once every two years?</LD>
<LD>   I love watching the Games. I love cheering for our athletes. And
NBC takes that away by showing the events tape-delayed. Maybe we
should all delay watching its No. 1 shows. Maybe we should delay
spending money with its advertisers. Maybe we should just realize
that making money is still more important to NBC than lifting up the
nation by allowing people to cheer the American flag our athletes
wear to victory.</LD>

<LD>   The sequestering of the Letantia Bussell jury to prevent its
members from learning of her husband's suicide and the dragging of
the poor woman, not yet 24 hours bereaved, into court to hear her
multiple guilty verdicts (would justice have been sullied by waiting
a couple of days, for God's sake, to let the widow collect herself?)
does not display our judicial system at its finest. I have no reason
to second-guess the jury; I assume the woman is guilty and, in fact,
she may be a complete charlatan. That is not at issue. The question
is: What are we?</LD>

<HD>Focus Shifts to Global Crossing</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Commerce Committee says a probe of the firm's
accounting could begin within a few weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr. and KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Interest is building on Capitol Hill for an investigation of the
business and accounting practices that steered telecommunications
pioneer Global Crossing Ltd. into Bankruptcy Court, stranding workers
and investors with worthless stock while company executives reaped
huge financial rewards.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears to be inevitable we will take a look at them," Ken
Johnson, a spokesman for the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, Rep. W. J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Since Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy 21/2 weeks ago,
shareholders have accused the company of using questionable
accounting techniques to overstate revenue, workers complained that
they were barred from selling stock in their 401(k)s as share prices
continued to fall, and former employees have fretted about the sudden
cessation of their severance pay.</LD>
<TE>   But in Washington, the plight of Global Crossing has been
overshadowed by investigations of energy trading giant Enron Corp.'s
even more stunning financial meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Now that is starting to change. Staffers on the Commerce
Committee, home to the subcommittee on telecommunications and the
Internet, said Wednesday that a Global Crossing probe could begin
within a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "They are on our radar screen, even though we are devoting a
tremendous amount of time to Enron," said a spokeswoman for Rep. John
D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the committee's ranking Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   Other congressional panels may have interest in the company as
well. This week, Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D-N.Y.) asked the
Committee on Financial Services to investigate Global Crossing's
aggressive accounting practices. As the telecom market fizzled, the
company booked revenue by trading capacity on its fiber-optic network
with other firms.</TE>
<TE>   Slaughter also requested that the Committee on Education and the
Workforce look into Global Crossing's decision to prevent employees
from accessing their 401(k) accounts, which included company stock,
in the weeks leading up to the bankruptcy filing. The restriction
arose in December and January because the company switched the
administrator for its 401(k) plan, automatically freezing workers'
accounts. The practice is legal, but the timing of the so-called
lockdown has raised suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   However, by the time the lockdown began, Global Crossing's shares
were trading for less than a dollar. They hit an all-time high of
$65.77 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers say partisan politics is behind the newfound
interest in Global Crossing. The 5-year-old company, which is based
in Bermuda but has executive offices in Beverly Hills, quickly became
one of Washington's most generous political donors. Of the nearly
$2.8 million in soft money the company contributed over the years,
55% of it went to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe was an
early investor in the company, and he pocketed nearly $18 million
when he sold the bulk of his shares in 1999, when the stock was
riding high. William S. Cohen, President Clinton's Secretary of
Defense, currently serves on Global Crossing's board.</TE>
<TE>   Those ties could give Republicans an opportunity to distress
Democrats as much as the Enron scandal has embarrassed the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people have pointed out that Terry McAuliffe got a
sweetheart deal ... and politicians always feel a need to embarrass
their foes," said Erick Gustafson, director of federal policy for
Citizens for a Sound Economy, a conservative Washington watchdog
group chaired by former President George Bush's White House lawyer,
C. Boyden Gray.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, Tauzin's spokesman, hinted that if congressional
Democrats try to mine political capital out of Enron, they could get
their comeuppance with Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that Enron is a business scandal, not a political
scandal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But if certain Democrats want to continue to try to politicize
the Enron scandal, there's always the possibility we could turn the
tables on them in a Global Crossing investigation."</TE>
<TE>   But like Enron, Global Crossing spread its money around Washington
liberally, giving money to 39 members of the House and 33 Senators.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, the company and its employees have given $2,000 in
soft money to Tauzin and $1,000 to Dingell, according to the
nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Slaughter received $1,500
in Global Crossing soft money.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Slaughter and other Democrats are eager to scrutinize the
company, motivated in part by the inevitable media visibility such a
probe would bring, and by good old-fashioned outrage from
constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a Democrat in good standing," said Slaughter, whose
Rochester, N.Y., district is home to 800 Global Crossing employees.
"If Global Crossing needs investigating, it needs investigating."</TE>
<TE>   Shiver reported from Washington and Kaplan reported from Los
Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Homestore to Restate 2000 Financial Results</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Company's announcement fuels doubts about its
viability. Nasdaq halts trading.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homestore.com Inc., the Internet's largest supplier of home-sale
listings, announced Wednesday that it will restate its 2000 financial
results and file new numbers by mid-March, fueling analysts' doubts
about the viability of the Westlake Village company.</LD>
<LD>   On news of the expanding internal accounting inquiry, the Nasdaq
Stock Market halted trading in Homestore shares until the company
fully satisfies the exchange's request for additional information.
The sale price was 72 cents when trading was halted, after hitting a
record low of 69 cents Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Homestore, whose shares have fallen 97% in the last year, already
had said it would restate financial results for the first, second and
third quarters of 2001. That announcement led to the suspension of
trading Dec. 21. Trading resumed Jan. 7.</LD>
<TE>   The newest restatements involve historical accounting issues and
do not relate to Homestore's ongoing operations, said Chief Executive
Michael Long. But that explanation was not enough to convince
analysts that Homestore has long-term prospects for success.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some very real concerns about this company," said Derek
Brown, an analyst at WR Hambrecht &amp; Co., who has rated the stock
"neutral." "The new management team is being forced to pick up the
pieces that are left of this company and try to push it forward. It's
going to be extremely challenging."</TE>
<TE>   Homestore announced the resignation of Chief Executive Stuart
Wolff on Jan. 7 and named board member Joe Hanauer as chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Jack D. Dennison, formerly with WebMD, was named chief operating
officer, and Lewis R. Belote III was appointed chief financial
officer.</TE>
<TE>   The company said Wednesday that it expects its cash flow from
operations to be positive for 2002. It said it had about  $48 million
in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of about $100
million as of Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   That may not be enough to cover the slew of class-action lawsuits
filed against the company this month. At least a dozen suits contend
that Homestore and some of its officers sought to prop up the stock
by issuing a false and misleading picture of company finances.
Executives sold at least $16 million in Homestore shares while the
stock price was still high.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Homestore said it overstated revenue in 2001 by as
much as $95 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the company said it was firing 300 employees this
quarter, after reducing its work force by 20% in October.</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at a very risky company," U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray Cos. analyst Safa Rashtchy told Bloomberg News.</TE>

<HD>Enron Plan Sought to Shift Blame</HD>
<DH>Probe: Doc shows Sherron S. Watkins proposed way for
energy firm's troubles to be placed on former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As his company neared collapse, Enron Corp.'s then-Chairman Kenneth
L. Lay was given a damage-control game plan drafted by Sherron S.
Watkins, who called for shifting blame away from Lay and on to former
Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and others, documents show.</LD>
<LD>   The documents provide an inside glimpse at how Enron executives
grappled for ways to cope with the firm's growing crisis last fall
and also shed new light on Watkins' role in the firm and her support
for Lay. Previously, she was chiefly known for her August memos to
Lay warning him of questionable accounting.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins is scheduled to testify today for the first time on
Capitol Hill.</LD>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, it was disclosed that Enron sought to gain
influence over accounting standards in return for a $500,000 pledge
to an international rule-setting board last year, the chairman of a
Senate committee investigating the firm said. When the company was
solicited for a commitment, it asked whether the donation would
entitle it to special access to the rule-making process. The matter
was called another example of Enron's influence peddling.</TE>
<TE>   In her efforts to insulate Lay from blame, Watkins laid out a
strategy in an Oct. 30 e-mail to point the finger at Skilling, former
Chief Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow and Chief Accounting Officer
Richard A. Causey.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said the company should tell investors that Lay "relied on
his CEO Skilling, as well as CFO Fastow and CAO Causey, to manage
details."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants Ken Lay's head," she wrote. "He's very
well-respected in business and the community. The culprits are
Skilling, Fastow" and others, including Andersen, the firm's auditor,
and Vinson &amp; Elkins, its lawyers, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail, which was sent to an employee also involved in Enron's
public relations effort, urged that the company "come clean and
restate" its earnings to reflect losses from off-the-books
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins told congressional investigators in a four-hour interview
Wednesday that Lay told her he was planning to fire Andersen and
Vinson &amp; Elkins.</TE>
<TE>   "She may have come to the conclusion that Ken Lay was blameless,
but we have not to this point," said House Energy and Commerce
Committee spokesman Ken Johnson. He said investigators found Watkins
to be "entirely credible."</TE>
<TE>   Lay has declined to testify to Congress, and he could not be
reached late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   According to the documents, Lay recommended that Watkins assist in
handling PR after Enron disclosed heavy losses Oct. 16 related to
off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "Ken thinks it would be a good idea for me to work for you in our
[public relations] and [investor relations] efforts [regarding] our
current crisis," Watkins wrote Oct. 30 to another Enron executive.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' two memos to Lay in August prompted an internal probe of
the accounting issues by Vinson &amp; Elkins, which determined that no
further investigation or action was needed. In her Oct. 30 e-mail,
Watkins noted that she could play "devil's advocate on the accounting
issues and be sure we anticipate the tough questions."</TE>
<TE>   Skilling spokeswoman Judy Leon said he would not comment. In
testimony last week, Skilling denied knowing about illegal activity
or details of off-the-books deals.</TE>
<TE>   After writing the e-mail, Watkins was disappointed to learn that
Lay decided against firing Andersen and the law firm and instead
would appoint a special investigating committee, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Also disclosed Wednesday was a Feb. 23 e-mail showing that the
London-based International Accounting Standards Board asked Lay for a
five-year, $100,000-a-year commitment to help fund an effort to
create international standards, similar to those set in the U.S. by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board.</TE>
<TE>   Such fund-raising requests are common and other corporations were
also asked to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   In return, however, Enron executives wanted to know whether the
donation would entitle the company to special access to the
rule-making process, meetings with board trustees or other benefits,
investigators said, citing an e-mail from Enron's outside accountant,
since-fired Andersen partner David B. Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   "While I believe Rick [Causey, Enron's chief accounting officer]
is inclined to do this given Enron's desire to increase their
exposure and influence in rulemaking broadly, he is interested in
knowing whether these types of commitments will add any formal or
informal access to this process," Duncan wrote to colleagues, seeking
advice. "I think any information along this front or further
information on the current strategic importance of supporting these
groups for the good of consistent rulemaking would help Enron with
its decision to be supportive," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan was later fired for allegedly ordering the shredding of
Enron-related documents after the Securities and Exchange Commission
launched an inquiry into Enron's collapse last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Critics called the e-mail another example of Enron's efforts to
exert political influence through financial contributions. "No one
was mincing any words here," said Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.).</TE>
<TE>   An Enron spokeswoman did not return a call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Levin said it appeared that Enron pledged the money but never
actually made the contribution.</TE>
<TE>   In another twist, the accounting board's request came from Paul A.
Volcker, a former Federal Reserve Board chairman and head of the
international accounting board. Volcker was recently named by
Andersen to help it impose new controls and salvage its reputation.
Levin, however, said he wasn't criticizing Volcker.</TE>
<TE>   In other developments:</TE>
<TE>   * Two senior executives criticized in Enron's internal report for
failing to properly supervise the company's dealings--Causey and
Chief Risk Officer Richard B. Buy, are negotiating their departures
from the company and may leave shortly, sources said. Neither showed
up at the company's offices Wednesday, and they are considered to be
on leave, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   * Lay was spared another tongue-lashing before a congressional
committee, which canceled his appearance in the wake of his decision
to invoke his right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   * In U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, a hearing on Enron's
request to devote $30 million in insurance money to cover legal fees
for some of the officers and directors blamed for the company's
collapse was postponed until Feb. 27.</TE>

<HD>Jakks Pacific Reports 4th-Quarter Profit Fell 27%</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jakks Pacific Inc., which makes toys including World Wrestling
Federation action figures, said fourth-quarter profit fell 27% as the
company had a reserve relating to Kmart Corp.'s bankruptcy protection
filing.</LD>
<LD>   Net income fell to $4.39 million, or 22 cents a share, from $6.03
million, or 32 cents, a year earlier, Jakks said. Sales rose 4% to
$61.4million from $59.1 million.</LD>
<LD>   Jakks said it had a $5-million reserve related to Kmart's Jan. 22
bankruptcy filing. Kmart is one of Jakks' five largest customers,
according to a Jakks regulatory filing. Sales barely increased
because Malibu-based Jakks withheld shipments of about $1.4 million
of products to the discount retailer, Chief Financial Officer Joel
Bennett said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Jakks rose 7 cents to $18.73 on Nasdaq. They have gained
51% in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Other earnings from California companies, excluding one-time
items:</TE>
<TE>   * Fidelity National Financial Inc., an Irvine-based operator of
the nation's largest title insurance company, said net earnings more
than doubled in the fourth quarter on record revenue. The company
posted earnings of $92.3 million, or $1.04 a share, up from $37.5
million, or 48 cents a share, for the same period a year earlier.
Revenue rose 39% to $1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * First American Corp. reported net income of $52.3 million, or 68
cents a share, compared with last year's $31.8 million, or 47 cents a
share, which included a net after-tax benefit of $10.7 million.
Revenue at the Santa Ana-based provider of real-estate related
information and financial services rose 41% to $1.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   * Jack in the Box Inc. reported net income rose to $26.7 million,
or 67 cents a share, from $23.7 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue at the San Diego-based fast-food hamburger chain grew 9.4% to
$594.2 million.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp. amended a third-quarter federal filing to provide more
information on its energy business and finances in response to an
inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Calpine, one of the largest U.S. power producers, added details on
new projects, letters of credit, bond repurchases and business with
bankrupt energy company Enron Corp. It also revealed some details on
energy derivatives used to hedge electricity production. The report
didn't change the earnings, balance sheet or cash flow previously
reported.</LD>
<LD>   The changes follow a call last week from the SEC's Division of
Corporation Finance, a "nonenforcement" division, and talks with the
SEC staff, Calpine said.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, the SEC's enforcement division is investigating
whether the company improperly disclosed financial information to
analysts.</TE>
<TE>   The amendment "is a normal part of the filing and review process
at the SEC," said Richard Dietrich, a professor of accounting at Ohio
State University who was an SEC academic accounting fellow.</TE>

<HD>Comcast Vows to Stop Recording Web Activity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Comcast Corp. promised amid criticism Wednesday to stop immediately
recording the Web browsing activities of its 1 million high-speed
Internet subscribers.</LD>
<LD>   One congressional member said collecting the data might have
broken federal law.</LD>
<LD>   The president of Comcast's cable communications division, Stephen
Burke, said the company will stop storing the information.</LD>
<TE>   Comcast also said it will hire a chief privacy officer and "will
not let this situation rest until we are convinced that we have done
everything that needs to be done to ensure that our customers are
reassured."</TE>
<TE>   Comcast's reversal--and inquiries from Rep. Edward Markey,
(D-Mass.) an aggressive privacy advocate--came a day after The
Associated Press reported that Comcast had started recording each
customer's visits to Web pages without notification. Comcast said the
decision was part of a technology overhaul to save money and speed up
the network and was not intended to infringe on customers' privacy.</TE>
<TE>   Comcast said the information, collected over the last six weeks,
had been stored temporarily, was purged automatically every few days
and "has never been connected to individual subscribers."</TE>
<TE>   Markey said the 1984 Cable Act prohibits Comcast from collecting
personal information from its subscribers without obtaining "prior
written or electronic consent."</TE>

<HD>Auditing Group Looks to Tighten Partnership Rules</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Standards Board will propose guidelines to curb
type of off-the-books entities Enron used to hide debt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Accounting rule makers plan to accelerate their effort to make it
more difficult for companies to create the type of partnerships that
Enron Corp. used to shift billions of dollars in debt off its books.</LD>
<LD>   The rules under review by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
allowed Enron to create off-balance-sheet partnerships by finding
investors who took as little as 3% of the risk.</LD>
<LD>   New guidelines to be proposed next month will focus on who
controls such entities and whose capital is at risk, rather than just
their stated ownership, board members said at a meeting Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "We have to make absolutely sure that the outside investor can
lose the entire amount and that there is no implicit or explicit
guarantee" for the investor's debts, board member Catherine Schipper
said. One test could be whether the "entity could obtain ... a
commercial bank loan without the support" of the company that set it
up, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines would seek to determine if the financing
vehicles are independent of their sponsors and who will benefit from
any income the entities generate.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The FASB, a private group that sets the generally accepted
accounting principles used by U.S. corporations, had planned to
propose rules by the end of June. But as Congress investigates
Enron's collapse, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey
L. Pitt has told the FASB to make proposals to close the accounting
loopholes on so-called special-purpose entities in 60 to 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Enron, which created more than 3,000 off-balance-sheet
partnerships, used just three of them to keep $2.6 billion in debt
off its books.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Special-purpose entities are widely used by U.S. companies. In a
typical case, a company sells an income-generating asset to the
entity, which then borrows against it and pays the sponsoring
company.</TE>
<TE>   To meet standards for off-balance-sheet treatment under the
current rules, the assets of such an entity must be legally isolated
from the parent company and an independent third party must have a
substantive investment at risk.</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say the accounting board's new standards should avoid
setting a specific minimum level of outside investment, such as 3%,
that is sufficient to allow a company to move a partnership off its
books.</TE>
<TE>   Schipper said the board should consider keeping a percentage,
possibly 10%, as a "rule of thumb," while making it clear that the
percentage of outside investment at risk is only one of several
guidelines used by auditors.</TE>

<HD>FCC Expected to Deal Blow to Ultra-Wideband</HD>
<DH>Telecom:  Faster wireless may face constraints. Some worry
the technology could cause airwave interference.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a setback to computer and consumer product makers, federal
regulators today are expected to tightly constrain a breakthrough
wireless technology that backers had hoped would usher in a new era
of wireless networking and tracking.</LD>
<LD>   Proponents had boasted that the technology, known as
ultra-wideband, could provide very high-speed wireless Internet
access and a host of new wireless services, such as allowing users to
track intruders with home radar, helping rescuers find earthquake
victims and greatly improving collision-avoidance systems.</LD>
<LD>   But the staff of the Federal Communications Commission is expected
to reject industry calls for a full-powered version of the technology
that would cover an entire house and limit transmission distances to
about 30 feet. The plan has drawn heavy criticism from the Pentagon
and the cell phone industry, which are worried that ultra-wideband
could cause airwave interference.</LD>
<TE>   "It's clear that the power levels are going to be lower than even"
household portable phones, said Jeff Ross, vice president of
corporate strategy and development for TimeDomain Corp., a
Huntsville, Ala., company that has been developing the technology.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the FCC staff is expected to oppose most commercial
and consumer applications of ultra-wideband tracking technology out
of fear it might fall into the wrong hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We think a conservative approach is appropriate at the outset," a
top administration official said. "We can make adjustments later."</TE>
<TE>   Although military and public safety personnel will be able to use
ultra-wideband's radar capabilities to see through walls and other
obstructions, the FCC staff wants to limit commercial applications to
collision avoidance in automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   The staff of the FCC was still negotiating late Wednesday with
Pentagon, Commerce Department and industry representatives. Sources
warned some provisions of the more than 100 pages of staff
recommendations could change.</TE>
<TE>   More than a decade in the making, the versatile ultra-wideband
technology has been eagerly awaited by Intel Corp., Sony Corp. and
other big backers looking to improve on an older wireless standard,
called WiFi, that has been hurt by security problems and
comparatively lower data speeds.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the constraints the FCC is expected to place on
ultra-wideband, the technology could remain useful for short
distances, such as transmitting video from a camera to a nearby
television set or sending data from a cell phone to a laptop, said
Robert Scholtz, a USC professor of electrical engineering.</TE>

<LD>Federal energy regulators Wednesday expanded an investigation beyond
Enron Corp. to determine whether any companies used their market
power to drive up electricity prices in the West last year.</LD>
<LD>   The chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Patrick
H. Wood III, promised a congressional committee Jan. 29 that he would
investigate long-standing complaints by West Coast lawmakers that
Enron engaged in price gouging.</LD>
<LD>   The commission broadened the probe Wednesday, expanding the focus
to other companies and authorizing the use of subpoenas if necessary
to determine whether power suppliers manipulated markets for
electricity or natural gas.</LD>
<TE>   In a letter to Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy
and Natural Resources Committee, Wood said FERC staff would be
consulting with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Wood said the investigation could take several months to complete.</TE>
<TE>   California officials have asked the commission to order suppliers
to refund $8.9 billion in alleged overcharges.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) welcomed the investigation, with a
caveat.</TE>
<TE>   "FERC's words have raised our hopes before, but FERC's actions
have often disappointed us. I hope that is not the case this time
around," Boxer said.</TE>
<TE>   She urged FERC to examine the long-term contracts between the
state of California and electricity generators and asked FERC to
detail for her all meetings and phone calls between commissioners and
Enron executives.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Boxer has asked the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, to investigate "the relationship
between Enron's faltering business" and skyrocketing electricity
prices in California last year.</TE>

<HD>PacifiCare Posts 4th-Quarter Loss</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Health Net's profit rises 21% as it handles
restructuring in the industry better than its counterpart.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two of California's largest health insurers reported divergent
fourth-quarter financial results Wednesday, illustrating how some HMO
operators are coping better than others with cost pressures and
restructuring that are roiling the industry.</LD>
<LD>   PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. took a $59.4-million charge in the
fourth quarter due to a restructuring, resulting in a loss of $26.4
million, or 77 cents a share, compared with net income of $12
million, or 35 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana-based PacifiCare said profit would have been $11.8
million, or 34 cents a share, without the restructuring expense.</LD>
<TE>   Health Net Inc. reported fourth-quarter profit rose 21% as it
added customers and cut costs and debt. Net income was $55.9 million,
or 45 cents a share, versus $46.2 million, or 37 cents a year ago.
Woodland Hills-based Health Net's revenue also rose 5.3% to $2.48
billion from $2.36 billion.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare last month said it was cutting 1,300 jobs to reduce
costs as it struggled to meet rising medical costs. It said it
expects the restructuring to save it $80 million to $90million a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the nation's biggest operator of Medicare plans fell
3.3% to $2.88 billion. The company also experienced a membership
decline as it dropped unprofitable businesses and ended relations
with some medical care providers.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it expects to earn $3.55 to $3.65 a share in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare continues to face "some serious strategic issues," said
Fox Pitt Kelton analyst Greg Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   "The shift ... to a shared-risk model [in which doctors and
hospitals are paid more and the insurer assumes more risk of losses]
is necessary in many of its markets," Crawford said. "But it's also
fraught with danger....You can never plan for every contingency. It's
almost impossible to predict."</TE>
<TE>   This week, the Texas attorney general's office sued PacifiCare of
Texas Inc. for not paying "tens of millions of dollars" in back
claims for three physician groups in its network that filed for
bankruptcy protection. PacifiCare denied any wrongdoing and said it
will fight the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   PacifiCare announced its results after the market closed. The
shares fell 58 cents to $18.09 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Health Net also is reinventing itself. Both companies
are seeking more diversified and profitable business. But Health Net,
which has a much smaller reliance on HMO business, is operating with
less of a sense of urgency and from a much better position of
strength, health care and financial analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net also cut jobs and shed unprofitable businesses last
year, but its own turnaround is much further along than PacifiCare's,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Health Net executives forecast a 2002 profit of $2.05 to $2.10 a
share and said that first-quarter profit is now expected to be
slightly higher than previously believed, offering a prediction or
guidance of 46 cents instead of 44 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Health Net stock closed at $24.03, up 28 cents on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>HP Cites Profit to Stir Support for Merger</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>Hewlett-Packard Co. on Wednesday reported first-quarter profit that
handily beat analysts' recently raised forecasts, but executives said
the company still needs to buy Compaq Computer Corp. to solve
long-term problems.</LD>
<LD>   HP is fighting hard to rally support for the $22.6-billion Compaq
deal against intense opposition from dissident director Walter
Hewlett, who said the strong earnings report proved that HP would be
fine without taking on Compaq.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Carly Fiorina carefully used the earnings report
to tout HP's execution in a tough atmosphere and to lament the
company's holes--notably in business PCs, networked data-storage
systems and low-end servers.</LD>
<TE>   "These results demonstrate we know our business--better than
anyone else," she said. "The simple fact is, HP has a lot going for
it, but there are also significant areas where a lot more is needed.
And with Compaq, we have a detailed plan, not just platitudes, to
address them."</TE>
<TE>   HP said its earnings excluding acquisition-related charges were
$564 million, or 29 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31, down
from $812 million, or 41 cents, a year ago, as revenue declined 8% to
$11.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts were expecting 25 cents a share, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call. The estimate had been 16 cents until last week,
when HP said consumer demand for printers and computers had been
surprisingly strong.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the results were so far beyond expectations that one
analyst asked Fiorina during a conference call whether the numbers
were "goosed" to help the company's Compaq campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I will metaphorically, literally, look you in the eye and tell
you these numbers are exactly what they appear to be," she responded.</TE>
<TE>   Even the impending earnings report didn't quiet the infighting
over the acquisition, as six HP directors accused Walter Hewlett of
going too far in his criticism of Fiorina.</TE>
<TE>   The directors sent Hewlett a letter complaining that he has
mischaracterized the amount of time HP spent formulating its
long-term strategy before the Palo Alto-based company decided to buy
Houston-based Compaq. It also said he has suggested falsely that the
board has just rubber-stamped Fiorina's decisions.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, HP shares rose 21 cents to $20.98
before the report and Compaq closed up 28 at $11.40.</TE>

<HD>Japan May Suffer Drop in a Key Credit Rating</HD>
<DH>Asia: Moody's says the downgrade on domestic debt may be
two notches as the economy struggles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Moody's Investors Service said Wednesday that it may downgrade
Japan's domestic credit rating by two notches, as pressure rises on
the Japanese government to tame deflation and fix its economy.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's, which last shaved Japan's debt rating in December, said
it may cut the Aa3 rating on Japan's yen-denominated debt further
after a one- to three-month review of the country.</LD>
<LD>   "In this particular case, there is a reasonable possibility that
the downgrade might be two notches," said Vincent Truglia, Moody's
managing director of sovereign ratings.</LD>
<TE>   A one-notch cut by Moody's to A1 would put the domestic debt
rating of the world's second-largest economy on par with that of the
Czech Republic, Hungary and the Bahamas.</TE>
<TE>   A two-notch cut to A2 would put it alongside Poland, South Africa,
Cyprus and Latvia.</TE>
<TE>   The news knocked the yen lower against the dollar, after a two-day
rally. But the stock market rallied modestly, as investors bet the
rating threat could spur true financial reform. The Nikkei 225 index
rose 90.36 points, or 0.9%, to 9,968.35. The market sank to 18-year
lows last week.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi ordered his top economic advisors
Wednesday to devise a deflation-fighting economic recovery plan by
the end of the month, taking his first stab at major reform this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Koizumi is seeking a plan to reverse Japan's
continually falling prices, which undercut hope for a turnaround. "We
must aggressively implement concrete and effective anti-deflation
measures," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Economics Minister Heizo Takenaka said an outline decided
Wednesday will target five policies already being pursued: getting
rid of banks' bad loans, stabilizing the financial system,
re-energizing financial markets, helping small and medium-sized firms
get loans and loosening monetary policy.</TE>
<TE>   The weak state of the banking system has been a major issue in
Japan. Banks are saddled with a huge number of nonperforming loans
that they have been reluctant to write off.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation that more government money may be needed to bail out
the banks has grown in recent days. Public money was used during the
1997-98 financial crisis and afterward to prevent a banking meltdown.</TE>
<TE>   Koizumi's decision comes ahead of next week's visit by President
Bush, who is expected to lean on Koizumi to step up the pace of
reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's singled out Japan's losing battle to stem a three-year
fall in consumer prices, warning that deflation was eroding the
government's revenue base and making it harder for policymakers to
tackle other economic problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Deflation is the foremost challenge facing Japanese authorities,
exacerbating overall credit risks throughout the economy as debt
rises in real terms," Moody's said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the banking system's woes, unemployment is at a
record 5.6%, exports are flagging, and government debt is the highest
in the industrialized world, at more than 130% of gross domestic
product.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Advance on Upbeat Retail Data</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: The market rallies as investors show confidence
in economic recovery. However, analysts are cautious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An encouraging report on retail sales inspired another rally on Wall
Street on Wednesday as investors grew more confident about an
impending economic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average scored
its best close in more than a month and its third triple-digit gain
in four sessions.</LD>
<LD>   But analysts still cautioned against too much optimism, noting
that investor sentiment remains fragile. Despite short-lived rallies,
stocks have moved mostly lower in recent weeks on concerns that
prices are too high given the uncertain prognosis for earnings.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow was less than 11 points from regaining the 10,000 level
after closing up 125.93 points, or 1.3%, at 9,989.67--its best close
since Jan. 10. The Dow rose 118 points Friday and 140 on Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Broader stock indicators also advanced. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index climbed 11.01 points, or 1.0%, to 1,118.51, while the Nasdaq
composite index gained 24.95 points, or 1.4%, to 1,859.16.</TE>
<TE>   Winners outpaced losers by 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq. Volume was weak, continuing a trend of
lackluster trading activity.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were encouraged by a Commerce Department report showing
retail sales rose by a satisfactory 1.2% in January, excluding
volatile automobile sales. It was the biggest gain since March
2000--the month Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 hit their all-time highs.</TE>
<TE>   Auto sales fell by 4.3%, but that decline was anticipated as
no-interest financing and other sales incentives expired.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending is closely watched because it accounts for
two-thirds of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "The number was much stronger than expected and it's giving people
a little bit of optimism that the economy is recovering better than
thought," said Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells
Fargo Securities.</TE>
<TE>   The news helped boost retail stocks. Home Depot advanced 93 cents
to $51.24. Rival Lowe's gained 63 cents to $46.16. Office Depot rose
$2.30 to $18.49 after raising its earnings outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Technology stocks also fared well, helped by a
better-than-expected report from Applied Materials. The chip-making
equipment company rose $3.25 to $47.96 after announcing a $45-million
first-quarter loss Tuesday that beat expectations. The company also
said it expects orders in the current quarter to grow 10% to 15%.</TE>
<TE>   The buying also spread to manufacturing and industrial stocks.
General Motors rose $2.13 to $51.20, while Boeing gained $1.75 to
$44.90. Both are Dow members.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street remains vulnerable to fears of more terrorist attacks.
Stocks pulled back briefly in the morning after a terminal at Los
Angeles International Airport was evacuated because of a mysterious
package. The package was later determined not to be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   In other market highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * The retail sales report heightened speculation the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates by midyear as the economy recovers.
That drove some investors away from Treasury securities. The yield on
the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 4.99% from 4.98% on
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   * Shares of GameStop, the video game retailing subsidiary of
Barnes &amp; Noble, closed at $20.10 in their first day of trading. They
opened at $19.25--higher than the $18 offer price set a day earlier.</TE>
<TE>   * American International Group gained $3.11 to $77.08 after
McDonald Investments reiterated its "aggressive buy" rating on the
stock. Other insurers also rose: XL Capital rose $5.86 to $97.11,
RenaissanceRe added $6.75 to $108.80 and Ace rose $3.84 to $44,
despite reporting a 59% drop in profit. The Bloomberg index of
insurers rose 3.3%.</TE>
<TE>   * Telecom shares remained weak. WorldCom lost 10 cents to $7.16,
Qwest Communications fell 62 cents to $8.59, Sprint PCS was off 37
cents to $11.62 and Nortel Networks lost 31 cents to $6.11.</TE>

<HD>Gates Unveils Web Services Tools for Software Developers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>As Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates unveiled a $2-billion suite of
tools for software writers Wednesday, the programmers who want to
create applications for the company's Web services framework weren't
the only ones taking note.</LD>
<LD>   The nine states pressing for harsher antitrust sanctions against
Microsoft are increasingly citing the so-called .Net services
framework in court, arguing that the plan will allow Microsoft to
extend its monopoly over desktop computer operating systems into new
areas.</LD>
<LD>   The suite of tools released Wednesday, called VisualStudio.Net,
will make it easier for programmers to create products for .Net, just
as they have for Windows operating systems.</LD>
<TE>   The .Net framework is designed to let end-users on any
Internet-connected device use automated services, but the central
data will reside on big computers running Windows software. Analysts
said VisualStudio will help Microsoft compete for programmers' time
against rival Sun Microsystems Inc., which controls the programming
language Java.</TE>
<TE>   In filings over the past week in federal court, California and
other states have argued that Microsoft could use .Net's Passport
authentication gateway and security protocols to block access from
PCs, hand-held computers and phones that don't run Windows software.</TE>
<TE>   "Any Web service that seeks to compete with Microsoft must ensure
that it can interoperate across many devices, including those running
Microsoft software,'' the states said in one recent filing.</TE>
<TE>   Hand-held maker Palm Inc. already has been denied advance access
to VisualStudio details because it didn't pledge to adopt the .Net
framework, the states said. Palm officials didn't return calls for
comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The new filings set the groundwork for a trial scheduled for March
on whether Microsoft's proposed settlement with the U.S. Justice
Department and nine other states go far enough to rein in the
Redmond, Wash., software giant. That settlement would bar retaliation
by Microsoft against PC firms that include non-Microsoft programs on
the machines they sell.</TE>
<TE>   The states that haven't settled want to go further, forcing
Microsoft to publish the source code for the dominant Internet
Explorer Web browser and allow other firms to make versions of Office
applications for Linux and other operating systems. And they want
Microsoft to offer a stripped-down version of Windows that doesn't
include its media player or other accessories.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said the states were escalating the dispute by asking to
see source code, when in earlier legal rounds, they were content to
leave Microsoft's code alone but make sure that computer companies
could hide consumer access to parts of it.</TE>
<TE>   "They're injecting a very complicated issue into this," spokesman
Jim Desler said. Competitors have been working hand in hand with the

<HD>Oakley Reports Profit Down 66%</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trendy sunglasses maker Oakley Inc., feeling the effects of a
sluggish economy and a feud with its biggest customer, said Wednesday
that fourth-quarter profit fell 66% on lower sales.</LD>
<LD>   The Foothill Ranch company said earnings should climb this year,
now that its dispute with Sunglass Hut's owner has been patched up,
but will rise less than analysts were expecting because of sluggish
sunglass sales. The company also said it expects sales of other
products such as shoes and clothes to account for a bigger part of
its revenue, but those products don't generate as much profit as
sunglasses.</LD>
<LD>   The firm's growing international sales--they surpassed U.S. sales
for the first time last year--also are generating less profit because
of the strong U.S. dollar, spokesman Gar Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   Oakley said it expects to earn 77 cents to 80 cents a share this
year, below analysts' estimates of 82 cents a share. For the fourth
quarter, earnings fell to $3.3 million, or 5 cents a share, from $9.7
million, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales decreased 3.4% to
$90.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The stock closed at $16.45, off 34 cents a share, on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley's sunglass sales tumbled last year when its biggest
customer, Sunglass Hut, slashed orders after being acquired by
competitor Luxottica Group.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley and Luxottica have since signed a new three-year contract
that should generate significant sales for Oakley but won't reach
"pre-acquisition levels," Chief Operating Officer Link Newcomb told
analysts in a conference call. Before the Luxottica acquisition,
Sunglass Hut accounted for about 20% of Oakley's sunglass sales.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley executives were upbeat about the company's future prospects
despite what Newcomb described as a global retail environment that's
still "choppy at best."</TE>
<TE>   "Truth be told, I'd rather just skip the discussion of the quarter
and brag about the performance of our sports marketing effort at the
winter Olympics," Newcomb said. About 150 athletes will wear the
company's products in the Games, the company said, including 11 who
won medals in the first four days of competition.</TE>
<TE>   Oakley also announced it has struck a deal to sell its products in
some Macy's stores and will open a division in Brazil this year. The
company has sold eyewear since 1996 through a Brazilian distributor.</TE>

<HD>Qwest, Level 3 Say Contracts Properly Recorded</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Statements come in response to probe of dealings
with Global Crossing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON STANCAVISH</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. and Level 3 Communications
Inc. said Wednesday that they followed the rules in recording
transactions with customers last year, as accounting at
telecommunications firms comes under scrutiny.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. regulators are investigating whether Global Crossing Ltd., a
fiber-optic network company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, inflated
revenue by using so-called swaps, or transactions in which a carrier
sells access to its lines in exchange for using another carrier's
network.</LD>
<LD>   Qwest and Level 3 are among telecommunications companies that use
swaps, though each company sought to distinguish its transactions
from the types of arrangements drawing investigators' attention. Both
firms issued statements saying they follow generally accepted
accounting principles when they record the contracts.</LD>
<TE>   "They have to comfort the market that they're not doing anything
wrong," said U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Cary Robinson, who
rates Level 3 "outperform" and owns the shares. "I don't see any
problems in these two companies' accounting, but it may take some
time to convince investors."</TE>
<TE>   Level 3 said it properly recorded sales from seven transactions
last year in which it swapped network capacity. The agreements
represented 2% of last year's revenue, Level 3 said.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest, a phone company in 14 Western states, said it used
generally accepted accounting principles in the way it accounted for
a transaction with closely held Internet service provider KMC Telecom
Holdings Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest sold networking equipment to KMC Telecom, then agreed to pay
KMC Telecom hundreds of millions of dollars for Internet services
using the gear. It accounted for its obligations with KMC as routine
operating leases, Qwest said in the statement. The transaction was
reported Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it disclosed its Internet equipment sales in an
Oct. 31 conference call with analysts and investors after releasing
third-quarter results. It said it had addressed the KMC transaction
with investors at a Dec. 13 meeting. .</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, KPNQwest, operator of a data and Internet network in
Europe, said Wednesday that it "does not engage, and has never
engaged, in cashless transactions." The firm, 47.5% owned by Qwest,
sold capacity to other carriers last year for $382 million, and all
the transactions were cash sales.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission ordered Qwest to surrender
records of transactions with Global Crossing. The companies bought
and sold at least $100 million in space on their networks from each
other last year.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, said its accounting
for buying and selling capacity with other carriers was proper and
approved by auditors at Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Level 3, which is based in Broomfield, Colo., rose 11
cents, or 5%, to $2.33 on Nasdaq. The stock had fallen 22% this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Denver-based Qwest slid 62 cents, or 6.7%, to $8.59 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The shares had dropped 18%.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales Excluding Autos Rose in January</HD>
<DH>Economy: Consumer spending went up 1.2%, a sign that
shoppers may help the U.S. emerge from the recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. sales at retailers excluding auto dealers rose more in January
than any month in almost two years, a sign shoppers may help pull the
economy out of recession.</LD>
<LD>   "Consumer spending is holding up well, maybe surprisingly well,"
said Jack Guynn, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
"The consumer is terribly important to what happens over the next
several quarters."</LD>
<LD>   Sales of items other than cars and trucks rose 1.2% last month
after a 0.7% increase in December, the Commerce Department said.
January's gain was three times larger than analysts expected and the
biggest since March 2000, four months before manufacturing fell into
a slump.</LD>
<TE>   Consumers, whose spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy,
bought building materials, furniture, clothing and items from
discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc., bringing the January level
of retail sales excluding autos to a record $223 billion. Combined
with a record $120.6-billion annual rate of decline in fourth-quarter
inventories, the sales increase suggests factories will have to boost
production to keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   Including cars, sales fell 0.2% in January, erasing December's
increase. Car sales have fallen since setting a record in October.</TE>
<TE>   Sales at general merchandise outlets that include department
stores increased 2.1% after rising 1% in December. Wal-Mart and
Target Corp. were among retailers that reported increased sales last
month as consumers flocked to discounters. Sales rose 2.9% for
building materials, 2.5% for clothes and 0.8% for the category that
covers sporting goods, books and music. Furniture sales increased
0.4% in January after rising 1% in December.</TE>
<TE>   Higher gasoline prices pushed up the value of sales at gasoline
service stations by 5.1% last month. The average price of gasoline at
the pump crept up to $1.15 a gallon in January from a two-year low of
$1.10 a gallon in December.</TE>

<HD>Kmart Wins Key Bankruptcy Ruling</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kmart Corp. won final approval from U.S. Bankruptcy Court to pay
lawyers and advisors helping to reorganize the retailer, and the
judge allowed payments to keep garbage from piling up at stores
nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The court also approved Kmart payments to suppliers of alcoholic
beverages for shipments made before its bankruptcy-protection filing,
in order to keep the supplies coming, something the retailer called
essential to maintaining a steady stream of customers. Several
suppliers stopped shipments to the retailer after not receiving
payments.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Susan Pierson Sonderby gave Kmart the green light to pay $6
million to maintain shipments of imported goods from Martha Stewart,
Kathy Ireland and other core brands.</LD>
<TE>   Kmart became the largest retailer to file for bankruptcy when it
sought protection in Chicago on Jan. 22.</TE>
<TE>   Sonderby also approved a $6.4-million payment to Weyerhaeuser Co.,
which holds a garbage hauling contract for Kmart's 2,100 stores
nationwide.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd. lowered expectations for its fiscal
second-quarter profit and said it has not reached a decision on
whether to sell or spin off its finance unit.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco, roiled by concerns that the company's accounting has not
been transparent, will provide more information today about
acquisitions in a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</LD>
<LD>   The conglomerate now expects earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents a
share for the quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz said on a
conference call with investors. Analysts on average were expecting 77
cents, according to those surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tyco, which lowered its full year earnings estimate last
week as it accelerated a plan to split into four companies, fell
$1.60 to $28.90 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has lost
half its value since December.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it remains in talks about a possible sale of its
CIT finance unit. Last week, it canceled a share sale for the unit
and Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski said he would consider buyout
offers for all its businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski announced last month that the conglomerate would split
into four companies to enhance shareholder value after the plunge of
the company's share price.</TE>

<LD>Marriott International Inc. reported a quarterly loss as business and
leisure travel fell and the largest U.S. hotel company wrote down the
value of properties and loans.</LD>
<LD>   The loss of $116 million, or 48 cents a share, for the fiscal
fourth quarter ended Dec. 28 contrasts with net income of $149
million, or 59 cents, a year earlier. Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott
said revenue fell 10% to $2.87 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Marriott took $85 million in write-downs of off-balance-sheet
loans it guaranteed or made to developers. Chief Financial Officer
Arne Sorenson said no more write-downs are expected, fueling optimism
that the hotel industry is rebounding from a drop in travel.</LD>
<TE>   The company had $1.15 billion in off-balance-sheet items
representing loans and guarantees to hotel developers as of the end
of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Marriott's shares rose $2.46 to close at $39.36 on the NYSE.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Critical Path Inc.'s former president pleaded guilty to conspiracy to
commit securities fraud for directing the e-mail software company to
overstate revenue in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors indicted David A. Thatcher, 47, earlier this month for
allegedly playing a role in the company's inflation of its third- and
fourth-quarter revenue for 2000. Thatcher agreed to cooperate with
investigators and faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000
fine.</LD>
<LD>   In a plea agreement with federal prosecutors, Thatcher said he
participated in a criminal conspiracy "to report false revenues to
meet Critical Path's predicted financial results."</LD>
<TE>   Sara Brody, Thatcher's attorney, could not be reached for comment.
Shares of Critical Path fell 15 cents to $2.40 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>British Airways announced an additional 5,800 job cuts, taking total
layoffs in the last five months to almost a quarter of the work force
as it fights to return to profitability.</LD>
<LD>   Europe's biggest airline is hurtling this year toward its biggest
loss since it was privatized 15 years ago, struggling to cope with a
slump in demand for air travel, rising competition from no-frills
carriers and a heavy debt burden.</LD>
<LD>   In response, the carrier said its "future size and shape" review
would carve out $928.3 million in annual savings by March 2004.</LD>
<TE>   The airline already had cut 7,200 jobs after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, which shattered demand for transatlantic air
travel, its most lucrative route.</TE>

<HD>Walgreen to Toughen Policies on Tobacco</HD>
<DH>Agreement: Drugstore chain says it will take steps to
prevent the sale of cigarettes and related products to minors.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walgreen Co., the largest U.S. drugstore chain, will crack down on
sales of cigarettes and other tobacco products to children as part of
an agreement with 40 states.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which operates 3,651 stores in 43 states, will stop
selling cigarette papers and pipes to children, improve the training
of store clerks to end sales to minors, and notify customers that it
will check the identification of anyone who looks to be under age 27,
Walgreen and state officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Walgreen is the first U.S. retailer to announce new policies that
aim to stop teenagers from smoking as part of an initiative by state
officials, Michigan Atty. Gen. Jennifer Granholm said. Attorneys
general are in talks with other U.S. retailers, which weren't named,
to come up with similar accords, she said.</LD>
<TE>   The agreement requires Walgreen to minimize its use of employees
younger than 18 as clerks who sell tobacco products; train workers
about health reasons for the ban on sales to children; and monitor
its enforcement, Walgreen spokesman Michael Polzin said. It also
requires an end of self-service displays for cigarettes and smokeless
tobacco products.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys general representing the largest U.S. states, including
California, New York, Florida and Texas, were among the 40 officials
who made the agreement, according to the Michigan attorney general's
office.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement will serve as a model for all drugstores and
retailers," Florida Atty. Gen. Bob Butterworth said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>THQ, one of the nation's largest publishers of video games, posted a
32% jump in profit on flat revenue for the fourth quarter, benefiting
from last year's launch of Microsoft Corp.'s Xbox and Nintendo Co.'s
Game Boy Advance game consoles.</LD>
<LD>   Revenue rose a slight 3% to $196.4 million for the quarter ended
Dec. 31. Profit rose to $28.5 million, or $1.12 a share, from $21.5
million a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Chief Executive Brian Farrell said he expects Sony Corp. and
Microsoft to slash the price of their consoles from $299 to $199,
matching Nintendo's GameCube console. Such a move would benefit
companies such as Calabasas-based THQ, which sells more software as
more homes acquire consoles.</LD>

<HD>Hoping for New Twist on Old Spinning Tops</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Spinning into a toy store near you this year: battling tops. Several
U.S. toy makers and major retailers are betting that the Japanese
craze will be the next kids' sensation.</LD>
<LD>   The new toys, unveiled this week at the annual International Toy
Fair here, are to traditional spinners what Razor scooters were to
the wheeled wooden platforms that came before them.</LD>
<LD>   With rip-cord launchers, interchangeable "battle armor" and
plastic arenas to contain the spinning, most of the new metal and
plastic tops hark back to their traditional forebears while adding
more modern features.</LD>
<TE>   The goal in most of the new top games is the same as ever: to be
the last one standing. What's different now are the added features
and accessories to help get the tops going, keep them spinning and
aid in their ability to knock down other players' tops.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the tops have all the makings of a well-orchestrated fad.</TE>
<TE>   They include a Japanese pedigree, a battle motif, a variety of
styles within each line and a low-enough retail price (many for about
$5 to $10) for children to start a tops collection.</TE>
<TE>   But the various campaigns also could have the opposite effect,
canceling out one another in the minds of already overwhelmed buyers,
toy industry veterans say.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be an example of where the biggest company, with the
biggest muscle, wins. Or it could be that they all fail--you just
don't know," said Sean McGowan, a longtime toy industry analyst for
Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "The companies are also thinking that because this worked in
Japan, it should work here, which isn't always the case," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If battling tops catch on in America, they would be the latest in
a string of hit toys coming out of Japan, after such blockbusters as
Pokemon, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and virtual pets.</TE>
<TE>   The first battling tops, called Beyblade, were introduced in 1999,
and they became the top-selling toy in Japan last year. Beyblade also
won top prize at this year's Hong Kong Toy Fair.</TE>
<TE>   The tops are part of a larger retro trend in this year's toys.
More than ever, the biggest hits are revivals of older products.</TE>
<TE>   After a year of recession, terrorist attacks and war, risk-averse
toy makers are betting that parents will reach for comfort toys the
way some reach for comfort food--buying gifts for their children that
remind them of simpler times, especially from their own youths.</TE>
<TE>   New Versions Come in Many Variations</TE>
<TE>   So at the Toy Fair, relaunches abounded. There was Malibu Barbie.
Mr. Potato Head celebrated his 50th anniversary. Board game Trivial
Pursuit launched a 20th-year edition. And commemorative Matchbox cars
sported 50 state license plates and a special U.S. map in which to
house them, to mark that product's 50th year.</TE>
<TE>   The new tops, however, were able to generate more excitement.
Although they are based on an age-old concept, they have been more
dramatically updated.</TE>
<TE>   The big muscle in this arena, toy buyers and others say, is Hasbro
Inc. The company has the rights to sell Beyblade in the U.S. and has
made it the only new top line already in big stores. The toy also was
test marketed in Los Angeles and Chicago in December, with favorable
results.</TE>
<TE>   Beyblade tops--among the most customizable of the group, with four
interchangeable pieces that affect appearance and performance--sell
for about $7 each. A deluxe launcher is available for better spin
power. Beystadiums, sloped differently for strategic kinds of play,
will hit stores this spring.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other offerings:</TE>
<TE>   * Bandai America Inc.'s Cyclonians E.G.G. Bots, with well- defined
characters and comic book stories for its tops, which come as
snap-together pieces.</TE>
<TE>   * Trendmasters Inc.'s Rumble Rippers, an extension of the
company's popular Rumble Robots, with pins to control spin and a
heavier base and gyroscope center; the company promises they will
spin longer and better than other tops.</TE>
<TE>   * Sport Fun Inc.'s Stingerz, a bigger top with a single snap-on
piece, with three different battle belts that affect spin and battle
powers.</TE>
<TE>   * Toymax Inc.'s Spinjas, with flashing lights and launcher.</TE>
<TE>   * Playmates Toys Inc.'s World Top Wonders for girls, a flower with
a pop-out spinning fairy.</TE>
<TE>   * Micro Top and Gryo Top, from Re:Play, a division of Playmates.
The former will be sold in packs of five with optional accessories
such as multiple and rapid launchers. The Gyro, a spinning disk with
different battling tops, also comes with an optional Extreme Track,
to send the top on something like a pinball machine ride.</TE>
<TE>   Hasbro's lead with Beyblade will be hard to beat, many in the toy
industry say.</TE>
<TE>   Toys R Us Inc., the nation's largest chain of toy stores, has
placed its biggest bets on Beyblade in terms of dollars and floor
space. But the company says it is carefully choosing and watching
some of the other brands as well.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers say Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other toy sellers also
have placed orders.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Toys R Us and Hasbro say, children are responding well to
the toys.</TE>
<TE>   At a Beyblade tournament last weekend at the new Toys R Us
flagship store in Manhattan's Times Square, Ami Kachalia, 9, spent
two hours testing and battling top combinations and ended up winning
her round of play.</TE>
<TE>   "I like building stuff," said Ami, who came into the city from New
Jersey with her parents and cousin to visit the store--only to spend
most of her time playing with the tops. "It's fun because it's really
suspenseful seeing who's going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Animated TV Series Seen as Advantage</TE>
<TE>   Like Pokemon and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers before them,
Beyblade also has the advantage of a TV series.</TE>
<TE>   Corus Entertainment's Nelvana Ltd. of Toronto hopes to find its
animated Beyblade series a broadcast home by this fall. Corus granted
the Hasbro license after buying rights from Japanese creator
D-Rights, a division of Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   But in the entertainment realm, Bandai hopes to give Beyblade some
competition. Bandai, the force behind the now decade-old Power
Rangers shows and products, is shopping around its own animated
series, based on its tops' characters.</TE>
<TE>   And Toymax, to be acquired by Malibu-based Jakks Pacific Inc., is
hoping that price, rather than brand, will move parents to choose its
tops, which sell for about $3 each.</TE>
<TE>   Features aside, Beyblade's biggest advantage may come from being
first.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you have a fad like this, being the first out is
important," said Jim Silver, the publisher of industry magazine Toy
Book and consumer magazine Toy Wishes. "Others could be successful,
but the first one out usually wins."</TE>

<HD>Currency's Volatile World</HD>
<DH>Money: Foreign exchange traders move huge sums quickly, but
the risk of another debacle like Allfirst, many say, is minimal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jake Lee scans three computer screens flashing numbers, charts,
graphs and news bulletins from around the world. A squawk box nearby
shouts prices from brokers in New York.</LD>
<LD>   In a second, Lee makes a bet. "Thirty-four," he calls out, placing
an order to sell several hundred thousand euros to a customer for
87.34 cents to the dollar. Lee doesn't own the euros he's selling, so
he starts hunting for the European currency at a lower price, hoping
to cover the deal and give his bank a gain.</LD>
<LD>   "If you're making money, it's a good day," said Lee, a 35-year-old
native of South Korea. "If you're not, it's miserable."</LD>
<TE>   Lee and his fellow traders at Union Bank of California in downtown
Los Angeles make several hundreds of such transactions a day, usually
totaling around $200 million, making Union the biggest currency
trader in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Though the action is fast-paced and overall volume large, the
regional bank, like most major foreign exchange operations, has
increasingly minimized risk by hedging bets, limiting amounts of
typical trades, employing rigid checks and balances and turning to
salespeople, not traders, to pull in customers.</TE>
<TE>   But as last week's $750-million debacle at Baltimore's Allfirst
Bank showed, the world of currency trading is in some ways still the
Wild West of the financial markets, as one trader put it. Unlike the
New York Stock Exchange and other major markets, the world's biggest
financial market is governed by no regulatory body.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no licenses we have to hold and no restrictions on us
as individuals or as businesses, except what we put on ourselves,"
said Johannes "Johs" Worsoe, who manages Union's global markets
trading and foreign exchange staff of 20.</TE>
<TE>   Currency trading has been far less volatile than the
roller-coaster days of the Asian and Russian economic crises a few
years back. But traders around the globe still move roughly $1.2
trillion worth of currencies a day. And in the trading pits at banks
and other institutions, even a swing of few tenths of a penny can be
big if huge amounts are wagered, as was the case with former Allfirst
trader John M. Rusnak.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last year, traders say, Rusnak allegedly bet $50 million
to more than $100 million at a time--much of it the bank's own
money--mainly on the hope that the Japanese yen would rise in value
against the dollar. But with Japan's economy in a persistent
recession, the yen fell 14% last year.</TE>
<TE>   Allfirst, a subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks in Dublin, Ireland,
says Rusnak, 37, ered up mounting losses by creating bogus option
contracts that were supposed to hedge against big deficits. His
exploits hark back to the days of rogue trader Nicholas Leeson and
macho world that came to be identified with currency trading.
Leeson's $1.4 billion in concealed losses destroyed Britain's Barings
Bank in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Back then and in previous years, individual deals involving $100
million were not uncommon, and "there was a lot of yelling, screaming
and hand signals--and a lot of mistakes," said Lan Yee Chan, a
25-year veteran who is Union Bank's chief trader.</TE>
<TE>   Today, computers, the Internet and other electronic tools move
deals along quietly, quickly and more accurately--although traders
also conduct deals verbally. Currency trading desks at major banks,
hedge funds and other investment houses have imposed such tight
internal controls--especially since Leeson--that a mistake doesn't go
undetected for long.</TE>
<TE>   That's why veteran traders found the Allfirst scandal
mind-boggling and in some ways anachronistic.</TE>
<TE>   Like many institutions, Union Bank has severely curtailed the
amount of its own money used in currency trading. Such proprietary
trading, which Leeson and Rusnak engaged in, puts the risk squarely
on the bank and turns the trading room into a pressure cooker.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, most banks and traders take a far more conservative,
risk-averse--and less stressful--path. They exchange currencies on
behalf of customers, such as a U.S. citizen traveling abroad or a
Hollywood studio seeking a million euros to film on location in
Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The customers buy the foreign money from the bank at whatever
exchange rate is pending at the time, and the bank takes on only the
risk of fluctuating rates.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't create shareholder value by gambling your company's
money," Worsoe said.</TE>
<TE>   The bank primarily trades for its customers, rather than
speculating to make big gains. The bank nonetheless bears some risks.
For example, if a customer wants $10 million worth of euros, Union
sells at the current exchange rate, hoping that the euro will decline
soon so the bank could pocket a profit. But the bank also could cover
the risk of the euro rising in value by buying options to repurchase
dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Worsoe's department added nearly $30 million to the bank's $2.2
billion in revenue last year, but the bank sees more value in
attracting and keeping customers.</TE>
<TE>   At 34, Worsoe already has 15 years of experience as a currency
trader. He started on the trading floor at a bank in his native
Denmark when he was 18, and then worked at the bank's U.S. operation,
the National Bank of Long Beach, before moving to Union.</TE>
<TE>   Worsoe remembers what it was like a decade or so ago, when the
stress from the job burned out many traders at a young age. Even
today, he says, traders often move up to management or into other
areas within 10 years .</TE>
<TE>   Worsoe, Lee and others at Union have college degrees, but for an
industry in which higher education has never been a prerequisite,
traders are paid well. At Allfirst, Rusnak earned a salary of $85,000
plus bonuses that hit as much as $200,000 a year. Union Bank pays
bonuses of $10,000 to $300,000, but gives the bigger bonuses to
salespeople, not traders.</TE>
<TE>   As with most institutions, Union Bank has set up walls between the
trading side and the operations side, which confirms the orders made.
A monitoring group oversees both operations. And the heads of each
section have no authority in the other sections and can't get into
each other's computer systems. The structure is aimed at minimizing
risk, preventing unauthorized trades and ensuring, at least in
theory, that no one can hide anything.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Allfirst had a similar safety net, but officials don't
know yet how Rusnak, with authority only for trading, made false
entries in the operations side about option contracts that didn't
exist. The FBI and regulators are investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Barings collapse, the failure at Allfirst hasn't caused
Union and other banks to revamp their controls. Worsoe said he's
confident that there are adequate safeguards in place, including
spending limits for traders, though he wouldn't specify the amounts.</TE>
<TE>   At Union's trading section, the day begins at 5 a.m. The staff
gathers at 8 to go over global events that might affect currencies.
During the 15-minute meeting, they enter about a dozen transactions,
and about 60 more come in from bank branches.</TE>
<TE>   Then the day's work begins in earnest as the salespeople work the
phones to call customers and the traders get back to the open deals
on their screens and the information they must monitor constantly.</TE>
<TE>   With all the money floating around, the traders have to reduce
their open positions--deals that aren't closed yet--to about $2
million before they go home. As they sleep, colleagues at other
institutions around the world watch Union Bank's open positions,
ready to close them to avoid big losses. Lee and co-workers Jeff
Sakamoto and Chan do the same for them.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, traders bundle up smaller deals to make one bigger
transaction. A package of deals worth $2 million can bring the bank a
profit--or a loss--of $2,000 with a swing of just a tenth of a cent.</TE>
<TE>   And some deals still can make veterans nervous, especially in
positions open overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "Some guys go home with $20million still at stake. I don't know
how they do it," said Sakamoto, 38, an 11-year veteran. "I couldn't
sleep at night."</TE>

<HD>Quick Action to Block United Strike Unlikely</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If United Airlines and its mechanics are unable to reach agreement on
a new contract by Wednesday, a strike could last for days before the
government would be able to intervene--a walkout that could severely
disrupt U.S. air travel and push the carrier toward bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   The mechanics, as expected, Tuesday rejected a contract proposed
by a presidential emergency board and authorized a strike Feb. 20 if
a settlement isn't reached before then. United, a unit of UAL Corp.,
and the International Assn. of Machinists union plan to resume
bargaining Friday in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   If they remain deadlocked and the 10,600 mechanics strike,
Congress is widely expected to take the rare step of intervening in
the dispute by extending the negotiating period or forcing a contract
settlement on both sides. But Congress goes into recess after today
until Feb. 26, so it's conceivable a walkout could last several days
before Congress could act. President Bush or a congressional leader
could make an urgent appeal for lawmakers to return earlier to deal
with the issue.</LD>
<TE>   Regardless of the solution Congress would choose, the entire body
would have to pass legislation at the Capitol to enact the measure
and "nothing would happen until they got back" to Washington, said
one congressional source familiar with the United situation.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, United is being hurt by a growing number of
skittish passengers "who are booking away from the airline," said
Michael Boyd, who heads The Boyd Group, an aviation consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   If a strike does occur and the airline is grounded, United--with
1,650 flights a day and hubs that include Chicago, Los Angeles and
Denver--would immediately lose up to $30million a day, and likely
would seek Bankruptcy Court protection to conserve cash, Boyd said.
United currently has more than $2billion of available cash, but it's
already losing about $10million a day due to the weak economy and the
post-Sept. 11 travel slump.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one major travel agency, Carlson Wagonlit Travel, continues
to recommend United to its customers because it's "quite confident
that this will be ironed out," spokesman Steve Loucks said. UAL
Chairman Jack Creighton said that if "progress is made [in
negotiations], and there is no reason to believe that it can't, then
we anticipate that another vote will occur by mid-March, without
interruption of operations."</TE>
<TE>   Union President Thomas Buffenbarger said union negotiators would
"travel anywhere, and meet around the clock if necessary, for the
next six days to reach an agreement." But he reiterated the union's
opposition to federal involvement, urging Bush and Congress to "stay
out and we will get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Bush already has used his main lever for heading off a strike
against United, the nation's No. 2 airline behind AMR Corp.'s
American Airlines. The mechanics originally planned to strike Dec.
20, but Bush convened an emergency board that kept the mechanics
working while it developed a contract proposal. The mechanics
rejected that proposal Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ready for a strike and we're moving toward shutting this
company down on Feb. 20," said Tom Reardon, assistant general
chairman for the IAM in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is unlikely to get involved further for the moment, said
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "The parties have
indicated they are going to continue to meet and work to get a
good-faith agreement," he said. "The president will continue to
monitor the situation, but that's where the action is now."</TE>
<TE>   The House Transportation Committee, led by Rep. Don Young
(R-Alaska), would be the likely starting point for congressional
intervention. "The basic indication that [Young's] received from
United and the union is that they believe they can negotiate a
contract," and Young "is optimistic that a strike will not occur,"
said Steve Hansen, a committee spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The mechanics, who haven't had a pay hike since 1994, rejected a
contract that would have raised wages for senior mechanics by 37%, to
$35.14 an hour, with additional raises in the coming two years. The
new wages would put United's mechanics on par with peers at other big
airlines.</TE>
<TE>   But with nearly 90% of the eligible IAM members voting, 68%
rejected the offer and 86% voted to authorize a strike, the union
said. The contract also covers 2,200 cleaning and janitorial workers
at United, but at different pay scales.</TE>
<TE>   UAL's stock, which is majority owned by the mechanics and other
United employees, tumbled 58 cents to $11.81 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Viacom Exceeds Forecasts, Says It Will Buy Channel 9</HD>
<DH>Media: Purchase of the independent television station, for
$650 million, would make it the firm's second broadcast outlet in Los
Angeles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc. posted a fourth-quarter loss, but the media giant beat
Wall Street's expectations and spurred hopes by indicating that
television advertising sales are starting to improve.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the company also said it has agreed to buy Los
Angeles independent television station KCAL Channel 9 from Young
Broadcasting for $650million in cash, gaining a second broadcast
outlet in the nation's second-largest market.</LD>
<LD>   Broadcasters such as Viacom, which owns the CBS and UPN television
networks, are eager to take advantage of relaxed federal rules that
allow them to own two stations in the largest cities. Los Angeles
would be the eighth city with two Viacom-owned stations.</LD>
<TE>   Viacom, which already owns KCBS in Los Angeles and 33 other
television stations, said the company would build on KCAL's specialty
in sports and news and would keep the station independent. Young has
improved the profitability of the station since buying it in 1996
from Walt Disney Co. for $368 million.</TE>
<TE>   The ad climate hurt Viacom in the fourth quarter, when the
nation's third-largest media company lost $42.5 million, or 2 cents a
share, compared with net income of $30.4 million, or 2 cents, in the
year-earlier period. Sales fell 5% in the quarter, to $6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding a pretax gain of $288million from TV station swaps and a
one-time charge of $159 million from layoffs at MTV and UPN, the
company reported a net loss of $140 million, or 8 cents a share.
Analysts were projecting that Viacom would lose 11 cents a share in
the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call Wednesday with analysts, Mel Karmazin,
Viacom's president and chief operating officer, said Viacom's huge
cash resources would allow the company to make other acquisitions
despite the economic slump of the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin said that advertising has picked up so far this year but
cautioned that this trend might not hold up. He said ad prices for
CBS' prime-time shows are up as much as 15% over last year. He said
cable and radio ad revenues also are improving this year.</TE>
<TE>   "People are generally feeling more optimistic about the
advertising market across the board in television, radio and
newspapers," said James Marsh, an analyst at Robertson Stephens.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom's shares rose 25 cents on the New York Stock Exchange,
closing at $43.41 Wednesday. Viacom derives 50% of its revenue from
advertising--more than any other media concern--and the company's
shares have dropped nearly 25% over the last year, largely because of
the economic downturn.</TE>
<TE>   Though CBS' television rival Fox took a $909 million write-down on
three expensive sports contracts this week, Viacom said it would not
be taking such a charge.</TE>
<TE>   In the conference call, Viacom Chief Executive Sumner Redstone
also attempted to put to rest concerns on Wall Street of a rift
between him and Karmazin. "Mel and I are getting along great, and you
should feel great about your investment in Viacom," Redstone said.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between the two media moguls spilled into the national
press in January, prompting independent board members of Viacom to
hold a special meeting this month. After being instructed to put
aside their differences by the board, the two executives have been
working to project an image of collegiality and cooperation, holding
a dinner in New York for money managers and analysts Wednesday as
part of that effort.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Pushes to Open Up Telecom in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Trade: WTO action is urged to break up virtual monopoly by
Telmex. Sanctions are possible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. asked the World Trade Organization to force Mexico to open
its telecommunications industry to foreign competition or face trade
sanctions, raising the stakes in a two-year dispute over the
$12-billion market.</LD>
<LD>   "Mexico's market remains dominated by a single company with a
government mandate to set high wholesale prices," U.S. Trade
Representative Robert Zoellick said.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint to the WTO, a Geneva-based body that sets the rules
for trade, boosts Avantel, part-owned by WorldCom Inc., and Alestra,
part-owned by AT&amp;T Corp., in their competition with Telefonos de
Mexico, or Telmex, a former state monopoly.</LD>
<TE>   Jim Cicconi, AT&amp;T's general counsel, welcomed the government's
decision to press the case because Mexico has been "ignoring its WTO
telecom commitments and hoping its trading partners would go away."</TE>
<TE>   Telmex's domination results in phone charges that "penalize
American and Mexican families seeking to maintain cross-border ties,
raise the price of doing business across the border and burden U.S.
telecom firms with unnecessary costs," Zoellick said.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's government, which began opening its telecom market after
an earlier U.S. challenge before the WTO, said it had no objections
to settling the matter again at the trade body.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of trade sanctions underlines U.S. dissatisfaction with
market-opening moves that Telmex and Cofetel, Mexico's federal
communications commission, have made since the first WTO case, filed
during the final months of the Clinton administration.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the earlier WTO challenge, Mexico reduced access
rates to Telmex's phone lines, lowered interconnection fees for
long-distance calls over the U.S.-Mexico border and drafted new
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration said last June that Mexico had to do more
to open the industry to international competition, including changing
the way Cofetel deals with Telmex.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. complained that U.S. companies must pay inflated charges
and are prevented from using channels outside of Telmex's control for
carrying their calls to Mexico.</TE>

<LD>Some people enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but it takes more than
tastebuds to fully understand the art of the vine. Fortunately, the
Orange County Wine Society offers a solid education for the curious.
This nonprofit organization, formed in 1976, hosts meetings on the
second Friday of each month at the Hilton Costa Mesa, with
mini-tastings scheduled throughout the year at members' homes. The
society is also active in the community, awarding scholarships to
students of enology, viticulture, culinary arts and restaurant/hotel
management. Its next event is the Fruit Wine Making Interchange on
Saturday at the Orange County Fairgrounds. Orange County Wine
Society, P.O. Box 11059, Costa Mesa, (714) 708-1636; www.ocws.org.</LD>
<LD>   In a similar vein, the Robert Mondavi Wine &amp; Food Center refers to
itself as a "hospitality center"--a place where people come to learn
about wine, food and the culinary business itself. With a selection
of wines from around the world, the Mondavi Center not only holds
wine tastings and evening seminars but also lets patrons hone their
kitchen skills in participation cooking classes. After its
Valentine's dinner tonight, events begin again the first week of
March. Robert Mondavi Wine &amp; Food Center, 1570 Scenic Ave., Costa
Mesa, (714) 327-8300.</LD>
<TE>   Other Orange County wineries offer tastings on a weekly basis. At
Hi Time Cellars, doors are open every weekend, with French wines
usually served Thursdays, everyday ones Fridays and cult specialties
Saturdays. Bread is also available to clear the palette. Hi Time
Cellars, 250 Ogle St., Costa Mesa, (949) 650-8463. Wine tasting
Thursdays and Fridays, 4:30-8 p.m.; Saturdays, 2-8 p.m. $20-$150.</TE>
<TE>   More on the eclectic side is Wine Exchange, which hosts thematic
tastings from Spanish to Italian to French, with complementary
appetizers to match. This winery has been in Orange County for 19
years and strongly recommends reservations. Wine Exchange, 2368 N.
Tustin St., Orange, (714) 974-1454. Wine tasting Saturdays, noon-5
p.m.; most Thursdays, 5-7 p.m. $8-$45.</TE>
<TE>   Beverages &amp; More, with locations in Brea, Irvine and Orange,
offers a "wine school" Saturdays in which participants sample wines
from around the globe. Of course, if wine isn't your favorite cold
one, the Irvine location also offers beer tasting every Friday.
Beverages &amp; More, 15315 Culver Drive, Irvine, (949) 551-3377; 875 E.
Birch St., Brea, (714) 990-2060;  2000 N. Tustin St., Orange, (714)
279-8131. Wine tasting every Saturday, noon-4 p.m.; beer tasting

<HD>GOP Hopefuls' Last Debate Gets Testy</HD>
<DH>Election: Disagreements over abortion, Enron and whether
spouses are fair political game continue during meeting at Long
Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK Z. BARABAK and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's three leading Republican gubernatorial hopefuls tangled
Wednesday night over abortion, Enron and whether spouses are fair
political game in a testy debate that sent their campaign hurtling
toward a bruising finish.</LD>
<LD>   The disagreements began with the candidates' opening statements
and scarcely let up for the next 58 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan responded angrily when
Secretary of State Bill Jones criticized his wife, Nancy Daly
Riordan, for giving money to Democrats. "Pathetic," Riordan said.</LD>
<TE>   Jones, in turn, repeatedly questioned Riordan's character. "We
just can't trust you," Jones said at one point. Businessman Bill
Simon Jr., who generally has avoided criticizing Riordan, a longtime
friend, seconded the notion, accusing the former mayor of repeated
inconsistencies in his campaign statements.</TE>
<TE>   The debate, held in a music recital hall on the campus of Cal
State Long Beach, took place 20 days before the March 5 primary and
marked the last time the three men will meet face-to-face. In recent
weeks, the campaign has seen Riordan come under increasing challenge
from his competitors while at the same time battling a barrage of
televised advertisements paid for by the incumbent, Democratic Gov.
Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the Republican primary will face Davis in November.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who is leading in money raised and in most polls, again
bore the brunt of the attacks. But unlike the candidates' first two
encounters--the last one just days ago at the state GOP
convention--the debate Wednesday night saw all three candidates
challenging one another.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who is making his first run for public office, set the tone
in his opening remarks when he dismissed Riordan and Jones as a pair
of "professional politicians" who "look first to government for
solutions."</TE>
<TE>   The millionaire financier cited his own background in business,
philanthropy and a five-year stint as a federal prosecutor to suggest
he would bring fresh leadership to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Jones responded dismissively, calling the 50-year-old Simon--who
is just two years younger--"a nice young fellow" who has never worked
in government and also failed to vote in several of the state's
elections since moving to California a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   He was even harsher toward Riordan, calling him "just another
big-city liberal mayor" and renewing his attack on Riordan for giving
substantial sums to many of California's most prominent--and
liberal--Democrats. That was a precursor of the evening, which
featured Jones again and again lighting into Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   When his turn came, Riordan brushed off the attacks and, as he did
throughout the night, sought to turn the focus to the incumbent
Democrat each hopes to beat in November.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray, you're a disgrace," Riordan said, peering straight into the
TV camera. "You get at your office about 11 every day. You dial for
dollars all day long. You've raised over $1 million a month since you
became governor."</TE>
<TE>   Accusing Davis of signing laws to support his political
benefactors, Riordan said, "Let's put California first. Let's pledge
that we will not sign any legislation at any time that we are raising
campaign funds."</TE>
<TE>   The discussion turned personal when Jones was asked by one of the
media panelists, Dave Bryan of KCAL-TV, about a verbal attack he made
this week on Riordan's wife for contributing $3,000 to Maryland Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it just a contribution," Jones asked, or is it a sign of
philosophical compatibility that extends to both Riordans?</TE>
<TE>   Simon agreed that the spousal support was "certainly fair game" to
discuss in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan sharply disagreed. Turning to face his opponent, he said,
"Mr. Jones, what you said the other day was pathetic, and your
explanation today was even more pathetic."</TE>
<TE>   He defended his wife as a wonderful woman and described her ties
to a number of Republican luminaries--ignoring her long record of
supporting Democratic candidates and causes.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates also traded blunt charges over the collapse of
Enron and the respective ties of Davis and Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan called Davis "the Enron governor" for the $119,500 he
collected from the company, and suggested Davis had traded favors for
campaign cash.</TE>
<TE>   Jones responded by citing the profits Los Angeles made selling
surplus electricity during last year's energy crunch and noted that
the former head of the city's Department of Water and Power, S. David
Freeman, was a key architect of Davis' energy policy. "If Gray Davis
is considered to be--as you stated--the Enron governor," Jones
taunted, "maybe you were the Enron mayor."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the debate turned on issues that already have been debated
in the campaign but that continue to animate the candidates,
particularly as their differences sharpen in the closing weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The candidates disagreed sharply over abortion, for instance, with
Riordan renewing his assertion that the party had to strike
anti-abortion language from its platform to send a more welcoming
message to centrist Californians and women in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "Pro-life or pro-choice, this is a shorthand way for women to say
if somebody is not pro-choice, they are not pro-after-school care,
they are not pro-day care for children, they are not pro-health
care," Riordan said. "There is no way that a Republican can win in
this state unless they respect women who are pro-choice."</TE>
<TE>   Both Jones and Simon took umbrage at the remark--and at the
implication that only a candidate who supports abortion rights can
also support day care or other programs for children.</TE>
<TE>   "We care," Jones responded. "We've always cared."</TE>
<TE>   Jones, who opposes legal abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or to protect a woman's life, accused Riordan of raising abortion as
"a wedge issue" to try to divide the Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also objected to Riordan's statement.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first time I've heard that someone who's pro-life
can't be pro-kids," Simon said. "Actually, I think it's the other way
around."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who also opposes legalized abortion, said he would uphold
the existing laws and further stated he would shun any single-issue
"litmus tests" as governor.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more convoluted exchanges involved the question of
whether Jones--the most pugnacious of the candidates--would pledge to
support Riordan or Simon should one of them win the nomination. He
never directly answered, finally saying he would "support the party,"
as he has throughout his 30 years of involvement in the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Later, at a news conference, Jones said he would support the
nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Simon showed no such hesitation during the debate. He promised to
show up March 6 for the party's morning-after unity appearance. "The
only question I asked was ... what's for breakfast," Simon said with
a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan did them both one better. "I will pay for the breakfast!"
he exclaimed, inviting them to his restaurant in downtown Los
Angeles, the Original Pantry--"9th and Figueroa," he added, to
laughter from the audience.</TE>

<HD>Clergy Scorn Funds Hahn Offered</HD>
<DH>Grants: Two African American clerics view the money as an
effort to keep them silent on police chief issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two African American ministers whose South Los Angeles churches were
recently promised $25,000 grants from Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn
rejected the money Wednesday, calling it an effort to buy their
silence on the mayor's controversial decision to oppose the
reappointment of Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.</LD>
<LD>   "We will not be silenced by any force," said Bishop Charles Blake
of the West Angeles Church of God in Christ during a news conference
at the church. "We don't want anybody in the community to feel that
this gift would cause us to alleviate our stand or to speak softly
when we should be speaking loudly for justice."</LD>
<LD>   Blake was surrounded by about three dozen ministers, many of whom
backed Hahn in last year's mayoral campaign, who say they now feel
betrayed by his decision to oppose the black police chief.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor said he is offended by suggestions that he was
attempting to buy support for his stance on the chief. Hahn said the
grants were some of the many that his office has given out since he
took office in July.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's just wrong to characterize these as having any
connection to any other issues," Hahn said during a news conference
at City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it makes any sense that somebody like [First AME
Church] Rev. [Cecil "Chip"] Murray or Rev. Blake or any of the other
ministers would somehow be willing to give up their rights to freedom
of speech for a few pieces of silver," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm offended that they would even think that's the way that I
operate," said Hahn, who grew up in South Los Angeles. "They've known
me for 20 years."</TE>
<TE>   The denunciation of Hahn by dozens of former supporters Wednesday
was the latest in a series of public criticisms of the mayor's
decision last week to oppose a second term for Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he is disappointed in the chief's lack of progress on
community policing, recruitment and the implementation of a federal
consent decree. Parks has said he has done all the mayor has
requested on those issues.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hahn expected his decision to upset some people, he said
Wednesday that he was worried that "troublemakers" were using a
"whisper campaign" to keep the issue alive. The mayor said he did not
know who these people were.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, several African American ministers said Wednesday
that they thought the grants they were promised by Hahn, which they
did not formally apply for, were attempts to keep them from speaking
out against his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "You cannot place a 'For Sale' sign on a preacher called by God,"
said Murray of the First AME Church. "It is possible that the gifts
may have come without strings attached. It does not appear to be that
way."</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 20, Hahn visited West Angeles and presented Blake with a
mock, oversized check for $25,000 to fund economic development. A
month earlier, he had given Murray a similar check.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, both ministers ripped up the mock checks in front of
news cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Blake acknowledged that Hahn had never asked the ministers not to
voice their opinions about Parks' reappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a strange coincidence of the closeness of the time,"
he said. "It would seem he had to know what he was going to do when
he brought that check to West Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The grants came out of $2.5 million in federal urban development
action grants left over from previous years, Hahn's aides said. The
mayor's office is now negotiating to give $750,000 of the funds to
six programs throughout the city, including West Angeles and First
AME. The grants had to be negotiated and approved by the City Council
before the programs could get the funds.</TE>
<TE>   "This money is for worthwhile programs that already are in
operation," Hahn said. "If they're not able to get the funds to
continue those operations, the only people who are going to be hurt
are the community."</TE>
<TE>   At least one minister who recently received a grant from the mayor
did not believe Hahn had an ulterior motive.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. William Epps at the Second Baptist Church in South Los
Angeles said Wednesday that he resents the implication that he or his
church could be bought.</TE>
<TE>   "All of us who have community programs have benefited from these
grants in the past, and I don't think there's anything wrong with
taking these moneys," Epps said. "I don't think the mayor was trying
to buy me."</TE>
<TE>   But many of the clergy who had embraced Hahn when he was
campaigning for mayor said they now don't trust him.</TE>
<TE>   "During the election, implicit in our support was the fact that
Bernard Parks would be reappointed," Blake said. "We feel the mayor
deceived us because he may even then have had very strong feelings
about the matter, but he concealed those feelings to our community.
And if we had known how he felt, we would not have elected him."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Frederick Murph of Brookins AME Church held a victory
party for Hahn when he was elected. Now, Murph said, he will help a
letter-writing campaign protesting Hahn's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Murph said he feels especially betrayed because he was one of a
dozen black leaders from South Los Angeles who met privately with the
mayor and the chief several times during the last month, trying to
negotiate an agreement between the two men.</TE>
<TE>   "He was dishonest, he lied to our community," Murph said. "He used
the African American community for his own advantage, and then he
decided he didn't need us any more."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he had not made up his mind about whether he could
support a second term for Parks until very recently.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor said he knew his position would spark anger among some
black supporters, but said he believed he had to speak out.</TE>
<TE>   "I could have done the easy thing," he said. "I could have kept my
mouth shut and worked behind the scenes and sent the signals of what
I wanted to have happen and not have my fingerprints on anything. But
I don't think that's leadership."</TE>

<HD>Teacher Pleads Not Guilty to Sex Charges</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge refuses to lower $250,000 bail for the
Camarillo High School instructor despite show of support.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a courtroom packed with supportive students and parents, a
Camarillo High School teacher pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges
that he tried to seduce or had sexual relations with nine male
students in the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, a 30-year-old science teacher and coach,
faces 33 misdemeanor and felony counts. Charges include supplying
teenagers with alcohol, showing them pornography and forcing teenage
boys to perform oral sex on him.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, Pridgen could face more than 20 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Roland Purnell refused Wednesday to lower
bail for Pridgen, despite testimony from students and a fellow
educator that he is "a man of his word" and well-respected in the
community. Bail is set at $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The court has to assume these charges are true in a bail
hearing," Purnell told more than 50 students, parents and teachers in
the courtroom. "Taking into consideration the trust he had as a
teacher.... Someone who would commit these acts is a great risk to
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen did not speak during the hearing and made no eye contact
with supporters.</TE>
<TE>   He remained in Ventura County Jail as of late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley pushed for the maximum allowable
bail after filing more charges against Pridgen on Wednesday. The
teacher is accused of having sexual relations with two of the nine
teens and engaging in lewd behavior with all of them.</TE>
<TE>   Additional charges are possible, Ridley said, as investigators
still have to contact several more potential victims.</TE>
<TE>   "This is serious," Ridley told the court. "His access to
high-school-aged children and his ability to drum up this kind of
support is a concern. We believe there is danger of tampering with
witnesses in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's Los Angeles attorney, Paul Takakjian, argued in court
that the public show of support for Pridgen indicates that the
teacher poses no danger to the community. Pridgen was considered a
"model citizen with the full support of the community as a teacher
and as a coach," Takakjian said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the Oxnard Union High School District have placed
Pridgen on paid administrative leave and assigned his four Advanced
Placement classes to a substitute teacher. District officials were to
discuss the matter in a closed session Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Several Camarillo High School students and parents who showed up
at court said they did not believe the charges, describing Pridgen as
one of the best teachers they had ever known.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally false; he's not like that," said 19-year-old Carleen
Pitts, a former environmental science student of Pridgen who now
attends Moorpark College.</TE>
<TE>   "I find the allegations to be ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Christine Tobias, who said she has known Pridgen for seven years,
said he was a great influence over her twin daughters, who both were
students of his.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good mentor and a tough taskmaster, who got the most out
of kids and the best out of kids," Tobias said. "Until he looks me in
the face and tells me he did these things, I will never believe it. I
know him too well."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen was arrested Feb. 5 after a sheriff's investigation
prompted by one student, now 18. The youth said the teacher showed
him pornography in attempts to seduce him, gave him alcohol and
masturbated in front of him on several occasions between the fall of
2000 and last month, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The student reported the alleged behavior to police after an
incident Jan. 31, when Pridgen asked the boy to see him after class
about assignments missed because the boy had been sick, according to
court records.</TE>
<TE>   The student told police that Pridgen then asked him to engage in
oral sex with another student in exchange for "not giving him a bad
grade during the semester," court documents said.</TE>
<TE>   Using a concealed microphone and transmitter worn by the student
during a meeting with Pridgen the night before the teacher was
arrested, police recorded admissions by Pridgen that he had watched
pornographic videos with the student and bought him alcohol,
according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   At the bail hearing Wednesday, Sheriff's Det. Scott Peterson said
his investigation revealed that Pridgen had Camarillo High School
students at his house on weekends for get-togethers that often
involved alcohol and pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "He would show them the tapes, and that would lead to other sexual
behavior," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   The behavior ranged from coercing students to masturbate or to
perform oral sex with him or each other, Peterson testified.</TE>
<TE>   However, Camarillo High senior Susan Trinh, 16, said she had been
to Pridgen's house with other students, and the gatherings usually
involved studying or playing board games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Mr. Pridgen for two years, and I feel he'd never be a
threat to anyone," she told the court Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's an excellent person and an excellent citizen."</TE>

<HD>State Water Board OKs Tough Runoff Rules for Southern O.C.</HD>
<DH>Environment: Local officials say regulations will cost $15
million more a year but may not improve water quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>State water regulators approved stringent new runoff rules for south
Orange County on Wednesday, despite objections from local officials
who fear the restrictions could cost the county and local cities an
additional $15million a year and still fall short of improving water
quality.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to be strong. We need to mandate. It's time for change,"
said Janet Keller, a member of the San Diego Regional Water Quality
Control Board, shortly before the unanimous vote in the Mission Viejo
City Council chamber.</LD>
<LD>   The south Orange County restrictions are intended to decrease the
amount of pollutants flowing into local waterways and the ocean. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified urban
runoff--water that washes car oil, pet waste and other contaminants
off streets and lawns into storm drains, creeks and eventually the
ocean--as the No. 1 cause of coastal pollution.</LD>
<TE>   The rules are contained in a new five-year runoff permit required
by the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   "This permit's a challenge," said Chris Crompton, Orange County's
environmental manager, after the hearing. "It's got a tremendous
amount of detail and a tremendous amount of requirements which will
be a significant challenge to implement."</TE>
<TE>   Key provisions of the rules, which apply to 11 cities,
unincorporated county land and the county flood-control district in
southern Orange County, include:</TE>
<TE>   * Requiring most developments and major redevelopment projects to
include devices that slow and cleanse runoff from the first rainfall,
which is typically the dirtiest because it picks up contaminants that
have accumulated on streets for weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibiting polluted runoff from flowing out of storm drains to
waterways. The runoff would need to be either filtered in the drains
or diverted.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspecting construction, industrial, commercial and municipal
sites for possible contamination.</TE>
<TE>   * Educating residents, city workers and others about the effects
of urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   County and city officials have said they are already spending
nearly $7 million this fiscal year to comply with storm-water
regulations in the southern part of the county, and they expect the
new requirements to add at least $15million to that cost.</TE>
<TE>   The affected cities are Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Beach,
Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Lake Forest, Mission
Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods City Manager Leslie A. Keane said the city may have
to spend more than $600,000 to meet the new rules--the same amount
the city spends on police protection.</TE>
<TE>   She said the city will fund this mandate by cutting social
services, transportation and recreation--a disappointment in a city
where the average age is 78.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are really critical services for seniors," Keane said.</TE>
<TE>   An attorney for the building industry also questions whether the
rules will work. The regulations are "highly costly, with marginal if
any benefit to ultimate water quality," said David Smith, general
counsel for the Building Industry Assn. of South California.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who have disputed the cost figures projected by
the county and cities, were pleased with the new rules, which they
say mirror the tough standards recently enacted for Los Angeles, San
Diego and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another brick in the wall," said David Beckman, a senior
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council's Los Angeles
office. "The thing that's most important is that the board saw
through the cities' smoke screen so clearly. They deserve credit for
sticking to their principles."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether local government officials will appeal the
rules, though one board member said during the hearing that she
expects an appeal or litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Similar permits elsewhere have repeatedly been challenged. In Los
Angeles County, more than 40 cities appealed to the regional board's
parent, the State Water Resources Control Board. Appeals at the state
level were exhausted for a San Diego County permit, so it is now in
the courts.</TE>
<TE>   A challenge is expected to another, less stringent permit that was
approved last month for the northern and central portions of Orange
County by another regional water board.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, county supervisors decided in closed session to file a
petition with the state that allows the county to challenge the
permit. Environmentalists also are expected to challenge the same
permit, saying it is too weak.</TE>

<HD>Dearth of Nominees Defies Rhyme or Reason</HD>
<DH>Verse: The state post of poet laureate, established Jan. 1,
has attracted little interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is a rankling challenge to state pride.</LD>
<LD>   Surely California has no less literary talent or affection for the
written word than Arkansas, Wyoming or the other 19 states that have
official bards.</LD>
<LD>   Yet with the deadline looming Tuesday, just 10 nominations have
come in for the now formal post of California poet laureate, about
one-third the number expected.</LD>
<TE>   Program organizers blame the muted response mostly on a time
crunch in publicizing the job, which came into being on Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Even they wonder, however, if leading California poets have
concluded that the laureate title will bring more headaches than
rewards. The post has already been fried on talk radio and newspaper
editorial pages (in verse, naturally) as frivolous and irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a circus atmosphere around this thing," said Paul
Minicucci, assistant director of the California Arts Council, which
is overseeing the poet laureate program. "If I were a world-class
poet, I'm thinking I don't need the validation from this and I don't
want to be the butt of jokes. There's adversity written all over this
thing."</TE>
<TE>   California has had chief poets--and chief-poet
controversies--since 1915, but before last year never specified their
qualifications, duties or term limits.</TE>
<TE>   Political cronyism often outweighed literary merit in their
designation. In 1966, the Legislature named former Assemblyman
Charles B. "Gus" Garrigus--then unpublished and best known for
commemorating each legislative session in verse--poet laureate for
life, enraging the poetry establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Garrigus died in 2000, opening the door for a new kind of poet
laureate, codified in a bill passed last September.</TE>
<TE>   California poet laureates must have lived in the state for at
least 10 years and achieved prominence through a published body of
work. Nominations must come from college literature departments,
poetry societies or other experts.</TE>
<TE>   In return for a small stipend and money for expenses, laureates
must give at least six public readings and take on a project, perhaps
coordinating with the U.S. poet laureate. They may serve no more than
two two-year terms.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the elaborate new rules, finding a poet who can speak
for and to 34 million Californians remains a delicate proposition.</TE>
<TE>   The state's literary structure mirrors its sprawling geography:
Multiple regional centers have flourished, but no single spot holds
clear sway. The Northern California poetry klatch has little to do
with its southern counterpart and vice versa.</TE>
<TE>   "They're probably going to feel they have to please everyone,"
said Suzanne Lummis, a poet and director of the Los Angeles Poetry
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Several noteworthy poets have begged off in deference to the
handful of universally acknowledged California poets, including
Pulitzer Prize-winners Gary Snyder and Philip Levine and former U.S.
Poet Laureate Robert Hass, Minicucci said.</TE>
<TE>   "Many have said they wouldn't want to be the first one," he said.
"They're very modest and tend not to want to be out front."</TE>
<TE>   But Snyder, for one, has declined to be nominated, for similarly
self-effacing reasons. Anointed last spring with the state's Gold
Medal for the Arts, he said, "I thought it would be unseemly to go
looking for more honors from the state of California."</TE>
<TE>   Modesty aside, he said some poets are loath to accept a state
office, fearful that lawmakers would try to influence or censor their
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "Any sort of official position is a disaster for the creative
person," said Lawrence Ferlinghetti, though he was the first to hold
the poet laureate job in independent-minded, contrarian San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Ferlinghetti, too, is uninterested in the state post. At 82, he
said he prefers to concentrate on his own work and to leave the bully
pulpit to younger poets.</TE>
<TE>   Practical and logistical concerns also may keep poets from
clamoring for the laureate title. Its still-unspecified stipend may
not be enough to persuade established writers to forgo other work or
to sustain lesser-known figures.</TE>
<TE>   Some in the poetry community call the nomination process too
paperwork-intensive and bureaucratic.</TE>
<TE>   "When I read the application requirements, I just went 'Oh, that's
too bad,'" said Joyce Jenkins, a member of the nomination review
committee and editor in chief of Poetry Flash, a Berkeley-based
bimonthly. "Top poets don't have 8-by-10, black-and-white photos of
themselves. The psychology of it is all wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the wrinkles and pitfalls, Minicucci says the
poet-in-chief nominees include at least one "really major" poet and
several others who have held the laureate title elsewhere in
California, perhaps in the four cities that have such posts.</TE>
<TE>   Lummis said the quantity of nominees matters less than the
quality--and the state's commitment to literary endeavors. "Poetry
does not need the state, but the state needs poetry," she said.</TE>

<HD>Accused Mass Killer Found Dead in Cell</HD>
<DH>Jail: Man held in slaying of six relatives hanged self,
officials say. Lawyer calls death suspicious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Nikolay Soltys, the 28-year-old immigrant accused of last summer's
rampage slaying of his wife, young son and four other relatives, was
discovered hanging in his jail cell early Wednesday, authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   Jail officials said Soltys apparently committed suicide using a
makeshift rope he fashioned from a plastic bag and strips of cloth,
then wedged behind a wall-mounted light fixture in his cell, out of
sight of a surveillance camera.</LD>
<LD>   "If someone is bent on killing themselves, they're going to do
it," said Sheriff's Capt. Jim Cooper, who oversees the Sacramento
County Jail. "Where there's a will, there's a way."</LD>
<TE>   But Soltys' attorney said he considered the death suspicious and
questioned how the Ukrainian immigrant had been able to pull off a
suicide while under intense scrutiny in a high-security cell.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm baffled," said lawyer Tommy Clinkenbeard. "How ... did
something like this happen with Nikolay Soltys being watched 24 hours
a day with a camera?"</TE>
<TE>   The death brought an abrupt conclusion to a case that shocked
Sacramento and sent waves of fear through the region's large
immigrant community.</TE>
<TE>   Soltys, who immigrated to the United States three years ago,
vanished after the August slayings of his pregnant wife, Lyubov; an
uncle, Petr Kukharskiy, 75; an aunt, Galina Kukharskaya, 74; and two
cousins, Dimitriy Kukharskiy and Tatyana Kukharskaya, both 9. The
body of the accused killer's 3-year-old son, Sergey, was discovered a
day later in a cardboard box tossed on a trash heap in a remote
vacant lot, his throat slashed like the others.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings put the slim, quiet young man on the FBI's 10 Most
Wanted list, and prompted authorities to whisk Soltys' surviving
relatives into protective custody. Many Ukrainian immigrants,
including some who did not know the accused killer, expressed fear of
him in the days that followed.</TE>
<TE>   After a 10-day, coast-to-coast manhunt, authorities found Soltys
hiding in his mother's backyard. He was captured moments after his
relatives, who were having breakfast, spotted him and fled the home
in terror.</TE>
<TE>   Barefoot, disheveled and carrying a potato peeler and a backpack
with the knife believed to have been used in the murders, Soltys had
been hiding for several days in an abandoned house not far from the
suburban duplex he had shared with his wife and son. He then traveled
on foot at night to reach the home of his relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Soltys suggested in a note he left in his abandoned vehicle that
he killed his relatives because they were "poisoning" his reputation.
He later told investigators that his wife had been disrespectful.
Their troubles began years earlier in Ukraine, where her family
accused Soltys of regularly beating her and at one point going after
her with an ax.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it is sad news that a person died, even though he did
commit so horrible a crime," the Rev. Valentin L. Kalinovskiy, a
family friend, said after learning of Soltys' death. "But it is over,
and it's going to be a little bit easier for the family and our
community. No more trials, no more decisions to make."</TE>
<TE>   In jail, Soltys was put on suicide watch when he arrived, then
spent three days in the facility's psychiatric unit in late October,
when he attempted to tattoo himself with a pencil. Soltys again
landed in the unit for 17 days in late November and early December
after he inexplicably jumped from the second tier of his jail housing
unit, breaking his heel.</TE>
<TE>   During those stays, Soltys refused psychiatric medication,
Clinkenbeard said. The defense attorney said Soltys remained
profoundly depressed throughout his incarceration, prone to fits of
uncontrollable crying. Mental health professionals from UC Davis
Medical Center evaluated him as recently as Dec. 11, concluding that
he was not suicidal.</TE>
<TE>   Clinkenbeard said he disagreed with that evaluation and raised
concerns about his client to authorities, but was unable to sway
them. In recent days, however, Soltys appeared finally to have taken
an interest in his own defense, after weeks of refusing to engage in
it in any meaningful way, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Clinkenbeard said jail officials should have paid more attention
to the possibility that Soltys might try to kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   "We've known from the beginning he was very depressed," the lawyer
said, adding that "the potential has always been there for him to
commit suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff Lou Blanas, who oversees the county lockup, said he and
jail officials had engaged in a round of "second-guessing" but came
away "satisfied this is a suicide" and convinced that jail staff had
done everything possible to prevent it.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a happy day," Blanas said, adding that he could never
put enough guards in the jail "to hold the hand of every inmate to
prevent a suicide."</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said there was no sign of a struggle involved in the
death. Soltys was kept in isolation for his own safety, given the
notoriety of his crime and the possibility that another inmate might
try to harm him.</TE>
<TE>   The body will be taken to neighboring San Joaquin County for an
independent autopsy. The death is being investigated by the
Sacramento County sheriff's homicide team and district attorney's
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Clinkenbeard, however, said an outside investigation seemed
warranted because the Sheriff's Department runs the jail and the
district attorney was prosecuting Soltys.</TE>
<TE>   If the case had gone to trial, Clinkenbeard said, he would
probably have used an insanity defense. Soltys, he said, had
breathing problems at birth and suffered debilitating headaches as a
youth. He grew up in a part of Ukraine that was not far from the
Chernobyl nuclear plant and was laced by heavily polluted rivers,
raising the possibility that he suffered some mental illness caused
by the environment, Clinkenbeard said.</TE>
<TE>   The makeshift rope was made from the inmate's bedsheet or part of
the cast he was wearing after his December jump, and a plastic bag he
obtained from the jail commissary, Blanas said. The cell's ceilings
were low, so the 6-foot Soltys would have had to lower his body until
the noose clenched around his neck and strangled him, jail officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cooper said the closed-circuit camera captures only a view of the
bunk bed in the 7-by-11-foot cell. Soltys died in an area near the
toilet, which is not in view. In addition, a microphone in the cell
that is monitored from a central station manned by deputies picked up
no unusual noises, Blanas said.</TE>
<TE>   Jail deputies fed breakfast to Soltys and noticed nothing amiss
during a 6 a.m. check of the cell, Cooper said.</TE>
<TE>   But when they came around for the 7 a.m. check, the small window
on the solid door had been covered with a film of soap.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies opened the door and found Soltys hanging from the crude
rope, facing away from the wall. Attempts to revive him failed,
Blanas said.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff said no suicide note was immediately found. It was the
second suicide this year at the jail, which normally averages about
two a year, he said.</TE>

<HD>State Ordered to Replace Old Vote Machines</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Los Angeles and eight other large counties must
update equipment by the 2004 presidential election, federal judge
decides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles on Wednesday ruled that California has
to replace outmoded punch-card voting machines by the 2004
presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson's decision is the first
ruling in the nation requiring the elimination of obsolete voting
machines in the aftermath of the controversial 2000 presidential
election. Similar suits are pending in a number of other states.</LD>
<LD>   The decision immediately affects nine California counties,
including Los Angeles, which have about 8 million registered voters.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson rejected the position of California Secretary of State Bill
Jones and several county voting officials who said that they did not
have the millions of dollars needed to upgrade their systems and that
it was not feasible to make a change until 2005.</TE>
<TE>   The judge issued a one-sentence order and attorneys said they
anticipated he would provide a more detailed ruling later. A lawsuit
over the machines had been set for trial Feb. 19.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was hailed by Daniel Tokaji, an attorney for the
American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, which last
year filed the lawsuit seeking to compel elimination of the machines.</TE>
<TE>   "This landmark decision means that by 2004, 'hanging chad'
machines will go the way of black-and-white TVs, eight-track tapes
and the Edsel," Tokaji said. "It does what the secretary of state
should have done years ago: upgrade the infrastructure of our
democracy by providing a voting system fit for use in the 21st
century."</TE>
<TE>   The ACLU attorney said he hopes that the plaintiffs can now work
out a consent decree with Jones that would provide a plan for the
transition to newer, high-tech machines.</TE>
<TE>   Jones conceded last September that two types of punch-card voting
machines approved for use in California were "obsolete" and needed to
be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   However, in December, Jones said that it would "invite disaster"
if some of the state's large counties were required to change systems
by the 2004 presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Jones, who is running for governor in the Republican
primary, said Judge Wilson "has set a deadline that may be impossible
for counties to meet with advanced voting technology. Several
counties will have to scale back plans to adopt state-of-the art
technology to meet the new deadline."</TE>
<TE>   Jones also said that unless California voters pass Proposition
41--a $200-million bond measure that would provide 3-to-1 matching
grants to California counties for the purchase of new election
equipment--on March 5, "many counties will be unable to purchase new
systems at all."</TE>
<TE>   State May Appeal or Seek a Stay</TE>
<TE>   Jones spokesman Alfie Charles said the secretary of state would
decide whether to appeal the ruling after consulting with county
voting officials. Other political sources said they believe that
Jones will ask for a stay of the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Conny McCormack, Los Angeles County's registrar-recorder,
predicted that "the ruling will throw our Los Angeles County election
system into chaos."</TE>
<TE>   "Requiring us to procure, test and install a new system in less
than two years precludes us from replacing punch cards with modern
touch screens because there are no funds currently available from the
federal, state or county government to do so," McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   She said attempting to make a transition more rapidly than is
feasible could lead to more tabulating errors in the next election.</TE>
<TE>   "The ultimate irony is this would be the exact opposite outcome of
that sought by the plaintiffs," McCormack said.</TE>
<TE>   But Tokaji said evidence developed in the lawsuit, Common Cause
vs. Jones, "shows that the nine affected California counties can
easily upgrade their systems" in time for the 2004 presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles is the largest of the nine California counties that
use the punch-card machines.</TE>
<TE>   In the November 2000 presidential election, 53.4% of California
voters, including those in Los Angeles County, used machines for
"pre-scored" punch cards, similar to those that created some of the
problems with hanging and "pregnant" chads in Florida. Ballots cast
using those machines accounted for 74.8% of all ballots that did not
register a vote for president in California.</TE>
<TE>   The error rate for those machines was more than double that of any
other system used in the state and three times as high as in
Riverside County, which used high-tech touch-screen machines,
according to the suit filed last April by the ACLU.</TE>
<TE>   The suit alleged that the wide variety of voting machines used in
California resulted in sharply disparate levels of accuracy, with the
consequence that a disproportionate number of votes are not counted
in some counties--including Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the suit, filed on behalf of five nonprofit groups and
eight voters, asserted that "a disproportionate number of African
American, Latino and Asian American voters do not have their votes
counted at all."</TE>
<TE>   Officials Admit There Are Problems</TE>
<TE>   Since the suit was filed, voting officials throughout the state
have acknowledged there are problems with the punch-card machines and
said they should be replaced, but have expressed reservations about
how fast change can be made, primarily due to a lack of funds.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said it would cost $90 million to $100 million to
implement a touch-screen voting system in Los Angeles County. She
said there are only four companies in California certified to make
the machines.</TE>
<TE>   "It is incredibly difficult," she said, to make a machine with the
seven languages now used in California elections--English, Spanish,
Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Tagalog.</TE>
<TE>   She said that if Proposition 41 passes, the county might get about
$75 million from the state. However, she said that the county would
still have to pay a quarter of the project's costs, and that she had
no idea where that $25 million would come from.</TE>
<TE>   McCormack said that when the county issued a request for proposals
seeking bidders to make a limited number of such machines for an
experiment in 2000, it drew only two bids.</TE>
<TE>   Al Fawcett, director of administrative services for the Sacramento
County registrar of voters, also said that it would be difficult for
that county to modernize its system in time for the next presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at a cost of $20 million to $30 million," Fawcett
said. "There is no money and none on the horizon."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Los Angeles and Sacramento counties, the outmoded
systems are in use in Alameda, Mendocino, San Bernardino, San Diego,
Santa Clara, Shasta and Solano counties.</TE>
<TE>   In December, the House of Representatives passed a bill which
allocates $2.65 billion over three years to improve voting
technology, education and training. A bill pending in the U.S. Senate
would give the states $3.4 billion over five years for the same
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Common Cause, the AFL-CIO, the Chicano Federation
of San Diego County, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and
the Southwest Voter Registration Project were plaintiffs in the suit.</TE>

<LD>   The tree, christened "Big Mo" by a would-be developer several
years ago, was spared in a first round of fire.</LD>
<LD>   But flames fanned by fierce Santa Ana winds returned to claim it
late Sunday, after helicopters had to be pulled from the Coal Canyon
fire to help battle a larger San Diego County blaze, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "The winds were unfortunately very strong. There's no way to say
for sure [keeping the helicopters on the Coal Canyon fire] would have
made a difference," said Ron Krueper, superintendent of Chino Hills
State Park, which includes Coal Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials on Wednesday confirmed the cause of the 2,400-acre
blaze as a 50,000-kilovolt power line that emitted sparks as it was
knocked to the ground by winds that reached 78 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "The line could be energized or re-energized when it's on the
ground," Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Stephen Miller said.
"It's pretty amazing that we were able to stop a fire in those
whipping winds."</TE>
<TE>   It took 1,000 firefighters to battle the blaze, which broke out
Saturday night near the Coal Canyon exit of the Riverside Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Officials estimated the cost of fighting the fire at $621,732.</TE>
<TE>   'It Was an Extraordinary Tree'</TE>
<TE>   The burned tree was one of scores of Tecate cypress destroyed or
damaged in the blaze. The stand of Coal Canyon trees was one of four
remaining in the United States. Only 11 others exist, all in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big loss," said Clarie Schlotterbeck, who had worked
with local activists for decades to preserve Coal Canyon and an
adjoining ridge covered with the rare, twisting evergreens.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an extraordinary tree," state parks ecologist Geary Hundt
said. At 30 feet high, Big Mo was no giant redwood, but Hundt and
others said it was at least twice the size of an average Tecate
cypress and was probably about 200 years old.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt about it, it was one of the elders," said Hundt, who
said the tree was ideally situated in a quiet, flat area near a
seasonal stream.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tecate cypress are fire-adapted, Hundt and others worry
that because of development in the area, fires may become too
frequent for them to handle. The trees' cones pop open "like popcorn"
after an intense blaze.</TE>
<TE>   When state parks personnel found Big Mo late Sunday, it was a
blackened skeleton split into pieces on the ground. But its cones had
burst open, spreading its seed as it died.</TE>
<TE>   Rains expected as early as this morning could help germination, as
long as they do not become too strong and erode the soil.</TE>
<TE>   There is another tree in the canyon bottom known as Little Mo that
could grow to be as big as its forebear, Hundt said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a large, healthy specimen," he said. "It was untouched."</TE>

<HD>Council Is Urged to Remove Barriers Around Civic Center</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite the latest FBI alert against terrorism, pressure is building
at Los Angeles City Hall to remove barricades that have closed
streets around city offices and the Parker Center police
headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   A City Council committee voted Wednesday to recommend that the
full council open the streets after additional security measures are
added. The council will take up the proposal next Wednesday, said
committee Chairman Mark Ridley-Thomas.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, the committee agreed that planters should replace the
unsightly concrete barriers now installed on the sidewalks around
municipal buildings.</LD>
<TE>   Security at City Hall, police headquarters and the Civic Center
area in general has been costing about $80,000 a month, according to
Jon Kirk Mukri, manager of the General Services Department.</TE>
<TE>   City Controller Laura Chick and two council members, Tom LaBonge
and Jack Weiss, have spoken out in the last two days in favor of
lifting the barricades, contending they waste resources.</TE>
<TE>   Before the committee met, a Police Department spokesman said Chief
Bernard C. Parks opposes the step, at least until March 11, when the
latest FBI security advisory is scheduled to end.</TE>
<TE>   "The same concerns that we have had about terrorism still exist
and, though it may inconvenience a couple of people, our underlying
obligation is to protect the people of this community," said Lt.
Horace Frank.</TE>
<TE>   But some contend that the expense and personnel devoted to
monitoring traffic and staffing the barricades amount to lessening
protection elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "While I think the threat of terrorism in the country remains
real, I think maintaining the barricades around three city buildings
in downtown Los Angeles is an inappropriate use of resources that
could better be used protecting the public at large," Weiss said.</TE>
<TE>   LaBonge said he fears the barricades may discourage the public
from entering city buildings. And "I don't think the City Hall should
be protected more than 123 Elm Street," he added. "I think we should
be consistent throughout the city.... I respect the interest and
concern of law enforcement, but I think there's a better way, and I
have to feel that if someone wishes to hurt us, unfortunately,
they'll find a way."</TE>
<TE>   Chick agreed, contending that money spent on extra Civic Center
security "could better be used in our neighborhoods and parks."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn has voiced similar sentiments in the past,
said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's expensive to provide this security.... We do not want to
see the present situation last, so we're moving our way through the
process, and opening the streets is being talked about internally,''
Middlebrook said.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, Hahn pressed successfully for a lifting of some
security barriers at Los Angeles International Airport, where some
terminal evacuations have still continued intermittently when
suspicious objects are seen. One lasted an hour at three terminals
Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, some streets remain blocked off near the
footings of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. In Sacramento, the
Legislature is debating some additional security precautions at the
state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's council committee vote, held in closed session, was
unanimous, with Ridley-Thomas and Dennis Zine the only two members
present. They also recommended that parking restrictions and security
cameras be added in the Civic Center area.</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said, "I think this is the consensus position and
the police chief will agree with it. It's both security-conscious and
constituent-friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking for Parks, Lt. Frank said the chief will review the
situation and may alter his position.</TE>

<LD>Detectives on Wednesday arrested a Villa Park woman, accusing her of
bludgeoning her husband to death during an argument at their home.</LD>
<LD>   Marita Hooton, 36, called 911 about 11 p.m. Tuesday from the home.
Police said Steve Hooton, 48, appears to have died during a fight
with his wife, who suffered stab wounds during the altercation.</LD>
<LD>   "She called saying her husband stabbed her and tried to kill her,"
said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's
Department. "When police arrived, they found turned-over chairs,
broken objects ... signs that a struggle had occurred."</LD>
<TE>   Deputies discovered the man's body in the garage of the home in
the 10100 block of Workman Circle, where police have been called
before on domestic violence reports. Authorities would not say who
had been the aggressor in those incidents. Hooton died from blunt
force trauma to the head, Amormino said.</TE>
<TE>   The woman had a knife wound to her thigh and bruises on her body,
police said. She was treated at Chapman Medical Center in Orange,
then went to a shelter Wednesday. She returned home to speak with
police and was arrested and booked on murder charges. She is being
held at the Central Women's Jail in Santa Ana.</TE>

<HD>LAPD Reform Is on Pace, City Officials Tell Council</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city officials on Wednesday told council members that the
Police Department is largely in compliance with reforms outlined in a
federal consent decree, even though Mayor James K. Hahn has expressed
dissatisfaction with the LAPD's progress.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor cited the slow pace of reform when he announced last
week that he would not support reappointment of Chief Bernard C.
Parks to a second term. He said then that he believes the department
is "falling short" in its implementation of the consent decree.</LD>
<LD>   But under questioning Wednesday from Parks' strongest council
supporter, Nate Holden, city officials said they thought the LAPD was
doing an admirable job in making numerous fixes.</LD>
<TE>   "They've done an outstanding job of meeting complex and difficult
demands," Chief Deputy City Atty. Terree Bowers told council members.
"Overall progress is good. Although some of the most important work
is ahead, I'm very optimistic."</TE>
<TE>   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "They have more than met the mark," said Miscikowski, who heads a
committee tracking police reform efforts.</TE>
<TE>   After the council meeting, however, a spokesman for Hahn
reiterated the mayor's views.</TE>
<TE>   "The consent decree is a floor and not a ceiling when it comes to
reform," said Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "We not only have to
achieve total compliance in the consent decree, but we need to go
beyond in reforming the department."</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing allegations that he might have a conflict of interest, a Los
Angeles federal judge postponed a hearing set for today to decide
whether Afghan fighters are being held at Guantanamo Naval Base in
Cuba in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the Geneva
Conventions.</LD>
<LD>   Civil rights lawyer Stephen Yagman filed papers earlier this week
questioning whether U.S. District Judge A. Howard Matz could properly
decide the case because Matz's son, Jeremy, is a prosecutor with the
U.S. attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. attorney's office is defending the Bush administration in
the action brought by Yagman last month on behalf of a coalition of
clergy, academics and lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Matz issued an order saying he was referring the
conflict-of-interest issue for review by another judge in accord with
standard court procedures.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Florence-Marie Cooper was selected at random
to decide whether Matz can continue to hear the case. There was no
indication of when she might rule.</TE>
<TE>   Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office, said that
Jeremy Matz is not assigned to the Guantanamo case. As a matter of
strict policy, he said, Jeremy Matz has no involvement in any matters
that come before his father.</TE>

<HD>School Board Maps Proposed</HD>
<DH>Education: The three competing plans would decide political
boundaries for L.A. Unified officials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG SMITH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The commission redesigning Los Angeles Board of Education districts
voted Wednesday to submit three competing maps for public review amid
charges of "classic gerrymandering."</LD>
<LD>   Sponsors of two of the maps sharply criticized the third as a plan
to protect board President Caprice Young by extending her district
from its Studio City base into the largely white west San Fernando
Valley. That would force the current West Valley member, Julie
Korenstein, into an East Valley, Latino-dominated district where she
would face a much more difficult election.</LD>
<LD>   The third map, drawn by Young appointee Michael Keely, would
stretch board member David Tokofsky's northeast Los Angeles district
in a long arc into the heavily Latino cities southeast of downtown,
where he has no political base.</LD>
<TE>   Representatives of Korenstein and Tokofsky on the commission each
submitted alternative maps that would keep Korenstein in a largely
white West Valley district and place Tokofsky in a less heavily
Latino district. Tokofsky, who is white and lives in Eagle Rock, has
just barely won two elections in his majority Latino district.</TE>
<TE>   Both maps would require Young to run in a new Valley district,
which is largely Latino.</TE>
<TE>   At issue in the three maps is how to give the Valley the two whole
districts and part of a third that its population dictates without
cutting up its representation.</TE>
<TE>   The commission is expected to recommend a single map to the City
Council by March 1, but has asked for an extension. The council must
adopt new board districts by June 30. The first election based on the
new districts would be held in March 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Backers of the maps that favor Korenstein and Tokofsky accused
Young's representative of classic gerrymandering.</TE>
<TE>   "He's putting his appointer's political priorities ahead of the
children of the LAUSD," said Sue Burnside, a political consultant
named to the panel by Tokofsky.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clearly not what the Valley wants," Korenstein said. "The
Valley wants two Valley seats, east and west, with the San Diego
Freeway as the boundary."</TE>
<TE>   Current Boundaries Had Caused Anger</TE>
<TE>   Young defended her map as the one that best respects neighborhoods
and school attendance areas. But even under her own plan, Young said,
she would lose all the portions of her current district in Hollywood
and mid-Wilshire, where she has formed close constituent ties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not perfect. Frankly, the other two maps are not perfect
either," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   The current configuration, with a portion of the Valley in a
Westside district and another in the northeast L.A. district, angered
Valley leaders when it was adopted after the 1990 census.</TE>
<TE>   "In some part of the Valley there has to be a portion going over
the hills," Young said.</TE>
<TE>   The map she endorses joins the far West Valley to the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein's representative on the commission submitted a map that
would use Cahuenga Pass to bring a piece of the Westside district
into the Valley. That map was drawn by Alan Clayton, research
director of the California Latino Redistricting Coalition, which has
filed lawsuits contesting political districts that it believed
shortchanged Latinos and African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Clayton said he devised that configuration by listening to Valley
residents.</TE>
<TE>   He believes it will ease resentment that still boils from the 1991
redistricting. He says Young's map will aggravate that tension.</TE>
<TE>   Tokofsky's representative, Burnside, drew Korenstein's district
into a horseshoe sweeping over the north Valley. It joined the Valley
to the Westside over the mountains in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Burnside said she tried to match communities of interest that she
believes link Sunland-Tujunga to Chatsworth and Sherman Oaks to
Hancock Park. Young said she believes that Woodland Hills is more
akin to the Westside.</TE>
<TE>   In drawing the new boundaries, the commission must try to balance
a number of goals that sometimes conflict.</TE>
<TE>   A primary goal, as required by the Voting Rights Act, is to
maintain each of the seven board districts at about the same
population. At the same time, the boundaries have to strive toward
racial parity. That means expanding the representation of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   Meetings on Maps Planned</TE>
<TE>   Currently, Latinos make up more than 70% of the residents within
L.A. Unified, but there is only one Latino on the seven-member board.
All three maps under consideration provide four districts with
majority Latino populations.</TE>
<TE>   Another goal is to try to keep board members' residences in the
districts they would represent. Keely's map departed from this
principle by including board member Julie Korenstein's home in what
would be Westside board member Marlene Canter's district. Clayton's
map creates a narrow finger that connects Young's home to the
northeast Valley district.</TE>
<TE>   The commission will display the maps and take comments Wednesday
at San Fernando Middle School, 130 N. Brand Blvd., San Fernando; Feb.
21, at Locke High School, 325 E. 111th St., Los Angeles; and Feb. 28,
at Brooklyn Avenue Elementary, 4620 Cesar Chavez Ave. All meetings
begin at 7 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Prosecutor Admits Altering Evidence in Murder Case</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A veteran prosecutor with the Los Angeles County district attorney's
office tearfully apologized in a downtown courtroom Wednesday for
altering key evidence during a capital murder case and hiding what he
did from the defense.</LD>
<LD>   Under an agreement he reached with the court, Deputy Dist. Atty.
Michael Duarte was fined $1,000, and contempt of court charges, which
could have resulted in a jail sentence, were dropped.</LD>
<LD>   "I find these apologies and expressions of remorse sincere, and I
accept them," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Terry A. Green
said.</LD>
<TE>   He called Duarte's offense very serious and held him in violation
of a court order requiring him to turn over unrevised witness
statements to the defense. But because of Duarte's admissions, Green
declined to hold him in contempt.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's hearing, Duarte stood with bowed head as he read a
statement. He was flanked by three members of his legal defense
team--two from the district attorney's appellate division and private
attorney Harland Braun.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish to apologize to the court, my office, the defense and the
victims' families for my actions and the enormous burden of a retrial
resulting from my violation of [the court] order," Duarte said, voice
cracking. He took a long pause before saying he already had reported
himself to the State Bar of California for possible discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte was not punished enough, some defense lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   "What he did was egregious," Deputy Public Defender Michael
Gottlieb said. Duarte "got a slap on the wrist," Deputy Alternate
Public Defender Henry Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Once a high-profile trial attorney with the district attorney's
elite major crimes division, Duarte has been reassigned to the
anti-truancy unit since his botched prosecution of a 1998 West Hills
case involving the murder of two witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   Last May, near the end of a months-long trial of defendants
Kenneth Leighton and Randall Williams, a law clerk at the district
attorney's office told her supervisors that Duarte had altered a
witness statement.</TE>
<TE>   Duarte had the law clerk, Jennifer Blair, take notes while he
interviewed a witness, who later testified about an alleged
confession made by Leighton. After Duarte read Blair's handwritten
notes, he crossed out certain parts and added others. He instructed
Blair to rewrite her notes with his revisions and then gave a copy of
the rewritten notes to defense lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   Blair's revelation rocked the trial, and the D.A.'s office dropped
its bid for the death penalty against the two defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' jury deadlocked; Leighton's convicted him. Citing
Duarte's "prejudicial misconduct," Green threw out Leighton's
verdict, declaring a mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   The deleted evidence "deprived the defense of evidence that
potentially would have impeached that confession," Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Leighton and Williams now face retrial in Van Nuys Superior Court,
where the case has been moved, and new prosecutors have been
assigned.</TE>

boxer Henry Tillman when he failed to disclose the background of a
prosecution witness who had been a police informant. Tillman later
pleaded guilty to attempted murder and voluntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "A prosecutor's job is to do justice," said Gerald Chaleff, the
former Police Commission president who was appointed by the court as
a special prosecutor in Duarte's contempt matter. "This case was even
worse because it was a death penalty case."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office also is considering whether to
discipline the prosecutor, insiders said.</TE>

<HD>Blast in Manhole Injures 8 Workers</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An explosion in an underground vault injured eight city workers in
the Westlake area Wednesday morning.</LD>
<LD>   The Department of Water and Power employees, all men, were about
to start working on a cable in the 200 block of North Vermont Avenue
when the explosion occurred about 10:35 a.m., said Gale Harris, a DWP
spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   Four workers were inside the manhole and four were on the street,
Harris said. The explosion occurred when someone underground touched
the cable they were about to begin working on, she said.</LD>
<TE>   "They were testing an underground cable line and apparently it was
still energized and that caused the explosion," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   Fumes also might have triggered the explosion, fire officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was determined to be a ... fire that flashes from fumes," said
Jim Wells, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman. When firefighters
arrived, there were no flames, but smoke was coming from the vault,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Five of the workers suffered minor injuries and were treated at
hospitals, Harris said, but three were taken to Grossman Burn Center
in Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Hanson, 37, of Santa Clarita suffered second- and
third-degree burns to the side of his face and his ears and hands. He
was in stable condition, said burn center spokesman Larry Weinberg.
Earle Hough, 36, of Littlerock suffered minor burns to his face and
hands and was in fair condition. David Ybarra, 37, of Hacienda
Heights suffered smoke inhalation and burns to his face, ears and
shoulder. He was in fair condition, Weinberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said the department is still seeking to pinpoint the cause
of the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The blast cut electrical power to more than 1,700 residential and
a dozen commercial customers, Harris said. Crews were working late
Wednesday night to restore power, she said.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Firefighters Trace Illnesses to Trade Center</HD>
<DH>Health: Persistent respiratory problems result in 25
workers' compensation claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the five months since they helped in the search at the World Trade
Center, 25 Los Angeles firefighters have filed workers' compensation
claims for respiratory problems they say that work caused.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the firefighters have significantly recovered with
treatment by specialists, but a few have lingering problems,
including coughing, throat irritation and breathing difficulties,
said Capt. Edward Bushman, the department's medical liaison officer.</LD>
<LD>   "I would say it was [caused by] the particulate matter in the area
at ground zero, including silica from the glass that was pulverized
when the buildings collapsed and the pulverized concrete, as well as
smoke," Bushman said.</LD>
<TE>   Not all of the 93 Los Angeles firefighters who helped in New York
for 10 days in September have health problems.</TE>
<TE>   But some, like Don Forrest, still have daily coughing attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still coughing every morning for about half an hour," said
Forrest, a 40-year veteran of the Fire Department. "It's a cause for
concern, because it has lingered for some five months now."</TE>
<TE>   Others continue to have problems when they are exposed to smoke or
other irritants, Bushman said. All the firefighters are back on the
job, although many missed work as they recovered, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Forrest said his doctor told him the throat irritation and
coughing will pass, but he and other firefighters who went to ground
zero still are waiting for final reports on what kinds of toxic
chemicals they encountered.</TE>
<TE>   Because there was not enough breathing equipment for all
searchers, Forrest said, he and other firefighters wore only dust
masks.</TE>
<TE>   The workers' compensation claims have allowed the firefighters'
treatment to be paid for by the city, which plans to ask the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for reimbursement .</TE>
<TE>   This week, more than 1,300 people, mostly rescue workers, notified
New York City that they may sue for damages stemming from their work
at the World Trade Center. Their claims are a first step before
lawsuits can be filed.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, a team of California scientists reported that air
samples collected about a mile from the World Trade Center in the
weeks after the terrorist attacks found extremely high levels of tiny
particles laced with soot and metals.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anti-Defamation League on Wednesday announced a new partnership
with law enforcement agencies to help deal with hate crimes and
extremists.</LD>
<LD>   The group's Law Enforcement Advisory Committee, which includes
representatives of 13 law enforcement agencies, was established as a
way for the Jewish anti-discrimination organization and police to
keep each other informed about the crimes and patterns prevalent
among hate groups.</LD>
<LD>   "It's important for officers to be knowledgeable," Matt Pitcavage,
the league's national director for fact-finding, said during a press
conference at the Los Angeles Police Academy. "They're the front line
in the battle against terrorism and extremism."</LD>
<TE>   LAPD Chief Bernard C. Parks said the sharing of information can
help prevent tragedies.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put a lot of energy since Sept. 11 looking at terrorists in
other countries, but you can never forget the terrorists that are
home-grown," Parks said.</TE>
<TE>   For much of its history, officials said, the Anti-Defamation
League has worked with law enforcement to combat bias and hate
crimes, but the creation of the committee formalizes this
relationship and brings more agencies together. "In the past we would
develop training programs for police officers and take it to law
enforcement; now we're asking them what they need," said Nancy
Volpert, the group's associate director. Volpert said the committee's
creation has been in the works since midsummer, and the Sept. 11
attacks only reinforced the need for it. Other law enforcement groups
involved are the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the Los
Angeles school police, the Highway Patrol, the FBI, the state
attorney general's office and agencies from Bakersfield, Palm
Springs, Pasadena, Riverside, San Bernardino and Santa Barbara. It
will meet quarterly beginning in March.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Alleges County Detained Teens Illegally</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Two agencies are accused of repeatedly ignoring
court orders to release youths from juvenile hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County has repeatedly violated court orders to release
teenagers as young as 13 from juvenile hall for days, even weeks,
after they were supposed to be freed, according to a lawsuit filed
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The class-action lawsuit, although filed on behalf of 19 named
minors, contends that many other youths have "suffered" wrongful
imprisonment and violation of their civil rights by design or
oversight of both the Department of Children and Family Services and
the Probation Department.</LD>
<LD>   "When a judge says that you get out of custody, you are supposed
to get out," said Manhattan Beach attorney Sanford Jossen, who filed
the case. "But that is not happening."</LD>
<TE>   Instead, the suit alleges, at minimum a "lack of coordination and
cooperation" between the Children and Family Services Department and
probation officials has allowed children to remain in custody for
more than two weeks after a judge ordered them returned to foster
parents or to other non-jail settings. In other cases, according to
the lawsuit, children's department employees unilaterally decided to
hold teenagers despite court orders that they be released back to
foster care.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with both departments referred calls to Roger Granbo,
principal deputy county counsel, who said he had not seen the
lawsuit. Granbo said he would not comment on pending litigation in
any case.</TE>
<TE>   The allegedly illegal detentions, according to the lawsuit,
occurred at numerous county detention facilities for juveniles. And
in virtually every case, the lawsuit alleges, the teenagers were not
only held when they should not have been but were never contacted by
Children and Family Services caseworkers about why they would remain
in custody.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, the lawsuit says, a children's department employee
allegedly told an attorney representing 14-year-old Mairon A. that
the teenager should remain at Eastlake Juvenile Hall rather than the
dependency facility MacLaren Hall because "MacLaren does not have
enough structure for Mairon." In that case, the lawsuit says, the
teenager spent seven days in custody at the juvenile hall despite a
judge's order that he be immediately released from custody.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleges that 16-year-old Cassie A. was placed in
Sylmar Juvenile Hall on Aug. 3 after being arrested for driving her
foster mother's car without permission.</TE>
<TE>   For the following eight days, the lawsuit says, Cassie remained in
custody without any charges filed.</TE>
<TE>   And during most of her incarceration, which continued for 11 days,
the teenager was strip-searched two to three times a day, the lawsuit
says.</TE>
<TE>   And in one of several cases alleging more than a simple oversight
by the Department of Children and Family Services, the lawsuit claims
that Shawana J., 16, was illegally held at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall
for five days after a judge ordered her release.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did department employees fail to call the teenager's
social worker, the lawsuit alleges, but they also "decided that ...
[Shawana] should remain incarcerated in Los Padrinos" despite a
judge's order that she be sent to foster care or a group home within
48 hours. Shawana originally was taken into custody, according to the
lawsuit, for breaking into her foster mother's home and taking a
computer game.</TE>
<TE>   "DCFS is supposed to act as a parent for these dependent
children," Jossen said. "But what parent would not pick up their
child when a judge has ordered their release?"</TE>

<HD>County, Ventura Launch Joint Dispatching</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After two years of contentious negotiations, the city of Ventura and
Ventura County on Wednesday celebrated the start of a joint fire
dispatch operation that promises to reduce response times.</LD>
<LD>   In the 30-year deal, the city of Ventura agreed to let the county
Fire Protection District handle all its fire and medical dispatch
calls.</LD>
<LD>   The actual transfer occurred last week without any problems,
officials said. County operators are now expected to handle an
additional 8,600 calls annually. Three new dispatchers have been
hired to help with the load.</LD>
<TE>   "The years of circling the wagons are over. This type of regional
approach is something I think we are going to see a lot more of,"
said Ventura Mayor Ray Di Guilio.</TE>
<TE>   Two dozen fire officials and politicians involved in creating the
deal gathered at the county's fire training center at Camarillo
Airport for a barbecue lunch to publicize the pact.</TE>
<TE>   "The public really benefits from the efficiency of working
together," Ventura County Fire Chief Bob Roper said.</TE>
<TE>   The deal also means the Camarillo dispatch center is the hub of
nearly all fire and ambulance activity in the county. Officials say
such centralized operations are rare because of high costs and loss
of control for cities.</TE>
<TE>   The holdout cities include Santa Paula, which has dispatchers
handling its police and fire calls, and Oxnard, which recently spent
$3 million on a new dispatch center at the city police station.</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Steve Bennett, who spearheaded negotiations
between the county and the city of Ventura, said he believes the
"public doesn't give a hoot" which agency is dispatching calls as
long as help is on the way--fast.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura City Fire Chief Dennis Downs said joining the county made
sense because service will be faster and more efficient. "I don't see
this as a power issue. This is a relief," Downs said.</TE>
<TE>   Three vacant dispatch positions in Ventura's police and fire
operations were eliminated in the transfer. The city still has a
dozen police dispatchers on staff who handle all emergency crime
calls. If they receive a fire or medical call, they immediately
transfer it to county dispatchers.</TE>
<TE>   Several speakers told of the many benefits of forming a union with
the county.</TE>
<TE>   The city of Ventura will save more than $500,000 by eliminating
three salaries and by not building a larger dispatch center.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement between Ventura and the county is the result of a
fight over sales tax dollars. In 2000, the city balked at having to
turn over to the county its annual $572,000 portion of county sales
tax income. The county then threatened to eliminate the 1.25% tax
altogether, which would have cost Ventura $15 million in revenue. The
solution was to continue to share the tax in exchange for the joint
dispatching operation.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say the deal may help the city retain more dispatchers.
Like many police agencies, Ventura's has spent years watching high
turnover and burnout among dispatchers because of stress, long hours
and low pay.</TE>
<TE>   The way it works in a city with its own emergency communications
center is that 911 operators act as both fire and police dispatchers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Ventura's dispatchers deal only with police calls, and
automatically transfer all fire and medical callsto the Camarillo
dispatch center.</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Council Votes to Censure Parks</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Two planning commissioners are also ousted. Angry
residents call the move political.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brushing aside angry protests from dozens of residents, a split
Thousand Oaks City Council voted Wednesday to censure Councilwoman
Linda Parks and oust two planning commissioners over a dispute
involving a controversial land-swap deal.</LD>
<LD>   The council voted 3 to 2 during the highly charged meeting to
reprimand Parks and dismiss Planning Commission Chairman Michael
Farris and Commissioner Nora Aidukas. The council also voted to ask
the district attorney's office to investigate the commission for any
possible violations of the state's open meetings law.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately after the vote, Farris stood up and said: "See you all
in November. I'm running for City Council."</LD>
<TE>   More than 40 speakers addressed the council during the four-hour
hearing at the Civic Arts Plaza, with most charging Councilmen Dennis
Gillette, Dan Del Campo and Andy Fox with using the issue to cast a
shadow on Parks' candidacy for county supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a total sleaze-bag move," said resident Richard Messina,
among about 80 people who crammed into the council chambers for the
special meeting. "This stinks. It's a disgusting political move. I'm
ashamed of you people."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a disgrace to have this occur," added resident Mitch
Rheingold. "Because you guys aren't getting your way, you want to
pull these guys off the Planning Commission? That sounds like Saddam
Hussein or Moammar Kadafi. We might as well pack up our democracy.
This is more like a dictatorship."</TE>
<TE>   The firestorm centers around a land-swap deal that would preserve
a 191-acre swath in an area known as the Western Plateau. In exchange
for the land, developers could build more market-value housing in
place of 225 senior and affordable housing units in the Dos Vientos
area.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of the council accused Parks and the planning
commissioners of discussing the matter in advance of the commission's
meeting Monday, in possible violation of state law. They suggested
that commissioners may have conspired to delay their vote so that
Parks wouldn't have to take a stand on the issue before the March 5
election.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the commission voted to delay its vote by a week, citing
a need to gather more information. The council had been set to vote
on the matter at its Feb. 26 meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "I truly believe the decision by the Planning Commission was
predetermined," Fox said at Wednesday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The Planning Commission majority acted in a matter inconsistent
and in conflict with their charge," added Gillette.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who has built her political career on protecting open
space, is locked in a tight race for county supervisor against
millionaire entrepreneur Randy Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say the Western Plateau deal has put her in an awkward
position.</TE>
<TE>   If Parks voted for the deal, she might be accused of assisting
developers, and if she opposed the plan, it could hurt her reputation
as a protector of open space, they said.</TE>
<TE>   In the proposed land swap, developers would have to build 50
affordable units elsewhere if the city can provide a location. But
senior advocates question whether this provision could be enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the deal would allow for additional housing to be built
on land at the Dos Vientos subdivision site that appears to be set
aside for parkland and open space on some earlier city maps. Under a
1996 ordinance championed by Parks, a public vote would be required
before any development could proceed on such land.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, Parks showed the land-use maps to individual
planning commissioners and city officials. But she said she never
arranged for secret meetings.</TE>
<TE>   At Monday's commission meeting, city staff told the panel that
park and open space designations had been made in error on the
earlier maps. They said they learned of the errors months ago and
corrected them.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners Farris, Aidukas and Claudia Bill-de la Pena remained
skeptical and decided to postpone a decision, despite protests by
their colleagues Tom Glancy and Jim Bruno.</TE>
<TE>   But Steve Weston, an attorney for one of the Dos Vientos
developers, told the council Wednesday night that the commission
acted unfairly.</TE>
<TE>   "The planning commission majority used fabricated questions and
false concerns to improperly delay the hearing," Weston said. "To
what end and what purpose? The political ambitions of one council
member, no matter how important to her, cannot be placed ahead of the
interests of the city."</TE>

<HD>Shah's Son to Speak in Irvine</HD>
<DH>Lecture: Officials invite Reza Pahlavi to a town hall forum
in deference to the city's Iranian Americans and expect thousands to
attend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying they have an obligation to the city's Iranian community,
Irvine city officials have asked the son of the former shah of Iran
to speak at a town hall forum in April.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said they will tighten security during Reza
Pahlavi's visit, which they expect to draw as many as 20,000 people.</LD>
<LD>   "He is a moderate voice of change and someone who really deserves
to be heard," Mayor Larry Agran said. "He is not the controversial
figure his father was."</LD>
<TE>   The shah was deposed more than two decades ago as opposition to
his monarchy grew. Whereas the shah was reputed to have used his
secret police force to arrest and torture those who publicly opposed
his rule, his son advocates democracy for his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   It is estimated that Irvine has more than 15,000 residents of
Iranian descent, and the city hosts an annual Iranian festival that
routinely draws as many as 20,000 people. City officials expect at
least that many to attend Pahlavi's appearance, scheduled April 7 in
the plaza in front of City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   A frequent figure on the lecture circuit, Pahlavi spoke at UC
Irvine last year. Though his appearance was orderly, a visit two
years ago to Dana Point by the Iranian foreign minister--the
highest-ranking Iranian official to tour the country since the
overthrow of the shah--ended in a bottle-throwing protest.</TE>
<TE>   In his talks and writing, Pahlavi urges opposing factions to work
toward a free government in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "His mission is not about restoring monarchy," said Cameron Beigi,
a spokesman from Pahlavi's office in Virginia. "It's about restoring
democracy so the Iranian people can choose freely the type of
government they want."</TE>
<TE>   Some local Iranian Americans say Pahlavi's message is important
for all to hear. President Bush identified Iran as being part of an
"axis of evil" during his State of the Union speech and anti-American
sentiment has swelled in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, personally, it's going to be an educational experience to
hear firsthand his views on the political situation in Iran," said
Arman Afsar, a Newport Beach resident.</TE>

<HD>Arrest Made in Theft of School's Money</HD>
<DH>Crime: Former Westlake High bookkeeper is accused of
stealing $150,000 from activity funds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators have arrested Westlake High School's former bookkeeper
on suspicion of stealing more than $150,000 from the school's student
store, sporting events and other campus money-making activities.</LD>
<LD>   Sandra Hofacker, 41, was taken into custody at her Simi Valley
home Saturday after an investigation that began in April at the
school, said Ventura County Sheriff's Det. Jeff Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Hill said Hofacker told him she took the money to support a
longtime gambling habit.</LD>
<TE>   Hofacker was charged with one count of grand theft with a special
allegation because the amount of money exceeded $50,000, said Deputy
Dist. Atty. John Vanarelli. She is free in lieu of $20,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   She has not entered a plea and a court date has not been set,
Vanarelli said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation started when accountants with the Conejo Valley
Unified School District noticed that money was missing from several
funds at Westlake High School, said Gary Mortimer, the district's
assistant superintendent for business services.</TE>
<TE>   Hofacker worked as a bookkeeper at the high school for 12 years
before resigning just prior to the start of this school year.</TE>
<TE>   She had been on paid administrative leave for several months
before that, Mortimer said.</TE>
<TE>   Mortimer said district officials have since instituted "a number
of checks and balances."</TE>
<TE>   The assistant superintendent declined to elaborate other than to
say that additional workers have been hired to ensure that employees
aren't left alone with large sums of money.</TE>
<TE>   He said the school generates more than $200,000 annually from
various events, including games, dances, the student store and
booster clubs.</TE>
<TE>   Hill said a security camera installed by a private security firm
hired by the school district videotaped Hofacker taking cash from the
student store.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts apparently began in September 1999, Hill said.</TE>

<HD>Residence Issue Hits Boyd Foe</HD>
<DH>Election: Seal Beach council hopeful Miller hasn't lived in
the city for six years, he says. No challenge has been filed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A candidate running for the Seal Beach City Council acknowledged
Wednesday that he hasn't lived in the city for six years.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Miller, a 71-year-old retired accountant challenging
incumbent Shawn Boyd in the March 5 election, listed his son's Seal
Beach home on nomination papers, he said. Miller owns the home but
rents it to his son. He lives with his wife in a Long Beach
condominium. Boyd has three challengers in the race.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said election laws require council candidates to
have their primary residence in Seal Beach. The law allows
candidates--such as students or military personnel--to live out of
the city temporarily, but only if they intend to return, officials
said.</LD>
<TE>   Miller said he is willing to move back to the city and live with
his son.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't live there, but I will if that's what it takes," Miller
said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has not lived in Seal Beach since his 1996 divorce.</TE>
<TE>   The question of Miller's residency came up at a candidate's forum
at City Hall on Tuesday. Miller said Seal Beach is his "domicile."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said Wednesday that a domicile in election law is
considered the principal place of residence.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he has deep roots in the community. In addition to the
home where his son lives, Miller owns vacant land on Seal Beach
Boulevard in Old Town, where he has been trying to build a home since
1987.</TE>
<TE>   "I own property here [in Seal Beach], I want to build here and I
have plans to build here," Miller said. "My car's registered in Seal
Beach, my driver's license says Seal Beach, everything I own is in
Seal Beach."</TE>
<TE>   City officials said they must accept what Miller put on his
nomination papers. If someone challenges him, the district attorney's
office would investigate, they said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the district attorney said no investigation is
underway.</TE>

<DH>Secession: County counsel says candidates in proposed city
would not be bound by strict L.A.-imposed caps.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sky would be the limit on campaign donations to candidates for
the first city council of a proposed San Fernando Valley city,
according to a legal opinion released Wednesday that said contenders
would not have to abide by Los Angeles' strict caps.</LD>
<LD>   In his opinion, County Counsel Lloyd W. Pellman also said
candidates for Valley and Harbor cities could file nominating papers
from July 15 through Aug. 9, provided the Local Agency Formation
Commission decides in April to put the two cityhood proposals on the
Nov.5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   According to the opinion, delivered to LAFCO on Wednesday, state
law would apply to such elections. The state does not set a limit on
fund-raising and spending in local city elections. Los Angeles city
laws limit contributions to $500 from individuals in council races.</LD>
<TE>   The opinion troubled campaign-reform advocates who worry that
wealthy special interests would unduly influence an election.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a serious concern," said Paul Ryan, project director for
the Center for Governmental Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Los Angeles has some of the best campaign finance
laws in the country," Ryan said. "To not have those apply would be
unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Ross Hammersly of the California Public Interest Research Group
agreed that the lack of limits could create an uneven playing field
for candidates who are wealthy or backed by affluent supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounds like it is a loophole that they could take advantage
of," Hammersly said.</TE>
<TE>   But Jeff Brain, president of the secession group Valley VOTE, said
he is not concerned that a Valley council election could be bought by
wealthy interests.</TE>
<TE>   "I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brain said it would cost much less to reach a smaller
constituency. Each Valley council district would represent 96,000
people, compared with 250,000 represented by each Los Angeles council
member.</TE>
<TE>   Although election of the first council would not be subject to
campaign finance limits, the new council could establish its own
ethics laws and contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   If the Valley cityhood proposal reaches voters in the fall, the
same ballot would include the election of 14 council members by
districts and a mayor elected valleywide. Harbor voters would elect
five council members at large.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Fred Merkin, special assistant city attorney, said once
a new Valley city begins operation--proposed for Jan. 1, 2003--the
four current Los Angeles city council members whose districts are
wholly in the Valley would lose their seats.</TE>

<HD>'Gray Ghost' Harbors Some Ghoulish Tales</HD>
<DH>Visitors and employees at the luxury ship report
unexplainable rattling, knocking and apparitions. And maybe a little
Tinseltown hype.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen Young's ghost story begins in the men's room. He finds a
woman in there, brushing her hair. He tells her she's in the wrong
place and she does not even look at him--just stares blankly at the
mirror and turns slowly toward the door.</LD>
<LD>   He glances away and when he looks back:</LD>
<LD>   "She's totally gone," Young says.</LD>
<TE>   He's so startled he searches the area outside this Queen Mary
restroom. "I race out into the lobby," he says. "I go around to look
for her." Here he switches to the past tense: "She was nowhere to be
seen."</TE>
<TE>   Young, a 37-year-old teacher from Westwood, is reluctant to sound
like a nut and concedes that the incident may have a logical
explanation. A film crew was aboard the old British luxury liner that
summer afternoon in 1998, shooting for "The X-Files" TV show. The
woman might have been "some method actress trying to freak me out."
She might have ducked into a doorway, or slipped down the stairs.
But, he says: "She would have had to sprint. I did not hear any
footsteps whatsoever. That is a true story. What it is, I don't
know."</TE>
<TE>   No one is sure what is, or isn't, happening aboard the Queen Mary,
a landmark described as possibly the world's "best-known and
best-documented haunted ship" by the authors of the Complete Idiot's
Guide to Ghosts and Hauntings. "There have been literally hundreds of
sightings of various ghosts throughout the ship, and they continue to
the present day," the book says.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts fill a hefty file in the offices of the ship's
publicity staff. Some are short declarations scrawled by tourists and
hotel guests. Others are detailed letters like the one from Ronnie J.
Johnson of Temple Hills, Md.</TE>
<TE>   He was a guest last June in the Queen Mary Hotel and reported
waking one night to see the light flickering above the shower--even
though the switch was off. Two nights later, the bathroom was
inexplicably bathed in a reddish glow. Johnson got up, fiddled with
the switches, and went back to bed. He awoke again, he wrote, "to
find a white, spiral-like form [like a snake] coming toward me."</TE>
<TE>   It glowed like neon, he said, and vanished as soon as he turned on
the lights.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Embellished Spooky Reputation</TE>
<TE>   There is no sense trying to discern the truth of such tales. The
important point is they are part of the ship's lore--and have been
since soon after the 1,019-foot liner docked permanently in Long
Beach in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Some stories are wilder than others. They come from eccentrics and
teenagers as well as business professionals leery of signing their
names. They involve disembodied voices, moving objects, lights
drifting through hallways, and even full-bodied spooks: for instance,
the young man in coveralls said to be seen every so often down in the
engine room.</TE>
<TE>   During one of the final voyages, an 18-year-old crewman was on
duty deep in that maze of girders, pipes and catwalks and was crushed
to death in hydraulic door No. 13. Reports of strange activity there
began while the ship was being converted to a hotel and tourist
attraction, says Ron Smith, the Queen Mary's historian. A security
guard was unable to coax his German shepherd to pass through the
door.</TE>
<TE>   A tour guide, some years later, was said to be closing up the
engine room when she noticed a man behind her on the escalator, Smith
said. When she stepped aside to let him pass, he vanished.</TE>
<TE>   April Baxter's story is not nearly so dramatic, but she retells it
just as she wrote it down well over a year ago. She, too, was a tour
guide. One day doors kept opening. She heard voices from empty
spaces. Finally, she says, she entered the first-class lounge and saw
an overstuffed chair balanced on its back legs.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried for some time to get the chair to stand like that"
again, she says, "and it was not possible."</TE>
<TE>   During the Queen's years of service, from 1936 to 1967, at least
16 crew members and 41 passengers died of various illnesses and
accidents. Some fell from stairways. Some were elderly. A number of
the names and causes of death are lost to history.</TE>
<TE>   The ship was repainted and known as the Gray Ghost throughout
World War II, when it ferried American troops to and from Europe,
using its speed to elude German U-boats. On one crossing, a British
escort ship, the Curacao, was knifed in two by the Queen Mary's bow,
drowning more than 300 men. No one aboard the Queen Mary was killed,
but the tragedy has attracted the interest of psychics. A few have
hauled equipment into the Queen's bow and reported picking up faints
screams and sounds of ripping metal.</TE>
<TE>   This, however, may be where the spectral hand of marketing begins
to show.</TE>
<TE>   Smith cautions that the Walt Disney Co. managed the ship for the
city of Long Beach for several years and apparently considered some
of the existing ghost stories too mundane. According to Smith, who
worked for Disney at the time, information from the psychics--who
seemed serious about the task--was used by Disney along with other
material developed by scriptwriters to heighten the ship's
"ghoulishness."</TE>
<TE>   'GhostCAM' Offers View of Art Deco Pool</TE>
<TE>   Writers embellished the account of at least one ghost and invented
the murder of a ship's purser in cabin B 340, Smith says. The
fabricated murder drew mention in the Field Guide to North American
Hauntings: "The purser has returned in the form of a restless
poltergeist that hurls objects, shakes the bed, rattles drawers,
knocks on walls and even grabs visitors. The unexplained disturbances
are so severe, in fact, that the hotel has closed the room to
guests."</TE>
<TE>   No cabin was ever closed because of a poltergeist, the historian
says.</TE>
<TE>   Current management, Joseph Prevratil's RMS Foundation, still
exploits the supernatural theme in a year-round marketing program.
For the $19 admission price, guests get the "ghosts and legends"
tour, complete with strobe lights and ersatz apparitions. A Web
site--ghostsandlegends.com--was outfitted in September with a 24-hour
"GhostCAM" aimed at one "vortex of ghostly activity": the ship's Art
Deco indoor pool.</TE>
<TE>   The camera is real and drew 72,000 hits in its first 12 hours on
the World Wide Web, says spokeswoman Robin Wachner.</TE>
<TE>   Elyse Bova was 12 when she stayed overnight a year ago. But she
talks with assurance of what she thinks she saw: a pale face in the
darkness. It made her roll over, and she felt a hand touch her
shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   She freaked out and woke up her mother.</TE>
<TE>   "She was like, 'Oh, it's nothing,' " the teenager recalls. "I
stayed up the rest of the night. I couldn't go back to sleep."</TE>

<HD>Agassi Returning With New Coach</HD>
<DH>Tennis: He's cleared to play again in San Jose event in two
weeks and confirms Australia's Cahill as new tutor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Andre Agassi, the conservative path of rehabilitation of his
injured right wrist appears to have been the correct one as he has
been given medical clearance to resume tournament action.</LD>
<LD>   Agassi is expected to return for the Siebel Open in San Jose,
starting Feb. 25, accompanied by a new coach, Australian Darren
Cahill. Agassi told The Times last week Cahill was his top selection
to replace Brad Gilbert but needed to receive the go-ahead from his
hand surgeon, Leonard Gordon of San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   The 31-year-old Agassi, who withdrew from the Australian Open
because of the injury, said at a luncheon/news conference in San
Francisco on Wednesday that Cahill will work with him during the
six-week, hard-court season.</LD>
<TE>   "With some real good direction, I've managed to make some good
progress, so I have high hopes of being ready," Agassi said.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon was also at the news conference and said the wrist is
"healthy at this point."</TE>
<TE>   The San Jose event would be Agassi's first tournament of 2002, and
only his second since getting married to Steffi Graf and becoming a
father in late October. Agassi had been preparing to contend for his
third straight Australian Open singles title when he hurt the wrist
in an exhibition against Pete Sampras two days before the event in
January.</TE>
<TE>   In an interesting twist, U.S. Open champion Lleyton Hewitt,
coached by Cahill for three years, is expected to make his return in
San Jose. Shortly before the Australian Open, Hewitt was hit by a
case of chickenpox, and, greatly weakened, lost in the first round.
Cahill and Hewitt parted mysteriously in December, and Hewitt is now
coached by Jason Stoltenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi has taken note of Cahill's success with Hewitt.</TE>
<TE>   "He's familiar with playing the game of tennis and he's familiar
with a baseliners' approach to the game, through Lleyton," Agassi
said. "I want to feel if I'm at my best I can win. I think it will be
that way for awhile longer."</TE>
<TE>   Cahill told the Melbourne Age last week that Agassi contacted him
a few hours after the breakup with Gilbert was announced. Gilbert and
Agassi had been together since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "I think working with someone who's as great a tennis player as
Andre is, and as dedicated and professional as he is, it's always a
great challenge to try and find other areas in which he can improve,"
Cahill told The Age.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi said last week that it has been difficult to hold back,
among other reasons, because he is excited about working with Cahill.</TE>
<TE>   "On the sidelines, it's tough. Especially this time of the year,
it's always been such a great time of the year for me," he said. "I
spent many years not playing Australia, and jumping into the year
with fresh legs, a fresh mind. Now it feels like I'm starting the
year a bit late and starting it, fighting off a lot of things."</TE>

<LD>   CAL STATE FULLERTON (4-17, 1-11) at UTAH STATE (18-4, 10-3),
7--Fullerton has not won since Jan. 19 when the Titans upset Utah
State, 65-51, at Fullerton. Utah State probably won't be looking past
Fullerton this time after moving into a first-place tie in the Big
West Conference with a 62-61 victory over UC Irvine on Saturday.
Fullerton is coming off a 70-58 loss to UC Riverside. Center Babacar
Camara tied a conference record with eight blocked shots.</LD>
<LD>   LONG BEACH STATE (8-16, 4-9) at PACIFIC (14-8, 6-6), 7, KRLA
(870)--Long Beach has struggled this season, but the 49ers
occasionally show signs of being a team that could make a run in the
Big West tournament. Long Beach lost to Utah State, 60-53, on
Thursday. On Friday, the school announced that Coach Wayne Morgan was
resigning effective at the end of the season. A day later, the 49ers
lost to Idaho, 64-62. Pacific is happy to be home after losing at Cal
Poly San Luis Obispo, 84-79--the Tigers' sixth consecutive road loss.</LD>
<TE>   UC RIVERSIDE (7-13, 4-8) at IDAHO (8-14, 5-8), 7, KPRO
(1570)--Riverside is not eligible for the Big West tournament, but
the Highlanders are enjoying some success against Southland
conference members. They ended a six-game conference losing streak
Saturday with a 70-58 victory at Fullerton. Idaho is coming off
victories at Fullerton and Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   LOYOLA MARYMOUNT (9-15, 2-8) at GONZAGA (22-3, 9-1), 7, KXLU
(88.9)--With Gonzaga scheduled to play Pepperdine on Saturday in a
nationally televised game, Loyola is hoping to catch the Bulldogs
looking ahead. Loyola has lost seven games in a row. The Lions were
defeated by St. Mary's and San Francisco last weekend. Gonzaga
defeated Loyola, 94-60, on Jan. 19 when guard Dan Dickau scored all
34 of his points in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine (17-7, 10-3) at Cal State Northridge (8-13, 7-5), 5:30,
Fox Sports Net 2, KUCI-FM (88.9), KCSN-FM (88.5)--Northridge ended
Irvine's school-record 19-game home winning streak on Jan. 19, but
the Matadors have lost three in a row. In those three road losses,
they didn't shoot better than 37% from the field. Guard Markus Carr
had a career-high 31 points against Irvine in that 73-72 overtime
victory. The Anteaters are coming off a 62-61 loss to Utah State on
Saturday and are tied for first with the Aggies. Irvine leads the
conference in field-goal percentage at 48.2%, which also ranks 14th
in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine (17-6, 10-0) at Portland (5-19, 1-9), 7, KPLS
(830)--The Waves are tied with Western Kentucky for the longest
active winning streak in the nation at 12 games. They continue to
hold a one-game lead over Gonzaga for first place but must not get
caught looking ahead to the anticipated nationally televised showdown
Saturday in Spokane. Senior center Cedric Suitt needs one blocked
shot to break Geoff Lear's career mark of 153. Portland, in its first
year with Michael Holton as coach, has lost 15 of its last 16 games.
Pepperdine won, 109-88, at Firestone Fieldhouse in January.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WOMEN</TE>
<TE>   UCLA (7-16, 3-11) at Arizona (12-12, 8-7), 7, KACD (850), KEWS
(1350)--This is a potential pairing in the first round of the Pac-10
tournament. Arizona is the second highest-scoring team in the
conference at 75.2 points a game. The Wildcats are led by forward
Elizabeth Pickney (17.1 points). With a 21-point effort against USC,
guard Whitney Jones has become UCLA's leading scorer (9.1).</TE>
<TE>   USC (13-10, 9-5) at Arizona State (19-7, 10-5), 7--This is the
biggest game of the season for USC (at least until next week's
showdown against Stanford). The third-place Trojans trail the Sun
Devils by a half-game in the conference standings, and are a half
game ahead of Oregon State. Guard Tiffany Elmore did not score
against UCLA last week, but her return to the lineup after missing
six games with a sprained ankle gave the Trojans a needed lift.</TE>

<KH>GOLF THOMAS BONK</KH>
<HD>Duval's Aiming High Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Probably the most recognizable snowboarder in Sun Valley, Idaho, last
week was David Duval, who was either on his board practicing his
technique or inside watching the Olympics and letting his chin
whiskers grow. It's amazing, Duval said, to study the snowboarders,
for one huge reason: "Those dudes are getting way high!"</LD>
<LD>   Well, yes, they are, which brings us back down to earth,
specifically the golf course at Riviera Country Club, where Duval is
playing for the first time since he withdrew from the Phoenix Open
three weeks ago. As for snowboarding, Duval says his elevation is
sort of limited.</LD>
<LD>   "I only get a couple of feet off the ground," he said. For the
Nissan Open, Duval plans to keep both feet on the ground and return
to those thrilling days of 1998 and 1999 when he was healthy, happy
and winning everything in sight. You can't help but be happy when you
win all the time, like Duval did.</LD>
<TE>   Even though he's won twice in the last two years, including his
first major title at the British Open and was second at the Masters
last year, Duval is steadfast in his assertion he could have done a
lot better.</TE>
<TE>   "My one goal is to play like I did a few years ago," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Duval has worked through a bad back and a bad wrist and said that
as odd as it sounds, it took a long time to get out of the bad habits
he picked up to compensate for his injuries. A 13-time winner with
more than $15 million in career earnings, Duval says he played too
many tournaments in too many places at the end of the year and the
beginning of this year, so he pulled out of Phoenix to keep himself
together.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, my schedule was just too much," he said. Duval has not
played since the Hope, where he was 18 under but only tied for 48th.
He was 12th at the Mercedes Championships. Even though Duval has
played only two events, he has won $102,320 and is 67th on the money
list.</TE>
<TE>   And for this week, Duval has one more specific goal: "Hopefully,
win a golf tournament."</TE>
<TE>   Darren Time</TE>
<TE>   When he's playing a tournament and watching the highlights in his
hotel room, Darren Clarke hears the phone ring and knows who is
usually calling. It's Butch Harmon, Clarke's coach, and he has a
standard message: "Boy, you were swinging bad today," Clarke said
Harmon tells him.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully those bad-swinging days aren't going to happen this week
at Riviera, where Clarke plays his first event of the year on either
tour.</TE>
<TE>   To make sure he's swinging well, Clarke spent the weekend working
on his swing with Harmon at his club in Las Vegas, specifically
controlling the flight of the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke has packed his bag full of new Taylor Made clubs, a new
Scotty Cameron putter and a new, brighter outlook.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to play solid," Clarke said. "Try to get my swing in
the right path again."</TE>
<TE>   Clarke won three European Tour titles in 2001 and he was also
third at the British Open at Royal Lytham. He played just seven PGA
Tour events and may add only two more to his schedule this year. And
Clarke wants to get off to a good start at Riviera, for obvious
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a huge run, right up to the Masters," said Clarke, who won
the 2000 Match Play Championship at La Costa, the $5-million event
that's back at La Costa next week.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be nice to get off to a good start," said Clarke, who
listed his new equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "New driver, new irons, new putter, same old cigar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Word Picture</TE>
<TE>   This week's award for colorful language goes to the Sydney Morning
Herald about the weather at the ANC Championship: "After two days of
inaction because of the big wet, players came out like rabbits from a
burrow when the ferret has been let loose."</TE>
<TE>   We can only imagine the furry scene.</TE>
<TE>   Blow Out the Candles</TE>
<TE>   News item: Last week was the first anniversary of Aaron Baddeley's
one and only professional victory, at the ANC Championship in Sydney,
Australia. To try to get him on the right track, Baddeley had a
heart-to-heart pep talk with sports psychologist Bob Rotella. The
advice, according to Baddeley, was "get out of your own way."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Excellent idea, especially if your foot is between the
ball and the hole.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Baddeley tied for 53rd in Sydney. He plays in Tucson next
week.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Out the Schedule</TE>
<TE>   After missing the cut at Pebble Beach and then the Buick
Invitational, Phil Mickelson has missed more cuts in the last two
weeks than Tiger Woods has in the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   More Cut News</TE>
<TE>   We already know one guy who's sure to miss the cut this week at
Riviera. Why, it's last year's winner, Robert Allenby. How do we know
this? It's trendy. The defending champions at the last four
tournaments missed the cut: Mickelson at Torrey Pines, Joe Durant at
the Hope, Mark Calcavecchia at Phoenix and Davis Love III at Pebble
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Short Stuff</TE>
<TE>   The question-and-answer of the week, media department, Buick
Invitational division, was handled by Mark O'Meara.</TE>
<TE>   Question: "How did you find the length?"</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara: "Long."</TE>
<TE>   Triage Unit</TE>
<TE>   Third-round co-leader Jerry Kelly didn't feel so well about his
game after he closed with a 73 at Torrey Pines and fell to a tie for
eighth, so he did what everybody should do. He went to the movies.
Actually, Kelly studied videos of himself when he won the Sony Open
five weeks ago and knew immediately he wasn't turning his back the
same way on his takeaway.</TE>
<TE>   Said Kelly: "That was the Band-Aid I needed."</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, Kelly might be hitting it off his knee and still be
doing all right, considering how much money he's made.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly is No. 2 (trailing Chris DiMarco) on the money list with
$984,400 in four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hoch donated $20,000 of his $300,000 prize money from the
Williams World Challenge to the Tiger Woods Foundation. Woods donated
his entire $1-million first-place check.... Artist Scott Medlock, who
created artwork featuring Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Ben Hogan,
will embellish the painting with creations from this week's Nissan
Open and donate the piece Sunday to the Los Angeles Junior Chamber of
Commerce.... Industry Hills Golf Club has completed a $1.5-million
renovation of its driving range and practice facility.</TE>

<HD>He Also Displays Multiple Courage</HD>
<DH>Golf: Massingham hasn't let multiple sclerosis stop him
from competing in sport he loves. He will tee off in Nissan Open
today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he stood in his place at the driving range at Riviera, Brett
Massingham took a look around and wondered if he belonged. It's not
only  because Massingham is a club pro. It's not because he had to
qualify. It isn't because he has never played a pro event.</LD>
<LD>   What sets Massingham apart is his illness. The 37-year-old from
Marbella Country Club in San Juan Capistrano was diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis six years ago, a couple of months after he
couldn't pull himself out of a bunker while playing a tournament at
La Quinta.</LD>
<LD>   He is the only known player with MS to play in a pro golf event,
but that's not close to how Massingham wants to be known. He just
wants to play the Nissan Open.</LD>
<TE>   "I can play golf," he says. "I don't know about this level, under
these conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "A successful week for me would be to make the cut and enjoy
myself to the fullest. If I'm not smiling and enjoying it, I'm not
having any success. This could be my only time. I can't win, I know
that, I just want to get out there and play golf and walk in their
shoes for awhile."</TE>
<TE>   Walking in Massingham's shoes is something that few can
appreciate. Dennis Paulson, who played a practice round with
Massingham on Tuesday, says he can't fully understand how his friend
can handle the illness so well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's absolutely awesome he qualified," Paulson said. "He's a
great kid. Being around him, you understand there's a lot bigger
things than golf. He's a real spirit and a showcase for people who
also have that disease."</TE>
<TE>   Massingham, from Rancho Santa Margarita, played the South Pacific
Tour in 1992 and in 1993, he was an alternate for the Hogan Tour's
Bakersfield Event. He also qualified for the Bakersfield event in
1994. When he played the 1995 PGA Apprentice Championship at La
Quinta's Dunes Course, he fell face first into a bunker and thought
he had heatstroke.</TE>
<TE>   He began having seizures and he visited five doctors who had
difficulty in diagnosing his problem.  One doctor said he had a brain
tumor. But after undergoing  a spinal tap, Massingham learned he had
multiple sclerosis, a degenerative disease that destroys tissue
around nerve endings and whose effects range from seizures to
paralysis.</TE>
<TE>   At  his lowest point, Massingham counted 120 seizures in one day
and he lost 65 pounds. He was blind in one eye for nearly a week.</TE>
<TE>   Steroid injections  began to help almost immediately and within 10
months, he was ready to play golf again. Although he still has
headaches, weakness and dizziness,  Massingham gives himself
injections every other day and his illness appears to be in
remission.</TE>
<TE>   When he tees off today, Massingham will be playing golf, no matter
how remote that possibility might have seemed.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't measure heart, you can't measure determination."</TE>

(113).</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched him play since he was 14," Nelson said. "He has the
ability to make a shot or putt, when he needs it real bad, better
than anyone I know."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hardly sympathetic: The Denver Post's Terry Frei, commenting on
the coaching carousel in the NHL, has trouble feeling too sorry for
these new members of the ranks of the unemployed: "When the Stars
fired Coach Ken Hitchcock last week, 'Hitch' had two years remaining
at $1.1 million a season on his deal. He isn't going to have to go
back to selling equipment in Edmonton and coaching youth hockey to
make a living."</TE>

<TE>   Remember? Dick "Night Train" Lane, the Hall of Fame NFL cornerback
who died recently, had a memorable nickname. Fred Mitchell of the
Chicago Tribune recalled some other distinctive nicknames. A
sampling: Running backs L.G. "Long Gone" Dupree, Howard "Hopalong"
Cassady, Alan "the Horse" Ameche, linemen Johnny "Blood" McNally,
Eugene "Big Daddy" Lipscomb and William "Refrigerator" Perry, and
receiver Elroy "Crazy Legs" Hirsch.</TE>

<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1975, Julius Erving of the New York
Nets scored 63 points in a 176-166 four-overtime loss to the San
Diego Conquistadors.</TE>
<TE>   It's not surprising that the 342 points set an American Basketball
Assn. record.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Magic Johnson, 24, against Denver in 1989 and
Phoenix in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: George Andrews, a longtime NBA player agent, switched
sides several years ago and became assistant general manager of the
Grizzlies in Vancouver and Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   Andrews, who recently left the organization and is thinking of
writing his memoirs, said: "I went from representing poor downtrodden
millionaires to poor downtrodden billionaires."</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fourth-ranked Oklahoma brought out the best in struggling Oklahoma
State.</LD>
<LD>   The 16th-ranked Cowboys, who had lost five of eight, got a
career-high 22 points from Ivan McFarlin and a double-double from
Melvin Sanders to beat the Sooners, 79-72, in overtime Wednesday
night at Stillwater, Okla.</LD>
<LD>   McFarlin scored three consecutive baskets and had eight points in
overtime, helping Oklahoma State, 19-6 overall and 6-5 in the Big 12,
win without leading scorer Maurice Baker, who sat out his second
consecutive game because of a sprained ankle.</LD>
<TE>   "We needed to win it bad," said Sanders, who had 12 points and 11
rebounds. "Probably nobody thought we could win, but this is going to
help us out a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma Coach Kelvin Sampson said he never doubted the Cowboys
would give his team all it could handle, even though Oklahoma State
didn't play well in losing at Fresno State on Sunday without Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "Basketball is a game of today," Sampson said. "That was last
Sunday. Today, they were good and that was a tough team out there
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma (19-4, 8-3) got 27 points and 11 rebounds from Aaron
McGhee, but scored only one  basket in the final 1:30 of over- time.</TE>
<TE>   McFarlin scored consecutive inside baskets on assists from Victor
Williams to give Oklahoma State a 69-67 lead with 2:18 left. McFarlin
then stole a pass took it the other way for a dunk and a four-point
lead at the 1:57 mark.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make big plays and have to make defensive plays in
order to make a big gap in the game," McFarlin said. "Fortunately
that steal, it made a big presence on the scoreboard."</TE>
<TE>   Fredrik Jonzen had 19 points for the Cowboys. Jason Detrick had 15
points for Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Maryland 85, Georgia Tech 65--Lonny Baxter had 22 points and
10 rebounds for the Terrapins (20-3, 10-1 in the Atlantic Coast
Conference) at College Park, Md.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland had never won 10 of its first 11 conference games.
Maryland, which last won the ACC regular-season title in 1980, has
won seven in a row. The 20-3 start matches the 1974-75 team for best
in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Wilcox had 14 points and 12 rebounds and Juan Dixon, despite
missing his nine three-point shots, scored 14 for the Terrapins.</TE>
<TE>   Isma'il Muhammad, Tony Akins and Marvin Lewis each had 15 points
for Georgia Tech (10-15, 3-9).</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Alabama 52, South Carolina 51--Rod Grizzard scored 18 of his
20 points in the second half and the Crimson Tide (21-4, 9-2 in the
Southeastern Conference) overcame a 15-point deficit at Columbia,
S.C. Neither team scored over the final four minutes. South Carolina
(14-10, 4-7)</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Kentucky 67, Vanderbilt 59--Tayshaun Prince scored 20
points at Lexington, Ky., and the Wildcats (17-6, 7-4 in the SEC)
defeated the Commodores (14-10, 4-7) for the 18th consecutive  time.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Freije and Chuck Moore each scored 17 points to lead
Vanderbilt, which has never won at Rupp Arena in 25 games.</TE>
<TE>   No. 13 Miami 79, St. John's 56--Elton Tyler scored 21 points at
Miami as the Hurricanes (21-4, 8-4 in the Big East) pulled within a
half a game of Connecticut for first place in the conference's East
Division.</TE>
<TE>   Miami led 36-14 at halftime, holding visiting St. John's (16-8,
6-6) to 15% shooting from the field.</TE>
<TE>   Clemson 118, No. 19 Wake Forest 115--Edward Scott had career-highs
of 30 points and 16 assists at Clemson, S.C. as the Tigers (12-13,
3-9 in the ACC) won in double overtime to end an eight-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   After Darius Songaila of Wake Forest fouled out late in the first
overtime, Clemson turned to its frontcourt duo of Ray Henderson and
Chris Hobbs, and they scored 13 of the Tigers' 17 points in the
second overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Dawson scored a career-high 38 points, including a school
record 11 three-point baskets, and Songaila had 24 points for Wake
Forest (17-8, 7-4).</TE>
<TE>   Hobbs finished with 24 points and 17 rebounds, and Tony Stockman
scored 30 points for Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin 64, No. 22 Indiana 63--Charlie Wills had 17 points and
Kirk Penney scored the Badgers' final points on a three-point basket
with 2:18 to play as they defeated the Hoosiers at Bloomington, Ind.,
for the first time since Feb. 24, 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Coverdale had 17 points for Indiana (16-8, 8-3 in the Big
Ten). Wisconsin is 15-11 and 8-5.</TE>

<HD>Excitement Builds for Young Clippers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: L.A. in playoff contention as second half
begins; Gentry seeks improvement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nothing has changed. The Clippers remain hopeful instead of hopeless.
As expected, they have emerged as a bona fide playoff contender with
a 25-26 record heading into the stretch drive.</LD>
<LD>   What happens in the next 31 games is anyone's guess, however. If
the first 51 games are any indication, it promises to be lively.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers, the NBA's youngest team with an average age of 24.8,
get back to work tonight against the San Antonio Spurs at Staples
Center. Well, perhaps work isn't the correct word.</LD>
<TE>   So far, the Clippers have played their best basketball when it
looked as if  they were having fun. When they smiled and mugged for
the fans and talked trash  to the opposition, their futures appeared
boundless. When they played with scowls on their faces, they appeared
mired in goo, unable to win.</TE>
<TE>   In the final analysis, the Clippers are simply a work in progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played well in some sequences and we've played horrible in
others," swingman Corey Maggette said. "I'd grade us a C-minus. We
can pick it up. We're still capable of getting better."</TE>
<TE>   How much the Clippers improve depends on at least two medical
reports. They have done just fine so far without the services of
forward Lamar Odom and guard Keyon Dooling for extended periods.</TE>
<TE>   Odom sat out eight games because of a drug suspension in November.
He has also been sidelined since Jan. 24 because of a sprained right
wrist and is expected to be out for several more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Dooling sprained his left ankle Nov. 14 against the Chicago Bulls
and only now appears fit to return to practice with his teammates. It
remains uncertain when he will be able to play, however.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Clippers will rely on those who have brought
them this far, starting with power forward Elton Brand.</TE>
<TE>   One of the questions facing the team at training camp was whether
Brand could duplicate his averages of 20 points and 10 rebounds in
the more competitive Western Conference. He proved he could do it in
the East in two seasons with Chicago, but could he match up with  the
likes of Karl Malone, Rasheed Wallace and Tim Duncan after the Bulls
traded him to the Clippers last summer?</TE>
<TE>   So far, so good.</TE>
<TE>   Brand is averaging 19 points and 11.2 rebounds and is coming off
his first All-Star game appearance. He has done it all while battling
nagging injuries that Coach Alvin Gentry said might have sidelined
another player.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were being realistic here, the guy probably should have
missed six or eight games because of his [sore] elbow, shoulder and
knee," Gentry said. "He's struggled some and he's never used it as an
excuse or complained. He plays all the games like they're the seventh
game of the NBA finals."</TE>
<TE>   And that presents this  question: Has this become Elton Brand's
team?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's become anyone's team because of the play of
Quentin and Michael and Corey," Gentry said, referring to Quentin
Richardson, Michael Olowokandi and Maggette. "It has truly become a
team, but I don't think it's anybody's team. That's a good thing
because everybody has a chance to step up for us. Sooner or later,
you will have a pecking order. Everything eventually falls into
place."</TE>
<TE>   After 51 games, various players have played the role of go-to guy.</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Jeff McInnis has stepped up on occasion, as when he
had a season-best 31 points in a victory Jan. 26 against the
Mavericks at Dallas. Olowokandi has had his moments, too, matching
his career high of 27 points twice in a five-game span. Both players
need new contracts at season's end and have played to impress.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette, Richardson and Darius Miles give the Clippers three
superb players in reserve roles. Maggette has filled in recently for
Odom as the starting small forward, often guarding the opposition's
best offensive player. Richardson and Miles have been more
comfortable coming off the bench, giving the team a jolt of energy.</TE>
<TE>   Richardson seems destined to be named  sixth man of the year.  He
is averaging 13.9 points. Miles, only 20, often appears destined for
the rafters when he takes off for one of his electrifying moves to
the basket. He is averaging 9.1 points.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry has kept his poise through Odom's drug suspension, the
arrest of Olowokandi for assault (charges were not filed by the
district attorney) and a hotel lobby scuffle among Brand, Maggette
and Obinna Ekezie.  On the surface,  the coach has been calm, cool
and collected, no matter the circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's remarkable," said John Hammond, Detroit Piston director of
player personnel and a former Gentry assistant. "Because of the
improvement last year, people don't appreciate the job he has done
this year. My gosh! That team is right at .500. I think he's doing
another outstanding job coaching that team on the floor and keeping
that young team together with all the different personalities he has
to deal with.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the major factors in coaching in this league is the
maturing of the players. He has an entire team of players maturing
for the most part. He has contract situations he's dealing with right
now because a lot of players are at the end of their deals. I mean,
look how these guys are improving. Look at the improvement of Darius
Miles and, most important, look at the improvement of Quentin
Richardson."</TE>
<TE>   Improvement, no matter how slight, pleases Gentry. Last season,
the Clippers won 31 games. With seven victories in their final 31
games, they will top that figure.</TE>
<TE>   "We're making progress," Gentry said. "I think people expect us to
make a quantum leap. As long as we're making progress, that's the
important thing to me. It may never be a quantum leap."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers desperately want to make the playoffs for the first
time since 1996-97, but Gentry said that should not be the only
standard that determines whether 2001-02 is a successful season.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't make the playoffs, I refuse to call the season a
failure," he said. "We just have to make sure we're making progress.
I think we're definitely headed in the right direction. We're not
satisfied. We want to be better."</TE>

<LD>Amid all their comings and goings, the Clippers continue their quest
for the playoffs tonight, opening a three-game homestand, sandwiched
between road trips, against the San Antonio Spurs.</LD>
<LD>   Corey Maggette, a starting guard, is listed as questionable
because of tendinitis in his left knee. If he doesn't start, Darius
Miles will take his spot.</LD>
<LD>   However, Maggette practiced Wednesday and has resisted all efforts
to get him to rest.</LD>
<TE>   "Corey's really hurt," Coach Alvin Gentry said. "He's trying to
tough it out, trying to suck it up but I'm telling you, the guy's
really hurt. I don't want to be the guy who decides. Somewhere along
the line, we may just have to sit him down.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about Corey, if there's any chance he'll play, he'll
play. He's just a real gut-it-out, try-to-do-whatever-he-can guy....</TE>
<TE>   "We lose a lot of things [without Maggette]. We lose a toughness
factor about our team that he brings.... When people look at Corey
play sometimes, some of the mistakes he makes, but all the positive
things he does, so much outweigh the mistakes that he makes. He's a
coach's dream from the standpoint of just playing hard and giving you
everything he's got."</TE>
<TE>   Backup point guard Keyon Dooling, who has been out since
mid-November with a severely sprained ankle, is practicing again but
not yet ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar Odom had his sore right wrist examined by team physician
Tony Daly, who found some progress this time, but not enough to speed
up Odom's scheduled return. The wrist was put back in a cast and will
be re-examined in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The homestand continues against Dallas on Saturday and Portland on
Monday before the Clippers head out again, playing nine of the
ensuing 10 games on the road.</TE>

<HD>Robby Gordon Likes Daytona Chances</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: 'I think we can win it, for sure,' says driver
from Orange before Sunday's race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Speculation as to the winner of Sunday's Daytona 500 generally
centers on Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart and Dale Earnhardt Jr. Then come
Dale Jarrett, Kevin Harvick and Ricky Rudd.</LD>
<LD>   Usually overlooked is the winner of the last Winston Cup points
race, Robby Gordon.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we can win it, for sure," Gordon said Wednesday before
climbing in his Richard Childress-owned No. 31 Chevrolet for the
final practice before today's Gatorade Twin 125 qualifying races at
Daytona International Speedway.</LD>
<TE>   He will start in the second row of the second of the two races,
right behind Harvick, a teammate.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon is from Orange, Harvick from Bakersfield. Furthering the
California connection is El Cajon's Jimmie Johnson, pole-sitter for
Sunday's race as well as the first Twin 125.</TE>
<TE>   It is easy to overlook Gordon, a talented driver who never seems
to live up to his potential and doesn't seem to know if he wants to
be a Winston Cup driver or an Indy car driver.</TE>
<TE>   If he were a cat, he'd already have used up his nine lives.</TE>
<TE>   When he was dropped by the Morgan-McClure team last year after
only five races, it looked as if Gordon's NASCAR career was finished.
After all, he had runs with owners Junie Donlavey, Robert Yates,
Kranefuss-Haas, Buz McCall and a full season with Felix Sabates. He
even tried owning his own team with Mike Held. But he never caught
on, usually because he kept drifting back to Indy cars.</TE>
<TE>   Gordon caught the eye of Childress, who runs one of the highest
profile and best-financed teams in racing, at the Indianapolis 500
last year. Gordon was driving for A.J. Foyt in a car Childress
co-owned. He qualified third and led 22 laps before his engine went
sour about Lap 75.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd heard a lot of tales about Robby and his troubles, but he
wasn't anything like I'd been told," said Childress, who signed a
young Dale Earnhardt in 1981 and helped guide him to six of his seven
Winston Cup championships. "Maybe he's a little older and has a
different attitude. No one ever doubted his tremendous talent. What I
saw that I liked was the way he worked with A.J."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon got his chance with Childress' Cup team when Mike Skinner
injured his knee and decided to have season-ending surgery last
September.</TE>
<TE>   "Richard and I started our dialogue in May at Indy after I'd been
released from the No. 4 [Morgan-McClure] car and we kept in touch,"
Gordon said. "I drove a couple of races for Jim Smith in the meantime
and almost won the Sears Point race."</TE>
<TE>   In July, Childress put the still-unemployed Gordon in his Busch
Series car for a road course race at Watkins Glen, N.Y., and was
impressed with his fifth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   "When Skinner got hurt, Richard called me and here I am," Gordon
said.</TE>
<TE>   In 10 races with Childress last season, Gordon almost won at
Watkins Glen, before a freak fire sidelined him while leading, and
won his first Winston Cup race in the season-finale at New Hampshire
International Speedway in a late-race battle with series champion
Jeff Gordon. The Gordons are not related.</TE>
<TE>   On lap 285 of the 300-lap race, Robby clipped the rear of Jeff's
Chevrolet, a nudge that enabled Robby to take the lead. A lap later,
under caution, the usually unflappable Jeff repaid the favor and was
penalized a lap, enabling Robby to pull away and win.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really surprised at Jeff," Childress said. "Someone
apparently slowed in front of him and when Jeff checked up, Robby
bumped him. It wasn't anything that doesn't happen all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Robby Gordon called it a "heat of the moment thing," and insists
that he and the four-time champion have no on-going feud.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys who cover NASCAR love to talk about feuds, but the truth
is there is very little of that that lasts more than a day or two,"
Robby Gordon said. "If you had feuds with these guys, you'd never get
anything done on the racetrack."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon qualified sixth fastest for the 500 with a speed of 184.362
mph, but his starting position Sunday will be determined by where he
finishes in today's 125-mile sprint.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're in great position to win the 500, but before that
we're going for the win in the 125. Kevin and I have been drafting
together, working on our fine tuning and in practice I've been able
to get around [Jeff] Gordon and Stewart so I know the race car is
ready."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon kept himself sharp during the off-season with two quite
different events, a Race of Champions rally in the Canary Islands in
December and the Rolex 24 Hour Race here two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   "The rally was great fun, kind of like the old Baja 1000 runs," he
said. "It was my first time at it, I drove a SEAT Cordoba and broke
the track record on my second lap. I think I would have won but I
flipped and the car caught fire.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to go back and give it a shot next year. I think I'd have
really enjoyed being a rally driver if I'd tried it earlier. I just
love racing anything. That's why I race crazy events like the rally
and the 24 Hour. In the Rolex, I drove about eight hours, mostly at
night.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed strange, driving a sophisticated sports car around
Daytona and then climbing into a big, old Winston Cup car."</TE>
<TE>   That big, old Winston Cup car may be his salvation. For someone
who won the Baja 1000 driving solo when he was 20, who won the first
Sports Car Club of America Trans-Am he ever entered in 1992 at Long
Beach, who won PPG Cup Indy Car races at Phoenix and Detroit in 1995,
who won his first IROC race at Charlotte in 1997, who won his first
Winston Cup pole at Atlanta in 1997 and came within a lap of winning
the 1999 Indianapolis 500 before running out of fuel, Robby Gordon
has had a largely unfulfilled career.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard before that this was my last chance," he said. "I
heard it when I went with Felix [Sabates], I heard it when Mike
[Held] and I started our own team, and I heard it last year when I
started with Morgan-McClure, so it's nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   "What is new is that I don't want to screw things up again. It
helps that we won our first race and we have confidence in each
other, Richard and myself.</TE>
<TE>   "Our objectives are to win Thursday, win Sunday and run
consistently all season so we can have a shot at the Winston Cup
championship."</TE>

<KH>DAYTONA NOTES</KH>
<HD>Allison Will Miss Race for the 'Party'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>For the first time since 1959, the year the Daytona 500 was first
held, three-time winner Bobby Allison will not be here. He and his
wife, Judy, will be in Ames, Okla., for the "Ultimate Daytona 500
House Party" for John Sattler, who won the honor in a promotion by
NASCAR.</LD>
<LD>   "I hate to miss the 500 live but I've got a feeling Judy and I are
going to have a lot of fun watching it on NBC television," said
Allison, winner of the 1983 Winston Cup championship as well as the
1978, 1982 and 1988 Daytona 500s. "I haven't met [Sattler] yet but I
understand he's a short-track racer, so I certainly won't have any
trouble fitting in with him and his crowd."</LD>
<LD>   Sattler, who has raced stock cars on a half-mile dirt oval in
Enid, Okla., said, "Me, my wife and my grandfather have all raced, so
having this party with Bobby Allison will be truly memorable."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Indy Racing League driver Scott Sharp and World of Outlaws sprint
car champion Danny Lasoski will start on the front row in Friday's
International Race of Champions. The line up for the 12 drivers from
different racing series was conducted by draw.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Elliott's Dodge Intrepid was the fastest Winston Cup car in
Wednesday's final practice for today's Gatorade Twin 125s, but the
two-time Daytona 500 winner downplayed the results.</TE>
<TE>   "That time really didn't mean anything," he said. "We weren't
really the fastest. We were just in between two drafts. That's the
only reason we were up there."</TE>
<TE>   Felix Sabates, co-owner with Chip Ganassi of Dodges driven by
Sterling Marlin and Jimmy Spencer, was even more pessimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "If a Dodge wins tomorrow, it's because all of the other cars in
the race will wreck and fall out," Sabates said. "We've got no chance
with that extra spoiler."</TE>
<TE>   Dodge owners are upset that Ford received a quarter-inch reduction
in the height of its rear spoiler to help maintain parity among the
four NASCAR manufacturers--Ford, Chevrolet, Pontiac and Dodge. When
Dodge returned to Winston Cup racing last year, the templates on the
Intrepid model were patterned after the Ford Taurus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dave Marcis, who has announced that Sunday's 500 will be his final
race, started his career with the Daytona 500 in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem like that many years ago when you stop and think
about it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "But coming down here with a 1966 Chevrolet with a 427 cubic inch
big block engine was a big handful. There was a lot of horsepower
there. We didn't have all those rear spoilers and we didn't have the
good tires. They were narrower and they had tread on them. It was
simpler, but it was a hell of a handful."</TE>
<TE>   Marcis will start today in a new Chevrolet Monte Carlo, thanks to
help from Childress Racing, for whom he does test driving.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Waltrip is the defending champion in the Daytona 500, but
he says it won't mean a thing when the green flag flies Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't even enter my mind [being defending champion] until I
got here and now I've heard it a couple of times," said Waltrip, who
drives for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. "It just puts an extra bounce in your
step. I'm happy to hear that. The defending champ gig is just a
little bonus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rain halted qualifying for Saturday's Busch Grand National race
late Wednesday and NASCAR officials said it would be completed this
morning before the Gatorade Twin 125s.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Keep a Good Thought</HD>
<DH>Hockey: They head into Olympic break on positive note after
3-2 victory over Flames gives them seven wins in last nine games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Expressions of success varied widely for the Mighty Ducks on
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   There was frivolity, as when center Matt Cullen did his Bobby
Orr-header after scoring in the second period.</LD>
<LD>   There was satisfaction, as when defenseman Pavel Trnka pumped his
first after whipping a shot into the net in the third period.</LD>
<TE>   And there was a been-there-done-that routine by Andy McDonald, who
held a statue-like pose after scoring what was the game-winner in a
3-2 victory over the Calgary Flames.</TE>
<TE>   Which led to a team mob scene at the end.</TE>
<TE>   There were more than enough thrill-of-victory moments for an
announced 9,583 at the Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, I was just trying to mix up the celebrating," Cullen said
about his head-first leap into the corner after tying the score, 1-1,
in the second  period.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the Ducks now have a little reason to celebrate in their
season on the blink. They have won seven of nine heading into the
Olympic break.</TE>
<TE>   Those victories have taken them tantalizingly close to the
mediocre level.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 12 days, while the cream of the NHL--and that does
include a couple of Ducks--competes in the Olympics, the Ducks can
bask in their recent play.</TE>
<TE>   Even better, Paul Kariya (Canada) and Oleg Tverdovsky (Russia)
will have a week to savor at the Olympics, where they actually have a
chance at success on the ice.</TE>
<TE>   Then it's back to work, which involves making something out of the
Ducks' final 21 games.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to just have a strong finish to our season,"
defenseman Keith Carney said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we've made some strides here the last few weeks.... We
know how hard we have to work each night to be successful.''</TE>
<TE>   That was a formula that worked Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Twice the Ducks fell behind against the struggling Flames, who are
7-15-2 since Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Twice the Ducks rallied to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Then McDonald flew out of the Duck zone, bore down on goalie Roman
Turek and zipped a shot into the net for a 3-2 Duck lead.</TE>
<TE>   The goal extended McDonald's point streak to seven games, the
longest by a NHL rookie since Scott Gomez in 1999. It is also one shy
of the Duck record, set by Kariya in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   More importantly, it gave the Ducks a lead they could protect,
which they did by matching the Flames check for check.</TE>
<TE>   "Against this team it's always going to be a gritty game," Cullen
said. "We knew it was going to be tough game and we would have to
battle all over the ice."</TE>
<TE>   That's experience speaking.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there were none of the brawls that made a Dec. 8 game
between  these teams an embarrassment,  when they combined for 309
penalty  minutes. Jarome Iginla gave the Flames a 1-0 lead with his
league-high 35 goals midway through the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen got the Ducks even when he swooped in to pick up a gimme
five minutes into the second period. Jason York zeroed in and let
loose a shot that Turek stopped, but the puck trickled through his
legs. Cullen was there to push it into the net.</TE>
<TE>   Cullen has five goals in his last eight games.</TE>
<TE>   He had two in his last 42 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hanging near the net more than I used to," Cullen said.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of drifting off to the side, I'm trying pick up things in
front of the net."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Begin scored on a rebound, giving Calgary a 2-1 lead after
two periods.</TE>
<TE>   Trnka got the Ducks even with a shot from the blue line that
somehow squeezed between Turek and the right post to tie the score,
2-2, near the start of the third period.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald struck a minute later.</TE>

<HD>Rucchin's Almost Ready to Return</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Mighty Duck center Steve Rucchin, the Olympic break is the start
of his countdown.</LD>
<LD>   Rucchin has missed 44 games because of a stress fracture in his
left ankle, which required surgery. But he said he will return after
the break and play when the Ducks face Minnesota on Feb. 27.</LD>
<LD>   "The ankle is still pretty tender right now, so I definitely
wouldn't be back the next couple of days," Rucchin said. "But looking
at two weeks, there is no question I'll be back within a couple of
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "This definitely gives me something to look forward to. I have
been pretty excited to skate with the 'A' club, I guess, the last few
days. It's been a while, I could use this week, let things settle
down a little more, then get raring to go in what will be a mini
training camp after the break."</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin missed 66 games because of injuries last season and his
contract is up after this season. The Ducks have 21 games remaining
to evaluate Rucchin.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I need to prove anything," Rucchin said. "I can't
put too much pressure on myself. It takes a little while to get back
to game playing shape."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Calgary goalie Roman Turek pulled out of the Olympics on
Wednesday. Turek, who was to back up Dominik Hasek for the Czech
Republic, said he needs to recover from chronic injuries.</TE>

<LD>Five days after winning its first league title, Temple City had a
successful debut Tuesday in the Southern Section girls' water polo
playoffs, defeating Glendora St. Lucy's, 12-5, in a Division III
first-round game at Temple City High.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad for a second-year program.</LD>
<LD>   "We've totally come from nothing," said junior Tammy Trejo, who
scored four goals against St. Lucy's. "Some of us couldn't even throw
the ball five feet when we started last season."</LD>
<TE>   Temple City Coach Brian Roth, a 1992 graduate of Temple City who
played water polo and coached at UC Santa Barbara, has been the
architect of the development.</TE>
<TE>   Roth began with the basics. There was no other choice. He started
by teaching standard shooting motions--where to position the elbow
and when to release the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Some players, like Trejo, didn't know how to shoot the ball on a
line, instead lobbing it with the arc of a rainbow.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, everybody was throwing the ball with the trajectory of a
dart. And, best of all, players were enjoying every minute of
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids devoured it," Roth said. "Three hours wasn't long enough
for them."</TE>
<TE>   The Rams finished 9-16 last season and placed fourth in the Rio
Hondo League. They missed qualifying for the playoffs with a
season-ending one-goal loss to San Marino.</TE>
<TE>   The team graduated nine players, but four starters
returned--Trejo, Ivone Garcia, Linda Calvert and Rebecca Maichrawicz.
Now they're in the second round of the playoffs, and will play
Sherman Oaks Notre Dame today at L.A. Valley College.</TE>
<TE>   Trejo has much in common with her teammates. She's new to the
sport but capable and more than willing to learn. She was a seasoned
youth soccer player who played junior varsity as a freshman.</TE>
<TE>   She was on the swim team in the spring that year and decided to
try water polo the following winter, the first year it was offered at
the school. New to the sport, Trejo was eager to master the most
basic drills.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt comfortable asking coach why a certain drill was
important," she said. "He would tell us and then incorporate the
drill into a game situation."</TE>
<TE>   Roth has been fortunate to attract players from other sports, but
that's not the only place he has found contributors. While helping
decorate floats for the 2001 Rose Parade, Roth convinced fellow
volunteer Jessica Jen to try out for the team. A little more than a
year later, she's the starting goalkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "I like working with developmental kids," Roth said. "These girls
don't lose, they absorb."</TE>
<TE>   Close calls: If Tuesday's first-round games are any clue, the next
10 days could be wild in Division III.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the 10 games were settled in overtime, including Covina
Charter Oak's 9-8 victory over Alhambra Keppel in sudden death.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Beverlin scored two of her seven goals in overtime to lift
Palos Verdes Chadwick against Whittier La Serna, 13-11. Beverlin also
scored with 27 seconds remaining in regulation to tie the score, 9-9.</TE>
<TE>   In the other overtime game, Pico Rivera El Rancho edged Walnut,
8-7, as Miriam Quintanilla scored her second goal from seven meters
out with 1:20 to play.</TE>
<TE>   That's a no-no: Southern Section spokesman Thom Simmons confirmed
Wednesday that Etiwanda Coach Chris Carlson was forced to resign last
week after violating Blue Book rule No. 305, which forbids section
schools from conducting practices with players who do not attend the
school.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of Etiwanda graduates who played boys' water polo
practiced with the girls' team earlier this season, Simmons said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Simmons, Etiwanda Principal Lynne Ditfurth reported
the violation and, as a result, pressured Carlson to resign.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons said the section could have forced Etiwanda to forfeit two
matches for each time the violations occurred, but Ditfurth's strong
stance led the section to limit Etiwanda to one-hour practices for
the remainder of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles clinched the Mt. Baldy League title for the fourth time
in the last five years last week and will open the Division V
playoffs today under interim Coach Amy Davis.</TE>

<LD>A look at the final regular-season top 10 girls' water polo teams in
the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Santa Margarita (23-3, SS-Div. I)</LD>
<LD>   Santa Margarita will have to earn its points today against

<TE>   3. Corona del Mar (21-7, SS-Div. IV)</TE>
<TE>   Sea Kings received a wake-up call Friday after losing to Anaheim
Canyon, 9-8, in regular-season finale. They open playoffs today vs.
visiting Ocean View. (3)</TE>
<TE>   4. El Toro (19-8, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   Adrian Beaney scored her 89th career goal Friday against Villa

but teams figure to meet again in the final. (7)</TE>
<TE>   8. Long Beach Wilson (19-9, SS-Div. I)</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to tell which team will show up, the one that upset
Santa Barbara two weeks ago in the SoCal tournament, or the one that
was upset four days later by Capistrano Valley. (8)</TE>
<TE>   9. Santa Barbara (20-6, SS-Div. II)</TE>

<HD>Once a Year, He's Young Again</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Leaping Plum will try to win an incredible
eighth consecutive Grasmick Handicap Saturday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just as certain as arctic temperatures and snowfall by the foot,
central Nebraska is visited every winter by an arthritic old gelding
who is in his element when he runs in those harsh elements. It
wouldn't be February at Fonner Park without trainer Joe Moss winding
up the indefatigable Leaping Plum to win the Jake Grasmick Memorial
Handicap again.</LD>
<LD>   When Fonner Park--a five-furlong bullring whose configuration is
not unlike Fairplex Park in Pomona--runs the four-furlong Grasmick on
Saturday, Leaping Plum will try to win the $15,000 race for an
astonishing eighth consecutive  year. Because of Fonner's modest
trappings, this is not comparable to Kelso winning Belmont Park's
Jockey Club Gold Cup five times in a row, as he did in the 1960s, and
not even something that ranks with Irish Linnet winning the Yaddo
Stakes five straight times at Saratoga in the 1990s. But in a sport
that begs for continuity--the best horses frequently are rushed off
to stud before they have even cooled out from their final
victories--the 11-year-old Leaping Plum is the ultimate stayer, a
Fonner tradition and a rock-solid affirmation of the breed.</LD>
<LD>   The good folks of Grand Island, Neb., aren't allowed to flip the
pages of their calendars until this horse has won another Grasmick.</LD>
<TE>   "It's nice that this horse is being mentioned in the next breath
with Kelso," said Moss, a 54-year-old third-generation trainer who
has had Leaping Plum from the start. "Growing up, Kelso was my
favorite. He was my hero."</TE>
<TE>   While Moss deserves kudos for doing all the grunt work, the man
who actually brought Leaping Plum to Nebraska in the beginning was
Clyde Woods, a cabinet manufacturer from Omaha who bought the horse
for $11,000 at a Keeneland yearling auction in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "Clyde picked out the horse and insisted we buy him," said Paul
Miskimins, a dentist from Mitchell, S.D., who is Woods' partner and
Moss' cousin. "He had had a half-brother to Leaping Plum that turned
out to be a fairly nice horse. There were some horses in that sale
that we had rated much higher, but Clyde just had to have Leaping
Plum."</TE>
<TE>   By Lightning Leap out of the mare Velvet Plum, Leaping Plum has
run 61 times, winning 29 and adding seven seconds and 10 thirds, for
purses of $369,716. While 17 of his wins have come at Fonner, the
stocky chestnut is not a one-track pony. He broke his maiden the
first time out of the gate at Thistledown in Cleveland, and since
then he's also raced at tracks in Illinois, West Virginia, Kansas and
Iowa. He has won at one track that's out of business--Ak-Sar-Ben in
Omaha--and has twice beaten quarter horses, at a distance of about a
half-mile.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a horse that's been awfully good to us," Miskimins said,
"and we try to take very good care of him. One year, for instance, he
wasn't feeling that good and he only ran three times. He's a big fish
in a small pond, we know that, and we're not boastful about what he's
done. We just consider ourselves very fortunate to have him."</TE>
<TE>   Just running in the same race eight  years in a row is a feat for
the ages. The Grasmick, named after an original board member when
Fonner opened in 1954, was first run in 1968, and before  the Leaping
Plum era, the stake had never been won more than three times by the
same horse.</TE>
<TE>   Leaping Plum was 5-1, a horse still trying to find his way, when
he won his first Grasmick in 1995. He won by 11/2 lengths, carrying
only 117 pounds. In the six subsequent wins, his margins have ranged
between 21/2 and 81/2 lengths, while carrying between 122 and 128
pounds. In 1996, when he won by 81/2 lengths, his time was 44 1/5
seconds, still the half-mile record for Fonner Park.</TE>
<TE>   Jockey Newil Wall is shooting  for his third win with Leaping Plum
in the stake on Saturday. Wall,  53, missed the race one year because
he had broken a leg.</TE>
<TE>   "Newil gallops the horse, works him and rides him well in races,"
Moss said. "He gets the horse to relax, and knows everything about
him. He's not a horse that relishes the whip, for example. We found
that out after a while, and Newil knows that he won't run any faster
or harder if he hits him."</TE>
<TE>   Leaping Plum has been the odds-on favorite for the last six times
in the Grasmick, paying $3.40 to win last year.</TE>
<TE>   Every Grasmick win has come off a layoff of at least 101 days. In
1999, Leaping Plum stiffened up badly on Moss two races after his
Grasmick win and the trainer gave him the rest of the year off.
Leaping Plum hadn't run in more than 10 months when, under 128
pounds, he won the 2000 Grasmick by 31/2 lengths. On Saturday,
assigned 122 pounds, the horse will be making his first start since a
fifth-place finish at Beulah Park in Grove City, Ohio, on Dec. 15.
Rival trainers may look at that result, rationalize that Leaping Plum
is running at an age when most horses have long been pensioned and
think they have a chance.  But only twice has Moss' horse gone into a
Grasmick after closing out the previous year with a win.</TE>
<TE>   It takes some clever training by Moss to get the horse ready for
his seasonal debut at Fonner.</TE>
<TE>   "In Nebraska, you train by the weather," said Moss, noting that 12
inches of snow had fallen on  Grand Island in  February. "I'm always
keeping one eye on the Weather Channel. If you see a storm coming,
you hurry to get in a workout before it comes. If the track gets
frozen, all you can do is walk the horse and hope for the best."</TE>
<TE>   With Leaping Plum, loving care also seems to work. Lisa Moss, the
trainer's wife of 20 years, also works at the barn and shares in
spoiling the veteran.</TE>
<TE>   "He's incredibly spoiled, and has gotten to love his apples," Joe
Moss said. "All he'll eat, though, are the golden delicious. Anything
else isn't good enough for him. He knows and he won't take them."</TE>

<LD>Horse players will get their own form of a Valentine's Day gift this
morning.</LD>
<LD>   At 9 a.m., local bettors will be able to start making future
wagers for the Kentucky Derby, which will be run on May 4 at
Churchill Downs.</LD>
<LD>   This is the fourth year the future wager has been offered, but the
first time it has been available in California.</LD>
<TE>   On the morning line posted by Churchill Downs, the field, which
includes all other 3-year-olds not mentioned among the top 23, is the
4-1 favorite. The second choice at 6-1 is Siphonic, the Hollywood
Futurity winner who was a troubled second in the Santa Catalina
Stakes in his first race of 2002 for trainer Dave Hofmans.</TE>
<TE>   Johannesburg, who remained unbeaten in seven starts with his
victory in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last fall in New York, is 10-1
as are Repent and Came Home.</TE>
<TE>   Danthebluegrassman, arguably trainer Bob Baffert's best chance to
get to Kentucky, is listed at 30-1, along with Easyfromthegitgo, High
Star, Nokoma, Political Attack and U S S Tinosa, who won the Sham
Stakes at Santa Anita six days ago.</TE>
<TE>   No Derby hopefuls are entered today at Santa Anita, but one
unbeaten horse will try to remain that way.</TE>
<TE>   Soup N'Crackers, who has won both his races, will try two turns
for the first time in the second race. She is the 3-1 second choice
in a race in which Daddy's Gold, who broke her maiden on Jan. 20, is
the 2-1 favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Ten 3-year-old maiden fillies will sprint about
61/2 furlongs on the turf. Lady Katy Did, who is bred for the grass
and chased repeat winner Shameful last month, is the 5-2 favorite on
Jeff Tufts' morning line.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Geana Dawn. A 4-year-old filly trained by Jerry
Hollendorfer, she will try for her fourth consecutive win at Golden
Gate Fields today.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Miss Indian. The 3-year-old, Oklahoma-bred filly has
been beaten a combined 44 lengths in her two races and will be a huge
price again today in the fifth race at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking:  A pick three using Lady Katy Did, Sultry
Sound, Chez La Femme and Fan Appeal in the third, singling Ben Saw
San in the fourth and using Catfit, Shining Britely and Girl Talk in
the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous Day/Meet Total: 0/105. Money: Previous Day/Meet
Total: $0/$645.40. Total money bet: $612.</TE>

<HD>Despite Plenty of Zs, Kings Tie</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Ziggy Palffy scores two goals but Kings fail to
hold two leads in 2-2 tie with the Coyotes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 20 minutes of regulation left before the start of the NHL's
Olympic break, the Kings found themselves tied with the Phoenix
Coyotes on Wednesday night at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Knowing that a defeat would not be a good way to head into the
league's 12-day hiatus, the Kings almost  pulled out a victory but
ended up with a 2-2 tie, which pleased goaltender Felix Potvin, who
finished with 36 saves.</LD>
<LD>   "Shutouts are fun but the most important thing is to [get
points]," Potvin said before the game. "We're chasing a few teams
right now, so every game is so important.</LD>
<TE>   "Some nights you've got to make more saves than others. Some
nights you may be off and they need to play better."</TE>
<TE>   With the tie, the Kings improved to 27-20-8-3 and have 65 points.
If the playoffs were to start today, they would be in the postseason
as the sixth-seeded team in the Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Red hot winger Ziggy Palffy, who has been on a scoring tear over
the last week, fired up a crowd of 15,964 by scoring twice, his 19th
and 20th goals of the season.</TE>
<TE>   He picked up a loose puck deep in the Coyotes' zone, skated across
the slot and, just when it seemed like he was ready to spin and shoot
from his strong side, he caught an edge on the ice and stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of quitting on the play, Palffy continued to fight off
Phoenix center Daymond Langkow before he gathered himself and snapped
a backhand shot from the right circle, surprising  goaltender Sean
Burke to put the Kings ahead, 2-1, 10:31 into the final period.</TE>
<TE>   It was Palffy's sixth goal in his last three games, which includes
a hat trick at Phoenix last week.</TE>
<TE>   But the Kings' lead didn't last long. Phoenix winger Brian Savage
jumped ahead of the pack and skated away from defenseman Philippe
Boucher, whose desperation dive fell short, before beating Potvin
with a slick backhand shot that went between the goaltender's legs at
12:06 to tie the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   It was fitting that the Kings and the Coyotes played beyond
regulation because they have gone into overtime in six of their last
seven meetings.</TE>
<TE>   In the extra period, the Kings had a couple solid chances, but
they couldn't get the puck past Burke, who finished with 32 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kings were outshot, 17-10, in the first period, they
managed to take a 1-0 lead when Palffy scored at 14:26, two seconds
after a power play  had expired.</TE>
<TE>   Burke stopped winger Steve Heinze's initial shot and defenseman
Aaron Miller's rebound try, but he was beaten by Palffy from in front
of the crease. It was Palffy's seventh power-play goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Coyotes' attack was relentless early, forcing Potvin to make
six saves in the first three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings missed a chance to extend the lead early in the second
period when Jason Allison's point-blank shot bounced off the right
post.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix, taking advantage of the Kings' conservative play, tied
the score, 1-1, on Teppo Numminen's goal at 15:16 of the second
period. Langkow, in the right corner, slid the puck across the goal
mouth to Numminen, who skated in from the left and lifted the shot
over Potvin's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   It was a valuable point for Phoenix, which has made a strong run
to get back into the playoff picture.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting ready for the stretch drive right now, and we know
every game is important," forward Shane Doan said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Enough of the Kobe Bryant-Michael Jordan comparisons, Shaquille
O'Neal said in the aftermath of the Lakers' 103-94 victory over the
Washington Wizards on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "They are two different cars going down the 405 [freeway]," O'Neal
said. "One is a 2002 [Mercedes] Benz, the other a 1991 Benz. They are
both excellent cars and they both get great mileage, but they are
different years.</LD>
<LD>   "Now I'd like to see a 26-year-old Kobe go against a 26-year-old
Michael, but you can't go back in time. That would be like comparing
me to Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar]."</LD>
<TE>   And how would O'Neal fare against Abdul-Jabbar, his predecessor as
a dominating Laker center?</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't stop his sky hook," O'Neal said. "He would get his 30
[points]. But so would I."</TE>
<TE>   And how about the rebounding matchup?</TE>
<TE>   "I think I would win that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attention, Ron Harper: You may not be on the Laker roster. You may
not be in game shape. But don't get too relaxed because, with the
start of the stretch run, you remain just where you've been all
season, in the back of Coach Phil Jackson's mind.</TE>
<TE>   Harper retired last season after 15 years in the NBA. But Jackson
can't quite let go of a cool, competent veteran guard who runs the
triangle offense as though he invented it, who plays the kind of
defense that brings a smile to a coach's face and who can get the
attention of young players the way no coach can.</TE>
<TE>   So Harper is 37. So what? That makes him two years younger than
Jordan, who turns 39 Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has no immediate plans to try to lure Harper, who played
for him for four years in Chicago and two with the Lakers, out of
retirement. But ...</TE>
<TE>   "We've always anticipated that that is going to be a possibility,"
Jackson said of a Laker comeback by Harper. "We haven't spoken since
the start of the season, but we've exchanged voice messages. Right
now, everybody is healthy and everybody is doing the job. Ron is not
part of our plans unless something happens."</TE>
<TE>   But, as Jackson well knows, something always does.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Seattle, 7, Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site--KeyArena.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 34-13, SuperSonics 25-24.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. SuperSonics--1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update--There hasn't been a home-court advantage in the series
this season. The Lakers lost at Staples Center to the SuperSonics,
104-93, but won at Seattle, 107-92. The Lakers were happy to get a
victory against the SuperSonics wherever they could find one after
having been swept in last season's four meetings. Seattle is only
12-16 in its own conference, 7-7 at home.</TE>

<DH>Wooden's Legacy Burdens Lavin, but Encouraging Letters From
the Legend Are Source of Strength for UCLA Coach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A riddle for brilliant college kids, esteemed professors and every
other know-all follower of UCLA basketball:</LD>
<LD>   The Bruins don't win every game by 25 points, or any game by 25
for that matter. They are a sickly 16-7 overall and a ho-hum 8-4 in
the Pacific 10 Conference, clustered with clearly inferior Arizona,
Oregon, Stanford, USC and California.</LD>
<LD>   You believe the team's performance is awful. Who is responsible?</LD>
<TE>   Hint: They call him Coach.</TE>
<TE>   "It is quite normal to enjoy praise and dislike criticism,
deserved or undeserved, but true strength of character is shown by
those who prevent either to affect them in a negative manner."</TE>
<TE>   --John Wooden in a letter to Steve Lavin</TE>
<TE>   Lavin, in his sixth season as UCLA coach, has come to terms with
the bull's-eye on his back.</TE>
<TE>   He reads the Internet postings calling for his immediate
dismissal. He hears the catcalls at Pauley Pavilion when the Bruins
struggle. But like immunity built against disease-carrying germs, he
has become indifferent to critics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a theater of the absurd and I try to take it with a sense of
humor," he said. "There is a boring side to it because it is not
original content. The faces of the coaches change, but the reality is
that it's been this way for 25 years."</TE>
<TE>   Wooden retired as UCLA coach in 1975, going out with his 10th NCAA
championship. From Gene Bartow to Jim Harrick, every coach who
followed Wooden was shouldered with unrealistic expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Yet none were clobbered more than Lavin. While Wooden invented the
Pyramid of Success, critics believe Lavin offers only a Bermuda
Triangle of poor recruiting, disorganized practices and poor game
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin, 37, fell into the job before he was ready because of odd
circumstances triggered by Harrick's firing in 1996. He catches
himself longing for a place where mistakes of inexperience don't
cause major earthquakes--often saying the ideal first job for him
would have been the University of San Francisco--but he is where he
is and knows he's blessed.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that makes UCLA unique is Coach Wooden," Lavin
said. "He is the greatest coach maybe in the history of sport. His
accomplishments in basketball are unsurpassed. No one will ever match
John Wooden. You might have a honeymoon period if you make the Final
Four or win a national championship, but eventually you will fall
short.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand you can't have it both ways. You can't have
recruiting advantages, an incredible institution and great tradition
and not expect to have high standards of excellence."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, under Lavin, is 130-54 (70.7%), has won at least 21 games
every season and advanced to the NCAA tournament round of 16 four
times and to the round of eight once.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of three coaches to reach the Sweet 16 four times in the
last five years, but many of the folks who fill Pauley Pavilion
consider this unexceptional. There has been neither a breakthrough
Final Four appearance nor a breakdown like Matt Doherty is
experiencing at North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Senior UCLA administrators appear content for the moment. Vice
Chancellor Pete Blackman played under Wooden in the early 1960s and
is acutely aware of what Lavin calls "the mythology and pathology of
Bruin basketball." Chancellor Albert Carnesale wants a clean program
and believes athletics serve a higher educational purpose.</TE>
<TE>   When Athletic Director Pete Dalis tossed out the name of Rick
Pitino at a news conference a year ago like a zookeeper lobbing raw
steak to big cats, Lavin met with Blackman and Carnesale and offered
to resign.</TE>
<TE>   "I was prepared to step aside if in fact the final negotiation
with Pitino had transpired," he said. "But once I had dialogue
eyeball to eyeball with the senior administrators, that was the
determining factor in staying."</TE>
<TE>   Dalis will retire in June and probably lacks the power to fire
Lavin on his way out. Although their relationship deteriorated in the
last year, Dalis recently sweetened the coach's buyout terms.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, the athletic director identifies with the coach. Dalis
also was unproven and unequipped when promoted from director of
recreational affairs 19 years ago, and he has taken his share of
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the importance of remaining in the good graces of Blackman
and Carnesale, Lavin strikes a politically correct tone when
addressing the team's struggles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to help the kids learn that although this is only
a game, it's a metaphor for life," he said. "Whenever there is an
obstacle or tough stretch, as a teacher or coach you see those as
learning opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up in a basketball family big on education. I never got
into coaching for money or glamour. I wanted to coach and teach and
learn from the best in the history of the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Character is what we are, while reputation is merely what we are
perceived to be by others, so what we think of ourselves is of far
more importance."</TE>
<TE>   --Wooden to Lavin</TE>
<TE>   Another fact of life for UCLA coaches: Not only did Wooden win the
most, his pearls of wisdom--some borrowed, some original--are
profound.The 91-year-old legend shares them with the beleaguered
current coach in handwritten missives. The most recent came Jan. 25,
a day after the Bruins lost to Stanford at Pauley Pavilion for the
fifth season in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden was at the game, as usual, sitting behind the Bruin bench,
at the same odd angle he preferred during a 27-season UCLA tenure
that began in 1948.</TE>
<TE>   Those who know you, love you and are with you. As Pearl Mesta
said: "Those that mind don't matter and those that matter don't
mind."</TE>
<TE>   Keep it up,</TE>
<TE>   Sincerely, John</TE>
<TE>   Lavin keeps the letters in his office along with ones from another
elderly mentor, Pete Newell. They provide a stark counterpoint to the
barrage of mostly electronic correspondence from the indignant and
the enraged.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the Pitino episode, UCLA won games at Oregon and
Oregon State. Wooden again picked up a pen.</TE>
<TE>   You came through bloody but unbowed and reminded me of how you,
personally, have endured, with class, over the past several weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hardship often creates strength and it is so nice to see how you
and 'your boys' have bonded. Those who have never suffered adversity
never experience the true feeling of success.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden declined to be interviewed for this story, adhering to his
long-standing policy of not commenting on the current state of the
Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Does he cringe when center Dan Gadzuric violates a Wooden tenet,
confusing activity for achievement by committing fouls
indiscriminately and tomahawking dunks off the heel of the rim?</TE>
<TE>   Does he sigh at Lavin's haphazard substitutions, the shuttling of
10 players in umpteen combinations, when he steadfastly refused to
use more than seven players until his teams had a sufficient lead?</TE>
<TE>   Does he abhor the Bruins' reckless cross-court passes--a no-no in
his system?</TE>
<TE>   Probably. But it is clear from his letters that he believes much
criticism is without merit. And he must recognize the irony that his
success spawned the culture of negativity that has pervaded Westwood
since his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, it was present when he was coaching, as he pointed out
in the January letter after UCLA's loss to Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   I was severely criticized when I permitted Notre Dame to score the
last 12 points to overcome our 11-point lead and break an 88-game
winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   I was told that if a hummingbird had my brains in its tail end, it
would still fly backwards. Others could not understand why it took me
15 years to have a national championship team and why I did or did
not do many things that all knowledgeable basketball fans knew.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies a difference. While Wooden did not do many things
Bruin faithful wished, Lavin does none.</TE>
<TE>   Losing to Ball State in Maui, to Pepperdine at home, to Villanova
on the road. Blowing a 20-point lead at Arizona and getting knocked
around by USC at the Forum. Getting crushed at Oregon and losing to
Stanford at home for the fifth season in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Unforgivable with a lineup of three senior returning starters, a
two-time all-conference junior and one of the nation's most touted
freshmen, critics crow.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin pleads for patience, describing the team as a work in
progress. Freshman point guard Cedric Bozeman missed a chunk of time
with a knee injury and it took a while for coaches to realize this
group is not quick enough to play pressure defense.</TE>
<TE>   But even for those who extended the benefit of the doubt, the
grace period ends today.</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 UCLA plays host to Arizona, which leads the Pac 10 by one
game over Oregon and 1 1/2 over the Bruins, USC, Stanford and Cal. A
Bruin victory could throw the race into a six-way tie in the loss
column with five games to play.</TE>
<TE>   After Arizona, UCLA has a home game Saturday against improved
Arizona State followed by visits to Stanford and Cal. Oregon State
and Oregon come to Westwood in two weeks to end the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "The three goals we set at the beginning of the season, winning
the Pac-10, winning the conference tournament and winning the NCAA
championship, are still alive," Lavin said. "We've had a lot of
valuable experiences, some tough losses and big wins. But all of our
goals are still attainable."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have made a habit of stumbling early, finishing strong
and putting a dent in the NCAA tournament. But this team was supposed
to be better, a collection of seasoned veterans and talented
newcomers picked to win the conference and advance to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "Our upper classmen, especially, understand we have a chance to do
something special," Lavin said. "Now there is a sense of urgency."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Now for the answer to the riddle.</TE>
<TE>   Responsibility for the team's performance, as you undoubtedly
guessed, falls squarely on Steve Lavin.</TE>
<TE>   But the correct answer is John Wooden, because his legacy is
responsible for anybody believing a 16-7, 8-4 record is awful.</TE>
<TE>   Wooden was Lavin's age when hired by UCLA in 1948. In his 16th
season, the Bruins won their first NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   Could Lavin last that long before winning a championship? Not a
chance. But if Wooden is to be believed, the coach who Bruin fans
love to loathe will be better for enduring their wrath.</TE>
<TE>   And chased from Westwood, perhaps that title will come at his next
stop. He'll know whom to thank.</TE>
<TE>   Although it would be great if we never had to face adversity, the
fact is that it only makes us stronger--be it physically, mentally,
morally or spiritually.</TE>

<HD>Simpson Sues NASCAR Over Earnhardt Report</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Bill Simpson said all he wanted was an apology. Now he's taking
NASCAR to court.</LD>
<LD>   The former owner of Simpson Performance Products sued NASCAR on
Wednesday, claiming it wrongly blamed his company's seat belt for
Dale Earnhardt's death a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   He said he would not have filed the suit had NASCAR apologized.</LD>
<TE>   "It was not a money issue. It was just an apology," said Simpson,
who filed an $8.5-million defamation of character suit in Marion
County Superior Court four days before NASCAR's biggest event, the
Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we tried to get [Tuesday]," he said. "We went all day
long. And that was not going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   Now it's too late, said attorney Robert Horn, who also is seeking
an unspecified amount from NASCAR for damage to Simpson's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a different level now," Horn said. "Before we filed this
suit, we touched every base and took every opportunity to resolve
this, and they wouldn't [apologize]."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, NASCAR said: "The Bill Simpson lawsuit is totally
without merit. We will vigorously defend ourselves against his false
allegations. NASCAR will continue to focus its efforts on safety,
working with members of the NASCAR industry, including Simpson
Performance Products, Inc."</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt was killed in a crash on the last lap of last year's
Daytona 500. In a report Aug. 21, NASCAR said a torn seat belt
manufactured by Simpson Performance Products was connected with the
fatality. Simpson later resigned as a consultant for the company he
founded and eventually sold.</TE>

<HD>Fiedler Re-Signs With Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Quarterback Jay Fiedler, who has played for four teams in six
seasons, decided against testing the free-agent market and signed a
$24.5-million, five-year contract with the Miami Dolphins.</LD>
<LD>   The deal, which runs through 2006, was announced Wednesday. It
includes a $4-million signing bonus.</LD>
<LD>   "This was the one place that I wanted to be," Fiedler said. "The
excitement level I have coming back is definitely high, knowing the
coaching staff is backing me, and knowing they have the respect that
I can be a winning quarterback."</LD>
<TE>   Fiedler, 30, is 21-10 as a starter for the Dolphins. He had 3,290
yards passing with 20 touchdowns and 19 interceptions last season.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a player on our football team who has had
more of an impact in helping us win," Coach Dave Wannstedt said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins gave Wannstedt a one-year contract extension through
2004. Financial terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Wannstedt, 49, has led Miami to an 11-5 record and a playoff berth
in each of his two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh hired Kevin Spencer as special teams coach to replace
Jay Hayes, who was fired last month. Spencer held a similar position
with Indianapolis. Hayes was hired by Minnesota.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball</TE>
<TE>   The Florida Marlins and Tampa Bay Devils Rays were among the
original candidates for elimination this year, baseball's top lawyer
told the Senate Judiciary Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Bob DuPuy, chief legal officer of major league baseball, said as
many as 18 teams at first were considered for folding. The Minnesota
Twins and Montreal Expos later were selected as the two target teams.</TE>
<TE>   The committee is considering legislation to further restrict
baseball's antitrust exemption.</TE>
<TE>   Among Wednesday's revelations:</TE>
<TE>   Union head Donald Fehr committed to increasing revenue sharing,
but management officials said the players' initial proposal was to
raise the amount of locally shared revenue from 20% to 22.5%, rather
than the 50% in the owners' plan.</TE>
<TE>   DuPuy said Alabama businessman Donald Watkins had "submitted at
least a preliminary offer to acquire the Minnesota Twins."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr said the union would consider accepting a competitive-balance
draft in the next labor contract.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) claimed that one week before
Commissioner Bud Selig said Jan. 17 that Washington was a "prime
candidate" for getting a relocated team, baseball officials had told
Watkins "it was a waste of time to discuss relocation of a team to
Washington, D.C."</TE>
<TE>   Besides his involvement in negotiations to purchase the Twins,
Watkins said Wednesday he wants to buy the Expos and move them to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He would be the first African American controlling owner of a
major league franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Rickey Henderson and the Boston Red Sox agreed to a minor league
contract, giving baseball's career leader in runs, stolen bases and
walks a chance to play a 24th season.... Utility player Placido
Polanco and the St. Louis Cardinals agreed to a $1.75-million,
one-year contract.... Right-hander Mark Gardner, a 13-year veteran
who spent the last six seasons with the San Francisco Giants,
announced his retirement. Gardner was 99-93 and had a 4.56 earned-run
average with four teams in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Venus Williams defeated Anna Kournikova, 7-5, 6-0, to reach the
quarterfinals of the Diamond Games at Antwerp, Belgium. Williams will
face the winner of today's match between Silvia Farina Elia and
Marie-Gaiane Mikaelian. In other action, Justine Henin beat fellow
Belgian Els Callens, 6-1, 6-4.... Australian Open men's champion
Thomas Johansson was ousted by Greg Rusedski, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, in the
first round of the Open 13 at Marseille, France.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Lousiana State football Coach Nick Saban, coming off a
Southeastern Conference title and Sugar Bowl victory, signed a new
contract. Terms were not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   A six-bout card will open the 18th year of boxing shows at the
Irvine Marriott tonight, the first program produced by Oscar De La
Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions.</TE>
<TE>   In the main event, welterweight Ernie Zavala (13-1) of Burbank
will fight Eduardo Castillo (15-16).</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Verbum Dei High has suspended its football program for
the 2002 season as it tries to implement a new work-study program
that administrators insist is crucial to keeping the school open.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to not field a football team next season came after
the resignation of Coach Lalo Mendoza, who has been at the all-boys
school for 36 years, including 32 as football coach. Mendoza has been
chosen coach and athletic director at Salesian High.</TE>
<TE>   This fall, the school will require all students to participate in
its corporate work-study program. Students will work one day a week
in a downtown corporation.</TE>
<TE>   Verbum Dei's enrollment this year is 180 but could fall to about
100 next school year.</TE>
<TE>   Several returning football players are expected to transfer.</TE>
<TE>   The school will continue to maintain its athletic program in other
sports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Merricks, one of the top left-handed pitchers in Southern
California, lost his appeal for a hardship waiver from the Southern
Section after transferring from Oxnard High to Moorpark.</TE>
<TE>   He will be ineligible to play for the Musketeers unless he wins an
appeal at the state level.</TE>
<TE>   Merricks, a senior, signed with Arizona State last November.</TE>

<HD>Hasek Has Wild Time in Shutout</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dominik Hasek finished off the Minnesota Wild before turning his full
attention to the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   Hasek recorded his fourth shutout this season and the 60th of his
career, and the Detroit Red Wings defeated the Wild, 2-0, Wednesday
night at St. Paul, Minn.</LD>
<LD>   The Czech goaltender heads to Salt Lake City to represent his
country in the Olympics. Ten other Detroit players also are
participating in the Games.</LD>
<TE>   "We finished our jobs tonight," said Hasek, who made 21 saves.
"Now we can forget about the NHL for a moment."</TE>
<TE>   Hasek spent most of his time diving on the ice, helping to hold
off the Wild.</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Maltby and Mathieu Dandenault scored for Detroit, both on
assists from Steve Yzerman.</TE>
<TE>   The Wild hung tough with the league-leading Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to challenge them and make them earn the win and I
think that's what they had to do," Minnesota's Darby Hendrickson
said. "Our effort was great, maybe our best all year."</TE>
<TE>   But despite Dwayne Roloson's 22 saves, the Wild couldn't crack
Detroit's defense. Minnesota was 0 for 5 on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   "They had two great chances on the power play, but other than
that, we played solid," Yzerman said.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 3, St. Louis 1--Recently acquired forward Mike Keane
assisted on Dan Hinote's go-ahead goal and Patrick Roy made 33 saves
for the Avalanche at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Radim Vrbata scored for Colorado and Greg de Vries had an
empty-net goal in the final minute. Pavol Demitra scored for St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Florida 4--Alex Zhamnov scored twice and had two
assists at Chicago for the Blackhawks, who scored five goals in the
second period.</TE>
<TE>   Zhamnov tied the score, 3-3, at 7:43 of the second period and put
the Blackhawks ahead, 4-3, at 9:44.</TE>
<TE>   Valeri Bure, Marcus Nilson and Bill Lindsay gave Florida a 3-0
advantage early in the second period.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 4, New York Rangers 2--Mike Modano and Joe Nieuwendyk
scored third-period goals to lift the Stars at Dallas.</TE>
<TE>   Modano's shot from the right circle with 9:34 to play put the
Stars ahead, 3-2.</TE>

<HD>A Bad Back Knocks Nicklaus Way Off Course</HD>
<DH>Golf: Arthritis and disk problems keep legend from
practicing and threaten his chances of playing in 43rd Masters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Golf is providing Jack Nicklaus with far more pain than pleasure
these days.</LD>
<LD>   Nicklaus, 62, who was at the Riviera driving range Wednesday to
check out his son's swing, has been so bothered by back pain lately
the mere thought of competing leaves him wincing. The problem stems
from arthritis and disk troubles, he said.</LD>
<LD>   "[My back] has gradually gotten worse, and it hasn't been any fun
to play," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Since competing in the Senior British Open in July, Nicklaus has
played in just three made-for-TV events and has withdrawn from three
others, including the MasterCard Championships.</TE>
<TE>   He recently joined Augusta National--he and Arnold Palmer are the
only Masters winners to become full-fledged members--although his
back problems have dampened the experience.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gotten out there once," he said. "I played from the members'
tees and shot 80. That's not a heck of a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus made the trip to California to meet with San Diego's Pete
Escogue, his longtime back specialist, and drove north at the behest
of his son, Gary, who will play in the Nissan Open, provided someone
pulls out. As of Wednesday, he was the first alternate.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary called and said, 'Hey, Dad, will you come up here and help
me?'" said Nicklaus, who has been working closely with his son for
the past year.</TE>
<TE>   Jack watched Gary hit a few buckets of balls, then stepped away
when he moved to the chipping area. "He doesn't need me there," he
explained. "That's one place where he's 1,000%  better than I am."</TE>
<TE>   After finishing 169th on the money list last year, Gary Nicklaus
returned to qualifying school and was able to retain his PGA Tour
card for the 2002 season. He finished second at the BellSouth Classic
in 2000. His best finish last year was a tie for 15th in the
Memorial. Most recently, he missed cuts at Palm Springs, Pebble Beach
and La Jolla.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy watching him play," his father said. "I don't enjoy
watching him play poorly, just like he doesn't enjoy playing poorly."</TE>
<TE>   Lately, Gary has struggled with his putting.</TE>
<TE>   "Then the obvious happens," Jack said. "You start struggling with
not being able to get the ball in the hole and make a score. Then
your swing starts suffering."</TE>
<TE>   Although he enjoys helping his son, Nicklaus would love the luxury
of working on his own game. His back problems won't allow him to do
that though, and he cannot confidently say he will be ready to play
in his 43rd Masters in April.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a mess back there," he said, motioning to his back.
"I've sent it away to a few doctors. Some say operate, others say
don't. Obviously, I'm going to go with the non-operation first before
I go in the other direction."</TE>

<HD>New Course to Be Charted</HD>
<DH>Golf: Even without Woods, Riviera's redesigned layout will
be tested when the Nissan Open begins today.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not the same old Riviera anymore, not with the Tom Fazio tuck
job-turned-face lift designed to render the 76-year-old course a more
attractive suitor for the U.S. Open sometime in the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   It's also not the same old Nissan Open, which begins today in the
comfy canyon nestled nicely in Pacific Palisades, amid leafy
eucalyptus, gnarly barrancas and not-so-tough rough. For the first
time since Tiger Woods turned pro, he's not going to show up, not
that they're going to stop the show in his absence.</LD>
<LD>   Sergio Garcia probably said it best Wednesday. "If Tiger were
here, it would be that extra spicy in the soup," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Actually, there's a lot going on for the next four days at hoary
Riviera, where six holes are new, last week's champion is old (well,
Jose Maria Olazabal is 36), Garcia feels old at 22 and the weather
forecast says they won't have to play the last hole underwater as
they did last year.</TE>
<TE>   And what a thrill that was. Who can forget the sight of Robert
Allenby a year ago, knocking his three-wood to kick-in range on the
first hole of what was either a six-player playoff or a claiming
race, the rain beating off his wraparound glasses that were more like
some sort of soggy windshield?</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who shot a 66 in the first round and was two over par the
rest of the way, says he loves Riviera, which puts him in the
majority after all the changes.</TE>
<TE>   The official yardage of the "new" Riviera says 7,078 yards, which
is only about 20 yards longer than last year's official yardage, but
it could be longer than that if the tees are all the way back at the
eighth and 12th. So far, the so-called "controversial" eighth, with a
double fairway, has been a big pushover, with players choosing to go
down the new right side, at least until somebody puts a big net down
there.</TE>
<TE>   Said Garcia: "To tell you the truth, I don't think anybody's going
to hit it left." (Riviera memo to self: Get Fazio on phone, ask for
rebate.)</TE>
<TE>   As for the rough, this cannot be considered a descriptive term
this week. It's only two inches higher. Here's speculating that
Garcia's stack of expense account receipts is higher.</TE>
<TE>   There is much at stake this week, the $3.7-million purse with
$666,000 to the winner notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Without Woods, who is supposed to be taking the week off to a) get
healthy, or b) re-learn his swing, you have to say the Nissan Open is
as wide open as anyone can imagine.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the players who hit the ball straight, get the ball on
the green and putt the best are going to be favored.</TE>
<TE>   Identifying them is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval is back after a three-week absence with what appears
to be a new-found intensity.</TE>
<TE>   And Garcia would be chief among all of them if he had played
recently, but he hasn't. Garcia hasn't played a PGA Tour event in a
month, when he tied for 40th at the Sony Open. However, he won the
week before, with an 18-under score at the Mercedes Championships, so
you have to take him seriously.</TE>
<TE>   He says he is a much better player than in 2000, when he started
playing the PGA Tour on a regular basis. He says he's able to control
the ball much better and to scramble with precision, if that's a
possible description. "You just mature," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oddly enough, a few Garcia clones are experiencing the same thing.
Charles Howell III, David Gossett and Matt Kuchar are all here to see
who is the fastest of the so-called "Young Guns."</TE>
<TE>   Gossett, 22, won the John Deere Classic. Howell is also 22 and he
has been on a tear, tying for fourth at the Sony Open and for sixth
at the Bob Hope.</TE>
<TE>   Kuchar, 23, is still trying to break through. He might be best
remembered as the smiling Georgia Tech freshman who won the 1997 U.S.
Amateur, was 21st at the Masters and fourth in the U.S. Open. He
turned pro nearly three years ago, so Garcia says he knows just where
he fits in with this group.</TE>
<TE>   "I actually feel like the old guy," he said. "I've been hanging
around more than they have and I feel like I have a little more
experience than they do.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably age-wise, I'm one of the youngest. But maybe mentally
I'm not."</TE>
<TE>   Next week, the $5-million Accenture World Match Play Championship
is being played at La Costa, and that means a stronger-than-usual
field of international players will play at Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   It is a group that includes Darren Clarke, Lee Westwood, Sergio
Garcia, Olazabal, Vijay Singh and John Daly.</TE>
<TE>   All right, Daly is from Arkansas. Maybe he gets a special
exemption this week.</TE>

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>Hinrich Is Kansas' Wizard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The talk about Kansas used to be all Drew Gooden and Nick Collison.</LD>
<LD>   But the player who really makes the No. 2 Jayhawks go is Kirk
Hinrich, an unlikely looking 6-foot-3 guard.</LD>
<LD>   Kansas fans have taken to calling him Harry Potter.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's the hair," Hinrich said.</TE>
<TE>   They ought to just call him good. Very good.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri Coach Quin Snyder was flabbergasted by Hinrich's
23-point, six-assist game against the Tigers in a Big 12 game last
month.</TE>
<TE>   "Kirk Hinrich, in my opinion, I think he's the best player in the
league," Snyder said.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden probably still gets the nod: His 28 points helped the
Jayhawks win in overtime at Texas on Tuesday and he is among the
nation's leading rebounders.</TE>
<TE>   But Hinrich--the son of an Iowa high school coach--is having a
stunning season after averaging fewer than 12 points last season.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who saw Kansas (22-2) lose to UCLA at Pauley Pavilion last
month probably came away more impressed with Hinrich, who made five
of six three-point shots against the Bruins. (UCLA won largely
because it shot 53% and held off the devastating Kansas transition
game.)</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Hinrich scored 26 points with six assists against
Kansas State and a career-high 28 against Texas Tech, earning a pat
on the bottom from as tough a critic as Bob Knight.</TE>
<TE>   His shooting totals in those two games: 15 for 21 from the field,
seven for 10 from three-point range and 17 for 17 from the line.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, statistics aren't everything, as any coach's kid will
tell you.</TE>
<TE>   "Stats are like a bikini," Hinrich told the Kansas City Star.
"They show some things, but they don't show it all."</TE>
<TE>   Hinrich's ultimate value to Kansas is his conditioning and ability
to push the ball upcourt, because the Jayhawks--with a three-guard,
undersized lineup--have to run.</TE>
<TE>   They do it as well and as purposefully as any team in recent
memory.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden gets the rebounds, and Hinrich, Jeff Boschee and freshman
point guard Aaron Miles sprint for the outlet pass, often catching it
in full stride, more like wide receivers than point guards.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks run on made baskets as well, with the inbounds pass
usually caught around the hash mark.</TE>
<TE>   The flaw that could keep Kansas from a Final Four showdown with
Duke--they are clearly the best two teams at the moment--is size.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA also beat Kansas because Gooden had an off game and because
some of the Jayhawk guards struggled to shoot over UCLA's perimeter
players--Cedric Bozeman (6-6), Jason Kapono (6-7) and Billy Knight
(6-5).</TE>
<TE>   Defensive mismatches are a concern too--such as the one Hinrich
faced against Texas Tech's 6-5 Andre Emmett, whose foul trouble
limited his minutes.</TE>
<TE>   As the tallest guard in a starting lineup with three former point
guards, Hinrich often draws a small forward, but Kansas Coach Roy
Williams praises him as perhaps the most consistent perimeter
defender he has coached.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been challenged with so many mismatches as far as size and
position goes," Williams said. "But he keeps competing .... If you're
trying to find faults with Kirk, you've got to search really hard."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Harry Potter comparison:"Harry," one sign read at Allen
Fieldhouse the other day. "Take us to the Quidditch Final Four."</TE>
<TE>   Duke-Maryland II</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's rematch between the No. 1 Blue Devils and No. 3 Terrapins
is the most intense rivalry in the Atlantic Coast Conference at the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   But consider the record: Despite last season's spectacular
four-game series, Duke has beaten Maryland in 11 of the last 13
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Duke has swept the last three-- winning last season's ACC
tournament semifinal and NCAA semifinal games and a 21-point victory
last month at Cameron Indoor Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Vocabulary Word for March: Pods</TE>
<TE>   There will be some confusion about the new NCAA tournament
bracketing procedure designed to allow some teams to play early-round
games closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   Teams will be assigned to the first- and second-round sites in
four-team "pods"--made up, for example, of a No. 1, No. 16, No. 8 and
No. 9 team, a group that will play a mini-tournament for the right to
advance to the regional, as always.</TE>
<TE>   What the new system means is that four teams placed in the West
region could play their first two games in Washington, D.C., before
the winner advances to the West Regional in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to reduce situations such as last season when UCLA and
USC both went East, and Maryland played a first-round game against
George Mason--another team from suburban Washington--at Boise, Idaho.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been out West [five] of the last eight years," Maryland
Coach Gary Williams said. "It's a real hardship on families to travel
that far to see games. This way, hopefully, the parents of players
will get to see games.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe this will help. I'm sure some schools are not going to like
it. It might favor some of the higher-seeded teams who will get an
easier road."</TE>
<TE>   Because the NCAA selection committee will have flexibility in
deciding how much to use the new system, it's possible the changes
won't be as drastic as some imagine.</TE>
<TE>   Though many coaches are taking a wait-and-see approach--even
Duke's Mike Krzyzewski is concerned about whether geography will
affect seeding decisions--the bottom line is this should only help
the heavyweights, and perhaps put some more fans in the seats for
early-round games.</TE>
<TE>   Dean's List</TE>
<TE>   After Roy Williams turned down North Carolina a year and a half
ago and it became clear Larry Brown wouldn't get the job, the next
coach on Dean Smith's list was Rick Majerus, according to a new
chapter for the paperback edition of Smith's book, "A Coach's Life."</TE>
<TE>   The Durham Morning Sun published a story citing Smith's interest
in Majerus after a book excerpt appeared on the Web site goheels.com.</TE>
<TE>   Smith writes that he called Majerus, but before it went further
Athletic Director Dick Baddour had zeroed in on Matt Doherty.</TE>
<TE>   Smith also reveals that he briefly considered returning to
coaching last year after an NBA team called.</TE>
<TE>   "The flirtation only lasted a couple of days," he writes. "I
always thought it would be interesting and challenging to make
adjustments from game to game in the playoffs. After all, I never
said I was tired of coaching. It was the peripheral things that go
with coaching college basketball that influenced me to get out."</TE>
<TE>   All-Underrated Team</TE>
<TE>   With the Wooden Award on its way to a Duke player for the third
time in four years--Elton Brand, Shane Battier and all but certainly
Jason Williams--we might as well look around for some players who
aren't getting as much notice as they deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Our choices:</TE>
<TE>   Georgia guard Jarvis Hayes-- Transfer from Western Carolina
playing for Jim Harrick's Bulldogs is No. 2 in Southeastern
Conference scoring at 18 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon guard Frederick Jones-- Deserves nominations for blocked
shot of the year versus USC and dunk of the year versus Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh guard Brandin Knight--Brevin Knight's brother averages
6.8 assists--and has Pitt on its way to the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Alabama forward Erwin Dudley--The Crimson Tide is in the top 10,
but how many people could name Dudley or Rod Grizzard?</TE>
<TE>   Memphis forward Kelly Wise--All the talk is about freshman Dajuan
Wagner, but Wise is the first Conference USA player to have 1,000
points and 1,000 rebounds in his career, and is fourth in the country
in rebounding.</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect any career marks from Wagner, whose college career
already might be drawing to an end.</TE>

<HD>Another Skating Controversy? Go Figure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Every summer night in the United States, blue-shirted arbiters make
subjective decisions on rules that change from eye to eye.</LD>
<LD>   We sigh and say, "That's baseball."</LD>
<LD>   Every winter night in the United States, a striped-shirted jury
makes quick decisions on rules blurry or unwritten.</LD>
<TE>   We shrug and say, "That's basketball."</TE>
<TE>   So forgive me for not hitting the ice and ramming my wife's
favorite sport into the boards in the wake of a report that an
Olympic pairs event was rigged.</TE>
<TE>   All together now ...</TE>
<TE>   "That's skating."</TE>
<TE>   Don't trust it anymore? Don't watch it.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but NBC knows you'll watch it.</TE>
<TE>   The network knows this so well, it will spend the remaining 10
days of these Winter Olympics milking the story that a French judge
was pressured to vote the gold pairs medal to Russian skaters Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of these Games, you will have seen more of Scott
Hamilton than any weeping athlete, his screeching whines drowning out
their victorious cries.</TE>
<TE>   Can't stomach it? Don't read about it.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but we know you'll read about it.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy has run on the front page of this newspaper for
the last two days, putting sequins in the same room as terrorism and
war crimes, and we'll keep chopping down trees for it until the Games
have ended.</TE>
<TE>   After which, the sale completed, it will disappear from every
medium as quickly as a blue-light special.</TE>
<TE>   And when the next big skating event occurs, fans will not wonder
more than usual about the judging, being too preoccupied with
checking out the channel and the time.</TE>
<TE>   We're all having too much fun and making too much money to bother
with a little perspective.</TE>
<TE>   But what happened this week is not news.</TE>
<TE>   It's sports.</TE>
<TE>   So an official felt pressure to change her vote.</TE>
<TE>   So what do you think college basketball officials feel every time
they work a game in a small and loud arena? There is a reason home
teams get most of their calls and win most of their games. That
reason is that officials are human.</TE>
<TE>   But, wait, you say, this is even more serious. This is like an NFL
referee saying he overheard a line judge say he was pressured to make
a bad call that decided a game.</TE>
<TE>   Well, if you ask the Oakland Raiders, something like that happened
several weeks ago, when a replay official interrupted what was a
certain playoff victory over New England in the final minutes to make
a bad decision that eventually gave the Patriots the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the shame of a call that changed a season, there were no
news conferences, no lawyers, no appeals, no investigations.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it was the beloved Patriots punking the hated Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing at all like the beloved Canadians being punked by the
Russians, right?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, you ask, what about the obvious judging bias toward a
Russian group that had already won 10 consecutive pairs
championships?</TE>
<TE>   Anybody remember Michael Jordan's NBA-championship-winning shot
before his last retirement? Remember how he clearly pushed off Utah's
Byron Russell before hitting the jumper?</TE>
<TE>   Nobody complained, because the veteran gets the call.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody is complaining and glaring and finger-pointing now
because ... why exactly?</TE>
<TE>   When the head of the French figure skating federation said French
judge Marie Reine Le Gougne felt pressure, how did that make her any
different from any of the other judges that night, or any other
night?</TE>
<TE>   Think Canadian judge Benoit Lavoie felt any pressure from his
bosses? Everyone knows that judges are told, when in doubt, remember
who paid your way.</TE>
<TE>   How about the U.S. judge Lucy Brennan, voting after seeing her
countrymen going crazy over the wonderful performance of Sale and
Pelletier? Any pressure there?</TE>
<TE>   Of course. Even with its technical component, skating is still
judged subjectively, leaving such decisions open to the vagaries of
the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Those decisions have worked well enough that skating has survived
as an Olympic sport for 94 years. The best skaters almost always win.</TE>
<TE>   America, of course, has already decided that the wrong skaters won
Monday. Or haven't you seen the NBC polls, which are whipping up
folks into a lather not seen since Regis split with Kathie Lee?</TE>
<TE>   At last count, something like 99.9% of viewers think the Canadians
should have won.</TE>
<TE>   As if even 1% would know. As if I would know. As if anybody who
wasn't sitting with the judges would know.</TE>
<TE>   Even Claire Ferguson, former U.S. skating boss and judge who was
sitting next to the referee Monday, said she wouldn't know.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know when everybody got so smart,'' she said. "I'm not
that smart. I didn't take notes. I didn't check off everything
everybody did."</TE>
<TE>   The Russians held a slight lead before the free skate, which meant
they had to stumble to lose. Not just technically, but artistically.</TE>
<TE>   While they slipped in the first category, they shined in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   They used music that was more familiar to the majority of the
judges. They looked more like champions to the majority of the
judges.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a bias here, it wasn't national bias, it was cultural
bias.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, never try to win an Olympic skating championship
in front of eight non-American judges by using music from a sappy
1970s American movie.</TE>
<TE>   Officials decide the French judge was dirty. So that judge's vote
gets thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean the Canadians win. That only means that the
votes are tied, 4-4.</TE>
<TE>   Which means that the Russians, as the leaders before the
competition, would still leave as champions.</TE>
<TE>   Wait. That's boxing.</TE>
<TE>   But come to think of it, that's also figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes sinister, other times shameful, but always bulletproof</TE>
<TE>   You've never trusted Don King, but that doesn't stop you from
watching Oscar De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   You no longer trust Marie</TE>
<TE>   Reine Le Gougne, but that won't stop you from cheering for
Michelle Kwan.</TE>

<HD>Monrovia Rally Falls Just Short</HD>

<AU>Ben Bolch and Tim Dermody</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a frenetic 13-point fourth-quarter rally during which it pulled
to within one with five seconds left, Monrovia got the ball into the
hands of the player it wanted to take the final shot.</LD>
<LD>   Only the ball didn't stay there long enough for standout Bryant
Markson to launch a potential game-winner. Markson immediately
slipped and fumbled an inbounds pass out of bounds and fourth-seeded
La Puente Bishop Amat held on for a 62-59 victory in the first round
of the Southern Section Division III-AA boys' basketball playoffs
Wednesday night in La Puente.</LD>
<LD>   Markson, who scored 19 of his game-high 23 points in the second
half, pulled the Wildcats to within one, 60-59, with seven seconds
remaining on a pair of free throws. Bishop Amat's Juan Canas then
threw the inbounds pass through the hands of Paul Porter, giving the
ball back to Monrovia with five seconds to go.</LD>
<TE>   After Markson lost the ball out of bounds, the Wildcats fouled
Porter. His two free throws with three seconds left set the final
margin. John Haywood had 17 points and Porter added 15 for the
Lancers (21-6), who play at Fullerton in the second round Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Amat Coach Ray Lokar, who before the game expressed dismay
that his Lancers were matched up against a Monrovia team that had
just gotten Markson back after a long injury layoff, could only smile
after surviving the tough test.</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia (14-14) went 3-8 in the 11 games Markson missed with a
knee injury, but was 11-6 with him in the lineup. Lokar felt that the
Southern Section committee which devised the playoff brackets gave
Bishop Amat an unusually tough first-round draw, considering the
Utah-bound Markson had just returned.</TE>
<TE>   Haywood, who will attend Loyola Marymount, scored 10 points in the
first quarter as Bishop Amat built a four-point lead and padded it to
as many as 13 in the second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Monrovia got back into the game late because Markson repeatedly
called for the ball underneath and scored easy baskets or drew fouls.
It also didn't hurt the Wildcats' cause when the Lancers missed nine
of 16 free throws in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second time Bishop Amat defeated Monrovia this season.
The Lancers won, 62-45, when the teams met back in December.</TE>

<TE>   In Division II-A:</TE>
<TE>   La Habra Sonora 58, Laguna Hills 39--Senior guard Jake Trejo
scored 24 points, including 12 in the second quarter, for host
Sonora, which advances to play Santa Barbara San Marcos on Friday in
the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Sonora (18-10) held a 24-21 lead at halftime, but used a 9-2
third-quarter run to take hold of the game. A 10-3 run ended the
quarter, giving Sonora a 44-28 advantage going into the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   .</TE>
<TE>   It was the final game for Laguna Hills Coach Dave Brown after 34
years, including the last 13 at Laguna Hills. The third-winningest
coach in Orange County history finishes his career with 527 wins,
trailing only retired Anaheim Katella coach Tom Danley (618) and
Santa Ana Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight (599).</TE>
<TE>   Marc Dimick led Laguna Hills (14-13) with 10 points, while Matt
Donat finished with nine.</TE>

<DH>Wards at All-Girls Scott Academy Use Basketball to Help
Change Their Lives</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The floor is cement, the backboards made of steel instead of
plexiglass. The court, about two-thirds the length of what it should
be, doesn't have boundary lines, three-point arcs or a midcourt
stripe.</LD>
<LD>   "Sometimes we play it off the walls just to keep it going," said
Bob Welsh, coach of the team that practices here.</LD>
<LD>   This is basketball at Camp Joseph Scott Academy in Saugus, where
there are no returning players. If the academy serves its purpose,
there never will be.</LD>
<TE>   The players are incarcerated, serving no fewer than 16-week terms
for felonies ranging from prostitution to armed robbery.</TE>
<TE>   This is a high school girls' team, and there are no home games at
the locked-down, medium-security all-girls' facility. Rarely does
Scott draw more than a half-dozen fans at a game.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the way girls' basketball is played at high schools in
San Clemente, Harbor City or Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   The play is unrefined, but occasionally athletic. Despite the
criminal records of the players, they are almost courteous. Until the
final minute of a game earlier this season against Encino Holy
Martyrs Armenian, not a single curse word was uttered, or elbow
thrown in frustration. At least not by Scott players.</TE>
<TE>   And despite their shoddy practice facilities, they have won enough
games to make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Academy finished the regular season at 16-6 and won the
Alpha League title with a 7-1 record. Last year, the program's first,
the Royals didn't win any of their 16 games.</TE>
<TE>   But their efforts aren't all about winning.</TE>
<TE>   "Wins and losses are secondary," said Welsh, a probation officer
for 19 years with the Los Angeles County Probation Dept. "Our goal is
to build a stronger person."</TE>
<TE>   Only time, perhaps years, will tell if this season is a success.
The senior point guard, Ana Orozco, could have left Scott on Nov. 8,
2001, when her sentence expired, yet she has stayed so she can finish
the season, hopeful that she might be able to take her game to the
next level--in her case, a community college.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me appreciate my family, my friends and my freedom,"
said Orozco, 17, the team's 4-foot-9 floor leader. "I'm looking at my
life from a different point of view. Before, I was running the
streets. Now, I actually want to make something of my life."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Richard Shumsky wants to hear. Shumsky is the chief
probation officer for L.A. County, and Scott Academy is his baby. He
was responsible for its start-up, wanting a female equivalent to the
all-boys Camp Kilpatrick in Malibu that has had a Southern Section
affiliation since 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning's not important," Shumsky said. "Last year, we had a
perfectly horrible team, but they had fun. It's the effort, the
organization, that matters. We want them to have anything pro-social
that will help them in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Welsh stresses to players that they're making history, "setting a
path for others to follow."</TE>
<TE>   "We're working the bugs out, getting to the point where they could
make or break the program," said Welsh, who coached the boys' team at
Kilpatrick in the late 1980s. "If we're successful, not only on the
court but building their character and having them be regular
athletes at a regular high school, that's what will be the ultimate
measure of this program's success."</TE>
<TE>   If the team has a star, it's Alexis Brown, 17, a junior averaging
about 23 points. "It's phenomenal how much she has blossomed as a
person," Welsh said.</TE>
<TE>   To be eligible to participate, players must have a B average and
exhibit model behavior. Players are also limited to one season. If
anyone who is released from Scott Academy finds herself sentenced a
second time, she won't be playing basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a 'screw you' attitude," said Teeya Kemp, 14, a freshman.
"I'm working on it. I can't be like that on a basketball team."</TE>
<TE>   Kemp said that before she arrived at Scott on Oct. 30, she kept to
herself and didn't have many friends. She lived a life "surrounded by
drugs, partying, not caring about anything--not even my mother, my
sister or my dad."</TE>
<TE>   But the elements of life learned while under arrest--living in the
115-bed facility at Scott--hopefully will make her a better fit in
society.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned teamwork, learned a lot of discipline," said Kemp,
who like many of the 15 players in the basketball program
acknowledged having a problem controlling anger. "I just liked to
start swinging on people. I used to get in fights all the time. This
has helped me learn how to deal with people."</TE>
<TE>   Players at Scott can face solitary confinement in an isolation
room at Challenger Memorial Youth Center in Lancaster. It's a tool
that has been used on players in the past. Breaking the rules results
in solitary confinement for 24 hours or an extended camp stay.</TE>
<TE>   "Camp Scott opened my eyes, helped me to realize my lifestyle
before I got arrested was [wrong]," Kemp said. "Basketball is my
life, and when I get out, I'm never going to get arrested again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to go to school, get myself together, and dedicate
myself to basketball and get my education."</TE>
<TE>   Ateliana Tuli, who shares guardianship of her sister, senior
Melanie Tuli, said Melanie has become more receptive to learning and
more outgoing since getting involved with the team.</TE>
<TE>   In the game against Holy Martyrs, a 60-53 loss in which the Lady
Royals lost a fourth-quarter lead, the only person exhibiting any
hint of frustration was Toni Jackson, 17, a junior.</TE>
<TE>   "She elbowed me, and I pushed her back," Jackson said of her brief
lapse in the game's final minute. "When I first got here, I wasn't a
little angel. I'm no angel now. You saw me push that girl. But I've
learned a lot. I've changed a lot. You grow up."</TE>

<HD>Without Woods, Favorite Is ... Well, Who Cares?</HD>

<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I went to Riviera with an open mind Wednesday expecting to find the
ropes down and a tee time that would allow me to play at least nine
holes--figuring if Tiger Woods wasn't going to be here there wouldn't
be any interest in the Nissan Open.</LD>
<LD>   Now I've heard TV announcers talk about how brave and courageous
golfers can be, but I always considered that ridiculous--until now--
seeing the determination in these no-name drips to play on like
anyone really cares.</LD>
<LD>   Tournament director Tom Pulchinski said it might be good P.R. for
the event if I talked to Robert Allenby about his victory here over
Tiger last year. I asked if someone could tell me what the guy looks
like, and then asked Allenby, "Why would anyone in L.A. want to watch
this year's tournament now that Tiger isn't playing?"</LD>
<TE>   Well, you would have thought my cell phone rang in the middle of
his backswing the way he looked at me, and snapped: "Then don't
come--go home."</TE>
<TE>   Now personally I can't think of a single reason to watch golf if
Tiger isn't swinging a club, but I know some people are making
weekend plans, so I wanted to give the pros a chance to sell
themselves. Now if you like growling golfers, I highly recommend
Allenby.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pointless to even talk to you--I think I'll find someone
else to ask me a question," huffed Allenby, who walked away. But
after discovering no one else wanted to talk with him, he came back
to say, "It's just pointless for me to go on." But he did, and as
chatty as he was, I can't see this guy yelling, "Fore," and leaving
it at that.</TE>
<TE>   I told him watching a golf tournament without Tiger is like
watching an NBA game between Cleveland and Atlanta, and when I asked
him to name a golfer--besides Tiger--who is compelling to watch, he
said, "all of us."</TE>
<TE>   When I laughed, that probably didn't help his disposition, but
before he stomped off, he said, "That's your opinion and your opinion
doesn't mean anything."</TE>
<TE>   I wish he'd told me right from the start he's a regular reader of
Page Two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GOLFERS, OF course, are some of the most pampered athletes in pro
sports. After allowing the game-deciding run, the media surrounds the
losing pitcher in the clubhouse, but in golf only the leaders are
brought to the media tent each day where they get such challenging
questions as "How were the greens today?" The real crummy golfers go
unquestioned most days, and if the guys who strike out all the time
in baseball got the same kind of treatment, we'd never hear what Eric
Karros has to say.</TE>
<TE>   Take Wednesday, for example. The folks who run the Nissan Open
brought Sergio Garcia to the media tent, and not one reporter took
the opportunity to tell the kid what an annoyance he's become. He
just stands there over the ball, wiggling and gripping and regripping
the club as if it has been sitting on the stove, and so now every kid
is going to grow up shimmying over the ball--giving us nine-hour
rounds on our public golf courses.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you realize how much you bug me when you do that?" I told
Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't watch," Garcia said, and listening to Garcia and Allenby, I
got the impression they don't want me here. My other choice is to go
to USC on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to an unflappable and mild-mannered Fred Couples, knowing
he would roll with anything, and said, "Why would anyone come to this
tournament now that Tiger won't be playing?"</TE>
<TE>   So that's what a flappable and angry Fred Couples looks like, his
voice rising and becoming gruff. "That's not a legitimate
question.... That's crazy.... That's the most ridiculous question I
have ever heard. How can you ask a question like that?"</TE>
<TE>   To show him how easy it was to ask a question like that, I
repeated it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a slap in the face," Couples said, and I would imagine
that's what it felt like for anyone who bought an $80 ticket for the
tournament before learning Tiger had withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN ADDITION to Tiger, Phil Mickelson is not going to be here this
week, which is surprising, because I would think The Big Choker would
jump at the chance to play in any tournament Woods skips.</TE>
<TE>   One official told me 40 of the top 50 money winners will be here,
while another said 31 of the top 50. It doesn't matter--Chris DiMarco
and Jerry Kelly are Nos. 1 and 2, and if someone had told me they're
representing the U.S. in the two-man bobsled, I would have believed
them.</TE>
<TE>   "There are good players like David Duval here," Couples said.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is boring," I said. "I like personality in my athletes."</TE>
<TE>   Couples persisted. "Sergio Garcia has charisma."</TE>
<TE>   "Ever watch him stand there and just wiggle?"</TE>
<TE>   Couples nodded. "Yeah, I don't like that," and then he cracked,
going full circle on me and saying, "It's a legitimate question,"
asking about Tiger "now that I've gotten over the jolt of being
asked" about it so directly.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, [Tiger] is my all-time favorite player, but I don't think
there's only going to be 4,000 people here instead of 40,000--just
because Tiger isn't playing."</TE>
<TE>   I know for a fact, however, that whatever they were going to draw
with Tiger here--there's going to be one less person in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   USC, here I come.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail James Burbott:</TE>
<TE>   "I hear Salma Hayek has a thing for sportswriters who actually
write about sports."</TE>
<TE>   So that's what has been holding her back.</TE>

<HD>Arizona Collapse Is Not Forgotten</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No lead is safe against Arizona. UCLA found out the hard way a month
ago, sailing along with a 20-point lead with 13:41 remaining on the
strength of hot perimeter shooting.</LD>
<LD>   Call it a heat transfer. All of a sudden the Wildcats couldn't
miss, and within three minutes the lead evaporated. The crowd at
McKale Center went bonkers and the Bruins were run out of Tucson,
96-86.</LD>
<LD>   "We definitely want to get back at them," Bruin guard Rico Hines
said. "We remember that game."</LD>
<TE>   No. 9 Arizona is in first place in the Pacific 10 Conference.
Victories over UCLA and USC aren't out of the question--the Wildcats
beat Stanford and California on the road two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Lute Olson is worried if UCLA comes out hot again tonight at
Pauley Pavilion, Arizona won't be able to mount a comeback.</TE>
<TE>   "They shoot the three so well you need to cut down on the number
of opportunities they're going to have," Olson said. "That's easier
said than done because they have so many guys who can shoot it.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year we've played over there it's been a high-energy type
of game, and I would guess it'll get down to ball possessions and
shooting percentage."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Coach Steve Lavin agrees with the bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest factor is holding the other team to a low shooting
percentage," he said. "One challenge is to get [center] Dan Gadzuric
more touches and more shots, because he shoots at a high percentage."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   vs. No. 9 Arizona</TE>
<TE>   7:30, Fox Sports Net</TE>
<TE>   Site--Pauley Pavilion.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150, 850).</TE>
<TE>   Records--No. 20 UCLA 16-7, 8-4; Arizona 17-6, 10-3.</TE>
<TE>   Update--Arizona has won four in a row since losing to Connecticut
in overtime Jan. 26. Forward Luke Walton has three consecutive
20-point games and seven double-doubles. Wildcat freshman center
Channing Frye was six for six from the field and seven for seven on
free throws in the first meeting. Jason Kapono scored only nine
points in UCLA's nonconference loss to Villanova on Saturday--only
the second time this season he has been under double figures.</TE>

<HD>Morgan Gets Overwhelmed at Long Beach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens and Gary Klein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years ago, Wayne Morgan pulled himself out of the fire. This
time it consumed him.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan, in his sixth season as Long Beach State men's basketball
coach, announced Friday he would resign at the end of the season. In
a prepared statement, he said he resigned for personal reasons. He
also knew he was in trouble as a disastrous season collapsed around
him.</LD>
<LD>   With three starters and three top reserves returning from an 18-13
team, much was expected of the 49ers this season. Long Beach won its
first two games, then spiraled downward by losing 12 of its next 15
games. The 49ers sit at 8-16 overall and eighth in the nine-team Big
West Conference.</LD>
<TE>   The night before his announcement, Morgan said he had lost 15
pounds during a season he called the toughest he has ever gone
through as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Worst-case scenario was we'd win 18 to 22 games," he said after
the 49ers' loss to Utah State.</TE>
<TE>   What was particularly embarrassing were the home losses to UC
Riverside and Cal State Northridge, area schools and recruiting
rivals new to the conference. The fans also stayed away from the
Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Athletic Director Bill Shumard was going to review
Morgan at the end of the season, and it probably wasn't going to be
favorable. While Morgan still had two years on his contract, the two
settled on a $150,000 buyout after 10 days of meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all deeply disappointed with how the season has
transcribed," Shumard said Monday. "Coming off 42 wins the past two
seasons, there was certainly plenty to be excited about.
Unfortunately, a lot of that didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan was in a make-or-break situation in 1999-2000 after his
first three teams compiled a 36-48 record. Led by Big West player of
the year Mate Milisa, the 49ers went 24-6, won the Big West and
earned a National Invitation Tournament berth. The former Syracuse
assistant was rewarded with a three-year contract extension through
2004, but barring a miraculous finish, Morgan will have four losing
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach State job could be one of the best in the
conference--it has a first-class facility and its proximity to Los
Angeles gives it a rich recruiting base. Shumard hopes to have a
coach in place by late March or early April.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer to have a coach with four years of head-coaching
experience," he said. "The other thing is the coach has to be a good
recruiter and have the ability to recruit in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   An intriguing list may be developing. UCLA assistant Jim Saia has
already expressed interest. Another candidate could be Larry
Reynolds, who has built a Division II power at Cal State San
Bernardino..</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount is on a seven-game losing streak, its longest in
the two seasons under Coach Steve Aggers, and the Lions are set to
play tonight at No. 8 Gonzaga. The lowest point came Friday night
when the Lions were emotionally absent in an 18-point home loss to
St. Mary's, which at one time lost 22 consecutive West Coast
Conference games and the Lions already beat at Moraga.</TE>
<TE>   "We have six seniors who need to stand up and take ownership of
the program," Aggers said. "We have too much pride and respect for
the program to play like this."</TE>

<TE>   The Dodgers report to Vero Beach, Fla., this week for the start of
spring training, but there will be baseball games at Chavez Ravine
this weekend. With USC's Dedeaux Field undergoing renovations, the
No. 6-ranked Trojans play host to No. 25 Baylor in a three-game
series starting Friday.</TE>
<TE>   USC, which has made two consecutive College World Series
appearances, lost two of three at Long Beach State last weekend. The
49ers began the Mike Weathers era by shutting out the Trojans, 2-0,
in the opener Friday. It was the first time USC was shut out in a
season opener since 1978. On Saturday, USC pitchers walked 12 in a
7-4 defeat. USC's 8-5 victory Sunday helped the Trojans avoid their
worst start since 1981.</TE>

<TE>   Cal State Northridge second baseman Shaun Larkin earned national
player of the week honors for his performances last week against
Loyola Marymount and Washington State. Larkin had eight hits in 10
at-bats with four home runs. The senior transfer from Texas Tech
drove in eight runs and scored 10.</TE>
<TE>   In three games against Washington State, he went six for six and
reached safely in all 15 of his plate appearances. Larkin also hit
three home runs to raise his season total to eight. In a 6-5 victory
over Loyola, he went two for four with a home run and three RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine soccer players Saul Wolf and Natalie Franklin were
selected to the Verizon Academic All-America second team. Wolf was
the Big West Conference co-defensive player of the year for the men's
team and Franklin earned All-Big West selections the last two years
for the women.</TE>
<TE>   To be eligible for the honor, a competitor must have a 3.2
grade-point average or higher and must be in at least their second
season at their current school. Wolf and Franklin are seniors.</TE>

<HD>Busterna Busts Out of Doldrums</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No longer a novelty, Gennaro Busterna is a legitimate scoring threat
for USC.</LD>
<LD>   And while the Trojans' forgotten fourth senior has played his way
onto Coach Henry Bibby's radar screen and is angling to possibly
start tonight against Arizona State, Busterna's entrance in games is
no longer fodder for jokes. Not after knocking down three three-point
shots and getting two steals en route to a career-high 12 points in
the Trojans' 67-65 last-second loss at UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   "I think I've finally shown I can play basketball, at least earn a
couple more minutes," said Busterna, who played a career-high 21
minutes against the Bruins. "I surprised myself as well as others
against UCLA in that I can still play basketball and make shots."</LD>
<TE>   Busterna, a junior college transfer from McCook College in
Nebraska--where he averaged 20.8 points as a sophomore--had not
scored at USC until getting 10 points in garbage time of the Trojans'
97-80 loss at Arizona last month. He had not scored again until
lighting up the unsuspecting Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that we needed," Bibby said. "I'm very
disappointed in him because he hasn't given us this up to this time.
He's a big threat for us because he can make shots for us in numbers
and that's something that we really don't have.</TE>
<TE>   "It opens up the floor for us a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Busterna, who is averaging 1.8 points in 3.8 minutes, said his
recent success has made him want to scrimmage harder in hopes of
earning more playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "That [UCLA] game is a confidence builder," he said. "I've been
getting in with the first team in practice more so hopefully, if it
happens again, it won't be a surprise."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC is only 3-4 in its last seven games, but Bibby is staying
positive.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to panic; there's never a reason to panic," he
said. "The kids are going to go out and play the best basketball they
can play and the pieces will fall where they may. I have some good
kids in the program who play hard for me. The kids don't give up.
It's a good group of guys. So whichever way the ball goes, I'm very
optimistic it's going to go well."</TE>

the Sun Devils are the only team in the Pac-10 to have beaten
first-place Arizona and second-place Oregon. Arizona State senior
forward Awvee Storey is out for at least two weeks after taking a
blow to the eye Saturday. USC forward Sam Clancy has been named to an
all-district team by the National Assn. Of Basketball Coaches.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Providence scored 14 of the final 20 points and defeated No.
22-ranked Virginia Tech, 67-61, Wednesday night at Providence, R.I.</LD>
<LD>   The Friars (11-12, in the 5-7 Big East) beat a ranked opponent for
the first time in Jim Jabir's six seasons as coach.</LD>
<LD>   Chrissy Vozabs led the Friars with 13 points. It was Providence's

Gibson.</TE>
<TE>   No. 1 Connecticut 85, Syracuse 55--Diana Taurasi had 24 points for

<HD>Stanford's Powell Would Get His Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't have a vote on this year's Naismith Award for women's college
player of the year and I don't know the people who do.</LD>
<LD>   But if I did have a vote, it would go to Stanford's Nicole Powell
for a variety of reasons, starting with the fact she is the most
complete player in the West--and maybe the country.</LD>
<LD>   Those three words--in the West--are a big problem for Powell with
Eastern and Midwest voters who spend the bulk of their time watching
Big East, Southeastern Conference, Big 12 and Big Ten games.</LD>
<TE>   Even though second-ranked Stanford is 24-1 and undefeated in the
Pac-10, the Cardinal is not on TV around the country as often as
Connecticut, Tennessee, North Carolina, Purdue or Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   The one Stanford game many of those voters probably did see was
the Dec. 16 battle against Tennessee, won by the Lady Vols in the
final minutes. Powell didn't have a dominant afternoon, although she
led the Cardinal with 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   If that is their only image of Powell this season, it's a pity.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-2 sophomore, who has played every position except
center, averages 15.4 points, 9.8 rebounds and 5.9 assists. The
numbers rise in conference play--16.1 points, 10.2 rebounds and 6.5
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Powell has three triple-doubles this season, and broke a 25-year
school record with 21 rebounds against Oregon on Jan. 13. She is the
conference leader in rebounds and assists. No player in Pac-10
history, male or female, has ever led the conference in both
categories.</TE>
<TE>   Powell's case, however, is not helped by the national perception,
true or false, that the Pac-10 is a weak league this season.</TE>
<TE>   After Stanford, only Arizona State seems certain of winning 20
games.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Powell is just as valuable to her team has Alana
Beard is to Duke, Kelly Mazzante is to Penn State, Angie Welle is to
Iowa State, Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi are to Connecticut and
Chantelle Anderson is to Vanderbilt, to mention a few of the 20
finalists.</TE>
<TE>   And she is more versatile.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford, which was 19-11 and a second-round NCAA casualty last
season, is a legitimate title contender with Powell in its lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Leykam, the women's basketball sports information director
at Stanford, said the school is trying to get the word out about
Powell.</TE>
<TE>   "We wait until the season unfolds and you see other [players']
stats unfold," Leykam said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a handful of people call to find out more about Nicole.
There are more national media than regional media tracking her.</TE>
<TE>   "She is getting more play this year because of where the team is.
Last year, we were near the bottom of the rankings. This year, we've
been top five."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1983, when women started receiving their own Naismith Award,
only one player--USC's Cheryl Miller--is a three-time winner. Powell
probably won't get a chance to equal that feat.</TE>
<TE>   But if she continues this level of play, she should eventually
join former Stanford stars Jennifer Azzi and Kate Starbird as a
Naismith honoree.</TE>
<TE>   The award will be given out April 5 in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mazzante is another sophomore sensation.</TE>
<TE>   She leads the NCAA in scoring (25.3) and needs 52 points to break
Penn State's single-season record.</TE>
<TE>   She has 632 points into tonight's game against Michigan State.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If, through good play or good fortune, the United States national
soccer team manages to get past the first round at this summer's
World Cup, chances are it will run slam bang into three-time world
champion Italy in the first game of the knockout phase.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, that eventuality suddenly took on a much less
threatening appearance.</LD>
<LD>   Playing up to the level of its more illustrious opponent, the U.S.
team came within the width of a goalpost of tying Italy, but
eventually succumbed, 1-0, to a second-half goal by Alessandro Del
Piero in Catania, Sicily.</LD>
<TE>   Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni was not merely being polite when
he said, "1-1 would have been a fairer result." Indeed, the match
might well have ended all square had Landon Donovan, still only 19,
fired his angled shot in the eighth minute a foot or so to the right
when he unexpectedly found himself all alone against Italian
goalkeeper Francesco Toldo.</TE>
<TE>   Donovan's shot beat Toldo but struck the outside of the left post
and rebounded away, taking with it the best U.S. scoring chance.</TE>
<TE>   Presented a similar opportunity, Del Piero made no such mistake,
powerfully side-footing a cross from Massimo Marazzina into the back
of the U.S. net in the 62nd minute to the delight--not to mention
relief--of the sellout crowd of 25,493 at Stadio Cibali.</TE>
<TE>   "There were many positive things for us in the game today, but it
would be foolish to look at this game as a moral victory," said U.S.
Coach Bruce Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the American performance was not to be scoffed at. In fact,
the U.S. had control of the first 45 minutes and the Italian display
was so poor that it caused the fans to start whistling their
displeasure.</TE>
<TE>   "Some [Italian players] treated this game in too friendly a
manner, and that's not the right way to do it," said Trapattoni.
"They [the Americans] were much faster than us in the first half and
they got people forward in numbers." Arena started eight
European-based players and three from Major League Soccer. Goalkeeper
Brad Friedel gave a solid display and could not be faulted for Del
Piero's goal.</TE>
<TE>   The back line of Tony Sanneh, Gregg Berhalter, Jeff Agoos and
David Regis did well until Italy turned up the pressure in the second
half.  In midfield, John O'Brien of Playa del Rey was the most
impressive performer and defensive midfielder Chris Armas worked
tirelessly and to good effect.  Up front, the California pairing of
Donovan, from Redlands, and Joe-Max Moore, from Irvine, kept the
Italian defenders busy, but the absence of a tall striker such as
Brian McBride (who chose to get married this week rather than go to
Italy) was noticeable.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the U.S. performance against a legitimate power will have
given its three World Cup opponents--Portugal, South Korea and
Poland--something to ponder.</TE>
<TE>   Two of those teams also played Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal held Spain to a 1-1 tie in Barcelona, Spain. Jorge Costa
scored for the Portuguese on a header off a Luis Figo free kick
before Fernando Morientes tied it.</TE>
<TE>   Poland, meanwhile, romped past Northern Ireland, 4-1, scoring
twice in the first 11 minutes en route to the victory in Limassol,
Cyprus. Pawel Kryszalowicz got two of the Polish goals.</TE>
<TE>   Defending world champion France overcame some lackadaisical play
against Romania in Paris, but won, 2-1, on goals by Patrick Vieira
and Emmanuel Petit.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup favorite Argentine had to come from behind on a
second-half Julio Cruz goal to tie Wales, 1-1, in Cardiff.</TE>
<TE>   England, which plays Argentina in the World Cup's "group of
death," also was involved in a 1-1 tie, against the Netherlands in
Amsterdam. The Dutch took the lead on a Patrick Kluivert goal, but
Darius Vassell, making his England debut, tied it with a superb
bicycle kick.</TE>
<TE>   World Cup-bound Mexico lost, 2-1, to Yugoslavia at Bank One
Stadium in Phoenix, Ariz., where Jesus Mendoza scored on a
75th-minute header. World Cup co-host South Korea was beaten, 2-1, by
Uruguay in Montevideo, putting Coach Guus Hiddink's job further in
jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   The day's most telling display came from Germany, which thumped
Israel, 7-1, in Kaiserslautern, where Miroslav Klose netted a hat
trick in 15 minutes.</TE>

<HD>AIDS Cases Hit a 15-Year Low</HD>
<DH>Health: Drop in state is credited to drugs that slow
disease's progress. Figures do not reflect trend in new infections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of AIDS cases reported in California dropped to a 15-year
low in 2001, officials said, largely because of prescription drugs
that can keep the full-blown disease at bay for years.</LD>
<LD>   In 2001, the state Department of Health Services received 4,227
reports of new AIDS cases, down 11.2% from 2000. In 1993, the state
reported a record 18,964 cases.</LD>
<LD>   But officials caution that the figures can be misleading because
they represent the number of AIDS cases, not new infections of the
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. Experts say the same
prescription drugs that can prolong the lives of HIV and AIDS
patients have been interpreted by some as an excuse not to practice
safe sex.</LD>
<TE>   Several studies have found a resurgence in risky sexual behavior,
particularly among young gay and bisexual men, and suggest that HIV
infections are increasing in major urban centers, including Los
Angeles and San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics are useful, though, because they allow officials to
determine whether medications and support services are reaching all
segments of the population, or if disparities exist among different
minority groups.</TE>
<TE>   California's decline differs from the national experience. Federal
health officials say the number of new AIDS cases stopped dropping in
1998 after years of dramatic declines. For the next two years, about
10,000 people became infected with AIDS each quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Experts attribute California's distinctive pattern to
demographics. In California, HIV and AIDS are more prevalent among
gay and bisexual men, who seek testing earlier and have better access
to health care. As a result, prescription drugs have been able to
delay the onset of AIDS for a longer period of time, public health
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   In many other places in the nation, the disease affects a higher
percentage of minorities, women and injection drug users, who may not
seek treatment or may not have the same access to medications.
Because of these gaps, they may develop AIDS more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Because it can take 10 or more years for an HIV-positive person to
develop AIDS, the 2001 reports represent mostly those who were
infected in the late 1980s or early 1990s. As a result interpreting
the numbers is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Public health officials don't want to send the wrong message.
"It's a very tricky balance to maintain," said Gunther Freehill of
the Los Angeles County Office of AIDS Programs and Policy. "You want
people to know that there's hope, yet you don't want them to take
risk. It's really much better not to get HIV in the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Dana Van Gorder, director of state and local affairs for the San
Francisco AIDS Foundation, agrees. "Everybody hates to say that this
trend isn't a good one ... [but] there is concern that, at some
point, the trend may begin to reverse itself."</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, for instance, experts estimated that new cases
of HIV infection increased to 1,122 last year from 499 in 1997. More
than 800 of the new cases were among men who have sex with men, the
experts speculated.</TE>
<TE>   Most states collect data on new HIV cases, allowing officials to
gauge how many people are infected in any given year. Beginning later
this year, the California office of AIDS will assign HIV patients a
unique code that will help track the spread of the epidemic.</TE>

<LD>Police are looking for leads in the slaying of an off-duty Marine who
was shot over the weekend in an apparent case of mistaken identity.</LD>
<LD>   Ronny Brock, a 19-year-old Marine stationed at Camp Pendleton, was
standing on a sidewalk just outside his parents' house at Breed
Street and City View Avenue on Sunday when he was confronted by an
assailant, said Det. Joe Preciado of the Los Angeles Police
Department's Hollenbeck Station.</LD>
<LD>   After a short conversation, the assailant drew a gun and shot
Brock several times in the upper body, Preciado said. Police say he
may have been mistaken for someone else. Brock, who recently returned
from a month's service in Pakistan, was on leave for the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call Hollenbeck homicide Dets.
Joe Preciado or Hugo Baeza at (323) 526-3114 or at (877) 529-3855.</TE>

<HD>Revered O.C. Cypress a Victim of Fire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the largest known remaining Tecate cypress trees was lost in
Sunday's wildfire in northern Orange County, authorities said
Wednesday. The tree, christened "Big Mo" by a would-be developer
several years ago, was spared in a first round of fire.</LD>
<LD>   But flames fanned by fierce Santa Ana winds returned to claim it
late Sunday, after helicopters had to be pulled from the fire in Coal
Canyon to help battle a larger San Diego County blaze, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   ""There's no way to say for sure [keeping the helicopters on the
Coal Canyon fire] would have made a difference," said Ron Krueper,
superintendent of Chino Hills State Park, which includes Coal Canyon</LD>
<TE>   Fire officials confirmed the cause of the 2,400-acre blaze as a
50,000-kilovolt power line that emitted sparks as it was knocked to
the ground by winds that reached 78 mph. It took 1,000 firefighters
to battle the blaze, which broke out Saturday night near the Coal
Canyon exit of the Riverside Freeway. Officials estimated the cost of
fighting the fire at $621,732.</TE>
<TE>   The tree was one of scores of Tecate cypress destroyed or damaged
in the blaze. The stand was one of four in the United States. Only 11
others exist, all in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an extraordinary tree," state parks ecologist Geary Hundt
said. At 30 feet, Big Mo was at least twice the size of an average
Tecate cypress and was probably about 200 years old. A tree in the
canyon bottom known as Little Mo could grow to be as big as its
forebear, Hundt said. "It's a large, healthy specimen. "It was
untouched."</TE>

<HD>Davis Finds an Old Playbook Handy</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   Sixteen years ago, U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston was running for
reelection and was uncontested in the Democratic primary. Same as
Gov. Gray Davis today.</LD>
<LD>   Cranston was a ferocious fund-raiser and had campaign money to
burn. Like Davis.</LD>
<TE>   The Republicans had a bruising primary contest to nominate their
candidate. Like now. And there was one potential GOP nominee--a
moderate--who particularly worried the Democratic incumbent. As there
is today.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Davis clearly has studied and adopted the late
senator's then-novel strategy, while altering the playbook to fit his
own situation.</TE>
<TE>   Cranston fretted about U.S. Rep. Ed Zschau of Los Altos, who
intrigued centrist swing voters--just as former L.A. Mayor Richard
Riordan does today. But Cranston wasn't sure who would win the
primary. Conservative broadcaster Bruce Herschensohn was on Zschau's
heels.</TE>
<TE>   So Cranston produced two TV ads, one attacking each candidate, and
bought a lot of air time. Just before election day, the senator
shipped both spots to the major TV stations.</TE>
<TE>   "First thing Wednesday morning," recalls Cranston advisor Darry
Sragow, "we called the stations and told them to start airing the
negative ads on Zschau.</TE>
<TE>   "He woke up the day after the primary, exhausted and thrilled he
had won a difficult fight, and saw ads all over TV painting him as a
flip-flopper.</TE>
<TE>   "We all knew if Ed Zschau won the primary, Cranston was going to
have the fight of his life. We needed to plant doubts [about Zschau]
in people's minds."</TE>
<TE>   Zschau never recovered from the flip-flopper ads. Cranston's quick
strike was unprecedented. The Democratic senator won in November by a
1.4% margin.</TE>
<TE>   Davis didn't wait for the primary voting. He assumed that
Riordan--with his well-known name, personal wealth and big lead in
polls--would win on March 5. At any rate, as a moderate, Riordan was
his most feared threat.</TE>
<TE>   The other two GOP contenders--Secretary of State Bill Jones and
rich political novice Bill Simon Jr.--were too far off on the right
fringe to win in November.</TE>
<TE>   So Davis last month opened up a $1.3-million-per-week TV attack on
Riordan, portraying him as a flip-flopper on abortion rights, crime
control and the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   New ads currently running in San Francisco and San Diego also
claim that the former mayor "gouged the rest of the state" in selling
surplus electricity, "charging ... more than Enron."</TE>
<TE>   "We're just killing him with these spots," says Davis strategist
Garry South.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis camp is polling likely voters five nights a week. The
tracking poll shows "Riordan sinking," South asserts. The
front-runner's lead over Simon has fallen to 6 points, with Jones
further back. Davis is 8 points in front of Riordan in a November
runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, says Riordan strategist Don Sipple. In their polling,
Riordan has a monster lead in the primary and a 7-point spread over
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   True, Sipple admits, the voters' "unfavorable" impression of
Riordan is rising. But that's mostly among liberals who probably
wouldn't vote for him anyway. Davis' negatives also are climbing,
especially among the swing voters he needs.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever's right, South says, the governor now is rethinking his
strategy of running negative ads right up until election day. Riordan
might have been portrayed flip-flopping enough. Save the money. Why
risk backlash?</TE>
<TE>   Besides, isn't this a dirty job for Jones and Simon?</TE>
<TE>   Davis' campaign strategy is being praised by politicos as
brilliant. He has forced his most dangerous adversary into a bloody
two-front war. "He's weakening him as a general-election opponent,"
says longtime Republican analyst Tony Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   "That is encouraging the jackals to attack Riordan from the right.
These are activists far more interested in the ideological purity of
the Republican Party than in defeating Davis. Riordan's more of a
threat to them because he would take away their party control over
social issues--abortion, guns, gays....</TE>
<TE>   "They want to make it easier to kill live people, harder to kill
unborn people."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, notes Quinn, Republican business leaders are unhappy
with Davis over energy policy and his new workers' compensation pact
with labor. But they've developed a comfortable relationship with the
centrist Democrat and are not worked up about ousting him.</TE>
<TE>   "Riordan has not made his case to the business community about how
he would change things," Quinn notes. "They're not all that engaged."</TE>
<TE>   For now at least, everything's going Davis' way--thanks, in part,
to Cranston's old playbook.</TE>

The blaze that started Sunday destroyed nearly 40 homes and burned
5,240 acres. The fire, which raced through million-dollar houses, may
have started as a controlled blaze by farmers burning brush. The cost
of fighting it has been estimated at $1.1 million.</CP>

<HD>Fred Gehrke, 83; Ram Player, Artist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fred Gehrke, a former Ram halfback who was inducted into the Pro
Football Hall of Fame--not for how he carried the ball but for
painting horns on his team's leather helmets, touching off a colorful
and enduring quest for logos in pro sports--has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Gehrke, who later served as general manager of the Denver Broncos,
died Saturday at his home in Palm Springs of unspecified causes.</LD>
<LD>   "They forget I played. I played 10 years.... I was All-Pro in
1945, but it's those helmets that got me into the Hall of Fame,"
Gehrke told the Riverside Press-Enterprise in 1994, when the
peripatetic Rams were deciding to give up half a century in Southern
California and move to St. Louis.</LD>
<TE>   Gehrke, one of the first art majors to play in the National
Football League, received the Hall of Fame's first Daniel F. Reeves
Pioneer Award in Canton, Ohio, in 1972. That was apt, because it was
the pioneering Reeves, owner of the Rams at the time, who
enthusiastically approved Gehrke's innovative idea.</TE>
<TE>   The first owner to move an NFL team west of the Rockies (1946),
the first to hire African Americans (1946) and the first to televise
games (1951), Reeves was always eager to improve his team's
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "That got me thinking about the helmet," Gehrke told The Times in
1972 at his Hall of Fame induction. "I made a pen-and-ink sketch of a
ram's horns one day in 1947 and showed it to our new coach, Bob
Snyder. He said he couldn't visualize it on the headgear and told me
to go home and paint it on a helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "So I took one of those gosh-awful brown leather helmets and
painted it blue, then made a free rendering of a ram's horns in gold.
It's the same thing they have today, except the gold is now white,
due to television. The blue-and-gold helmet was much prettier."</TE>
<TE>   Reeves took one look and said, "That's it! Do it." Snyder told
Gehrke to paint 75, and the halfback completed one a night over the
summer at his Inglewood home, lining them up on his garage floor. He
tried to use a cardboard template he had fashioned, but, because of
the differing helmet sizes, had to paint virtually all of them
freehand.</TE>
<TE>   Gehrke was paid $1 per helmet, which covered only the cost of the
paint, he said. He provided the labor for free, and for the next two
years carried cans of blue and gold paint with him to touch up
helmets after each game.</TE>
<TE>   By 1949, the Riddell sporting goods company had created a plastic
helmet, baking in Gehrke's design. Some observers said the only way
to tell the Rams and the Cleveland Browns apart in the primitive
initial coast-to-coast telecast of an NFL championship by the Dumont
network two years later was the distinctive horns on the Rams'
helmets.</TE>
<TE>   The logo idea quickly caught on and, over the next decade, most
other NFL teams, beginning with the Colts (then of Baltimore, now
Indianapolis), adopted their own designer helmets; college and prep
teams followed. Only the Browns retained plain headgear.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was in Cleveland that Gehrke joined the Rams in 1940.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Salt Lake City, Gehrke excelled in sports--football,
diving and javelin tossing--as well as art. When World War II
intervened, he was assigned to be an aircraft technical illustrator
at Northrop in Southern California. To keep in shape, he played with
the Los Angeles Bulldogs and other minor league football teams.</TE>
<TE>   He rejoined the Cleveland Rams at war's end and helped lead the
team to the NFL championship Dec. 16, 1945. "Gerk" moved west with
the team and remained with the L.A. Rams until 1950, the last two
years as a player-coach.</TE>
<TE>   Snyder told The Times in 1947 that he considered Gehrke "the
finest left halfback in the National Football League." At 5 feet 11
and 190 pounds, Gehrke averaged almost 5 yards per carry throughout
his career, rushed for 1,664 yards and 15 touchdowns and had 56
catches for 529 yards and seven scores.</TE>
<TE>   He later worked as a pro football scout and joined the Broncos in
1965 as director of player personnel. He became assistant general
manager in 1973 and general manager in 1976. He was largely
considered the architect of the Broncos' rise in the NFL, but was
fired in 1981, when Edgar F. Kaiser Jr. bought the team.</TE>
<TE>   Gehrke then spent two years working with the Denver Gold of the
United States Football League and remained in Colorado until 1999,
when he sold all his sports collectibles at auction and moved to Palm
Springs with his wife, Jean.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to her, Gehrke is survived by a son and two daughters.</TE>

<HD>Waylon Jennings, 64; Country's 'Outlaw'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD CROMELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Waylon Jennings, the black-clad singer who personified country
music's 1970s "outlaw" movement, died Wednesday from complications of
diabetes. He was 64.</LD>
<LD>   Jennings, who had struggled with diabetes-related health problems
in recent years--he had a foot amputated last year--died peacefully
at his Arizona home, according to his spokeswoman, Schatzi Hageman.</LD>
<LD>   Jennings' chief legacy rests with his role in liberating country
music from Nashville's conventions.</LD>
<TE>   Teaming in the '70s with the like-minded Willie Nelson, he broke
ranks with the country establishment's conservative sound and
lifestyle, bringing a rock edge to the music and a freewheeling
approach to his lifestyle (he would struggle for years with a cocaine
habit, finally kicking it in 1984).</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes sporting a buccaneer's beard and looking like a biker in
black leather, he and the long-haired Nelson teamed on such records
as "Mammas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys" and
"Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)," forging an unlikely
alliance between the era's hippies and honky-tonkers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a dear friend, one of the very best, of 35 years. I will
miss him immensely," Johnny Cash said Wednesday in a statement from
his home in Jamaica.</TE>
<TE>   "Waylon and I were real close," said Merle Haggard, another
country maverick who was born in the same year, 1937. "We were close
in age, and we both made our start out West. Sometimes I was mistaken
for Waylon and sometimes he was mistaken for me throughout our
careers. We go back a long way. We're all going to miss him--he's one
of a kind."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Littlefield, Texas, the son of a guitar-playing truck
driver, Jennings picked cotton as a youngster and saw music as a way
out of his family's poverty. A fan of such classic country figures as
Hank Williams, Ernest Tubb and Jimmie Rodgers, he got a job as a
radio disc jockey at age 12 and soon began playing at talent shows.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to Lubbock in 1958, where he met rock singer Buddy Holly.
Holly produced Jennings' first single, "Jole Blon," and Jennings
became the bassist in Holly's band. On the night of the 1959 plane
crash that killed Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. Richardson (The Big
Bopper), Jennings gave up his seat on the plane to Richardson.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings moved to Phoenix and formed a band that began drawing
crowds--and talent scouts--at J.D.'s nightclub. After Jennings' brief
affiliation with Herb Alpert's L.A.-based A&amp;M Records, Chet Atkins
signed him to RCA, and he moved to Nashville. Rooming with Cash, he
soon established himself as a rowdy character and a hit-making
singer, scoring seven Top 10 country hits by the end of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   "I was stunned the first time I heard him singing a demo of Harlan
Howard's 'Green River,'" singer-songwriter Kris Kristofferson said
Wednesday. "I was a janitor at the studio at the time. I became a fan
for life, thrilled by the passion and intensity of his voice."</TE>
<TE>   But Jennings became increasingly disillusioned by the slick,
strings-saturated sound of mainstream country music, and during a
severe bout with hepatitis he considered leaving the business. But
after changing managers and taking control of his own recordings in
the early '70s, Jennings was on a new track.</TE>
<TE>   Collaborating with Jack Clement and Tompall Glaser, Jennings
constructed a leaner, stripped-down sound and recorded songs by such
young writers as Kristofferson, Billy Joe Shaver and Mickey Newbury.
Nelson co-produced the 1974 album "This Time," which included four
Nelson songs.</TE>
<TE>   The 1976 collection "Wanted: The Outlaws," featuring separate cuts
by Jennings, his wife Jessi Colter, Nelson and Glaser, was the first
country album to be certified platinum (sales of 1 million). He had a
No. 1 country record (and his highest-charting pop hit) in 1979 with
the theme from the TV series "The Dukes of Hazzard," for which he
also did the narration.</TE>
<TE>   Like many country veterans, Jennings was discarded by Nashville in
the 1990s as a new generation of pop-leaning artists dominated
country radio. In that period, he toured and recorded with
Kristofferson, Nelson and Cash as the Highwaymen. His last album,
"Never Say Die," came out in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Jennings sold more than 40 million records worldwide,
according to his representatives. He had 53 Top 10 country hits, 16
of them No. 1. He won two Grammys and four Country Music Assn.
Awards.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success, Jennings was reticent about such honors. He
skipped his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame last year,
saying it meant "absolutely nothing, if you want to know the truth."</TE>
<TE>   "Waylon Jennings was an American archetype, the bad guy with the
big heart," said Kristofferson. "When I introduced him to Muhammad
Ali, they were like two little kids delighted with each other. What
they had in common was being so openhearted to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, I got to work by his side and be his friend and
hear him say some of the funniest lines I've ever heard. Right now
he's probably whispering in Johnny Cash's ear, 'See, I told you I was
sicker than you.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jennings is survived by Colter, his fourth wife, and seven
children.</TE>

<HD>George A. Kasem, 82; First Arab American in House</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>George A. Kasem, the first Arab American to serve in the House of
Representatives, has died at 82.</LD>
<LD>   Kasem died Monday of pneumonia at a care facility in Carlsbad.</LD>
<LD>   The one-term congressman, a liberal Democrat, was elected to serve
the 25th District, encompassing West Covina, in 1958 but lost his bid
for reelection in 1960.</LD>
<TE>   During his brief tenure in Washington, Kasem worked for federal
aid to education, medical care for the aged and funding of the San
Gabriel Valley Flood Control project.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his Lebanese ancestry, the Oklahoma-born Kasem angered
citizens of Lebanon when he went to Beirut as a congressman. In 1959,
two Lebanese newspapers asked their government to expel the visiting
Kasem after he said in a speech that the creation of Israel had been
"the best way to restore the tranquillity of the Middle East."</TE>
<TE>   Raised in Los Angeles, Kasem served in the Army Air Force during
World War II and then earned his bachelor's and law degrees at USC.</TE>
<TE>   He practiced law in the Los Angeles area for most of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Kasem served as a commissioner at Citrus Municipal Court in West
Covina from 1978 until 1984.</TE>
<TE>   He had lived in Carlsbad since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors include his wife of 54 years, Catherine; a daughter,
Janet Orr; and two grandchildren.</TE>

us to elect Randy Hoffman and Judy Mikels to the Ventura County Board
of Supervisors so he can make Hidden Valley a city so the new city
can pave Potrero Road. But wait, Murdock wants us to not concern
ourselves with the road yet, not to worry about cityhood yet, just
get his politicians on the board first.</LD>
<LD>   The county is saying that it has 545 miles of road and can only
afford to repave 10 miles a year. At this rate, a road has to last
for more than 54 years. The solution, according to Murdock, is to put
his people on the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Not so they can run our county, among the more prosperous in the
nation, responsibly so we can afford to pave our roads. No, Murdock
wants them to help him put a city in Hidden Valley so the new city
can pave the road.</LD>
<TE>   But if Murdock gets his city and can control the development
rights (by buying yet more politicians), he can do an end run around
SOAR, and that lets him develop thousands of homes in the rural
valley. And he can pave miles and miles of horse pasture, oak groves
and rural hills.</TE>
<TE>   Is this the real reason he has given Hoffman $91,000 and Mikels
$25,000?</TE>
<TE>   Seems to me that if the road through Hidden Valley needs to be
paved, then we ought to elect some supervisors who will help the
citizens. Candidate Linda Parks in District 2 has a proven record of
listening to the residents of Thousand Oaks and of not being under
the control of special interests. And over in District 4, candidate
John Lane is running against incumbent Judy "Just Build It" Mikels,
who has proved herself as the running dog of the over-developers.</TE>
<TE>   Support Parks and Lane, not the special-interest puppets.</TE>

<LD>I am supporting Ron Bamieh for district attorney because he
represents everything that is good about Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   I don't care that his father is helping to fund what we all know
are expensive campaigns. What I do care about is that Bamieh is
blessed to have a father who loves and supports him and is willing to
quite literally put his money where his mouth is. Don't we all wish
we had a father who loved us so much and was successful enough to be
able to help? Three cheers for Bamieh's dad. Three cheers for a
loving family with strong values! Isn't that just what Ventura County
needs? Seems to me that is exactly what Bamieh has campaigned for.</LD>
<LD>   I don't much care that Greg Totten has the endorsements of several
police chiefs and police associations.</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure out those good old boys
are merely protecting the status quo. They must feel intimidated by
the ghost of Mike Bradbury.</TE>
<TE>   For all their machismo, they must be afraid of substantive change.
They must be afraid that their good old boys' network won't be so
good if they don't stick to some sleazy back-room political plan that
steals our voting will and allows for kingmakers to anoint their
successors. I think that stinks. Sorry, boys, but I think I'll vote
for the best candidate, not someone you think you can force down my
chad.</TE>
<TE>   As for me, I'm a young voter with a long and bright future ahead
of me. I'm voting for Bamieh because he holds the greatest promise
for my future and yours. Bamieh is young. He is also honest,
effective and smart.</TE>

<TE>   I have heard the allegation several times lately that Chief
Assistant Dist. Atty. Greg Totten was benefiting from a good old boys
network in his campaign to become the next district attorney. The
phrase "good old boys" creates the impression of power brokers in a
smoked-filled back room wielding influence for personal gain, but
let's take a look at who the good old boys really are in this case.
This list starts with the current district attorney, Mike Bradbury,
who has served honorably for the last 24 years.</TE>
<TE>   As county sheriff, my name is also frequently mentioned. Joining
us in supporting Totten's campaign are each and every one of the
police chiefs and mayors in the county, the deputy district attorneys
and Deputy Sheriffs' Assn., and virtually every law enforcement
organization in Ventura County. Is this a suspect group manipulating
elections for some sinister motive? In reality, this is the criminal
justice team that has made this area one of the safest communities in
the United States, while maintaining the highest ethical and
professional standards in the industry.</TE>
<TE>   We are people who represent the public safety interests of the
people we serve. We are also individuals who have known Totten for
decades and recognize him as a person of character and experience who
has earned the trust and admiration of the law enforcement community.</TE>
<TE>   The meaningful distinction is not whether one candidate is a
better trial attorney than the other, because both have distinguished
records. The real issue is that only Totten has the demonstrated
leadership qualities required to run a large and complex agency, and
also the confidence of those who will be working with him to make
certain that Ventura County remains a safe place for you and your
family to live.</TE>

<HD>Teacher Enters Not Guilty Plea to Charges He Had Sex With
Students</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge refuses to lower $250,000 bail for the
Camarillo High School instructor despite show of support from
students and parents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a courtroom packed with supportive students and parents, a
Camarillo High School teacher pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges
that he tried to seduce or had sexual relations with nine male
students in the last two years.</LD>
<LD>   Chad Wenzlick Pridgen, a 30-year-old science teacher and coach,
faces 33 misdemeanor and felony counts. Charges include supplying
teenagers with alcohol, showing them pornography and forcing teenage
boys to perform oral sex on him.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, Pridgen could face more than 20 years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Roland Purnell refused Wednesday to lower
bail for Pridgen, despite testimony from students and a fellow
educator that he is "a man of his word" and well-respected in the
community. Bail is set at $250,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The court has to assume these charges are true in a bail
hearing," Purnell told more than 50 students, parents and teachers in
the courtroom. "Taking into consideration the trust he had as a
teacher.... Someone who would commit these acts is a great risk to
the community."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen did not speak during the hearing and made no eye contact
with supporters.</TE>
<TE>   He remained in Ventura County Jail as of late Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Douglas Ridley pushed for the maximum allowable
bail after filing more charges against Pridgen on Wednesday. The
teacher is accused of having sexual relations with two of the nine
teens and engaging in lewd behavior with all of them.</TE>
<TE>   Additional charges are possible, Ridley said, as investigators
still have to contact several more potential victims.</TE>
<TE>   "This is serious," Ridley told the court. "His access to
high-school-aged children and his ability to drum up this kind of
support is a concern. We believe there is danger of tampering with
witnesses in this case."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen's Los Angeles attorney, Paul Takakjian, argued in court
that the public show of support for Pridgen indicates that the
teacher poses no danger to the community. Pridgen was considered a
"model citizen with the full support of the community as a teacher
and as a coach," Takakjian said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in the Oxnard Union High School District have placed
Pridgen on paid administrative leave and assigned his four Advanced
Placement classes to a substitute teacher. District officials were to
discuss the matter in a closed session Wednesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Several Camarillo High School students and parents who showed up
at court said they did not believe the charges, describing Pridgen as
one of the best teachers they had ever known.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally false; he's not like that," said 19-year-old Carleen
Pitts, a former environmental science student of Pridgen who now
attends Moorpark College. "I find the allegations to be ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Christine Tobias, who has known Pridgen for seven years, said he
was a great influence over her twin daughters, who both were students
of his.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good mentor and a tough taskmaster, who got the most out
of kids and the best out of kids," Tobias said. "Until he looks me in
the face and tells me he did these things, I will never believe it. I
know him too well."</TE>
<TE>   Pridgen was arrested Feb. 5 after a sheriff's investigation
prompted by one student, now 18. The youth said the teacher showed
him pornography in attempts to seduce him, gave him alcohol and
masturbated in front of him on several occasions between the fall of
2000 and last month, according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   The student reported the alleged behavior to police after an
incident Jan. 31, when Pridgen asked the boy to see him after class
about assignments missed because the boy had been sick, according to
court records.</TE>
<TE>   The student told police that Pridgen then asked him to engage in
oral sex with another student in exchange for "not giving him a bad
grade during the semester," court documents said.</TE>
<TE>   At the bail hearing Wednesday, Sheriff's Det. Scott Peterson said
his investigation revealed that Pridgen had Camarillo High School
students at his house on weekends for get-togethers that often
involved alcohol and pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "He would show them the tapes, and that would lead to other sexual
behavior," Peterson said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Camarillo High senior Susan Trinh, 16, said she had been
to Pridgen's house with other students, and the gatherings usually
involved studying or playing board games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Mr. Pridgen for two years, and I feel he'd never be a
threat to anyone," she told the court Wednesday. "He's an excellent
person and an excellent citizen."</TE>

<HD>Rules Target Killer of Oaks</HD>
<DH>Disease: A federal quarantine of 10 coastal counties is
designed to limit a fungus that has destroyed thousands of trees.
Mulch shipments may be affected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH SCHOCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to stem the spread of a deadly tree disease, federal officials
today are expected to announce strict new quarantine rules that could
affect the transport of bark chips, mulch and even Mother's Day
azaleas.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is unveiling more stringent
regulations governing nursery activities and the movement of nursery
materials out of a 10-county area of coastal California.</LD>
<LD>   The rules were designed to curb the spread of sudden oak death, a
fungus that has killed thousands of oaks in northern and central
areas of the state. The disease is believed to be related to the
organism that devastated the Irish potato crop in the 19th century.</LD>
<TE>   In California, the fungus has attacked tan oaks, black oaks and
coastal oaks, and was found last month in commercial rhododendrons
growing in Santa Cruz County near some stricken oak trees.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules will take effect immediately. They will override
existing state restrictions, which generally have been less
restrictive on movement of such items as azaleas and bark chips,
state officials said. Precise details, they said, will not be known
until the rules are published today.</TE>
<TE>   "The law states that if local regulations are more or less strict
than federal regulations, the federal regulations proceed," said
Steve Lyle, director of public affairs at the California Department
of Food and Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   But on at least one key point, the federal rules are expected to
be less stringent.</TE>
<TE>   The state focused on restricting the movement of plant materials
from so-called "zones of infestation" to non-infested areas within
the 10 counties. The federal rules may not regulate those zones, but
instead may govern only what leaves the 10-county area.</TE>
<TE>   USDA spokesman Larry Hawkins said Wednesday that he could not
confirm that change or comment on specific aspects of the new rules
until they are published.</TE>
<TE>   "The USDA is trying to balance a lot of concerns with their rule,"
added Bill Callison, assistant director for plant health and pest
services for the state agriculture department.</TE>
<TE>   The public will be able to comment on the interim federal rules at
a Feb. 27 hearing in Petaluma.</TE>
<TE>   Another public hearing will be held in Washington, D.C., and
federal officials will then evaluate public comments and issue a
final rule.</TE>

<LD>Two LAPD officers responding to a Hollywood resident's complaint of
armed intruders knocked on the door and heard a voice inside say,
"Hello."</LD>
<LD>   The cops asked everyone to step outside. But the occupant wouldn't
open the door, responding instead, "Hello, how are you doing?"</LD>
<LD>   The officers tried to reason with the occupant, but the latter
repeated, "Hello, how are you doing?"</LD>
<TE>   Eventually, they gained entrance and discovered there were no
armed intruders in there, only a parrot. An unarmed parrot at that.</TE>
<TE>   Stork pick-up point? In case your kid wants to know where babies
come from, Tony St. John of San Diego sent along the answer (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Don't know much about geography: L.A.'s urban sprawl is really out
of control, judging from the label spotted by Mark Scott of Chino
Hills (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: After seeing how a letter from Rep. Elton
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) was addressed, Sue Ingram of Camarillo
wondered if she could vote twice (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   A tip for viewers: Don't know if you saw it, but KCBS-TV Channel 2
broadcast an expose of valets the other day, finding that some
couldn't resist plucking money left behind in vehicles they were
parking.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I've never had such an incident; any cash I carry in
my Honda is immediately appropriated by my 9-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   But I was disappointed that KCBS didn't examine another, more
serious problem: valets who change the settings on my car radio.</TE>
<TE>   Funny food: Mention was made here of Leave Me Alone, a Torrance
eatery that, contrary to its attention-seeking name, welcomes groups
as well as individual diners.</TE>
<TE>   I was pleased to see that Leave Me Alone made a list of recent
funny restaurant names on the chowhounds.com Web site. David Chan of
L.A., who submitted some of the names, alerted me to this honor
dinner roll:</TE>
<TE>   * Burrp Cafe (Alhambra)</TE>
<TE>   * Private Kitchen (Alhambra)</TE>
<TE>   * Shalom Hunan (L.A.)</TE>
<TE>   * Mad Wolf BBQ (Fullerton)</TE>
<TE>   * Fat Less Express (Culver City)</TE>
<TE>   * Beaux Thai Grill (North Hollywood)</TE>
<TE>   * Wok Don't Run (Northridge)</TE>
<TE>   And, in the supermarket category:</TE>
<TE>   * Shun Fat (Monterey Park)</TE>
<TE>   Chan adds, by the way, that Private Kitchen is open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: I'm proud that I'm one of the electors of the Shrine
of the Eternals, a sort of Screwball Hall of Fame created by the
Baseball Reliquary of Monrovia. The Reliquary is to major league
baseball what the Doo Dah Parade is to the Rose Parade.</TE>
<TE>   One of my votes will go for former minor league catcher Dave
Bresnahan, who, in 1987, sculpted a potato in the shape of a baseball
and threw it wildly on purpose during a game. When a baserunner
figured it was safe to run home, Bresnahan tagged the poor fellow out
with the real baseball, which he had concealed. He was banned from
the sport but later achieved oddball immortality by appearing on
David Letterman's show.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Gets Strict Rules on Runoff</HD>
<DH>Environment: Local agencies say the new regulations will
cost them $15 million more a year but don't ensure better water
quality.</DH>

<LD>State water regulators approved stringent new runoff rules for south
Orange County on Wednesday, despite objections from local officials
who fear the restrictions could cost the county and local cities an
additional $15million a year and still fall short of improving water
quality.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to be strong. We need to mandate. It's time for change,"
said Janet Keller, a member of the San Diego Regional Water Quality
Control Board, shortly before the unanimous vote in the Mission Viejo
City Council chamber.</LD>
<LD>   The south Orange County restrictions are intended to decrease the
amount of pollutants flowing into local waterways and the ocean. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified urban
runoff--water that washes car oil, pet waste and other contaminants
off streets and lawns into storm drains, creeks and eventually the
ocean--as the No. 1 cause of coastal pollution.</LD>
<TE>   The rules are contained in a new five-year runoff permit required
by the federal Clean Water Act.</TE>
<TE>   "This permit's a challenge," said Chris Crompton, Orange County's
environmental manager, after the hearing. "It's got a tremendous
amount of detail and a tremendous amount of requirements which will
be a significant challenge to implement."</TE>
<TE>   Key provisions of the rules, which apply to 11 cities,
unincorporated county land and the county flood-control district in
southern Orange County, include:</TE>
<TE>   * Requiring most developments and major redevelopment projects to
include devices that slow and cleanse runoff from the first rainfall,
which is typically the dirtiest because it picks up contaminants that
have accumulated on streets for weeks or months.</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibiting polluted runoff from flowing out of storm drains to
waterways. The runoff would need to be either filtered in the drains
or diverted.</TE>
<TE>   * Inspecting construction, industrial, commercial and municipal
sites for possible contamination.</TE>
<TE>   * Educating residents, city workers and others about the effects
of urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   County and city officials have said they are already spending
nearly $7 million this fiscal year to comply with storm-water
regulations in the southern part of the county, and they expect the
new requirements to add at least $15million to that cost.</TE>
<TE>   The affected cities are Aliso Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Beach,
Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Laguna Woods, Lake Forest, Mission
Viejo, Rancho Santa Margarita, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Woods City Manager Leslie A. Keane said the city may have
to spend more than $600,000 to meet the new rules--the same amount
the city spends on police protection.</TE>
<TE>   She said the city will fund this mandate by cutting social
services, transportation and recreation--a disappointment in a city
where the average age is 78.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are really critical services for seniors," Keane said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists, who have disputed the cost figures projected by
the county and cities, were pleased with the new rules, which they
say mirror the tough standards recently enacted for Los Angeles, San
Diego and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   "It's another brick in the wall," said David Beckman, a senior
attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council's Los Angeles
office. "The thing that's most important is that the board saw
through the cities' smoke screen so clearly. They deserve credit for
sticking to their principles."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether local government officials will appeal the
rules, though one board member said during the hearing that she
expects an appeal or litigation.</TE>
<TE>   Similar permits elsewhere have repeatedly been challenged. In Los
Angeles County, more than 40 cities appealed to the regional board's
parent, the State Water Resources Control Board. Appeals at the state
level were exhausted for a San Diego County permit, so it is now in
the courts.</TE>

<HD>Saugus Firm Is Focus of Probe by U.S. Agencies</HD>
<DH>Health: Allegations against the plastics company include
exposing workers to high levels of toxic chemicals and falsifying
environmental reports.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal authorities are investigating allegations that a Saugus
plastics company illegally discharged toxic chemicals, exposed
workers to the substances and falsified environmental reports,
according to court documents.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI and Environmental Protection Agency seized company
records, computers and chemical containers from Keysor Century Corp.,
a manufacturer of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC, officials said
Wednesday. The items were taken during a search Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   No charges have been filed and the investigation is continuing,
authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   FBI agents said in a search warrant affidavit that the
family-owned company, once a prominent producer of vinyl records, was
making PVC beyond its capacity, causing equipment to malfunction and
release "dangerous amounts" of vinyl chloride, which has been linked
to liver cancer.</TE>
<TE>   The agents also said in the affidavit that several company
officials "knew of the continuous falsification of environmental
exposure and emissions data that were submitted to local, state and
federal regulatory agencies."</TE>
<TE>   Calls to Keysor were not returned. Robert Crockett, who represents
the company, said Keysor was "fully cooperating with the FBI's
investigation. The company intends to comply fully with environmental
laws and regulations."</TE>
<TE>   A 2001 investigation by the California Division of Occupational
Safety and Health resulted in 63 citations against Keysor for
falsifying documents and exceeding air quality limits for vinyl
chloride on company property, Cal/OSHA spokeswoman Susan Gard said.</TE>
<TE>   "We conducted our own air monitoring," Gard said. "The air was 22
times the permissible exposure level for vinyl chloride."</TE>
<TE>   The company is challenging the $218,000 in fines imposed by
Cal/OSHA, Gard said.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal agencies began scrutinizing the company in
summer 2001 when a number of fired employees accused Keysor officials
of forging documents and violating environmental rules, Gard said.</TE>
<TE>   In the federal affidavit, agents said Keysor employees cited
"frequent unreported spills" of contaminated waste water from the
plastic-making process. The waste water gushed out of manholes in
Keysor's parking lot at 26000 Springbrook Ave., the affidavit
contended.</TE>
<TE>   In November, the Los Angeles County Fire Department cited Keysor
for an "intentional or suspicious act" that caused the release of
3,000 gallons of waste water into storm drains. Storm drain samples
near the plant exceeded federal limits for vinyl chloride, vinyl
acetate and trichloroethylene, the affidavit stated.</TE>
<TE>   One informant told the FBI that the company burned off plastics
waste in a gas boiler, which at one point leaked "acidic vapor" and
later exploded, the affidavit said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the documents allegedly falsified, agents said, were those
that tracked workers' exposure to vinyl chloride.</TE>
<TE>   FBI lead investigator Kathleen Giles stated in the affidavit that
a company file said employee Gary Arment was exposed in 1996 to 0.75
parts per million of vinyl chloride over eight hours--just under the
federal limit of 1 part per million. Giles stated in the affidavit
that an earlier company report showed that Arment was exposed to
13.71 parts per million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Keysor officials reprimanded a human resources manager
for evacuating the plant when a ruptured gasket released 1,000 parts
per million of vinyl chloride, Giles said.</TE>
<TE>   The manager "was severely reprimanded by Keysor President Howard
Hill and his plant manager, Scott Speakman, who both viewed this
action [manager's order to evacuate the plant] as unnecessary,"
according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Hill died last year. Speakman could not be reached Wednesday.
Officials said they have monitored the air quality around the plant
and found it to be safe.</TE>
<TE>   Keysor was founded by recording pioneer Bud Keysor. It is now
owned by his five children.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the company fell out of compliance with South Coast Air
Quality Management District rules after the agency lowered the
allowable number of estimated cancers that can be contracted by
people who breathe a company's air pollutants over a lifetime. The
standard of 100 cancers per million people was reduced to 25 cancers
per million.</TE>
<TE>   Keysor was determined to cause an estimated rate of 62 cancers per
million people. It and other companies were given until 2003 or 2005
to reduce their toxic emissions. Crockett said he didn't know whether
the company had complied.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Cal/OSHA fined Keysor for failing to properly monitor
vinyl chloride levels, Gard said. The air quality district fined the
company in 1985 for releasing vinyl chloride into the air.</TE>

<LD>A mysterious smell drifted slowly from the South Bay area as far east
as Redlands on Wednesday afternoon, but officials said they had no
idea what it was or where it originated.</LD>
<LD>   County fire officials first suspected a major natural gas leak,
but Peter Hidalgo, a spokesman for Southern California Gas Co., said
a systemwide check showed no leaks. Hidalgo said the smell probably
came from a refinery, but no leaks were reported.</LD>
<LD>   The odor was first reported about 2 p.m. By 6, there were
complaints in Redlands.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigators have arrested Westlake High School's former bookkeeper
on suspicion of stealing more than $150,000 from the school's student
store, sporting events and other campus money-making activities.</LD>
<LD>   Sandra Hofacker, 41, was taken into custody at her Simi Valley
home Saturday after an investigation that began in April at the
school, said Ventura County Sheriff's Det. Jeff Hill.</LD>
<LD>   Hill said Hofacker told him she took the money to support a
longtime gambling habit.</LD>
<TE>   Hofacker was charged with one count of grand theft with a special
allegation because the amount of money exceeded $50,000, said Deputy
Dist. Atty. John Vanarelli. She is free in lieu of $20,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   She has not entered a plea and a court date has not been set,
Vanarelli said.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation started when accountants with the Conejo Valley
Unified School District noticed that money was missing from several
funds at Westlake High School, said Gary Mortimer, the district's
assistant superintendent for business services.</TE>
<TE>   Hofacker worked as a bookkeeper at the high school for 12 years
before resigning just prior to the start of this school year. Hill
said a camera installed by a private security firm hired by the
district videotaped Hofacker taking cash from the student store.</TE>
<TE>   The thefts apparently began in September 1999, Hill said.</TE>

<LD>Sheriff's investigators in Kern County say they have a suspect in a
13-year-old murder case.</LD>
<LD>   Officials using DNA tests arrested Adam Guerrero, 37, on Monday in
connection with the slaying of Amado Carreno, whose body was found in
Kern River Canyon on Feb. 3, 1989. Investigators said Carreno, 23,
was stabbed to death.</LD>
<LD>   Guerrero was a suspect during the initial investigation after
blood was found on his coat. But tests used in the late 1980s could
determine only blood type, not origin, Sgt. Glenn Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   Carreno was Guerrero's sister's boyfriend at the time of his
death, Johnson said.</TE>

<LD>The father accused of starving his 19-month-old son to death and
neglecting a dozen other children was investigated 12 years ago in
the mysterious death of an infant daughter.</LD>
<LD>   The cause of that child's death was not determined, and charges
were not filed against Winnfred Wright or the baby's mother.</LD>
<LD>   Wright later moved his family to a Marin County suburb, where the
household group grew to four women and 13 children before one of the
children died in November.</LD>
<TE>   Among those present at the earlier death, according to a medical
examiner's report, was Carol Bremner, one of four women who appeared
with Wright in court Wednesday on allegations of severe child
neglect.</TE>

<LD>Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation Wednesday to reimburse state

duty.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government pays the difference between members'
salaries at their jobs and their military pay for the first six
months of active duty.</LD>
<LD>   Under SB 711 by state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), the state will
reimburse Guard members who are state workers for the next six
months. Davis estimates that the legislation affects 500 state
employees who have been activated, at a cost to the general fund of
about $3 million.</LD>

<HD>Cardenas, Greuel Exchange Barbs in Fight for Council Seat</HD>
<DH>Debate: The candidates list their qualifications as March 5
election nears. The district's lines are to stay intact until then.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Council candidates Tony Cardenas and Wendy Greuel
clashed Wednesday in a debate over which candidate has the best
credentials to bring the east San Fernando Valley's 2nd District a
greater share of city services.</LD>
<LD>   Cardenas, a Democratic state assemblyman from Panorama City,
chided Greuel for offering grand plans without having his experience
in approving budgets and legislation, while Greuel jabbed Cardenas,
chairman of the Assembly Budget Committee, over the state budget
deficit.</LD>
<LD>   The two candidates, who are competing in the March 5 election for
the 2nd Council District seat, squared off in a debate moderated by
Bill Rosendahl and taped at Adelphia Cable Television for viewing on
its system as well as on the city's local access channel.</LD>
<TE>   The City Council eliminated one issue in the race Wednesday when
it agreed to extend the deadline for drawing new 2nd District
boundaries until after the March 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, Greuel announced the release of a 12-page plan
that includes adding 1,500 police officers citywide, expanding LA's
BEST after-school program, providing new rapid bus service and
fighting expansion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill in Granada Hills.</TE>
<TE>   She touted her years working for Mayor Tom Bradley, during which
she helped create LA's BEST, as well her job experience with the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and most recently with
DreamWorks SKG entertainment studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I have the most broad and diverse experience to be the
next councilperson," Greuel said. "I'm the most qualified. My 10
years at City Hall allow me to hit the ground running."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said that while a plan for the district is nice, plans
often fail for lack of resources.</TE>
<TE>   He touted his five years as an assemblyman representing the
northeast Valley, saying he helped bring $591 million in state
transit money to the Valley for two new bus systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Both of those were funded during my watch," Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he was instrumental in getting $68 million for the
city to pay for police and youth programs.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've learned how to do in public office is create
solutions," Cardenas said, vowing to make city streets and schools
safer, while also getting sidewalks fixed and trees trimmed. He
promised to have city managers visit the district to show them what
needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates pledged to reopen a district office and a police
substation in the Sunland-Tujunga area.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel criticized Cardenas for the state budget deficit, but
Cardenas countered that budgets across the nation have "taken a bite"
since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates said they respect Police Chief Bernard C. Parks,
but do not believe he should be given another five-year term. They
also said they would oppose Valley secession if forced to vote today,
although Greuel said she is open to receiving more information on the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The two clashed again when Greuel noted that the county district
attorney's office recently referred to the city Ethics Commission a
report concluding that Cardenas had talked to some out-of-town
American Indian tribes about getting involved in last year's mayoral
election. The prosecutor had decided not to file charges over the
tribes' independent expenditures in the race.</TE>
<TE>   "People are really tired at City Hall thinking there is undue
influence by special interests," Greuel said.</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas countered that he acknowledged talking to the tribes
about the election and that the investigation focused on someone
else, not him.</TE>
<TE>   "Quite frankly, there was no wrongdoing," Cardenas said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about all the fund-raising done for her by DreamWorks
SKG executives and others in the entertainment industry, Greuel said
they do not have undue influence over her.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never had someone in City Hall who understands the
entertainment industry," she said. "They are an economic engine."</TE>
<TE>   Cardenas said he also has support of entertainment industry
figures and has worked in Sacramento to stem the tide of runaway film
production.</TE>

<HD>Popular Vote Urged on Sales Tax Sharing</HD>
<DH>Revenue: Legislature's legal advisor says a bill to force a
six-county area to pool sales levies must be decided by residents of
the target Sacramento area, not lawmakers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A hotly disputed bill that would force municipalities in the
six-county region around the state capital to share sales taxes may
be unconstitutional unless the 1.8 million people in the area are
given a chance to vote on the proposal, according to the
Legislature's legal advisor.</LD>
<LD>   The author of the bill, Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento), said Wednesday that he disagreed with the legal
opinion, which was sought by a Republican opponent. But he said he
had no problems with putting the issue before voters, if it is indeed
required by law.</LD>
<LD>   Steinberg is pushing the revolutionary tax-sharing plan as a way
to stop what many see as a silly, money-driven competition among
neighboring cities to lure auto malls and big-box retailers.</LD>
<TE>   By sharing future growth in sales taxes, Steinberg and the
measure's supporters argue, cities in the Sacramento region would
lose the incentive to compete against one another and could instead
work together on common problems such as air pollution, traffic
congestion and urban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   But opponents of the measure argue that the bill is a socialistic
attempt by a graying metropolis to siphon tax dollars from wealthier
suburbs. What was billed by Steinberg as a way to foster regional
cooperation has instead turned divisive, they note, with cities and
legislators from the area taking opposing sides.</TE>
<TE>   It was one of those legislators, Assemblyman Tim Leslie (R-Tahoe
City), who requested the opinion from the legislative counsel, the
office that advises lawmakers on the legality of their bills.</TE>
<TE>   Though the opinion concluded that lawmakers have the power to pass
tax-sharing legislation, it said such measures raise legal questions
and that the state would have to allow voters in affected areas to
decide the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "AB 680 is not only an uncommonly bad idea, but an
unconstitutional one to boot," Leslie told the assembled crowd,
largely consisting of lobbyists for cities, counties and business
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to Steinberg's bill has been mounting in recent weeks,
as more cities and counties join the fight.</TE>
<TE>   One of the latest opponents is Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee
Baca, whose department provides police services to some of the cities
working to kill the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   The bill has cleared the Assembly and is now in the state Senate.</TE>

<HD>Defensemen of a Feather Won't Flock Together</HD>
<DH>Ruslan Salei and Oleg Tverdovsky of the Mighty Ducks will
face each other when Belarus and Russia meet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruslan Salei and Oleg Tverdovsky, both Mighty Duck defensemen, will
step on the same airplane this morning, headed for the same
destination for the same reason: the Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   But what they carry with them is vastly different.</LD>
<LD>   Tverdovsky lugs with him the expectations of Mother Russia, which
is considered one of the favorites to win the gold medal.</LD>
<TE>   Salei totes along the excitement of those in Belarus, once a
pinprick in the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, Latvia and Ukraine, once only contributors to the world's
most renowned hockey team, have found their own success since the
Soviet Union's breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Belarus has qualified for the Olympic final round, as it did four
years ago. On Friday, Salei and his teammates will face Russia in a
rematch of a 1998 quarterfinal game won by Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously they have the better team on paper," Salei said. "But
this is all about a team, all about one day. Any team can beat any
team in that one day."</TE>
<TE>   What is the Russian translation for "Do you believe in miracles?"</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge thing for my country," Salei said. "Growing up,
you never thought about playing for Belarus. Why think about Belarus?
Growing up, the thought never crossed your mind that the Soviet Union
would separate. You wanted to play for the Soviet Union."</TE>
<TE>   When the Soviet Union broke up, Russia remained a player in
international hockey, as it could draw from a deep pool of NHL
players. Salei is the only NHL player on the Belarus roster.</TE>
<TE>   But teams from the other republics are beginning to emerge. Latvia
finished 2-1 in its qualifying pool, missing out on the final round
only because of a 4-1 loss to Germany on Tuesday. Ukraine won two of
three preliminary games, losing only to Belarus, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for those countries, Belarus, Latvia, Ukraine, to
compete in the Olympics with Russia," Tverdovsky said. "To me, they
are all Russians. But before they wouldn't have a chance because
Russia was the main country in Soviet Union hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Belarus, a country of 10 million that is slightly smaller than
Kansas, is squeezed between Poland and Russia. In the big picture
that was Soviet hockey, Belarus was a nonentity. The country had only
two indoor hockey rinks when the Soviet Union toppled in 1991. Its
claim to hockey fame was that Wayne Gretzky's grandfather emigrated
from a small Belarus town.</TE>
<TE>   But the interest in hockey grew when Alexander Lukashenko became
president in 1994. His passion for hockey is such that he and his two
sons often practice with national team members during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not allowed to hit him," Salei said. "They have guys with
guns there. But his sons can."</TE>
<TE>   Lukashenko has pumped money into the national team, which has
remained almost entirely intact since the 1998 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he will be at the Olympics, but he's watching us
closely," Salei said. "People in our country are cheering for us,
support us all the way. I talked to my family members, and they are
excited we made it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for us to be in the Olympics, especially with it in
the United States. So many people will be watching us, it is really
good for our country."</TE>
<TE>   Belarus and Russia have had memorable moments when they've met on
the ice. Russia won, 4-1, in Nagano. But two years later at the world
championships in St. Petersburg, Belarus stunned the Russians, 1-0.</TE>
<TE>   And so they face each other again, with Belarus already having
three games behind it, while some of the Russian players will be on
the ice together for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "You still feel like the same nationality," Salei said. "There
isn't a big difference really, Belarus and Russia."</TE>
<TE>   Except they will be in different color jerseys.</TE>

<LD>Timothy Goebel, who trains in El Segundo, landed the first quadruple
salchow ever in the Winter Olympics in Tuesday night's short program.
Whether he can transform his technical superiority into a gold medal
will be determined tonight in the freestyle program.</LD>
<LD>   Third after the short program, Goebel can win if he finishes first
tonight in a program that counts toward two-thirds of the final
score. But he must beat the leader, three-time world champion Alexei
Yagudin of Russia, and surprising Takeshi Honda of Japan, who was
second in the short program.</LD>
<LD>   Evgeni Plushenko, the reigning world champion from Russia, all but
took himself out of gold-medal contention by falling on his quad jump
and finishing fourth in the short program.</LD>
<TE>   Also disappointed were U.S. champion Todd Eldredge, who finished
ninth, and compatriot Michael Weiss, who finished eighth.</TE>

<LD>Austrians, led by downhill bronze medalist Renate Goetschl, are 1-2-3
in the World Cup standings going into today's combined (one downhill
and one slalom.) But Goetschl claims Croatian Janica Kostelic should
be favored.</LD>
<LD>   Kostelic, fourth in the standings, won the overall World Cup title
last season with victories in seven of eight slalom races.</LD>
<LD>   Caroline Lalive of Truckee, Calif., placed third in the super-G in

hope in the combined. She was seventh in the event in 1998 at Nagano.</LD>

<HD>Taking a Big Leap of Faith</HD>
<DH>With Russian rival Evgeny Plushenko out of contention,
skater Alexei Yagudin ponders a risky route to gold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY HARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Russia, which won a controversial decision in pairs, is looking for
an undisputed title in the Winter Olympics men's freestyle program.
Alexei Yagudin, a three-time world champion, appears capable of
delivering it after dominating Tuesday night's short program.</LD>
<LD>   Yagudin, who acknowledged that he was so nervous before the short
program at the Salt Lake Ice Center that he barely could feel his
legs, is so confident now that he is contemplating a rare
quad-triple-triple combination.</LD>
<LD>   Asked whether he would risk his lead by trying the challenging
combination in the long program, which accounts for two-thirds of the
final score, he said, "Maybe, why not? I have a comfortable lead
after the short, but I still want to be proud of myself and skate
good. It's just a question of the landing."</LD>
<TE>   One reason for Yagudin's bravado is the virtual elimination from
gold-medal contention of Russian rival Evgeny Plushenko, the reigning
world champion who came here as the co-favorite.</TE>
<TE>   But Plushenko fell on his opening combination--a quadruple toe,
triple toe--in the short program and finished in fourth place.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of the judges, in abundance here since the decision Monday
night that gave Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze the
pairs title over Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier, felt
Plushenko was propped up by presentation scores of 5.9 from three
judges.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see, did he get 5.9s on his second mark?" Frank Carroll,
who coaches American Timothy Goebel, asked, sarcastically. "If he
fell down and he got those, what do you get when you stand up? That's
interesting to me."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, to win the gold medal, Plushenko must win the long
program and hope that Yagudin finishes lower than second.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics is over," said Plushenko's coach, Alexei Mishin.</TE>
<TE>   Not for everyone. Either Japan's Takeshi Honda or Goebel, second
and third, respectively, can win the gold medal by finishing first in
the 4 1/2-minute-long program.</TE>
<TE>   Goebel, who trains in El Segundo, would appear to have the best
chance because of his technical skills. On Tuesday night, he became
the first skater in Olympic history to land a quadruple salchow,
performing it in combination with a triple toe. He was nearly in
tears as he skated off the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a shot at getting a medal," he said. "It's not
something I'm thinking about, but it's there. It's something that
could happen. It doesn't change my game plan. I'm still going to go
out there and go for it."</TE>
<TE>   But, as for the gold, he said he would be surprised if Yagudin
doesn't win it.</TE>
<TE>   "He's in great position to win," Goebel said. "Coming in, he was
one of the gold medal favorites. Unless he has a rough go at the
long, he's going to be the champion."</TE>
<TE>   Americans Michael Weiss and Todd Eldredge no longer are medal
contenders after finishing eighth and ninth, respectively, in the
short program.</TE>
<TE>   Eldredge, the U.S. champion, rarely has landed a quadruple jump in
competition, but he attempted one in the short program and
double-footed the landing, throwing off his combination. He then fell
on a triple axel.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been going so well in practice, I didn't see any reason not
to try," he said of the quad. "But, really, it was the triple axel
[that cost him], and that's one of my best jumps."</TE>
<TE>   Men from the former Soviet Union are not threatening the
Soviet/Russian gold-medal streak in pairs, which reached 11 Monday
night. But they could win their fourth consecutive gold medal here
after victories by Ukrainian Viktor Petrenko in 1994, Alexei Urmanov
in '94 and Ilia Kulik in '98.</TE>

<HD>Norwegian Aims for Hat Trick of Gold Medals</HD>
<DH>Bjoerndalen easily wins 10k sprint and will race in 12.5k
pursuit for shot at third first-place finish of Games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The biathlon has consistently humbled the world's best competitors,
yet Ole Einar Bjoerndalen keeps making the maddening sport look
deceptively easy.</LD>
<LD>   Calmly nailing all 10 of his targets, the Norwegian coasted to the
gold medal in the 10-kilometer sprint Wednesday, winning his second
gold of the Olympics and becoming the first biathlete to win three in
a career</LD>
<LD>   "There's not many like this race you have in your life," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen, who won Monday's 20k race by making 18 of 20 shots,
finished in 24 minutes, 51.3 seconds--28.9 seconds ahead of Germany's
Sven Fischer, who missed once. Austria's Wolfgang Perner was a
surprising bronze winner, shooting cleanly to finish 53.1 seconds
back.</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen won the same event in Nagano four years ago and has an
excellent chance of becoming the first person to win three biathlon
golds in the same Olympics. The combined pursuit, which makes its
debut Saturday, is a 12.5k that incorporates Wednesday's 10k results.
So Bjoerndalen will have a 28.9-second head start on Fischer.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's not important if I make one more gold or one less,"
Bjoerndalen said. "For me, it's more important to make every time
that I race a perfect race, and if I'm good enough to win, I win. But
if some other guy is better than me that day, I will be satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   In the women's 7.5k sprint, Germany's Kati Wilhelm used a
similarly flawless shooting performance to win her first gold. In a
mild upset, she finished in 20:41.4, more than 36 seconds ahead of
teammate Uschi Disl. Sweden's Magdalena Forsberg, the sport's
dominant woman for the past five years, had to settle for her second
bronze in three days.</TE>
<TE>   "It was wonderful to shoot without any mistakes in such a great
competition, and I'm very happy about that," said Wilhelm, who won
the 2001 world title but had not been consistent with her .22-caliber
rifle leading up to the games. During a World Cup sprint in Austria
on Dec. 6, she missed four of 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Disl, who won the silver for the second straight time in this
event, could have made Wednesday's race a lot closer if she hadn't
missed her last target, forcing her to circle the penalty loop before
entering the final lap.</TE>
<TE>   Disl remains the most decorated woman in biathlon history, with
seven medals. She has five individual medals, but no gold.</TE>
<TE>   Forsberg needed a furious finish to get on the medals podium. "I
thought the chance of a medal was gone when I missed a shot there,"
Forsberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Germany has won both women's biathlon golds at Soldier Hollow.
Andrea Henkel, who won Monday's 15k race, slumped to 25th on
Wednesday, taking herself out of contention with a miss at the first
station.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans struggled, with Kara Salmela finishing 49th, Andrea
Nahrgang 50th and Rachel Steer 60th.</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Teela, a surprising 14th on Monday, was the top American
male, taking 20th. The best U.S. finish ever in the event was 19th,
by Lyle Nelson in 1980. Jay Hakkinen was 26th, and Lawton Redman
54th.</TE>
<TE>   Bjoerndalen was exceptional, but his rivals made it easier on him.
Frenchman Raphael Poiree was the fastest skier after the first
shooting stage but missed two shots in the final round, falling to
ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Frode Andresen, who finished second behind his countryman
Bjoerndalen in 1998, also missed twice on the final shoot and wound
up eighth. And Russian Pavel Rostovtsev was perfect through nine
shots but missed on his final attempt.</TE>

<LD>American curlers lost three matches Wednesday, with the women losing
to defending gold medalist Canada, 6-4, and the American men losing
to Germany and Norway.</LD>
<LD>   Germany beat the U.S. men, 9-8, in an extra end in the morning,
then Norway beat them at night, 6-5, scoring twice in the top of the
10th.</LD>
<LD>   The men and women compete in 10-team round-robin tournaments, with
the top four finishers in each advancing to medal rounds next week.</LD>
<TE>   The American women are 2-1 and still in line for a qualifying
spot.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. men fell to 1-3 and sit in ninth place.</TE>
<TE>   In other men's early games, Sweden topped Denmark, 9-5; Finland
beat Switzerland, 6-5, and Norway defeated Britain, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   In late games, Canada routed France, 8-1; Sweden beat Switzerland,
8-7, and Britain defeated Germany, 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Canada, the 1998 silver medalist, is ahead in men's play with a
4-0 record.</TE>
<TE>   Germany, Norway and Switzerland follow at 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S. team up, 5-4, entering the final end--or
inning--U.S. skip Tim Somerville barely moved a Norway rock out of
scoring position. But that allowed Norway to set up for two points
and the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to play close games, but I would rather win them,"
Somerville said. "We're not dead yet. Maybe it's better for us to
have our backs up against the wall."</TE>
<TE>   In the earlier game against Germany, Somerville needed to put his
stone closer than the German stone to win, but instead hit his own
team's rock.</TE>
<TE>   "It just ran straight," Somerville said. "I have to be hard on
myself. At this level it's not as much fun. We want to win."</TE>
<TE>   In women's competition, after winning their first two matches,
including an upset victory over Sweden, the Americans lost in the
final end Wednesday afternoon. The Canadian women stayed atop the
standings at 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   Germany and Switzerland are 3-0 with the United States is tied for
fourth at 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. women's skip Kari Erickson missed a last shot to win against
Canada. "I am not upset with our performance," she said. "Canada has
a great team. They played really well."</TE>

<HD>Luger Had to Go for Green Before Chasing Gold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DWYRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>When things were going bad for either, Canadian luger Clay Ives used
to remind American rival Chris Thorpe that he had a U.S. passport.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd laugh about it, but I said it enough that he knew it was
true," Ives said recently.</LD>
<LD>   Still, thoughts of turning traitor do not come easily for anybody,
especially athletes who are surrounded daily by nationalistic fervor,
almost as if it is a part of their mission. But for Ives, after six
years of struggling to many non-medal finishes for Canada in both
singles and doubles luge, the Benedict Arnold move seemed more and
more justified.</LD>
<TE>   In the end, it was all about the money, and Ives doesn't apologize
for that.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked the Canadian federation for help," he said. "I called and
said I needed help, waited a couple of days and when I didn't even
get a call back, I packed and left."</TE>
<TE>   That was three years ago, when Ives said he was trying to train
full time and live on the $8,000 a year the Canadians were allotting
him. He said it cost him almost that much to leave, invoke his
American citizenship via his mother's birthplace in Gila Bend, Ariz.,
and join the U.S. luge program.</TE>
<TE>   Then, his casual conversations with Thorpe paid dividends.
Thorpe's longtime partner, Gordy Sheer, with whom Thorpe had won a
silver medal in luge doubles in Nagano, decided to retire. Thorpe
needed a new partner for his last shot at Olympic gold, and his
Canadian friend Ives was now an American luger. So, two years ago,
the match was made.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the two "old fogies," as Ives, 29, calls his partnership with
Thorpe, 32, will have a last go at it.</TE>
<TE>   Ives said he, too, will retire after the Salt Lake City Games. And
that last go has a solid chance of success when the competition is
held Friday at Utah Olympic Park. In late January, the old fogies won
a silver medal in World Cup competition in Germany, meaning that they
will be positioned well in the starting field in the Olympics,
running with group "A" seeds.</TE>
<TE>   "That was huge for us," Thorpe said.</TE>
<TE>   Huge for Ives is just being where he is, considering where he came
from.</TE>
<TE>   He grew up in tiny Bancroft, Ontario. He is one of four sons of
Paul and Linda Ives, and earlier in his youth, his father realized
that the cost of having four sons playing youth hockey in Canada had
to be dealt with.</TE>
<TE>   "All four of us were in different leagues," Ives said, "and when
you added up all the skates and sticks and jerseys and carpooling, it
was just too expensive."</TE>
<TE>   So Paul Ives did what any hockey father might do in that
situation: He built a sled run.</TE>
<TE>   Clay Ives said the run was not exactly luge or bobsled. It was,
and is today, 900 meters of ice, with no corners, no banks and cut
through the wooded area on the Ives' property. Taking a ride on this
course means you are participating in the sport of Naturbahn, or
natural luge. To this day, the Ives family rents out the track for
groups of fun-seekers and even the Canadian military. The family also
has a bed and breakfast there.</TE>
<TE>   In that setting, James Clay Ives learned to slide rather than
skate and cross-check, and by the time he was 17, he was ready to
take on the luge world. With $100 in his pocket, he left home and
went to Calgary to join the Canadian team.</TE>
<TE>   "I was never so scared in my life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over his nine years on the Canadian team, competing in both
singles and doubles, the $100 grew only slightly, prompting his
eventual departure. To this day, he has both regret and anger.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it was hard to leave," Ives said. "I'm Canadian. But
let me put it this way. If another newspaper offered you $20,000 more
to work for them, your loyalty would end pretty fast.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me give you an example. When I was competing in Canada, I
drove a 1966 Ford Falcon. Here, I have a '98 Dodge truck. Here, I
don't worry about eating. There, I once had to go to a food bank to
eat."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Farstad, the team leader of the Canadian luge program and the
executive director of Canada Luge, did not dispute Ives' claims of
financial hardship, nor did he indicate any sort of animosity toward
Ives by the Canadian luge program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a fact that the American sports system in general can
get much better money for the athletes," Farstad said. "Ives had an
opportunity to go, and there are no hard feelings."</TE>
<TE>   Farstad said that since Ives left in '98, the Canadian situation
has improved greatly, almost doubling its monthly allotments to luge
team members. Farstad added that the Canadian team is stronger now,
and younger, so much so that Ives might not have even made the team
north of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Ives said he still feels and thinks like an amateur, even though
the rules allow him the estimated $20,000 a year he gets from the
U.S. Luge Federation. He also said he feels that he and Thorpe have a
chance to win a gold medal, and that would make all he has been
through worth it.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was 15, a TV film crew came out to do a story at our track
at home," Ives said. "They interviewed me and I told them that,
someday, I'd like to go to the Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   This will be his third trip.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry if some Canadians are angry with me," he said, "but I
couldn't be happier."</TE>

<HD>Nordic's Bad Blood</HD>
<DH>Doping Scandal Leaves Finland With Little Chance in
Cross-Country</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Suppose that shortly after the Super Bowl, it was discovered that key
members of the New England Patriots had been using
performance-enhancing drugs when they beat the St. Louis Rams for the
NFL title.</LD>
<LD>   What might have been the reaction?</LD>
<LD>   Disbelief? Embarrassment? Anger? Disgust? Betrayal? Knowing winks?
That's how the folks in Finland felt last year when it was revealed
that the national cross-country ski team was involved in a form of
blood doping, even as the Finnish skiers were hosting the World
Championships at Lahti.</LD>
<TE>   Except, there wasn't much guffawing. Stupidity sometimes may be
laughable even in Finland, but not when it comes to something as
important as Nordic skiing--cross-country and ski jumping--the
country's national sport, a sport now trying to rise from the ashes
in Finland. Four medals were forfeited after the World Championships.
Three of the country's top coaches were fired--and banned for life.</TE>
<TE>   Six cross-country skiers--four men, two women, among them some of
the biggest names in the sport--are, theoretically, serving two-year
suspensions. But, more likely, their careers are over.</TE>
<TE>   The national ski federation has undergone massive personnel
changes and sponsorships have dried up.</TE>
<TE>   "We are weak," said Veikko Lautsi, sports editor of Helsingin
Sanomat, Finland's largest newspaper. "Our men's team is very weak.
We have won at least one Olympic medal in cross-country since 1928.
This time, there probably won't be any. Maybe in the women's relay
[on Feb. 21]."</TE>
<TE>   Blood doping, in various forms, has been going on in endurance
sports for a decade or more.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to raise the level of hemoglobin and expand the volume
of blood, resulting in greater stamina.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, a hormone called erythropoetin (EPO) has been used
as a hemoglobin booster. It has been on the list of drugs not allowed
in international competition for several years but there is no way to
test for it.</TE>
<TE>   So, to get around that, the International Ski Federation began
testing for hemoglobin counts.</TE>
<TE>   Violators learned, however, that by combining EPO and another
plasma expander, hemohes, commonly called HES, enhanced performance
could be achieved and the hemoglobin level held within the allowed
range. It was widely believed, however, that there was no way to test
for HES, which must be given intravenously over a period of time
before competition.</TE>
<TE>   The newly formed World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had come up with
a reliable test for HES, however. When testing began at the World
Championships, the Finns were surprised.</TE>
<TE>   First, silver medalist Jari Isometsa tested positive. He admitted
having used HES but said at a news conference that because he had a
naturally high hemoglobin level, he had done so to reduce his count,
and that he had acted independently of his teammates and coaches.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Kari-Pekka Kyro and team doctors denied involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Had it ended there, the flap might have died down.</TE>
<TE>   Then, three days after Isometsa's press conference, the manager of
a gas station near Helsinki's airport turned over to police a bag
belonging to the Finnish Ski Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He had found it at his station earlier that month, after a World
Cup competition in Estonia.</TE>
<TE>   Inside were hypodermic needles, used infusion bags for HES, and
prescriptions for HES signed by one of the team doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Three members of the Finnish relay team--Janni Immonen, Harri
Kirvesniemi, a six-time Olympian and the country's most respected
skier, and Mika Myllyla, who'd won a gold and two bronze medals in
1998 at Nagano and four world championships, all tested positive. So
did Milla Jauho and Virpi Kuitunen of the women's team.</TE>
<TE>   At another press conference, Coach Kyro admitted to the blood
doping, saying the entire team was aware of it but nobody thought
they'd get caught.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Kirvesniemi tearfully announced his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   As the country churned, Myllyla summed up the nation's angst in a
confession written for his fans:</TE>
<TE>   "My heart is broken and there is no way to describe the amount of
my agony with words. I kneel down, admit my defeat and beg for peace
in my soul."</TE>
<TE>   Peace, though, was about the last thing anyone was feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "There was shock, first," said Lautsi, the Finnish journalist.
"Cross-country has always been our beloved sport. Then some were
angry and some tried to understand. There was a lot of 'Everybody is
using drugs in sports, not just the Finns.' It's always easier to
blame others."</TE>
<TE>   Lautsi's paper played the story big, and said in an editorial, "We
have become accustomed to laugh behind our hands at Chinese swimmers
and Bulgarian weightlifters. Finland's skiers now find themselves in
the same caste, and not without foundation."</TE>
<TE>   That was not an entirely popular stand. "Some [subscribers] got
angry and said we were writing too much about this, that we should
let the skiers alone," Lautsi said.</TE>
<TE>   And the fallout?</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is quite the same as how it was," he said. "There's
maybe some more testing but the system has not changed. There have
been many changes in the [national] ski federation but the system is
like before."</TE>
<TE>   And Finland's love for cross-country skiing apparently has lost
none of its ardor.</TE>
<TE>   "[People] care quite a lot, still," Lautsi said. "These Games,
with everything happening in the evening, Finnish time, people will
be able to watch. There will be a lot of interest."</TE>

<HD>Choir Requires More Than Singing</HD>
<DH>You have to go through rigorous screening just to get an
audition with the famous Mormon Tabernacle Choir.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>You want to join a 155-year-old singing group that has recorded five
gold albums and won both an Emmy and a Grammy?</LD>
<LD>   You want to be part of a group that has as many as 150 gigs a
year, including hosting the longest-running weekly radio broadcast in
American history?</LD>
<LD>   You love singing in really cool robes?</LD>
<TE>   Then you'll want to apply to join the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.</TE>
<TE>   But you'd better be able to do more than just sing.</TE>
<TE>   First, you'll have to be a "temple-worthy" member of the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.</TE>
<TE>   That means you have to follow commandments including no alcohol,
tobacco, tea or coffee, plus you'll have to give 10% of your income
to the church.</TE>
<TE>   Once you've done that, you'll have to show your driver's license.
You can't be younger than 25, or older than 55.</TE>
<TE>   The age limit for Choir members is actually 60, but a five-year
commitment is required.</TE>
<TE>   (Once you hit 61 you are not, as it might seem, kicked out on the
street. According to the church, you are "retired.")</TE>
<TE>   Then, you may have to change your address. All Choir members must
live within a 100-mile radius of Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   Once those prerequisites are met, you can call the Choir office
for an application, which are only accepted in January and July.</TE>
<TE>   With that application, you must send in an audition tape that
features, among other things, one verse of a hymn.</TE>
<TE>   If the application and tape pass muster, then you must drive to
the Choir office and pass a Musical Skills Inventory test.</TE>
<TE>   After that, if you haven't yet been cut, you audition in front of
the Choir bosses.</TE>
<TE>   The best of those auditions are invited to complete a three-month
session in the Temple Square Chorale, a training choir that helps
singers in both technique and theory.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of three months, the best of the best are invited to
join the Choir, with a capital "C."</TE>
<TE>   You won't make any money--the Choir is totally made up of
volunteers--but you will be following in the footsteps of those who
began a singing group just 29 days after the first pioneers arrived
in the Salt Lake City area, on Aug. 22, 1847.</TE>
<TE>   "We view music as being one of the languages of God," said Keith
Atkinson, director of public affairs for the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-Day Saints in California.</TE>

<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>The Germans got their sweep, and Becky and Tom Wilczak got their hug.
You might say all the stars in the women 's luge constellation were
aligned properly Wednesday at Utah Olympic Park.</LD>
<LD>   Germany's Sylke Otto breezed to the gold medal with a time of
2:52.464 for her four runs. Barbara Niedernhuber finished second,
.321 seconds behind her teammate, and German Silke Kraushaar was
third, .401 out of first.</LD>
<LD>   Austria's Angelika Neuner bumped Wilczak from fourth to fifth on
their fourth runs, but the River Forest, Ill., resident, who finished
in 2:54.254, had the best consolation prize she could ask for waiting
at the finish line.</LD>
<TE>   Her father, Tom, was waiting with a hug, like he does at every
race he attends. This was never a given. Wilczak likely needs a liver
transplant within months to survive. If a suitable organ had become
available anytime shortly before the Games, he would have been back
in Chicago on Wednesday instead of at the sliding track.</TE>
<TE>   But he arrived Monday night to watch his daughter realize her
long-held Olympic dream, and he vowed to make his way to the finish
line, even if athletes' family members normally watch the competition
from a hospitality tent up a steep slope from there. Helpful
officials from the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and USA Luge
arranged transportation to the finish area and a credential.</TE>
<TE>   There Wilczak was, moments before his daughter's fourth run,
making the sign of the cross and watching first with nervous
anticipation and then unbridled joy as she sailed down the frozen
chute.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great surprise to have him there and give him a hug,"
she said. "I was a little disappointed in my last run, and I said,
'Oh, Dad.' He said, 'Don't worry. You did great.' I'm so happy he's
here, for him and for me because he has been there for me in my sport
for the last 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   In 1987 Tom Wilczak was diagnosed as having autoimmune hepatitis,
a disease in which a person's immune system attacks the his liver.
Medication controlled the illness until May 2000, when his condition
began to deteriorate.</TE>
<TE>   The Wilczaks hoped he would get a new liver early enough before
the Games so he could attend without worry, but an appropriate liver
hasn't become available.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Wilczak decided to come for Becky's races anyway, but she
struggled with the decision of whether she would compete if a
suitable liver arrived just before or even during her event.</TE>
<TE>   It was a decision she said she would make only if she had to, and
the fact she now wouldn't have to painted her face in relief after
her final run.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a relief in the sense if a liver comes, I can go straight
home and not worry about anything," said Becky Wilczak, whose
fifth-place finish tied the best ever by a U.S. luger in this event.
"It has been an emotional roller coaster but things happen for a
reason."</TE>
<TE>   Otto knows a bit about highs and lows, if only competitively. In
the 1992 Albertville Games, she finished 13th and at 22 seemed to be
a rising star. But the German luge program has more stars than a
Hollywood opening. Otto missed the next two Games as the fourth-best
German slider when only three athletes per country get to go.</TE>
<TE>   She arrived in Salt Lake City determined to make up for lost time
and not even a sore neck that she said hampered her starts was going
to stop her. She took a .048-second lead over Niedernhuber in
Tuesday's first two runs and then assured herself the gold with a
track-record 42.940 opening run Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy," she said. "There is nothing missing in my career
now."</TE>

<HD>Mormon Church Responds to Media</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mormon official called media coverage of the church biased and
sloppy in an open letter sent Wednesday to reporters covering the
2002 Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   While most news reports from Salt Lake City have been fair, the
letter said, others are "full of arrant nonsense and prejudice" and
prove that Mormons are still as persecuted as they were when they
fled to Utah in 1847.</LD>
<LD>   Also Wednesday, the church criticized a Denver Post column mocking
Mormonism and the Olympics. The piece was pulled from the paper's Web
site and an apologetic column was planned for today.</LD>
<TE>   The letter was attributed to Alan Wakeley, director of public
affairs for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in
Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands, but was originally
written for a church-affiliated magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Church spokesman Dale Bills said Meridian Magazine editor-in-chief
Maureen Proctor gave Wakeley permission to rewrite her article "to
address a few concerns he had about some media coverage in Australia
and New Zealand."</TE>
<TE>   The piece criticizes articles written by the Sydney Daily
Telegraph and five other news outlets, including one written by the
Associated Press. It accused the media of "drive-by reporting,"
saying reporters have focused on polygamy, which has been banned by
the church for more than a century, or portrayed the church as "a
vast, wealthy, clannish and secretive empire."</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, when some journalists talk about members of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, they create a
caricature," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   The Salt Lake-based church has long been skittish about media
attempts to dub the 2002 Winter Games the "Mormon Games."</TE>
<TE>   After repeated questions about polygamy and other dark spots in
the church's past, Mormon officials mailed more than 3,000 press
packets detailing the church's history.</TE>
<TE>   And though Mormon officials say they're generally pleased with
news reports, the official Web site posts a frequently updated list
of corrections and clarifications of stories about the church.</TE>
<TE>   Such mistakes are to be expected given the media's lack of
interest in theological details, said Jan Shipps, a non-Mormon
historian who has written several books about the faith. "They don't
send the religion reporters, they send the sports reporters," Shipps
said. "And they do the best they can. They don't know about the
trinity, they know about a triple salchow."</TE>
<TE>   An egregious example, church officials said, was a column by Woody
Paige that appeared in Tuesday's edition of the Denver Post. Paige's
story, titled "Colorado real winner of Games," joked that Olympic
visitors would be so annoyed by Utah's cultural quirks they would
never return.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole piece can be characterized as just a really nasty
piece, an offensive piece for Utahans," said church spokesman Mike
Otterson.</TE>
<TE>   The article drew so many angry e-mails that technicians at the
paper's Web site set up a special spot for complaints about the
column. Denver Post editor Glenn Guzzo said Wednesday that the column
was "inappropriate" and never should have been published, and
promised that Paige's Thursday column would include an apology.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Thrashers goalie Milan Hnilicka was going to spend his
Olympic break in the Caribbean. Now, he's heading to Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Hnilicka got a call asking him to join the Czech Republic team
after Roman Turek of the Calgary Flames dropped out because of
injury.</TE>
<TE>   Even though it's a lot warmer in the Cayman Islands--Hnilicka's
original destination during the break--he didn't balk at a chance to
play for his country. He planned to board a flight this morning to
Salt Lake City, one day before the Czechs play their first game
against Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slight change in plans," Hnilicka said from Atlanta. "But
that's OK."</TE>
<TE>   Hnilicka was a backup at the 1998 Olympics, but he didn't play as
Dominik Hasek led the Czechs to a surprising gold medal. Hasek and
Philadelphia's Roman Cechmanek are the team's top two goalies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going to happen," said Hnilicka, who led the
Czechs to their third straight world championship last year. "I
didn't expect anything, to be honest. This all came as a surprise.
Obviously, it's a very pleasant surprise."</TE>

<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Frankly, these Winter Games were starting to drag a little (Need more
halfpipe!) once Ross Powers and Danny Kass packed up their snowboards
(need more halfpipe!), so it's a good thing this pairs figure skating
scandal came along.</LD>
<LD>   The best Olympic event I've seen since Powers performed his
personal tribute to Apollo 11 (Need more halfpipe!) was International
Skating Union President Ottavio Cinquanta sweating bullets and
dodging some others before a roomful of hostile journalists
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Journalist wants to know why the ISU is conducting an "internal
assessment" of the incident instead of enlisting an outside,
independent investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Cinquanta wants to know which country the journalist is from.</TE>
<TE>   Journalist wants to know if Cinquanta agreed with the judges'
decision to award the gold medal to the Russians instead of the
Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta says, "You embarrass me with this question."</TE>
<TE>   Journalist wants to know if the judges' decision can be reversed
and the gold medal instead awarded to the Canadians.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta wants to know why the Canadians didn't ask for a
reversal when Jamie Sale and David Pelletier skated far from
flawlessly at the 2001 World Championships in Vancouver, yet still
walked away with the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Journalist tells Cinquanta he's "sliding like a figure skater"
during this slippery Q-and-A session.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta furrows his brow, clenches his teeth and says, "If I
answer with the same vigor as your question, it would be a
catastrophe."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, something has to be done to clean up figure skating,
which in its own way is as dirty as track and field. Track has its
anabolic steroids, figure skating has backroom politicking and bloc
alliances--pick your poison. And with the French judge at Monday's
pairs free skate allegedly admitting, and then denying, she voted for
the Russians because she felt pressured to do so by her national
figure skating association, the time to do something is now.</TE>
<TE>   But do what?</TE>
<TE>   Let's toss around a few options here:</TE>
<TE>   1. Throw figure skating out of the Olympics. It's not as if this
hasn't been proposed before. You know all the arguments: It's not a
real sport; it's too subjective; it's just Ice Capades with phony
scores. After the pairs fiasco, even Frank Carroll, longtime skating
coach and defender of the sport, said he could understand the
International Olympic Committee now deciding it wants nothing more to
do with the event.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, NBC would object. So would 80% of the world's female
television- watching audience. But the Olympics could survive and
thrive without figure skating.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, I have just the sport to replace it as the
top-of-the-line prime-time ratings grabber.</TE>
<TE>   (Need more halfpipe!)</TE>
<TE>   2. Throw figure skating judges out of the Olympics. A radical
move, but as one journalist told Cinquanta on Wednesday, "100% of the
public is behind the Canadians," so 100% of the public must be right,
right?</TE>
<TE>   So get rid of the judges and just let the audience decide it. We
don't care if Todd Eldredge's backside spends more time on the ice
than the Zamboni. He's our Todd and we're giving him the gold!</TE>
<TE>   It could happen. Consider: Cinquanta is Italian. The next Winter
Olympics are in Turin, Italy. If you let the home crowd decide the
winners and the Italians sweep the 2006 figure skating medals,
Cinquanta can simply shrug and say: Only giving the people what they
want.</TE>
<TE>   3. Change the scoring system. Give the skaters metal clubs and
have them beat one another to bloody pulps. (Oh, right. Something
similar has been tried already.) Or give them helmets and hockey
sticks and let's see Sasha Cohen and Michelle Kwan muck it up in the
corner. (Some figure skating writers insist this also has been tried
already.)</TE>
<TE>   Or just have them do their routines, let everyone applaud, blow a
horn and have them speedskate a few laps for the championship. Last
one to the kiss-and-cry area gets the bronze!</TE>
<TE>   4. Let the judges hold post-skate news conferences. ISU rules
currently prohibit figure skating judges from discussing their
decisions with the media. Lose that rule. Give the judges the chance
to explain themselves:</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's just me, but I thought the Russian guy who dressed
like Tinker Bell was a little bit over the top."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's just me, but I preferred the lavender pirate to the
chartreuse Zorro."</TE>
<TE>   "'Love Story?' You've got to be kidding."</TE>
<TE>   5. Scrap the skating, schedule more Cinquanta.</TE>
<TE>   Journalist wants to know if the referee's internal report after
Monday's pairs competition will be released to the media.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta says, "Absolutely not. It's an internal paper. Why
should we release it?"</TE>
<TE>   Journalist wants to know, again, if there is any possibility for a
reversal of the judges' ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta says, "If I say there's no possibility, I would be a
liar. I am not a liar."</TE>
<TE>   Journalists go on and on, reciting variations on the same theme:
The Canadians got jobbed.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta says, "If you place a phone call to Moscow, you may get
a different answer."</TE>
<TE>   I tell you, I could watch this stuff for hours.</TE>

<HD>Reforms Leave the Room a Bit Cold</HD>
<DH>The IOC's president stays in the Olympic Village to set an
example, as some on the committee balk at conflict-of-interest rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>When Jacques Rogge took over as president of the International
Olympic Committee last year, he vowed to embrace reform, reversing
the culture of excess that has plagued the IOC for decades. He would
start, he said, by setting an example.</LD>
<LD>   And so he bypassed the luxurious accommodations typically set
aside for his ilk this week and is living in the Olympic Village--a
first for an IOC president. By mingling with skiers and skaters,
munching on common fare such as brownies and apples and laying his
head to rest each night on a dorm room pillow, he hopes to set a
course for other IOC members to follow.</LD>
<LD>   But against this backdrop of symbolic change remains evidence that
several IOC members are clinging to the culture of entitlement that
led to the worst corruption crisis in Olympic history, critics say.
Two years after a 50-point reform plan was put into place in the wake
of the bid scandal that blossomed here in Salt Lake City:</LD>
<TE>   * A slate of rules detailing potential conflicts of interest that
require public disclosure was met with such opposition from the IOC
during a meeting here earlier this month that implementation was
postponed until later this year.</TE>
<TE>   * Some members are openly balking at limits on gifts.</TE>
<TE>   * And there appears to be clear opposition to the current ban that
prohibits IOC members from visiting bid cities--the very activity
that led to the Salt Lake City bid crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "The rejection of perfectly normal conflict-of-interest disclosure
rules by the members really signals how far the IOC has to go," said
John Hoberman, a University of Chicago professor who studies the
Olympic movement. "These are normal practices in any international
organization, or major corporation, but some of the members come from
national cultures where such disclosure rules are unheard of, so they
perceive it as an egregious violation of privacy. This is a set of
cultural differences the IOC still has to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   Conflict-of-interest rules and other guidelines were proposed or
put into place after revelations that bidders here mounted a campaign
for the 2002 Winter Games that included the wooing of IOC members or
their relatives with more than $1million in cash, gifts and other
inducements. The Salt Lake bid scandal led to other disclosures that
portrayed IOC members living a caviar-and-champagne lifestyle on the
backs of Olympic athletes.</TE>
<TE>   It was this image that Mitt Romney, the president of the Salt Lake
Organizing Committee, invoked last week as he formally welcomed the
IOC membership to town.</TE>
<TE>   "You will undoubtedly note that your venue seats are not heated,"
he said, "that your hospitality tents are a little small, that food
and furnishings are modest and that dignitary and official seating is
often quite limited. Even your hotel," the Little America, "is a full
star below its sister structure across the street," the Grand
America, NBC's base during the Salt Lake Games.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course," Romney said with a smile, "it's at least two stars
better than the accommodation President Rogge will enjoy at the
Olympic Village."</TE>
<TE>   Romney's remarks left some members bristling.</TE>
<TE>   One unnamed member later told a British newspaper, the Daily
Telegraph, "It was very condescending the way he spoke to us. It made
us look as though we IOC members are always demanding caviar, cigars
and limousines, but this is what cities offer when they bid for the
Games and want our votes."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, many aspects of IOC management and membership have
changed since the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC, for example, now has an ethics commission, and certain
budget documents are now easily accessible, all part of the IOC's
avowed commitment to financial and operational "transparency."</TE>
<TE>   A revamped membership is also helping to erode elitist attitudes.
Athletes are now allowed to join the IOC ranks, and the heads of
international sports federations and national Olympic committees can
be members--key, advocates say, to keeping the IOC's focus on staging
the best Games possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Opening the doors to the entire Olympic family--that is
revolutionary," said longtime IOC member Pal Schmitt of Hungary. For
many years, he said, the IOC had "an old system. Now I see we develop
a new one. I am very much satisfied."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC has intensified the fight against drugs, with the creation
of the World Anti-Doping Agency, a joint enterprise of officials from
the Olympic movement and governments from around the world.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps most important, the IOC membership, now totaling 131,
is no longer permitted to visit cities bidding for the Games.</TE>
<TE>   Many credit Rogge for a desire to apply basic business principals
to the IOC, which has long operated as a club--for most of its
history a gentleman's club. One of Rogge's first orders after his
election was a corporate-style review of IOC operations.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone is embracing change, evident by the backlash
Rogge experienced earlier this month during an IOC meeting at which
the conflict-of-interest guidelines were raised.</TE>
<TE>   New Zealand's Tay Wilson said there was no need for the rules at
all. Sinan Erdem of Turkey remarked the members should not be
"treated as schoolchildren."</TE>
<TE>   The IOC used to have a $200 gift limit. Now it says that "only
gifts of nominal value, in accordance with prevailing local customs,
may be given or accepted ... as a mark of respect or friendship."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, the message hasn't gotten out to the members. Some are
still focused on the $200 limit--and still upset by it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ridiculous," Erdem said the other day, speaking in French.
"If you give me a gift of $201, I have to give you back $1. It is
ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Rogge acknowledged in an interview, there are a "number
of my colleagues" who want to reinstate visits to bid cities.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge made it plain during last year's election campaign that he
had never gone on a bid-city visit and was personally opposed to such
trips. But as president he recognizes sentiment exists for the trips
and acknowledges that some members say they can't properly judge a
city without firsthand knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge said a compromise may be to allow visits if they are under
IOC control, and if members visit in groups, not individually. But,
he said, no "dining and wining."</TE>
<TE>   At an IOC assembly in November in Mexico City, the IOC is due to
reexamine these and other guidelines called for in the 50-point plan.</TE>
<TE>   But some members have noted with concern an apparent lack of
desire to follow through with reform plans.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it has changed at all," said Paul Henderson, a
plain-speaking Canadian member, "but you can't judge it until you see
what happens in Mexico City."</TE>
<TE>   Said Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S. member of the IOC and a
former Executive Board member: "Some members' views of what is the
IOC have not changed. That is not the same as saying the IOC as an
organization has not changed."</TE>
<TE>   Another litmus test of sorts on the issue of whether the IOC has
changed will be the reception to Rogge's accommodations--after he has
made his bed one final time in the Olympic Village.</TE>
<TE>   Rogge and his wife, Anne, will take up residence in an apartment
in Lausanne, Switzerland, where the IOC is based.</TE>
<TE>   Those who say the IOC has changed would call it a rooftop flat.
Critics might call it a penthouse apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Located atop the Palace Hotel, the one-bedroom unit features a
living room, small office, bathroom and a kitchenette.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC will pay the rent--about $60 a day when Rogge is not
there, and just over $204 when he's present. The IOC estimates
monthly rent will average $4,000, a "bargain," according to IOC
Director General Francois Carrard.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, the Palace Hotel is where former IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch lived for most of his term, in a two-room
suite. The media worldwide criticized him repeatedly, sometimes
savagely, for that choice--because he was often perceived to be regal
and aloof, because the Palace is one of the two nicest hotels in
Lausanne, and because it's named "palace."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge said he had no public-relations worries about moving atop
the hotel.</TE>
<TE>   While the apartment did come with a view of Lake Geneva, he said,
the ambience was hardly so charming given the location amid satellite
dishes and air-conditioning units on the hotel roof.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he is enjoying the Olympic Village. It's comfortable,
cozy and reminds the three-time Olympian of his own quests for gold
as part of Belgium's sailing team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think people know I'm a sober man," Rogge said. "And I've
started sobering out the IOC."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>It was a bittersweet night for South Korea on Wednesday in
short-track speedskating at the Delta Center.</LD>
<LD>   Korean skaters won gold and silver in the women's 1,500-meter
final, beating the fabled Yang Yangs of China in the process, but
only after men's teammate Min Ryoung had been injured sliding
headfirst into the retaining wall after a collision with American
Rusty Smith in a preliminary race.</LD>
<LD>   Ko Gi Hyun won the gold in the women's race, new to the Olympics,
and Choi Eun Kyung, who earlier in the evening had set a world record
of 2 minutes 21.069 seconds in the event, won the silver. Bulgarian
Evgenia Radanova finished third.</LD>
<TE>   Neither of the favored Yangs finished. Yang S. Yang, a triple
silver medalist four years ago at Nagano, was disqualified for
impeding, and Yang A. Yang, a five-time world champion, fell,
escaping injury.</TE>
<TE>   Min was not so fortunate. After crashing hard into the padded
wall, he lay still on the ice for several minutes while being
attended by emergency personnel, then was wheeled off on a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to LDS Hospital in downtown Salt Lake for treatment
of possible back and hip injuries, according to Dr. Scott Hansen, the
venue medical officer. A hospital spokesman said Min was undergoing
tests, was in stable condition and was not expected to be held
overnight.</TE>
<TE>   The accident occurred during the second heat of the men's 5,000
relay semifinals when Min tried to pass Smith for the lead on the
inside. Smith, of Sunset Beach, held his position, the skaters bumped
and Min's skates went out from under him. Smith managed to avoid
getting caught up by the sliding Min, but Italian Nicola Rodigari
also went into the boards. He untangled himself from Min, got up and
skated away.</TE>
<TE>   The South Koreans were disqualified and the race was
reskated--with only three teams. The U.S. team of Smith, Ron Biondo,
Dan Weinstein and Apolo Anton Ohno easily defeated Italy and
Australia, and gained a berth in the final Feb. 23.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a really bad pass," Smith said of Min's maneuver. "You
never want to see anybody get hurt, but he has a reputation for
bad-timed passes. He was going for the corner and his hip was on my
shoulder and I'm a little bigger than he is and that's how it worked
out.</TE>
<TE>   "When you make a pass, you usually want to make it by [the skater
being passed] on the straightaway. Unfortunately, he was not even
close ... and at that point my shoulder went into his hip and turned
him sideways. Unfortunately, he went down and took the Italian skater
also."</TE>
<TE>   In qualifying heats for the men's 1,000, Smith and Ohno advanced,
Ohno tucking himself behind South Korean Kim Dong Sung and finishing
second, Smith beating Canadian Mathieu Turcotte in his heat by about
three-quarters of a lap. The first two finishers in each heat
qualified for Saturday's quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   American women had no such luck. Erin Porter was disqualified in
her qualifying heat of the women's 1,500. Amy Peterson, the American
flag bearer in the opening ceremony, made it through her qualifying
heat, then finished last in her semifinal heat, skating against Choi
and Yang A. Yang, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "I've struggled with the longer race all season." Peterson said.
"I knew this would be my toughest race."</TE>

<HD>Miller's Time Kind of Special</HD>
<DH>After near spill in combined downhill, a dazzling second
slalom run gets American a silver, and almost steals gold from
Aamodt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SNOWBASIN, Utah</DL>
<LD>Watching Bode Miller work the slopes Wednesday was like watching a
guy trying to wiggle out of a straitjacket.</LD>
<LD>   In an Olympic Alpine event in which a skier needs to nail two of
three runs to have a chance--one downhill run in the morning and two
slaloms after lunch--Bode botched the first two, nearly killing
himself in the downhill portion and then kicking himself later after
turning in only the fifth-fastest time in the first slalom.</LD>
<LD>   Bode Miller? The world's fastest gate racer? Fifth?</LD>
<TE>   Yet then, with a second-run slalom that was immediately forwarded
to ski racing annals, Miller nearly made up a whopping 2.44-second
deficit on one of the greatest racers of all time and stole the
silver medal in Alpine combined before a stunned crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, skiing last in the second slalom,
held off Miller to win the gold, his sixth Olympic medal, with a
three-race time of 3 minutes 17:56. Miller finished only .28 of a
second behind at 3:17:84, with Austria's Benjamin Raich taking the
bronze with a time of 3:18.26.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt and everyone else who witnessed it couldn't believe
Miller's sizzling 49.73 time in the second-run slalom might almost
wipe out a commanding lead. Aamodt figured he could side-step down
the mountain and win.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought 2.44 should have been enough," he said. "But it was
very tight in the end."</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt secured his record 16th medal in international competition,
yet you sensed Wednesday marked a torch being passed, from skiing's
present to its future.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt gushed about Miller afterward, comparing him to a young
Alberto Tomba, which is like telling a singer he sounds like Sinatra.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anybody ski so fast, like he's doing," Aamodt
said. "He's revolutionized the way of skiing as I see it."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's last run dropped jaws. Even people who don't know ski
racing that well could see it was fast. Those who do know the sport
put it in historical context.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like scoring six touchdowns in the fourth quarter," Bill
Marolt, U.S. Ski Assn. chief executive, said of Miller's comeback.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Porino, a former member of the U.S. ski team who is doing
Olympic commentary for NBC, said Miller's run "was an 11" on a scale
of one to 10.</TE>
<TE>   The Alpine combined used to be a throw-away event, a complicated
paper calculation for races that weren't even raced on the same day.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first time in the Olympics all three combined races
were lumped together in morning and afternoon shifts, and it proved
wildly popular with fans and emotionally and physically draining for
the skiers.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 24, nearly lost it all on the morning downhill, doing his
best impression of Franz Klammer's white-knuckle downhill run to gold
at Innsbruck in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Approaching the bottom of the Grizzly course, in a section called
"Slingshot," Miller lost control on a sweeping left turn and fell on
his left hip at 55 mph.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a crash," Miller said. "My skis weren't touching the
ground."</TE>
<TE>   Miller was headed toward a group of coaches when he somehow
extracted himself from disaster. It was athleticism and instinct that
saved the former New Hampshire state tennis champion.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't a life-threatening situation, I probably wouldn't
have been able to pull it off," he said. "That was definitely above
and beyond what I normally do, because I felt like if I didn't I
probably would have died."</TE>
<TE>   Marolt couldn't believe what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a phenomenal recovery going at the speed he's going," he
said. "People don't understand, that course is a vertical skating
rink."</TE>
<TE>   Miller survived but finished the downhill portion in 15th place,
2.44 seconds behind Aamodt.</TE>
<TE>   Miller still believed he could make up the time in the slalom, his
specialty, yet a sloppy first run lifted him to fifth place but still
2.44 seconds behind Aamodt.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to rate his chances, Miller scoffed, "I don't rate it in
odds, I'm not Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   But he also offered, "I'm going to go full gas in the second run,
I think I still have a chance."</TE>
<TE>   Miller said he was not nervous at the start gate before his second
run. He said it was the most comfortable place he could be.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the equivalent of looking at a great golf course if you're a
golfer," he said, "Or a playground as a kid."</TE>
<TE>   Miller popped out of the gate looking to "salvage the day."</TE>
<TE>   He salvaged silver.</TE>
<TE>   "That was everything I had," he said. "I skied my heart out
today."</TE>
<TE>   Miller took the lead when he crossed the finish line, yet had to
wait for the four skiers with faster times to race before he'd know
if his time would stand up.</TE>
<TE>   Austria's Rainer Schoenfelder had an advantage of .76 on Miller,
but it didn't hold. When Austria's Raich couldn't keep the .77-second
lead he had, Miller clinched the bronze.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Norway's Lasse Kjus, in second place behind Aamodt and
one of the best combined skiers ever. But Kjus came up slow on his
second run and dropped to fourth, assuring Miller the silver.</TE>
<TE>   Only Aamodt was able to hold Miller at bay, barely.</TE>
<TE>   It was a victory Aamodt desperately wanted--his first Olympic gold
medal since winning the super-giant slalom at the 1992 Albertville
games.</TE>
<TE>   Aamodt, 30, secured his place in history. No male skier has won
more Olympic medals.</TE>
<TE>   If this is not the end of the line for the Norwegian, he is fast
approaching it.</TE>
<TE>   For Miller, sitting to Aamodt's left at the postrace news
conference, the future was unfolding. With golden opportunities next
week in giant slalom and slalom, Miller stands a chance to win three
medals.</TE>
<TE>   Before he races again here, Miller will race to Los Angeles to
appear on "The Tonight Show" with Jay Leno.</TE>
<TE>   A star is born.</TE>
<TE>   Miller has a lot in common with the young Picabo Street. Miller
too has been known to be headstrong and obstinate, yet he and his
skis seem to be carving turns toward common ground.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a phenom," Marolt said. "He's one of those special kids that
comes along. He's just willing to go right at it, all the time. He's
willing to put it all on the line."</TE>
<TE>   Marolt, a former ski racer himself and a member of the 1964
Olympic team, said Miller's second slalom was one of the best slaloms
ever tracked on snow.</TE>
<TE>   "That's as good as you're going to see," he said. "He didn't make
a mistake."</TE>

<KH>SKI JUMPING</KH>
<HD>His Retirement Plan Is 120K</HD>
<DH>Alborn says he's giving up the sport after disappointing
34th-place effort on big hill. Swiss Ammann wins again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEW FREEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>PARK CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>Alan Alborn is giving up flying to take up flying. The United States'
leading hope for a Olympic ski jumping medal finished a disappointing
34th Wednesday in the 120-meter individual competition--his best
event--then stunningly announced his retirement from the sport.</LD>
<LD>   At the age of 21.</LD>
<LD>   Alborn essentially said he wants to get a life after being forced
into a nomadic existence for the last six years, starving himself to
excel at the sport, and having no friends his own age. After years of
such sacrifices, Alborn said he hopes to attend college and become a
commercial jet pilot. He has expressed similar sentiments before.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's time for me," Alborn said. "This is not something I
want to do for four more years."</TE>
<TE>   As Alborn spoke, the final jumpers in the big hill competition at
Utah Olympic Park were provoking roars from the crowd of 20,469 under
bright sunshine on a brisk day.</TE>
<TE>   Simon Ammann, 20, of Switzerland, repeated his shocking
performance of Sunday in the 90-meter hill for a second gold medal.
Ammann, whose winning score was 281.4, had never even won a World Cup
event. Adam Malysz of Poland took silver, scoring 269.7, and Matti
Hautameki of Finland won bronze at 256.0.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trembling," Amman said. "I can't believe it. I am the
champion."</TE>
<TE>   Alborn, meanwhile, could not follow up his exceptional jumping
during qualifying. On Tuesday, he turned in the eighth-best score on
the big hill, which is somewhat akin to jumping off a 12-story
building using a mini-parachute. Sunday, he finished 11th overall on
the normal hill. And earlier this season Alborn three times placed in
the top six on the World Cup circuit. He expected better Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little bit shocked," he said. "It's pretty disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   Few American ski jumpers have made as significant an impact on the
world scene as Alborn, who was regarded as the herald of a brighter
future since peak years--Ammann's showing notwithstanding--in the
sport are generally regarded as mid-to-late 20s. Clint Jones, 17, of
Steamboat Springs, Colo., was 42nd, the only other American to make
it out of qualifying.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn had blunt words for the state of U.S. ski jumping. "The
level is pretty poor," he said, criticizing teammates as not being
serious enough. "You just have to want it."</TE>
<TE>   Ski jumpers are scored on a combination of distance achieved and
form in the air. Alborn, who owns a small prop plane that he keeps in
Alaska, where he grew up, has always said he loved the feeling of ski
jumping because it is like flying.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday began reasonably well. He recorded the 15th best
practice jump. However, unpredictable winds swirled at the top of the
jump. Ski jumpers prefer a headwind because it keeps them higher
longer.</TE>
<TE>   Tailwinds force jumpers down more quickly and Alborn caught a
tailwind. His jump was only 105.4 meters, compared with Ammann's
140.5, but it wasn't immediately apparent how it would affect him.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn shook his head as he exited the enclosure at the base of
the hill. "With that wind at that speed, you lose a good quarter of
your lift," he said. He expected his next jump to be better, only
there never was a next jump. He didn't make the 30-man finals.</TE>
<TE>   "Alan just wasn't on today," U.S. Coach Kari Yliantilla said.
"Every athlete has a bad day."</TE>
<TE>   That was before Alborn said he would retire. He will compete in
the team jumping event Monday and expects to enter a few more
international competitions this winter, but that's it, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn always seems calm--his only outward sign of colorful
expression is dyeing his hair bright yellow--and his demeanor was the
same as usual while discussing both his bad jumping and retirement.</TE>
<TE>   He insisted this is no quickie decision sparked by frustration.
His parents, Mary and David Alborn, wanted him to quit after the 1998
Olympics in Nagano, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been thinking about it for a while," he said. "[The Salt
Lake Games] is pretty much the whole reason I kept ski jumping since
Nagano."</TE>
<TE>   But as firm as Alborn sounded in his commitment to a lifestyle
that doesn't include ski jumping, Yliantilla believes the comments
were driven by his poor showing.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [retirement] was on his mind," Yliantilla said, "but it is
not the best thing to say after a bad competition."</TE>
<TE>   He said he is sure Alborn wouldn't have made any such statements
Wednesday if he had jumped well. More than an hour later, Alborn
waffled slightly, saying he may reevaluate after the season.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn is from Anchorage, where he was introduced to ski jumping
on a beginner's hill while in elementary school. He left home at 15
to develop his talent and has been on the road ever since. He took
correspondence courses and hasn't been in a classroom for five years.
Before he can even choose a college, he believes he will need some
tutoring.</TE>
<TE>   Another annoyance for him is the pressure jumpers face to stay
light.</TE>
<TE>   Alborn is 5-foot-11 and weighs 128 pounds for the Games. Ski
jumpers have come under scrutiny lately for eating habits that
include meals of diet soda and rice. Alborn said he would like to be
free to eat favorites like his mother's moose stroganoff.</TE>
<TE>   He laughed when it was suggested he might be found in an
all-you-can-eat buffet line come spring.</TE>
<TE>   That, he said, is the kind of thing ex-ski jumpers do. "There's a
lot of guys who get kind of out of control," Alborn said.</TE>
<TE>   Almost everything Alborn said indicated that he wants to get his
life back in control.</TE>

<HD>Canada Is the Judge and Jury</HD>
<DH>Team shows sympathy for controversial decision against
Canadian figure skaters, taking it out on Russia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah</DL>
<LD>This is one sport where the Canadian skaters will beat the Russians
every time.</LD>
<LD>   Hockey uses a scoreboard, not judges, but even the most biased
observer would have to agree that the Canadian women's team was
clearly superior to Russia in a 7-0 victory at the E Center on
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps it was a small measure of revenge for the controversial
decision in which Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze
beat the Canadian figure-skating pair of David Pelletier and Jamie
Sale--who had suffered an earlier blow during a warmup session.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't know about that, but we definitely feel bad for them,"
Canadian goalie Sami Jo Small said. "I think Jamie Sale, after the
way she got hit in the warmups, she could definitely be a member of
this Canadian national team. We gave her a jersey and told her that
she could suit up next game."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Canadians need much help.</TE>
<TE>   They improved to 2-0 in Group A preliminary-round play with
another dominant performance, outshooting Russia, 60-6. Danielle
Goyette scored two goals and Hayley Wickenheiser had a goal and two
assists.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which has dominated figure skating ever since the Soviet
Union era, lags far behind the Canadian and United States in women's
hockey. There are only four women's club teams in Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Every hockey player in Russia that can play on an international
level is on our team today," Russian Coach Viacheslav Dogushin said.</TE>
<TE>   And here they were, up against the country that treats hockey as
its national treasure.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is we have to choose out of 200 players, versus
choosing out of ... how many?" Russian forward Ekaterina Pachkevitch
said, turning to Canadian forward Dana Antal on the interview
platform next to her.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty thousand," Antal said.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, there you go," Pachkevitch said.</TE>
<TE>   Pachkevitch is just happy that their games are being broadcast on
Russian television, which is a first.</TE>
<TE>   "We call home and our relatives said they saw us on TV,"
Pachkevitch said. "I wouldn't say we are where figure skating is, but
we're getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Russian goaltender Irina Gashennikova implied that the decision to
play hockey instead of figure skating isn't exactly a choice.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at me," Gashennikova said, laughing and holding her jacket
wide open to reveal a stocky body, while an interpreter translated
her comments. "I'm not a figure skating kind of person.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to do some figure skating moves [in the game], some
pirouettes. I got a couple hits in my head and I remembered I'm not a
figure skater."</TE>
<TE>   The Russians sure don't play like figure skaters. They racked up
18 minutes in penalties, including a 10-minute misconduct against
Tatiana Tsareva for checking from behind in the second period. They
also aren't afraid to dive in front of slap shots, and two of their
players had to be helped off after taking pucks to the midsection and
head.</TE>
<TE>   Their doggedness was no match for Team Canada's skill, however. In
two games, Canada has taken 126 shots and their goaltenders have
faced only 17.</TE>
<TE>   In another women's game, Erika Holst had two goals and two assists
as undefeated Sweden clinched a spot in the medals round with a 7-0
victory over Kazakhstan.</TE>
<TE>   In men's games, the Swiss team--already eliminated from the final
round and with two of their players suspended for breaking
curfew--defeated Belarus, 2-1. Dmitri Khristich, who plays for the
NHL's Washington Capitals, and Igor Chybirev scored power-plays goals
in the first period of Ukraine's 4-2 victory over France.</TE>

<HD>The Real Lowdown on Ski Jumping</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those photos and TV shots you see with ski jumpers flying miles high
over land, with distant mountains and cities off in the distance,
create an image of unimaginable danger and superhuman feats. Well, it
isn't quite like that.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, ski jumping is a high-risk thing, but the truth is, once
they hit the takeoff and stretch out for distance, they seldom go
more than 12-15 feet off the ground. The real scary part is getting
down the big run before they take off--remember the spectacular crash
of the guy on "Wide World of Sports"?</LD>
<LD>   Wednesday, during the 120-meter finals, the closest call occurred
when a photographer, planted under a ledge directly below the
takeoff, decided to shift from one side to the other as a skier took
off, and the skier cleared the top of his head by four feet, at the
most.</LD>
<TE>   Another Opinion</TE>
<TE>   Dave Barry in the Miami Herald: "If you've ever watched ski
jumping on television, you've probably asked yourself: How do they do
that? How is it possible?</TE>
<TE>   "The answer is 'computer graphics.' The jumpers are actually
suspended by cables about a foot off the ground in a studio in Los
Angeles. Also, 'Bob Costas' is an elaborate puppet operated by four
people."</TE>
<TE>   Born to Luge</TE>
<TE>   Some luge trivia:</TE>
<TE>   * Singles competitors get 30 seconds from the time the whistle
blows in the start house to take off; doubles competitors get 45.</TE>
<TE>   * The course is groomed constantly, with sweepers up and down its
entire length, treating it like a golf green. The other day, somebody
found a double-A battery on the track, causing great alarm. According
to marshal Becky Bond, the next order that went out was for all
sweepers to take all the pins off their jackets, for fear that one
would fall off, get on the track and cause an accident.</TE>
<TE>   All Bets Are Off</TE>
<TE>   Any visions held by Nevada casino operators in West Wendover--a
90-minute drive due west of Salt Lake City--to capitalize on Olympic
tourism seem to have vaporized.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a disappointment," said Michael Devine, whose family
owns the Silver Smith and State Line casinos. "A few tourists are
coming out here, but by and large, it seems that people aren't
looking for any distractions from the Olympics. If they're not
attending the events, they're apparently staying home and watching
them on TV.</TE>
<TE>   "We expected them to be bored in Utah, with its liquor laws and
restrictive atmosphere, but they seem to be enjoying the Olympics and
aren't looking for alternatives," Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   The two hotels have a combined total of 750 rooms. While most of
the rooms are booked on weekends, as is typical, there are plenty of
midweek vacancies, he said--even with rates as low as $19.99 a night
with two-for-one buffets.</TE>
<TE>   "There are competitive demands for people's time, and we're
suffering," Devine said.</TE>
<TE>   Land of Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   Russian hockey leader Ekaterina Pachkevitch stands a towering 5
feet 11. She looks like the order-giving type. Maybe that's why the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology thought she would make a good
coach for their women's hockey teams.</TE>
<TE>   She had never heard of MIT until the Russian national team used a
campus ice rink to practice during the Boston stop on a tour of the
United States. She made some friends there, came to Boston to coach
the women's club team for two years, then coached the varsity team
for three years before taking a break to prepare for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   She also met her future husband during a pickup hockey game in
Boston. She was the one who asked him out. How could he say no to a
5-11 Russian woman holding a hockey stick?</TE>
<TE>   Where's the Fire?</TE>
<TE>   Marc Norman is the ice man at the Utah Olympic Oval. So why does
he carry a fire extinguisher?</TE>
<TE>   "They have CO2 in them, which is a cold chemical that gives us a
chance to freeze the damaged ice," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If a skater falls and damages the surface, Norman hauls out one of
the two extinguishers he has. They are most useful for the 500 and
1,000 meters, where skaters are likely to tumble because of high
speeds.</TE>
<TE>   The Early Line</TE>
<TE>   A feud is already brewing about which Norwegian city should bid
for the 2018 Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Oslo officials believe they should get the games because a
half-century has passed since the city was host. Lillehammer
officials insist they deserve another chance because the 1994
Olympics in their small town went so well.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been 50 years since Oslo arranged the Olympics and only
eight years since the Lillehammer Olympics. I think Oslo is a much
stronger candidate," Mayor Per Ditlev-Simonsen told the newspaper
Aftenposten.</TE>
<TE>   Lillehammer Mayor Synnoeve Brenden Klemetrud told the newspaper
Gudbrandsoelen Dagningen: "Oslo doesn't have a good starting point
for venues," adding that the capital would have to use some of
Lillehammer's facilities even if it got the games.</TE>
<TE>   A truce seems likely, since a joint Lillehammer-Oslo application
is considered Norway's best chance.</TE>
<TE>   Grin and Bare It</TE>
<TE>   A Canadian reporter got a chilly reception when he tried to dart
out of his hotel room to grab a newspaper in the hallway.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't bother to dress first, and the door locked behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Francois Gagnon, who works for the Quebec City newspaper Le
Soleil, used the newspaper to cover himself and asked the hotel
manager for help.</TE>
<TE>   After letting him back in, hotel management asked him to check
out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my fault. I didn't have to lock myself out of the hotel,"
Gagnon told the Ottawa Citizen. "I think they overreacted. That
incident would have been solved in 35 seconds in Quebec. He would
have laughed at me and opened the door."</TE>
<TE>   Gagnon said that he used sections of the newspaper to cover his
front and back as he asked for a key to his room.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to make a little joke and said, 'I'm lucky it was a
broadsheet and not a tabloid,' but they didn't laugh," Gagnon said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers J.A. Adande, Bill Dwyre, Mal Florence, Tom
Gorman and the Associated Press contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Figure Skating Scandal Is Pure Gold for NBC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>NBC got just what it needed, a figure skating controversy that is
turning into an international incident.</LD>
<LD>   And NBC is playing it to the hilt.</LD>
<LD>   "This is very, very big," reporter Kelly O'Donnell told host Bob
Costas Wednesday night. "It has rattled the whole world of figure
skating."</LD>
<TE>   Toward the end of Wednesday night's telecast, Costas offered a
report that said the head of the French Olympic delegation was saying
that the French judge caught in the middle of the controversy was "in
a fragile state."</TE>
<TE>   It may be considered a tragedy in some circles but the fact that
Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier got swindled out of a gold
medal by inept or crooked judges is the best thing that could have
happened to NBC.</TE>
<TE>   The NBC press people even arranged for figure skating commentators
Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic to talk to reporters the day after
Monday's controversial decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I was completely shocked and disillusioned by the whole thing,"
said Bezic, a Canadian.</TE>
<TE>   "I think those five judges judged what they wanted to see."</TE>
<TE>   Said Hamilton: "Yeah, not what actually happened."</TE>
<TE>   No question Bezic and Hamilton are outraged. But their bosses are
probably thinking, "This is great!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The controversy has provided Jay Leno with material for his
"Olympic Tonight Show."</TE>
<TE>   "Big snowstorm in Salt Lake City last night," he said Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you see that? Man I tell you, apparently visibility was down
to zero. Maybe that's why the figure skating judges couldn't see
anything."</TE>
<TE>   On CBS, the controversy was the topic of David Letterman's top 10
list.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although media critics have complained about NBC's delayed
coverage in the West, the ratings have justified it.</TE>
<TE>   Through Tuesday, the Winter Olympics were averaging a 19.8
national rating. The average rating for the Pacific time zone was a
22.8.</TE>
<TE>   NBC President Randy Falco said: "I just don't think you're
servicing your viewers by having something live if they're not
available to see it.</TE>
<TE>   "There are three main constituencies you have to
satisfy--advertisers, audiences and affiliates. And I don't think
you're servicing your viewers by having something live if they're not
available to watch it."</TE>
<TE>   Falco was also pleased that the ratings for the younger
demographic groups were up from the last Winter Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   In the 18-34 age group, the rating was up 31%</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For television critics, there is always something to complain
about when it comes to Olympic coverage.</TE>
<TE>   In Sydney, it was the color of Costas' hair, which appeared
reddish because the studio lighting.</TE>
<TE>   The authenticity of the fireplace at the broadcast center has been
a hot topic at Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   It's actually a video of a fireplace, complete with wafting smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "Our fireplace is truly one of the great mysteries of television,"
said NBC Sports Vice President Kevin Sullivan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the oddest story of these Games from the television side is
the excuse hockey play-by-play announcer Mike Emrick used for bowing
out.</TE>
<TE>   Emrick said his 4-year-old dog was sick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NBC people will tell you they are thrilled with how things are
going in Salt Lake City, that the fast-paced, audio-enhanced coverage
is a key reason the ratings have been so good.</TE>
<TE>   To get a more objective opinion, Neal Pilson, who presided over
CBS Sports during the Albertville and Lillehammer Games, was asked
for his opinion.</TE>
<TE>   He gave NBC high marks.</TE>
<TE>   "The tape delay factor is strictly a media issue," Pilson said.
"It has no relevance to most viewers. Whether an event has taken
place two hours or six hours before makes no difference to the
majority of the audience.</TE>
<TE>   "Viewers have grown accustomed to watching an edited version
during prime time, and that's what works best.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be mind-numbing to watch many Olympic events live. It
would be very repetitive to watch 20 to 40 straight ski runs, or luge
runs. There would be very little sports or entertainment value in
that."</TE>
<TE>   So far, only 47% of NBC's event coverage has been live outside the
Pacific time zone. But that number should increase to around 60%
before the Games conclude, as figure skating gets more attention.</TE>
<TE>   As if figure skating isn't already getting enough attention.</TE>

<HD>Jamaican Bobsledders: A Cool Running theme</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They were a novelty, and then they became a symbol of the Olympic
spirit. Then they were a movie. But the four men of the first
Jamaican bobsled team, the four men who went to the 1988 Calgary
Winter Olympics having hardly ever felt snow, always wanted one
thing.</LD>
<LD>   "We wanted most of all," said Nelson Chris Stokes, "to compete. We
were not jokes. We were athletes who wanted to test ourselves."</LD>
<LD>   Fourteen years after the first Jamaican bobsledders brought reggae
to the Winter Games, Jamaica could only afford to send a two-man team
to Salt Lake City.</LD>
<TE>   The team has survived mainly on the kindness of strangers.
Jamaican bobsledders train in Evanston, Wyo., where the town welcomed
the athletes by offering them free rooms and the chance to earn
pocket change by working as pizza deliverymen.</TE>
<TE>   Stokes, who with his brother Dudley, Devon Harris and Michael
White were the first Jamaican bobsledders, is now the president of
the Jamaican Bobsleigh Federation, and Dudley is a member. Chris
Stokes works for a savings and loan institution in the Jamaican
capital of Kingston. Dudley has his own company.</TE>
<TE>   White works in retail in the New York City area, according to
Chris Stokes. Harris is a motivational speaker.</TE>
<TE>   The 1993 Disney movie "Cool Runnings" was loosely based on the
four young Jamaicans and their quirky desire to pursue entry into the
Winter Olympics from a country where it is virtually always 80
degrees.</TE>
<TE>   While grim-faced bobsled officials lamented the way the Jamaicans
seemed to be making a mockery of their sport, the fans in Calgary
embraced the Stokes brothers, Harris and White. Jamaican bobsled pins
quickly became collectors' items. Even when the Jamaican sled had a
roiling, rolling, end-over-end crash in the third run, the team only
became more loved and more popular.</TE>
<TE>   At the 1994 Lillehammer Games, the Jamaican sled even beat a U.S.
entry and finished 14th. Harris was still competing as a driver in
Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "Jamaica is a funny country," Chris Stokes said. "Jamaicans tend
to like their heroes to have a medal or two, as they've been spoiled
by the track athletes. So we are much more famous and popular in the
U.S., Canada and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people wanted us to be a joke, but those who knew the sport
and understood athletics understood how serious we were and what a
great accomplishment we had."</TE>
<TE>   Doug E. Doug played a character based on Chris Stokes in "Cool
Runnings." Stokes said that although the movie took lots of liberties
with the true story--"I had no [dread-] locks like Mr. Doug had"--he
also said, "The movie's spirit was very much ours."</TE>
<TE>   Stokes said he is still convinced that with enough funding, the
Jamaicans can have a competitive team. "We, the first team, just
wanted to win some races, we just wanted to be a good team.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we have a two-man team, and our men have won the push
competition; we won it the last two years. I expect our team to be
the fastest-starting team. But to finish you need the best equipment
and training, and that we don't have yet."</TE>
<TE>   Stokes has two daughters, 11-year-old Jalissa and 6-year-old
Natalia. "Talia likes to wear my helmet," Stokes said. "Now that
there's women's bobsled, I'd like to get a Jamaican women's team
together too. Maybe we can have two generations of Stokes
bobsledders."</TE>

<HD>Skating Judge Felt Heat, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Olympics: French panelist is said to have been pressured. The
sport's credibility is at stake.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY
</DL>
<LD>A figure skating controversy that threatens to engulf the Olympic
Winter Games intensified Wednesday when details of a French judge's
alleged misconduct came to light.</LD>
<LD>   Marie Reine Le Gougne told fellow members of the pairs judging panel
Monday that she had been pressured to vote for a Russian duo, which led
to an unpopular gold medal triumph over a Canadian pair.</LD>
<LD>   Le Gougne made the admission in a judges' meeting after the event, a
highly placed figure skating official told The Times.</LD>
<TE>   The source said referee Ron Pfenning, an American, felt the outcome
was unjust and said so before the panel. Le Gougne responded by saying
she had been directed by the French figure skating federation to vote for
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who performed a flawed routine,
instead of the more polished Canadians, Jamie Sale and David Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, Pfenning made an official report to International
Skating Union President Ottavio Cinquanta. He dispatched representatives
of the ISU's technical committee, who oversee the sport's rules, to
question Le Gougne, who denied having been pressured or having said she
had been under duress.</TE>
<TE>   Capping a day filled with wild speculation and vague news conferences,
Didier Gailhaguet, head of the French figure skating federation,
confirmed that Le Gougne had been pressured, but he denied that the
federation was responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people close to the judge have acted badly and have put someone
who is honest and upright, but emotionally fragile, under pressure,"
Gailhaguet said. "She is a fragile person, and I think she has been
somewhat manipulated."</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to reach Pfenning and Le Gougne failed. ISU rules prohibit
judges from commenting during a competition.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta said the ISU has begun its own "assessment" and will discuss
the matter at a council meeting Monday in Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   IOC Director General Francois Carrard urged the ISU to move quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our Games too," he said. "We are concerned for the athletes. It
is our concern that this be settled expeditiously."</TE>
<TE>   If substantiated, Le Gougne's alleged actions could undermine the
credibility of figure skating, a marquee sport of the Winter Games and
one that is heavily subjective. A judge from Ukraine was suspended for
two years after the 1998 Nagano Games for allegedly prejudging the ice
dancing competition, but it has long been speculated that judges trade
votes for political favors or votes for their own skaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Heads are going to roll," said The Times' source, "most certainly the
judge's. . . . If it's true and she was pressured, she's gone. If she
lied, she's gone.</TE>
<TE>   "But a whole lot of people heard her."</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze performed a classical and dramatic long
program Monday but had one misstep, when Sikharulidze stumbled on the
landing of a double axel jump. Sale and Pelletier performed to "Love
Story," and many observers felt they were clearly superior.</TE>
<TE>   It's still not known why the French judge would have been pressured to
favor the Russians. Cinquanta said vote-swapping was not involved.</TE>
<TE>   Cinquanta would not speculate on possible remedies because he said
insufficient information had been gathered.</TE>
<TE>   "I have an allegation. I have a denial. Now I have to go forward,"
said Cinquanta, an Italian whose expertise lies in speedskating.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadian Olympic Assn. and Skate Canada requested an independent
inquiry and that a duplicate gold medal be given to Sale and Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like, first of all, to say we don't wish to in any way
tarnish the medal that was won by the Russian pair," said Michael
Chambers, president of the Canadian Olympic Assn. "We don't want to pull
anyone down. We want to pull somebody up. . . . We're alleging that
inappropriate actions were taken. We have no evidence that would prove
this right now, but we will continue our investigation."</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier, the reigning world champions and crowd favorites,
were in second place as they entered the final phase of the event, behind
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze and ahead of the Chinese duo of Xue Shen and
Hongbo Zhao. Any of the three could have won the gold medal had their 4
1/2-minute program been ranked first by the nine-judge panel from Russia,
China, the U.S., France, Poland, Canada, Ukraine, Germany and Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, who skated first among the top three
pairs, performed a classical routine to "Meditation From Thais" by French
composer Jules Massenet. Sikharulidze's stumble was the couple's only
significant error, although Berezhnaya displayed less-than-perfect form
on the landing of a throw triple salchow. Their speed and ice coverage
were impressive, as were their footwork and spins. For technical merit,
they received four marks of 5.7 (out of 6.0) and for presentation were
awarded two 5.8s and seven 5.9s.</TE>
<TE>   Sale and Pelletier performed a program that was comparable in
difficulty to the Russians', and they skated it flawlessly. Creating a
romantic mood that reflected their off-ice involvement, they received six
5.8s and three 5.9s for technical merit and five 5.8s and four 5.9s for
presentation.</TE>
<TE>   The judges from the U.S., Canada, Germany and Japan placed the
Canadians first, but the judges from Russia, China, France, Poland and
Ukraine favored the Russians, in each case by 0.1 of the total scores.
Sale and Pelletier, whose routine had won raves from NBC commentators
Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic--and who had been touted as the gold
medalists by the two commentators--looked on in disbelief when the number
2 appeared next to their name on the standings.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd at the Salt Lake Ice Center booed the results, a chorus
quickly joined by skating fans across North America. Dick Pound of
Canada, an influential International Olympic Committee member who has
criticized ice dance judges for voting according to national bias, added
his dissent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to watch something like this happen," Pound said. "To
watch two kids do a gold medal performance and get a silver medal, and
two people skate a silver medal performance and get gold, there's
something wrong. It shouldn't happen.</TE>
<TE>   "The mere fact that the ISU took the unprecedented step of
acknowledging there is a problem, and is going to see whether or not its
rules have been applied, speaks volumes."</TE>

<HD>Day of Terror Brings a Love Renewed</HD>
<DH>Sept. 11: The couple despaired, each thinking the other had died.
Today they are inseparable in recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The Griffiths met at the World Trade Center 22 years ago. That's
where they worked, where they kissed for the first time and where they
fell in love. It's also where they almost died, each sure the other was
lost forever.</LD>
<LD>   Arturo Griffith was in a Trade Center freight elevator when New York
came under attack. His elevator plummeted 10 stories before the brakes
caught and the doors imploded, shattering his left leg. As he was pulled
to safety, he took a peek back at the north tower and saw the gash the
plane had left.</LD>
<LD>   "My wife," he said. "She's dead."</LD>
<TE>   Carmen was near the 78th floor, where she reported to work each day in
a burgundy maintenance crew uniform, ferrying the suits to the top
floors, mustering a cheery "good morning" for each of them. Trapped in an
elevator, she clawed her way out, but not before burning jet fuel
attacked her face, her hands, her legs. Her eyes were swollen shut, her
earrings welded to her neck. After co-workers helped her to the ground
floor, a paramedic eased her onto a stretcher.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't look up!" he shouted. "Don't look at it!"</TE>
<TE>   She did, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't have to tell me," she said. "I know my husband is gone."</TE>
<TE>   Five months later, reunited and recuperating, they are out of a job
and have little means to support themselves beyond charity. Haunted by
the memories of that morning, Carmen has trouble spending time alone,
even doing simple chores like walking to the Laundromat. Arturo can
barely leave the house because of his bum leg. Both face additional
surgeries.</TE>
<TE>   But inside the walls of the Griffiths' cramped Bronx apartment, amid
the uncertainty and the pain, they have rediscovered a pure, visceral
affection for each other. It is a love they say is difficult to put into
words.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always been close. Now, we're so close that it's like she's the
nail on my finger," Arturo, 55, said. "Now we know that if we didn't both
live, neither of us could have lived. When I found out she was alive, it
was a joy I can't describe. It was like falling in love all over again."</TE>
<TE>   They met on the job in 1980. Both were working for the World Trade
Center maintenance company. He was drawn to her spunk and her fire. She
was put off by his notorious string of girlfriends.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never kissed a Puerto Rican before," Arturo, a native of Panama,
told her one day when the two of them were alone in an elevator.</TE>
<TE>   "You aren't going to kiss this Puerto Rican either," she replied.</TE>
<TE>   He got the hint. They became good friends, but still flirted.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to say my Spanish wasn't perfect," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It still isn't," he said. "But it's better than Jennifer Lopez. Rosie
Perez, too."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, he couldn't hold off any longer, and reminded her that they
had never gotten around to kissing.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," she said, as they were alone again in an elevator, "go ahead."</TE>
<TE>   "And that was it," Arturo said. "Love made in heaven."</TE>
<TE>   They were married a year later by a justice of the peace at New York
City Hall. It was his fourth marriage and her second.</TE>
<TE>   They moved to a Bronx apartment so close to Yankee Stadium that Arturo
would watch the games on TV, and through the window hear the crowd roar
for a home run.</TE>
<TE>   There was a constant merry-go-round of visitors--the Griffiths, who
call each other "Ma" and "Pa," have 12 mostly grown children between
them. On many weekends they rented a cabin in rural Pennsylvania and
hosted feasts for dozens of relatives.</TE>
<TE>   On workdays, they rode the No. 4 train to the southern tip of
Manhattan, Carmen sipping tea, Arturo enjoying a decaf coffee.</TE>
<TE>   It was their usual routine on Sept. 11. When they arrived at the World
Trade Center, Arturo was told to cover a shift for a co-worker, working a
freight elevator in the north tower. Carmen worked elevators on the upper
floors, mostly running Cantor Fitzgerald bond traders from the 78th floor
lobby to their offices 25 stories above.</TE>
<TE>Flames in the Elevator</TE>
<TE>   When the first plane hit, Carmen, 48, was trapped in an elevator. She
pried the doors open about 18 inches, allowing five other people to crawl
out between her legs. When she turned her head, she saw the wall of the
elevator split apart. The flames burst inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not going to die like this!" she shouted.</TE>
<TE>   She dived into the lobby. Less than 15 stories above, a jet had
exploded, and it would soon take the building down. Already the marble
walls around her were cracking. Her face felt like it was on fire.
Friends and co-workers guided her down to safety; her eyes were swollen
so tight her tears could not escape.</TE>
<TE>   She was taken by ambulance to Long Island College Hospital in
Brooklyn.</TE>
<TE>   Arturo, meantime, was in the freight elevator.</TE>
<TE>   On coffee breaks, he and co-workers who operated the World Trade
Center's spider web of freight elevators often had mused about what they
would do if one fell. There were different theories. Some said they would
lie on the floor so they wouldn't break their legs. Others said they
would jump up at the last second to counter the impact.</TE>
<TE>   "When it actually drops, though, you don't think of any of that,"
Arturo said. "You just think: This is it. I'm going to die in here."</TE>
<TE>   The real-life sensation was terrifying--the elevator was falling and
for a several seconds it was unclear whether it would stop before hitting
the ground. Near the bottom floor, however, the brakes caught and the car
skidded to a halt. Then the doors caved in with a powerful force, burying
Arturo in rubble.</TE>
<TE>   A rescue worker quickly pulled him to safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him how my leg looked," Arturo said. "I didn't want to look
at it. He said it was OK. But I knew from his expression that it wasn't
too good."</TE>
<TE>   Arturo was taken to St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   For two days, Carmen and Arturo each thought the other was dead.
Finally, a nurse delivered the news to Carmen: "We found your husband."
They were reunited several days later at the Brooklyn hospital.</TE>
<TE>   She was worried that her burns, which had melted her stockings,
severely injured her hand and covered much of her face, would make her
unattractive. It turned out he didn't care about that. He was only
worried about hurting her if he squeezed her too tight.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing hurts," she told him when, with crutches under his arms, he
walked into her hospital room. "Nothing else matters now."</TE>
<TE>   They stayed together in that hospital room for a month, surrounded by
27 deflating balloons, a slew of U.S. flags and 85 get-well-soon cards.</TE>
<TE>   They were celebrities, in a strange way. When they ambled off to
physical therapy, strangers reached out and touched them, laid their
hands on their shoulders, told them they had been chosen by God to
survive.</TE>
<TE>   But recovery was hardly glamorous. Doctors removed a 5-inch-wide graft
from Carmen's leg and used the skin to repair her hand. For weeks, the
hand bled every time they changed her dressing, and large pieces of skin
peeled away each day.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks rotten," Carmen said in late September. "And it stinks. It
smells like I'm dead."</TE>
<TE>   Arturo had to have a large metal rod installed in his lower leg to
repair the shattered bones. There were dilemmas he'd never considered: He
had no way to pull his underwear over his cast until hospital workers
brought him a hooked device that came to be known as the "underwear
stick."</TE>
<TE>   "They think of everything," Arturo said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The couple received many visitors during the day, but nights were
often difficult.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I will lie here and I'll just cry," Arturo said in early
October. "Tears just stream down my face and they don't stop. I'll look
over and she's sleeping. I'm just glad she's sleeping."</TE>
<TE>   But she wasn't, not soundly, anyway. Her bed was directly under an
air-conditioning duct, and every time it turned on she would wake up with
a jolt, reliving the attacks again.</TE>
<TE>A Sunny Day in the Fall</TE>
<TE>   They were released from the hospital on a sunny morning in late
October. A driver strapped Arturo's wheelchair to the floor at the back
of the ambulance. Carmen sat in the front seat. As they rounded the
southwest tip of Brooklyn, she looked west and saw the Lower Manhattan
skyline, seeing it for the first time without the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   "They're gone," Carmen said. "Just gone."</TE>
<TE>   The ambulance rumbled over the Triborough Bridge into the Bronx. Their
entire apartment complex, all 150 people it seemed, waited to welcome
them. Carmen ran into the open arms of her neighbors. Arturo was wheeled
out of the back of the ambulance like a returning war hero, his underwear
stick in his lap.</TE>
<TE>   Several friends and neighbors had taped welcoming greetings to the
wall of the apartment building. "Dear Carmen," one of them read, "I know
how you get when you are mad. I knew you wouldn't let no bomb keep you
down." It was signed Big John.</TE>
<TE>   Carmen tried to tell the crowd in the lobby about their ordeal. "You
don't know how hard it was," she said. "I didn't know where he was. I
kept saying 'He's dead, he's dead.' But then they brought him to me."</TE>
<TE>   Soon she broke down in tears, and she and Arturo went upstairs to
their apartment.</TE>
<TE>   These days, they rarely leave the house for anything other than doctor
appointments. A psychologist comes by on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and they
go to physical therapy together on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.</TE>
<TE>   Both probably will require more surgery. She needs work done on the
webbing between her fingers. He needs liquid and scar tissue removed from
his knee.</TE>
<TE>   But along the way, they say they have rediscovered an uncommon love.</TE>
<TE>   They finish each other's sentences and are sure they finish each
other's thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Both have nightmares. She hears the screams of those who didn't make
it out. He wakes up wondering if things would have turned out differently
if he had made a different decision--if he had gotten in the freight
elevator just a few minutes earlier and taken it to the upper floors of
the tower, where he surely would have perished.</TE>
<TE>   Arturo and Carmen aren't planning anything special for Valentine's
Day. They can't really leave the house, lest Arturo's leg swell up again.
She can't easily cook because of her hand. Money is tight--several
charities, including the Red Cross and the Salvation Army, are paying
their bills.</TE>
<TE>   But it will be another day together, Carmen said Monday night, another
day of survival.</TE>
<TE>   "We know it's not going to ease up, not any time soon," she said.
"It's going to be like this for a long time. But we'll come out of it.
With time, we'll get over this. We believe that. We have to."</TE>

<HD>House OKs Campaign Finance Bill</HD>
<DH>Congress: Debate into early morning ends in a 240-189 vote to ban
unlimited donations to parties. Approval sets up first overhaul of
election spending since the 1970s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The House early today gave solid bipartisan approval to legislation
that would reshape the nation's political fund-raising system for the
first time since the post-Watergate reforms of the 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   Led by Democrats and a breakaway bloc of Republicans, the House, on a
240-189 vote embraced a ban on the unlimited donations to national
political parties known as soft money. The action took Congress one major
step closer to making the reform a reality.</LD>
<LD>   Passage of the legislation came after two rival proposals offered by
GOP leaders that aimed to derail the reform effort fell well short in
early votes Wednesday. By early today, several tests on amendments had
also failed to splinter the pro-reform coalition.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a great moment for the country," said House Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), a leading reform advocate. "I just think
this is going to create a new politics in this country that surrounds
organizations and people and ideas rather than large amounts of money and
television ads."</TE>
<TE>   In the last decade, both major parties increasingly have relied on
soft money contributions from unions, corporations and wealthy
individuals to help pay for political advertising outside of the system
of federal campaign contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   Critics denounce the practice as an ever-widening loophole in election
law that allows big donors to seek undue influence over candidates for
president and Congress. They cite the discredited Enron Corp. as a prime
example of a special interest that sought advantage in Washington by
giving more than $3.5 million in soft money over the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   The bill the House approved, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays
(R-Conn.) and Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.), closely tracks a companion
measure by Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.)
that the Senate passed last April, 59 to 41. Today, 41 House Republicans
joined 198 Democrats and one independent in the pro-reform majority.</TE>
<TE>   The main provisions of each bill are similar: They would bar national
parties from raising soft money, increase the size of contributions that
can be given directly to candidates for federal office and impose new
regulations on broadcast advertising by interest groups that target
candidates in the days before a general or primary election.</TE>
<TE>   Soft money has powerful defenders among elected officials who are
reluctant to tinker with a formula that helped send them to Washington.
House Republican leaders, claiming their House majority could be at risk,
fought the Shays-Meehan legislation with every weapon in their arsenal.
Indeed, they scheduled a debate this year only after a rebellious
majority of House members signed a rank-and-file petition to force
action.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders on Wednesday proposed two alternatives to the bill that
sought even tighter limits on political donations. While the Republican
leaders conceded that they did not want these alternatives to become law,
they hoped the House might endorse them as a way to force a potential
bill-scuttling conference committee with the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The House swatted away the two proposals easily--one on a 249-179
vote, the other by a whopping 377 to 53.</TE>
<TE>   While the House coalition pushing the reform bill showed strength in
these preliminary votes, the Shays-Meehan measure was subjected to an
array of attacks in a marathon series of votes that culminated early
today.</TE>
<TE>   With the bill having survived the House largely intact, advocates now
plan to send it back to the Senate for final congressional action. If
approved there, it would be sent to President Bush for his signature or
veto.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has been noncommittal, though increasingly there have been
signals he would sign the bill. At the White House on Wednesday, he told
reporters that he wants to "sign a bill that improves the system."</TE>
<TE>   He added that if a bill is acceptable to him, it should take effect
immediately. That was an implicit criticism of a last-minute decision by
Shays and Meehan to postpone their proposed soft money ban until after
this year's congressional elections. Early today, the House affirmed the
sponsors' position.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Bush promised to "take a good look" at whatever Congress might
send him, and Fleischer said the Shays-Meehan bill makes "several
improvements to the current system."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's refusal to threaten a veto means that major campaign
legislation has a solid chance of enactment. In fact, several prominent
Republican lawmakers opposed to the proposed reforms have predicted that
the president will sign a soft money ban into law.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Republicans and Democrats collected nearly $500 million in
soft money for the 2000 elections--more than five times the $86 million
they collected in 1991-92.</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders have denounced the bid to ban soft money as an
unconstitutional infringement on free speech. And they have warned it
would leave their party more exposed to attacks by unions and others
sympathetic to Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not reform," House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) said of
the bill. "This is regulation."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates said the ban is needed to rebuild public confidence in the
political process.</TE>
<TE>   "This beautiful city in which we serve, 200 years ago was built on a
swamp," said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), the House minority
whip. "And a swamp it is again today, a swamp of special interest money.
Today we have the opportunity to drain that swamp."</TE>
<TE>   In a key preliminary vote, 39 Republicans joined 200 Democrats and one
independent to move the Shays-Meehan proposal forward. Two of the
dissident Republicans were from California: Reps. Stephen Horn of Long
Beach and Doug Ose of Sacramento. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley),
who in 1998 and 1999 had voted for earlier versions of the bill, sided
with his leadership this time in opposing the bill in the initial vote.</TE>
<TE>   All 32 House Democrats from California supported the bill.</TE>
<TE>   After the preliminary vote, the House began to consider amendments.</TE>
<TE>   Republican leaders proposed 10 amendments that advocates of the bill
described as "poison pills." As the House was working through those
proposals far into the night, it defeated nine of them, including one to
impose a U.S. citizenship requirement on campaign donors. Currently,
noncitizens who are legal residents are allowed to make donations.</TE>
<TE>   One GOP leadership amendment that passed the House on a largely
party-line vote with Republican support eliminated a provision that was
meant to help Democrats pay for a new party building in Washington. But
congressional aides said afterward the amendment did not appear to
threaten passage of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Reform advocates comfortably survived an important test as the House
defeated an amendment to make the soft money ban effective immediately.
Backers of the bill, who argue that it is impractical to change the
system when November elections are approaching, had feared the GOP
leadership proposal would cost the bill support in the Senate needed to
overcome an expected filibuster.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of Shays-Meehan squeaked past another challenge as the House
rejected, 219 to 209, a proposal backed by the National Rifle Assn. to
give special protections to political advertising pertaining to the 2nd
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   But the House approved three other amendments offered by supporters of
Shays-Meehan. One, approved on a 327-101 vote, stripped a provision from
the bill to regulate the cost of political advertising on television.
Shays and Meehan, who gave their allies the green light to offer the
amendment but did not endorse it, said it would not jeopardize its fate
in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   The provision had been pushed into the Senate-passed bill last year at
the urging of Sen. Robert G. Torricelli (D-N.J.) and other senators who
face high advertising costs in major television markets.</TE>
<TE>   Another amendment, approved by voice vote, would relax limits even
further for candidates who face self-funded wealthy opponents. A third
amendment offered by the Shays-Meehan coalition would raise the
individual contribution limits for House campaigns to $2,000 per election
per candidate, up from $1,000. It was approved, 218 to 211, mostly with
Republican support, mirroring provisions in the Senate-passed bill for
senatorial and presidential contribution limits.</TE>
<TE>   The debate on the legislation underscored the high stakes as lawmakers
on both sides acknowledged that Congress was considering historic changes
to the financing system.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John T. Doolittle (R-Rocklin), a prominent opponent, said the
current system is the product of a Democratic-led Congress in the 1970s
and that those reforms have left the GOP at a disadvantage for two
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "If this disastrous bill passes us today unamended, I suspect we will
have another 20 years in the trenches before we ever come back,"
Doolittle said, voicing fears of many in his party that the reforms could
cost the Republicans control of the House and undercut their chances of
regaining a Senate majority. Many in the GOP especially lament that the
bill does not require unions to obtain permission from their members
before using dues for political purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.) cited the ongoing investigation of
Enron's collapse in explaining his support of the bill. The chairman of a
House subcommittee leading the probe, he noted that the now-bankrupt
energy company repeatedly gave major checks, totaling tens of thousands
of dollars apiece, to Democratic and Republican party committees to
influence the 2000 elections.</TE>
<TE>   "My friends, this is not about philosophy," Greenwood said. "It is
about access and influence, and it corrupts our process."</TE>

<HD>Journalist Is Dead, Says Key Suspect in Pakistan</HD>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>The key suspect in the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter
Daniel Pearl appeared before an anti-terrorism court today and told a
judge "as far as I understand, Daniel Pearl is dead."</LD>
<LD>   Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was brought into the court in Karachi with a
hood over his head. As he was brought before the judge, he removed the
hood and said: "I don't want to fight this case. Whatever I have done,
right or wrong, I have my reasons, and I confess." He then said: "I just
want to add something: As far as I understand, Daniel Pearl is dead."</LD>
<LD>   It was difficult to immediately verify Sheikh's contentions. Sources
in the investigation said he has proved a difficult interrogation and has
not given them any accurate information on the whereabouts of Pearl or
his body. Several raids based on information provided by Sheikh proved
fruitless Wednesday night.</LD>
<TE>   In a strange twist to an already enigmatic case, Sheikh alleged that
he has been detained since Feb. 5. Pakistani authorities, however,
reported his arrest Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, the Journal's South Asia bureau chief, disappeared Jan. 23
in Karachi en route to what he believed was an interview with a reclusive
Islamic cleric.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl's abductors sent two e-mail messages to foreign media, which
included photographs of Pearl in captivity. They called for the release
of Pakistani prisoners of the U.S. war in Afghanistan, and the return of
the former Taliban ambassador to Pakistan, among other demands.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers' second e-mail threatened to execute Pearl within 24
hours and gave American journalists three days to leave Pakistan.
However, in recent days Pakistani police and investigators had expressed
optimism that Pearl was alive.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said after meeting
with President Bush in Washington that he was "reasonably sure" that
Pearl was still alive and that "we are as close as possible to getting
him released." He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf characterized the kidnapping as "fallout" from his crackdown
on extremism, but he said he would not be deterred.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Goldstein, spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., the Wall Street
Journal's parent organization, said he had not heard about Sheikh's
statement. "We continue to remain hopeful," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Brig. Mukhtar Ahmed, home secretary of Sindh province, where Karachi
is located, said: "We don't think that he's telling the truth. He could
say anything. We are not taking this seriously. He is derailing the
investigation. If he knows Daniel Pearl has been killed, he should tell
us where the body is. He is a very cunning man and a hardened criminal."</TE>
<TE>   The judge set a court hearing for Feb. 25 and sent Sheikh back to
jail.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, 27, a British citizen, was arrested in India in 1994 for
kidnapping Western backpackers in Kashmir. The kidnappers demanded the
release of Islamic militants fighting Indian rule in the contested
Himalayan region. Sheikh was shot and wounded by police and the hostages
were freed unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the next five years in jail, but was never tried. He was
freed in December 1999 after gunmen hijacked an Indian Airlines jet to
Kandahar, Afghanistan, and demanded the release of Sheikh and two other
militants.</TE>
<TE>   Educated at elite British institutions, including the London School of
Economics, Sheikh joined the Islamic "holy war" after a summer spent in
Bosnia-Herzegovina aiding Muslim war victims.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's apparent confession came just a day after Pakistani
investigators said they were shifting their attention away from Sheikh
and toward Khalid Khawaja, an aging former Pakistani intelligence
official who counts himself a close friend and confidant of Osama bin
Laden. Khawaja served as a source for Pearl.</TE>
<TE>   Implicating Khawaja would satisfy those who have divined the secret
hand of Pakistan's murky Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or some
rogue element of it, in the Pearl case. The supposed motivation: to
display their power despite Musharraf's crackdown on extremist groups the
ISI once aided.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja was forced out of the ISI and retired from the Pakistani air
force in 1988 for challenging former President Zia ul-Haq over his
dedication to Islamic causes. He said he worked on the agency's Afghan
operations in the late 1980s, when the U.S. government funneled millions
of dollars through the agency to moujahedeen groups battling the Soviet
invasion and proxy government in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja said he has maintained close contacts with Taliban members and
claims that he served as a back-channel link to them between the Sept. 11
attacks and the onset of U.S. bombing in Afghanistan in early October. He
showed e-mails that he said prove his case.</TE>
<TE>   But Hamid Gul, a former ISI chief, dismisses the possibility that
Khawaja or intelligence agents were involved in the Pearl kidnapping.
"Pakistan, ISI and the moujahedeen groups cannot benefit from this kind
of a thing," he said. "I think ISI is being targeted by the Western
media."</TE>
<TE>'I Am Not Scared'</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja, a media-savvy small-business man who does research and
development for the Pakistani navy, said he is mystified by the focus on
him. "They have tried to implicate me with that, but I am open, I am
honest, and I am not scared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Pearl disappeared, investigators twice came to the
doorstep of Khawaja's spacious house on the west side of Islamabad, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja since has been questioned twice but remains free. He has
co-written a plea for Pearl's release that was published by the Los
Angeles Times and has said he found Pearl likable. But he is angry that
the U.S. media and Pakistani government make so much of the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "I have all my sympathy for Daniel Pearl," he said. "But Pakistanis
are all human beings too. Daily, every day, you see people killed and
kidnapped all the time, and our government never lifts a finger."</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja, who spoke with The Times just before authorities arrested
Sheikh, said he met with Pearl on Jan. 7 or 8 in Islamabad. Pearl was
eager to set up a meeting with a reclusive Islamic cleric with a large
following in the U.S. who may have counted suspected "shoe bomber"
Richard C. Reid as a disciple.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time Pearl had contacted Khawaja. In September,
the reporter called looking for contacts in Karachi, he said. "I gave him
two, three or four people in Karachi," Khawaja said. "He was nice. As a
person, I liked him a lot."</TE>
<TE>   None of those contacts, Khawaja insists, are the ones who authorities
now believe led Pearl into the hands of kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>Source Kept in Contact</TE>
<TE>   The two kept in telephone and e-mail contact over the weeks before
Pearl disappeared, according to Khawaja. "He would call me and confirm
things," Khawaja said. "We became friendly. And then he disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja said he told Pearl he could not arrange a contact with Sheik
Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, who heads Jamaat ul-Fuqra (Party of the Poor).
Gilani also has helped convert hundreds of mainly African American
adherents in the U.S., called the Muslims of America, with chapters in
New York, Virginia, Colorado and California.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him at this particular time, it would be hard to meet him,"
Khawaja said.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say Pearl made contact with people he thought were
Gilani intermediaries through e-mail notes, which they now believe were
signed with fake names used by Sheikh, the British citizen who was
arrested Tuesday, to lure him into the kidnapping trap.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Gilani has turned himself in to police. He remains in
jail, though no charges have been filed.</TE>

<PH>THE RACE FOR GOVERNOR</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Riordan Runs With Enthusiasm, Candor</HD>
<DH>Election: Despite serving two terms as Los Angeles mayor, he
remains something of an anti-politician.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the red brick streets in downtown Santa Ana, former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan darts in and out of tiny shops like he's just
arrived at an amusement park and has to try every ride. He shakes every
hand he can reach. He pats every baby's head.</LD>
<LD>   Bystanders watch as he makes his rounds on his quest to be governor of
California. With a few exceptions, they have no idea who he is. Most of
the people he approaches in this predominantly Latino city speak little
English but seem pleased enough by the diversion of this candidate and
his posse of staff, reporters and local politicians.</LD>
<LD>   "What's your name?" Riordan asks a young woman.</LD>
<TE>   "Monica," she answers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm Ricardo," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yo quiero . . . ser . . . su gobernador," he adds, beaming as he
slowly delivers "I want to be your governor" in American-accented
Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, as his glossy black campaign bus hurtles toward Palm
Desert and lunch with the Coachella Valley Lincoln Club, he says he can
read Spanish, he just can't speak it well.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Latinos appreciate that I try," he says about his Spanish.
"They love to laugh at me. If you sound too perfect, like Al Gore, you
sound like a nerd." He laughs. "I just sound like an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   He is anything but. He is a former two-term mayor, a respected lawyer
and a successful businessman whose fortune is believed to hover between a
quarter- and a half-billion dollars but who delights in insisting that he
never knows how much he's worth. He is also one of the most generous
philanthropists in California and he does know how much money he has
given away--$30 million.</TE>
<TE>   A man who started his career in elective politics only 10 years ago at
the age of 61, Riordan has never cultivated the politesse of the public
candidate. When he's angry, he shows it. When he tells a funny story, he
laughs the hardest. When he breakfasts with Riverside politicos carping
about their traffic problems, he listens sympathetically but says,
"You've got to come up with a solution. I can't as governor tell you what
to do about your traffic."</TE>
<TE>   And when he addresses a group of supporters who have paid $250 to
mingle with him at a cocktail party at the Mission Inn in Riverside, he
starts by telling the mostly white group that their political party must
be more inclusive. "We are the new Republican Party," he says. "We can
disagree with each other. We can be pro-choice, pro-life, and respect
each other."</TE>
<TE>   He strings thoughts together in a stream-of-consciousness patter that
more carefully packaged politicians wouldn't dream of doing. He
derisively tells a story of Gray Davis holding up a commercial plane
flight--that Riordan just happened to be on.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be like a king," Riordan scoffs, saying that Davis
sat in the front. "I sat in the back. I felt like Rosa Parks," he says,
then adds, "who's a friend of mine, by the way." Of course, he meant it
as a quip--and he got it wrong, because she sat in the front of the bus.
But few rich white men would reach for a poor black woman and civil
rights icon for a joke--then try to fix it by insisting the person was a
friend.</TE>
<TE>   His candor and engaging playfulness may constitute his greatest assets
in a race against the famously bland and stiff Davis. But the flip
side--a coursing wrath--poses a constant threat to his ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Upset that this article might mention previously reported details of
the untimely death, 20 years ago, of one of his daughters, he ended a
conversation with a reporter by suddenly jumping to his feet and
screaming at the reporter to get out--of a moving campaign bus. An aide
took Riordan's arm and coaxed him away.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Riordan was smiling and chatting with supporters at a
Sacramento printing company as if nothing had happened. A few hours later
in Modesto, he was wolfing down In-N-Out burgers with a klatch of
reporters, including the one who had displeased him.</TE>
<TE>   Successful in business and politics, Riordan's life nonetheless is
clouded by a series of devastating tragedies--the death of three siblings
at young ages and the deaths of two of his five children. His
relationships have been troubled. He has been married three times and
divorced twice, despite a lifelong devotion to his Catholic faith. (All
his wives have been Catholic.) Stubborn and quick-tempered, he has pushed
away colleagues and friends.</TE>
<TE>   The most glaring example is his troubled relationship with Bill
Wardlaw, the Democratic activist who defied his own party to mastermind
both of Riordan's mayoral campaigns. They had a blistering parting of
ways when Riordan, who could serve only two terms as mayor, decided to
support Steve Soboroff as his successor. Wardlaw decided to support James
Hahn, and Riordan took it as a betrayal. Today, Wardlaw and Riordan are
just beginning to repair their relationship.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, Riordan is the model of the contemporary, pragmatic
elected official. As a Republican mayor, he gave money to Democrats
(including the governor he hopes to unseat) and happily opened the
Democratic Convention in his city. His wife is a registered Democrat who
can't even vote for him in the primary. He supports abortion rights for
women and rails against constraints on business. He seems to regard
politics the same way he regards shopping--a necessary but unappealing
task.</TE>
<TE>   But why at 71, an age when many prominent men are contemplating their
memoirs, would he want a job that he once called a nightmare? His answer
reveals a combination of civic-mindedness, sincerity and arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you start out by saying there's a vacuum of leadership," he
explains on his bus. "And . . . if you had somebody else in who could
beat Gray Davis, I'd be out of that race in a second."</TE>
<TE>Pursuing What He Called a Nightmare</TE>
<TE>   "My worst nightmare in the world is waking up in the morning, and
realizing I'm governor of the state of California . . . [The governor] is
just running the most convoluted bank there is."</TE>
<TE>   On a cool winter afternoon, seven years after he uttered those words,
Riordan is dressed in gym shoes and jeans. He has decided to turn an
interview into a walk around his lush Brentwood Park neighborhood. Behind
gates and hedges sit some of the city's most prized real estate,
including his own 7,000-square-foot Mediterranean home. A voracious
reader, he built a cozy two-story library inside, which holds only a
fraction of his collection of more than 40,000 books. Outside the house,
tiny lights adorn trees so high you marvel at how anyone got them up
there.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me about two days," Riordan deadpans. (He hired people to do
it.)</TE>
<TE>   As he walks, Riordan launches into his campaign appeal: Everything in
the state is in crisis, there's not enough housing, there are no
long-term plans for water, California schoolchildren rank nearly last in
math and science scores. He would hire "the best and the brightest" to
run the government. Business is the salve for most problems.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the main themes of my campaign is, if you're the most liberal
person and you're for the poor, you should want businesses to be
successful in California so that they will create quality jobs for the
poor and others."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's former law partner and close friend, Carl McKinzie, says
Riordan feels compelled to run. "He loves problem-solving; he loved it as
a lawyer, solving problems for clients. He sees problems with the state
he can solve--fiscal problems, energy problems. To have California rank
where it does in education is appalling to him."</TE>
<TE>   As he strolls his neighborhood, he recycles an anecdote he has told
for years about a couple he hired to do housework. As the story goes,
they quit because they had nothing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "They said I didn't know how to live like a wealthy man," he says,
chuckling.</TE>
<TE>   But he does live like a wealthy man. He has a house in the expensive
ski resort of Sun Valley, Idaho, and he just finished a yearlong remodel
of his Brentwood home. "That's a sore subject," he says, grumbling about
the cost of the project like any other homeowner. He spent millions on
his successful run for mayor in 1993. He often has breakfast at the
unpretentious downtown restaurant, the Original Pantry--but then, he owns
it.</TE>
<TE>   He loathes buying expensive clothes and once chided the wealthy Al
Checchi, when he was running for governor in 1998, for wearing an
expensive suit during the campaign. But even Riordan makes some
concessions to taste. On a recent campaign outing, he was wearing a
Trussardi suit that he said would have cost him $3,000 here. Ever the
bargain-hunter, he bought it for $600 in Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's a little Irish guilt or something," he muses.</TE>
<TE>   Even though he was born only a year after the stock market crash that
opened the Depression, Riordan grew up comfortably in the suburb of New
Rochelle, N.Y. "When I went to public school, it was about half very poor
blacks and half very well-off whites, and yet I don't think any of us
thought there was anything strange about it. The blacks came over to my
house. I went over to their house. Never thought twice about it."</TE>
<TE>   After an all-male Jesuit Catholic high school, he went to college at
Santa Clara University, hoping to make their highly rated football team.
He never did better than third string. After two years, he transferred to
Princeton University, where he studied with the renowned Catholic
philosopher Jacques Maritain. Despite the perks of an elite
university--he once met Albert Einstein at a small cocktail party the
physicist hosted for students--he wasn't happy there.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of preppies at Princeton. I wasn't that comfortable
with them," he says. "Nice people. I've gotten more comfortable with them
since then." He'll be returning in June for his 50th reunion along with
such famous alumni as former Cabinet members James A. Baker III and Frank
Carlucci.</TE>
<TE>   A stint in the Army in Korea followed college. He never saw combat,
but the experience changed the direction of his life. There, he abandoned
his goal of being an academic and decided to take up law. He learned how
to play chess--a game he loves to this day--and win. But most of all, as
a lieutenant leading a battery of 210 men, he went from being a shy boy
to a leader.</TE>
<TE>   After Korea, he entered University of Michigan Law School at the age
of 24, blazing through in two years because he attended classes during
the summer as well. Somehow, he managed to find time to court a woman he
had met on a visit to a New York resort. While he completed law school,
she finished up an internship as a hospital dietitian in Westchester
County, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The couple married and settled as newlyweds in South Pasadena. Riordan
had been drawn to California ever since college.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never known anyone who loved California as much as this man,"
says Jill Riordan Harris, who later became his second wife. "It felt new
to him."</TE>
<TE>   Genie Riordan eventually bore five children as her husband set about
building a law practice, starting off at O'Melveny &amp; Myers and eventually
setting up his own firm.</TE>
<TE>   As he was nurturing his law career, he was also beginning to make his
fortune. In the late '50s, he put an $80,000 inheritance from his father
into the stock market and in two years made $300,000.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '60s, he put $50,000 into a company that made audio
cassettes. After about a year, the company was sold and he reaped seven
times his investment.</TE>
<TE>   There were some mistakes--he invested $2 million in a promising memory
chip company in the '80s that went belly-up "in a flick." There were a
few missed opportunities--he passed on a chance to invest $200,000 in
Intel. "If I had kept it in, it would be worth $2 billion today," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, however, he was thriving, bankrolling two investment
companies. He helped start Riordan Freeman &amp; Spogli in 1983 but left it
five years later. And he started Riordan Lewis &amp; Hayden, in which he
still has an interest.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most important relationships in his life came from his work
at Riordan Freeman &amp; Spogli. Wardlaw joined up with Riordan in 1983 to
handle the legal work of Riordan's investment company.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '70s, Riordan and his first wife, Genie, separated. The
same year that they officially divorced--1980--he married Jill Herndon.
The two, who met through mutual friends, were passionate about reading
and children's issues. Together they bought the house in Brentwood that
Riordan still calls home and spent hours helping out at the downtown
restaurant, the Original Pantry, that Riordan purchased.</TE>
<TE>   But tragedy came as well. Riordan's son, Billy, was 22, fluent in
French, filled with the same sense of humor as his father, when he died
in a scuba diving accident on the East Coast. "He was picking up
shellfish to cook for his friends," Riordan recalls, his voice thick with
pain at the memory.</TE>
<TE>   Several years later, in 1982, he lost his daughter, Carol, at 19. She
died of complications from anorexia and bulimia, according to her death
certificate. Her death was devastating for the entire family. "One of the
things we do in dealing with any tragedy is, if we work, we put ourselves
more into our work," observes Jill Riordan Harris, 57, who is now
remarried and lives in Malibu with her pediatrician husband. She
remembers her ex-husband being "very strong. He was stronger about this
than I was."</TE>
<TE>He Emerged as a Political Player</TE>
<TE>   It was a decade when Riordan's life was changing in several ways. He
was emerging as a political player in the city. He loaned $300,000 to Los
Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley's unsuccessful run for governor. Despite the
fact that Bradley was a Democrat, the Riordans were both enthusiastic
supporters of him. Riordan was also getting involved in a more direct
way. He was appointed to the Coliseum Commission and the Recreation and
Parks Commission.</TE>
<TE>   And Riordan helped run the controversial but successful 1986 campaign
to oust state Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Bird.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's entrance into the 1993 mayoral race was the brainstorm of
Wardlaw and his wife, Kim, now a federal appeals court judge. Bill
Wardlaw, a staunch Democrat, was so convinced that Riordan would be a
good mayor that he ran the successful campaign even though his candidate
was a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Riordan had separated from his second wife, Jill. He
was just settling into a relationship with Nancy Daly, the woman who
would become his third wife.</TE>
<TE>   Deeply involved in foster care issues, Daly had met Riordan in the
'80s, when she sought funding from the Riordan Foundation, the conduit
for his charitable giving. Both were married at the time and they didn't
start dating until the early 1990s, when they were separated from their
spouses.</TE>
<TE>   "I was not excited about his running for mayor," recalls Daly, 60. "I
thought I had had my public life." Daly would eventually go through a
contentious divorce from Bob Daly, now the chairman of the Los Angeles
Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Nancy Daly Riordan is active in her husband's campaign for
governor, she was not a prominent figure during that first mayoral
campaign. She did, however, accompany him to his first fund-raiser at the
home of friends.</TE>
<TE>   "He was brand new at it," she say. "It was very dear. Slick, he
wasn't. He held some notes in his right hand and held my hand in his left
hand, and he said he was running for mayor."</TE>
<TE>   He swept into office despite the late revelation of three
alcohol-related arrests, the latest in 1975. Riordan says that at the
time, he and his business associates sometimes drank heavily after work.
Today, he says, he drinks "sometimes a glass or two of wine at night.
Most of the time, I don't have anything."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters and detractors will argue into the next decade over how
much he accomplished as mayor, but his quirky style is burnished into the
minds of all in the city. He was the mayor who, even in his 60s, could
bike-ride 30 miles at a stretch but also shamelessly catnapped between
meetings.</TE>
<TE>   Uninterested in the details of city governance and embroiled in a
generally combative relationship with the City Council, he had little
desire to deal with its members. But when he was interested in an issue,
he forged relationships even with those on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "He is so unlike a politician," says Alice Callaghan, an advocate for
the homeless whose access to Riordan included his home phone number.
"Every politician in town, you cross them once and they won't talk to you
again. Riordan, he's willing to disagree with you on the issues he
disagrees with you on and work with you on the issues he does agree with
you on."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan thought about running for governor in 1998 but, among other
things, he was getting married. His wife wasn't too keen on starting a
marriage as her husband was starting a campaign for governor. The two
were married on Valentine's Day by their friend, Kim Wardlaw, in a civil
ceremony in Sun Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan had gotten his first marriage annulled by the church. But his
second marriage was not annulled when he married Daly. On the eve of his
wedding, his good friend Cardinal Roger Mahony, the archbishop of Los
Angeles, released a statement lamenting the third marriage, which the
church does not recognize as valid.</TE>
<TE>   In deference to the church's view of his marriage, Riordan does not
receive the Sacrament of Holy Communion when he attends Mass, usually at
St. Monica's in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in God, I believe in honesty, I believe in helping people,"
he says. "And to me those are the most important Catholic traits."</TE>
<TE>   His faith has helped him through some of the most wrenching moments of
his life, including the deaths of his children. "Probably my religion, my
beliefs, my character said, 'You have three children and family that are
left.' I have other people who need me."</TE>
<TE>   His surviving daughters keep a relatively low profile. Kathleen, 42,
an animal welfare activist, sits on the city's Animal Regulation
Commission. Patricia, 41, worked in television on the business side but
now raises her children with her husband and lives on the Westside. Mary
Beth, 44 and a resident of Santa Barbara, is a mother and the manager of
her husband's chiropractic business.</TE>
<TE>   As Riordan rounds a curving street in his neighborhood, he comes upon
two chimney sweeps leaving a house. Their faces light up when they see
him.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Riordan, you're awesome!" one exclaims.</TE>
<TE>   "What's your name?" Riordan asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Billy," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my son's name," says Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   He sometimes speaks of his son in the present tense.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times, if I go into a debate or something, I'll think of
Billy and Carol, and I'll say they're looking at me, and even if I look
like a damn fool, they'll still be on my side." He laughs softly. "I
really do that."</TE>
<TE>Touring the State in Luxury Campaign Bus</TE>
<TE>   He has spent part of the primary campaign touring the state in a
luxurious bus with black leather upholstery. From this moving
headquarters, he hits conventions, factories and open air markets. He
makes tacos at a taqueria in Santa Ana, inquires about wages at the
Fender guitar factory in Corona, and watches in fascination as a worker
sorts oranges on a rumbling assembly line in a Riverside citrus packing
plant.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan began this campaign relying on his personality to make his
mark. But as the campaign has progressed and as Davis has started
attacking him, he has had to adjust. Any illusion that this campaign
would be easier than his mayoral ones has been quickly dissipated. The
stakes are higher. And the architect of his mayoral campaigns, Wardlaw,
is not on board in any official way.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the issue of his age and his health.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Riordan underwent radiation to treat prostate cancer. Two
months before he entered the governor's race, his doctors declared he had
a "clean bill of health" and an excellent prognosis.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the father of my children, and I care about his own personal
health," says first wife Genie Riordan, 70, who has donated $25,000 to
his campaign. "After he made his decision, I said, 'I'm concerned about
what the stress is going to do to you.' He thanked me. He's a person who
needs to be active."</TE>
<TE>   For Riordan, health is just another issue to be shrugged off--in this
case by citing his exercise regimen. (He bikes, ice skates and recently
gave up smoking cigars.) On this, as on other subjects, he is neither
reflective nor inclined to self-doubt. He tackles problems but does not
dwell on failure or loss. He moves forward.</TE>
<TE>   "I distinguish myself by how much I do today and tomorrow, not by what
I did yesterday," says Riordan. "It's about what I can accomplish every
day."</TE>

<HD>SEC Pushes for Fuller Disclosure</HD>
<DH>Securities: Officials feel pressure to restore investor confidence
after Enron's fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Federal regulators proposed rules Wednesday that would force
companies to disclose vast new amounts of financial information and to
release that data much sooner to the public.</LD>
<LD>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, under heavy congressional and
public pressure to restore confidence in a financial system shaken by the
scandal-tainted collapses of Enron Corp. and Global Crossing Ltd., said
it wants companies to notify investors more promptly about changes in
their financial condition.</LD>
<LD>   The agency also wants corporate officers and directors to disclose
personal purchases or sales of company stock immediately rather than a
year after the fact, as is sometimes the case now.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC proposals, announced by Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, came as
legislators in Washington unveiled several bills that also are designed
to improve financial disclosure and tighten accounting regulations. The
SEC and legislative proposals overlap in many areas.</TE>
<TE>   To help the SEC step up regulation, some in Congress are proposing a
45% boost in the agency's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the proposed SEC changes--which could take effect without
congressional approval--are aimed directly at stitching up loopholes that
allowed Enron executives to mask both the depth of the company's problems
and their own financial self-dealing.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal, for example, would require companies to immediately
reveal if their boards of directors waive a corporate ethics policy.
Enron's board suspended such a policy to allow then-Chief Financial
Officer Andrew S. Fastow to run several controversial outside
partnerships from which he reaped at least $30 million, according to a
company report.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC has made a list of everything Enron is guilty of doing and
tried to figure out a way to close as many of the loopholes as it can,"
said Roy Smith, a New York University finance professor.</TE>
<TE>   Securities experts praised the basic thrust of the SEC plan, which is
to have companies present a far more complete overview of their financial
conditions--and to do so on a timely basis so that problems can be
spotted before they balloon into market-shaking events.</TE>
<TE>   However, critics cautioned that the SEC plan would be only one step in
improving a financial infrastructure whose gaping holes have been laid
bare by the Enron debacle. They also pointed out that it would take the
SEC several months to write its new rules and invite public comment. The
final version could differ markedly from what is initially promised,
experts noted.</TE>
<TE>   Among the changes the SEC proposed:</TE>
<TE>   * The "significant-event" forms that companies are required to file
notifying investors about major developments would be expanded to include
many more types of events. For example, the plan calls for the filing of
these so-called 8K forms to disclose a credit-rating downgrade or a
"lockout" of transactions in a firm's 401(k) retirement plan. The forms
would have to be filed within two business days.</TE>
<TE>   * Companies would have to file quarterly and annual financial reports
more quickly. Quarterly reports, for example, would be due within 30 days
of the end of a quarter, rather than the current 45.</TE>
<TE>   * Companies would be required to give a more thorough explanation of
significant issues in the portion of financial reports where management
gives a written analysis of the company's condition. The goal is to have
companies go beyond pure numbers, which critics say can be used to
obscure reality.</TE>
<TE>   * Disclosure of stock purchases or sales by corporate officers,
directors and major shareholders would be revamped. Currently, their
disclosures typically come up to 40 days after a trade is made, and in
some cases can be filed a year later.</TE>
<TE>   Investors watch insider stock sales closely because wholesale dumping
of shares can be a sign of looming financial trouble. To ensure the
delivery of accurate data, the SEC would require companies, rather than
individuals, to file the reports. The commission also is considering
mandating electronic filing, which would make the reports more accessible
to investors.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC is considering forcing such disclosures within two days of a
stock trade, said Alan Beller, chief of the agency's corporate finance
division.</TE>
<TE>   Of the proposals overall, Beller said: "It's a first step, but it's
not a modest step. These rules, if they are adopted, will be the most
significant changes in our corporate-disclosure system since the '80s."</TE>
<TE>   The ideas drew some criticism. "I would have hoped that a more
comprehensive analysis would have been done after the whole Enron
situation had played itself out, because nobody knows the full story
today about what happened and who's responsible," said Ira Lee Sorkin, a
New York securities lawyer and former SEC official. "I'm not saying [the
SEC plan] is bad, but to do it piecemeal after every new revelation is
not the way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Others defended the plan, saying it was a good proposal that would
yield immediate benefits to investors. "My reaction is, hats off to the
SEC," said Richard Breeden, a former SEC chairman. "They're saying,
'Right now, there are some holes and we're going to step out and fill
them.' "</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, some members of Congress praised the SEC announcement,
but also made it clear that they plan to press ahead with legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, House Republicans on Wednesday introduced bills that would
mandate increased financial disclosure by corporations and provide for
greater oversight of accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   "We're addressing the core issues that will prevent future Enrons, but
we're not going to crush the entire business sector by putting government
in the boardroom," said Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), chairman of the
House Financial Services Committee.</TE>
<TE>   But the bills drew criticism from Democrats who said they didn't go
far enough. Portions of the bills, however, appear to enjoy bipartisan
support, such as a proposal to increase the SEC's annual budget from $480
million to $700 million.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcome the SEC's efforts to begin making improvement in public
disclosure under their existing statutory authority," said Rep. John J.
LaFalce of New York, a top Democrat on the House Financial Services
Committee. But "this is only one of many areas in which reforms should be
pursued, both by Congress and the SEC," he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial proposals previously announced by Pitt
is the creation of a new panel to oversee the accounting industry. It
appears to be very similar to the plan put forth by House Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Noting Pitt's close ties to the accounting industry from his prior
stint as a securities lawyer, some critics have characterized his call
for a new accounting-regulation board as aimed chiefly at helping his
former clients. A key issue is the level of control the accounting
industry would have over the board.</TE>
<TE>   A new proposal put forth by House Republicans on Wednesday would
prohibit executives from buying or selling company stock during any
period where 401(k) participants are unable to buy or sell securities.</TE>
<TE>   Rank-and-file workers at Enron and Global Crossing were locked out of
making trades in their 401(k) plans for lengthy periods before the
companies collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   LaFalce said the GOP-sponsored proposals don't go far enough to
correct the problems raised by Enron's collapse. For example, the
Republican plan wouldn't prohibit accounting firms from providing
consulting services to the same corporate client.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican bill only goes as far as the auditing industry has
already announced that it will go voluntarily, allowing auditors to
continue to earn significant non-audit fees from their audit clients," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In another legislative move, a bipartisan group of senators on
Wednesday introduced legislation that would require companies claiming a
tax deduction for stock options to report that expense on their books.
Similar proposals in the past have been defeated by business lobbies.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate proposal, Pitt asked the New York Stock Exchange and
Nasdaq to study ways to boost corporate ethics and to ensure compliance
with securities laws. In a letter to the markets, Pitt asked that they
examine whether companies should be required to adopt ethics codes for
officers and directors, institute "ethical training" and set up
compliance programs to make sure rules are followed.</TE>

<DH>To win an Oscar nomination, visual effects specialists defend their
work at a ritual called the Bake-Off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P. J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standing on stage, Stan Winston braced himself to defend his latest
creation--the fuzzy, dancing robotic teddy bear that starred last year in
the film "A.I. Artificial Intelligence."</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of his rivals and fellow members of the visual effects branch
of the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences sat before him. Their
job on this night was to pick the three films that would be considered
for an Academy Award.</LD>
<LD>   Winston, the man behind the Terminator in "The Terminator" and the
aliens in "Aliens," had been here before. To win an Oscar, he first must
win the crowd at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills and prove
that no computer-generated demon or crashing Black Hawk helicopter holds
a candle to Teddy.</LD>
<TE>   "There are far more points of motion in Teddy than any dinosaur,"
Winston bragged.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the audience, Oscar competitor Dan Taylor--the animation
supervisor who helped build the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park III"--ground
his teeth. Minutes later, when it was his turn to stand beneath the
20-foot Oscar statue, Taylor was as catty as any Hollywood starlet.</TE>
<TE>   "Our dinosaur could devour a teddy bear in one gulp," he shot back.
"Our spinosaurus kicks Teddy any day."</TE>
<TE>   Far from the red-carpet glamour and sequined sparkles of Oscar night
in March is a down-and-dirty fight where the technicians behind the big
screen's illusions wage an increasingly high-stakes war. Their Oscar
rules over robotics, miniatures, computer-generated visuals and wildly
destructive explosions, which increasingly are the key to a film's
success. Their academy category, once an occasional honor, now sits on
par with best actor and best picture.</TE>
<TE>   The path to glory started last week at an annual ritual that, in
un-Oscar-like fashion, is called the Bake-Off. It's a rare process for
the academy, whose top-tier categories such as best picture are nominated
by voters from the comfort of home.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike actors, directors and composers, whose work usually speaks for
itself in a film, visual effects require hours of explanation about the
grand illusions that, if successful, are invisible and spectacular at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   Out of 248 films released in the United States last year, only eight
of the flashiest are chosen to be here by an executive panel of academy
voters who work in the visual effects industry. The nominees will have
this one chance to explain their art, defend their science and proclaim
their methodology better, quicker, faster than all those other cheap
gimmicks on-screen.</TE>
<TE>   The dress is always casual--most academy voters opt for rumpled khakis
and Gap shirts--but the competition can be over the top. Although it's
fine to wear last season's fashion, woe be it to anyone who dares to
present last year's technology.</TE>
<TE>Event Draws an Overflow Crowd</TE>
<TE>   This year's Bake-Off--held in the packed 1,000-seat Goldwyn
theater--drew hundreds of fans, who scrambled to grab a chair and cheer
for their favorite computer scientists.</TE>
<TE>   Before the debate began, one organizer picked up a microphone and made
a plea to the crowd: "There are not enough seats for the people who have
to actually do something tonight. Your wives, your girlfriends, your
future ex-wives, they all need to either stand or move, please."</TE>
<TE>   Caren Dohen, a 23-year-old college student and aspiring visual effects
artist, refused to move. She had made the trek from San Francisco, and
she wasn't leaving until she met her heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Dohen scanned the crowd, looking for famous faces. There was Winston,
who has three statues including one for the original "Jurassic Park,"
looking dapper in slacks and a sport coat.</TE>
<TE>   Across the aisle was scholarly-looking Eric Brevig, who won last year
for "Gladiator" and headed up this year's team for "Pearl Harbor." Nearby
was Jim Rygiel, the visual effects supervisor for "The Lord of the Rings"
and an Oscar virgin, who hours before had flown into town from New
Zealand--and looked the rumpled part.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, there was Dennis Muren, one of the wizards behind the
"Star Wars" series. He has more Oscars in his home than any other living
person--eight so far. This year, he's allied with Winston for "A.I.
Artificial Intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Dohen spied Muren, sitting in an aisle seat and waiting for
the program to begin. Leaping forward, she grabbed his hand and shook it
furiously.</TE>
<TE>   "It's you!" she gushed. "Sir, you're a genius!"</TE>
<TE>   Muren, 55, whose wisps of thinning gray hair hang over his shoulders
like a cape, smiled sheepishly.</TE>
<TE>   "Visual effects are the driver of Hollywood," said Tom Atkin, head of
the trade group Visual Effects Society. "We can make a movie with a crap
plot huge, and we can kill a movie with a decent story."</TE>
<TE>   The rising status of visual effects follows the enormous amount of
money spent creating them and the huge crowds they can draw.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. spent about $125 million to make "Harry Potter"--with
nearly half that set aside to cover the cost of elaborate effects such as
the whooshing, broomstick-riding game of Quidditch. Just in the U.S., the
movie has pulled in nearly $313 million so far, the top-grossing film of
2001.</TE>
<TE>   This year's other candidates for the visual effects nomination weren't
far behind. Fire demons and elaborate, elfish sets helped "The Lord of
the Rings" gross about $256 million so far. "Pearl Harbor," with its
computer-generated scenes of the Japanese bombing, has nabbed $200
million. And "Jurassic Park III's" few hundred dinosaurs pulled in $181
million.</TE>
<TE>Dinosaur Causes Cringes, Grins</TE>
<TE>   The other four nominees were "Cats &amp; Dogs," "A.I.," "The Fast and the
Furious" and "Black Hawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   The audience cringed as a scaly tyrannosaurus lumbered across the
screen. Human actors became snacks for the dinosaur, which growled at the
camera with gore stuck like popcorn kernels between its 4-foot teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Enormous speakers filled the air with rumbles, seeming to shove the
crowd inside the reptile's mouth with each crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, who has been nominated previously but has yet to win an Oscar,
grinned with relief. As the "Jurassic Park" clip ended with a
bloodcurdling scream, the lights slowly warmed the room.</TE>
<TE>   "Time to go," whispered Taylor to his team, who strode up to the stage
amid warm applause.</TE>
<TE>   They have exactly five minutes. Go one second over and a fluorescent
red light bulb in front of the podium pops on--the visual bouncer yanking
the verbose offstage.</TE>
<TE>   "Titanic" director and visual effects maven James Cameron stood on
this stage several years ago and, deciding that he needed more time to
explain his vision, unscrewed the bulb. He talked. And talked. And
talked. For more than 30 minutes. He won that year.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the bulb is glued into its socket.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor touched on the "Jurassic Park III" crew's desire to surpass the
effects work of the previous two films. He pointed out the synthesis of
the physical and the virtual. A computerized reptile can flex and move.
Its skin can wrinkle and sweat. Yet its feet can't crush real grass. The
solution: Use a robotic leg to walk through the forest, and attach the
rest of the creature's body back in the computer lab.</TE>
<TE>   Out in the audience, one computer artist rolled his eyes and whispered
to a neighbor, "Oh, please. We've seen this stuff for years. Evolution is
not art."</TE>
<TE>   Even the academy wrestled for decades with how, or if, it should
recognize this field.</TE>
<TE>   By the 1930s, effects technicians routinely worked on teams that were
devoted to building visual and sound "tricks." In the view of the
academy, such effects were part of the physical production--not the
artistic vision--of the film, a tool often on par with the set caterers.</TE>
<TE>Debating Their Take on Reality</TE>
<TE>   The academy board of governors didn't establish an official visual
effects category until 1963 to honor Joseph L. Mankiewicz's
"Cleopatra"--particularly for the classic scene when Elizabeth Taylor
enters Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there was no guarantee that an award would be handed out each
year.</TE>
<TE>   Visual effects kept improving, using better miniatures and uniting
both photographic and animation elements in a single shot.</TE>
<TE>   With the evolution of the computer, artists and computer scientists
shifted from creating background elements to pushing their work to the
forefront.</TE>
<TE>   A turning point came with the 1989 undersea drama "The Abyss" and the
liquid column that morphs into a face. Far more than a prop, this was one
of Hollywood's first virtual creatures, an unearthly entity that could
help realize a writer's work and a director's vision on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "The effects are icing on the cake," said "Harry Potter" director
Chris Columbus. "When you're dealing with 800 or 900 effects shots in one
movie, of course, that's a lot of icing."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 the visual effects community convinced the academy it deserved
its own chapter, which would ensure an annual award. The branch was
formed with nearly 130 effects workers. Today, there are 230 members. All
work in the visual effects field in some capacity--pyrotechnic gurus,
model builders, matte painters, optical experts, computer software
designers, digital artists. The branch makes the initial cut from eight
to three Oscar nominees at the Bake-Off.</TE>
<TE>   "Nearly all the other categories let their branch pick five nominees,"
said Rich Miller, award administration director for the academy. "It's a
holdover from the past. I'm sure the visual effects branch would love to
get five spots, but they're just happy they have a guarantee of getting
recognized on TV."</TE>
<TE>   Hours passed at the Samuel Goldwyn Theater and still the film clips
rolled. Like college professors, the Bake-Off nominees debated their take
on reality and used the strengths of their software programs and
mechanical details as ammunition. Was the virtual hair on the virtual
kids in "Harry Potter" more revolutionary than the hyper-reality race car
shots of "The Fast and the Furious"?</TE>
<TE>Floating Candles Pose Danger</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter" visual effects supervisor Rob Legato said the team
built a contraption to float a sea of real candles above the dining hall
in Hogwarts school. Everything worked great--until the lit candles began
to drop on the heads of the child actors. Legato joked: "We switched to
C.G. [computer-generated] candles. I don't know what the fuss was about.
They had hundreds of kids. It's not like they were going to miss one or
two."</TE>
<TE>   It's well after 11 p.m. when the last film explosion fades to black.
Yawning, the crowd shuffles out of the theater. Academy members sneak
peaks at each other's blue ballots, curious to see who picked what.</TE>
<TE>   No one had dared to leave, as this was the only chance for members of
the academy's visual effects branch to cast their vote.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, a pair of stern employees from PricewaterhouseCoopers
guarded a cardboard ballot box. If voters tried to sneak out early, their
ballots were destroyed immediately.</TE>
<TE>   Fans, overwhelmed by the lush landscapes of Tolkien's Middle Earth,
swarmed around Rygiel of "The Lord of the Rings" team. Politely squeezing
through the crush, Muren made his way to the ballot box and cast his
vote.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday at 4:45 a.m., Muren rolled out of bed, turned on his
computer and logged onto the academy's Web site. After an hour of
scanning for clues, the news hit.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord of the Rings" and "Pearl Harbor" were in. So was "A.I."
Muren's phone immediately began to ring.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Troops Withdraw After Gaza Raid</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Five Palestinians die in the biggest ground operation of
the conflict. Army says arrests will help it trace launching of rockets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARJORIE MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EREZ CROSSING, Israel
</DL>
<LD>The Israeli army pulled out of the Palestinian-controlled town of
Beit Hanoun late Wednesday, after the most sweeping ground operation in
the Gaza Strip since fighting began nearly 17 months ago.</LD>
<LD>   Five Palestinian police officers were killed and 18 people were
arrested in the raid, which Israel said was a response to Sunday's launch
of two rockets into the Negev desert by the militant Islamic group Hamas.</LD>
<LD>   Although the homemade rockets fell in open fields, Israel described
their use as an escalation of the conflict.</LD>
<TE>   Defense Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer had vowed a different kind of
military response, but the operation looked much like previous Israeli
assaults on West Bank cities, fueling criticism that the government has
neither a military nor a political solution to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The operation began Tuesday night when the Israeli army seized three
towns and a refugee camp with armored and infantry units. The troops
withdrew from three of the areas early Wednesday but then took up fixed
positions and conducted a house-to-house search in Beit Hanoun, a Hamas
stronghold in the northern Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   Zohour Naieem, whose husband, Rezek, was arrested, said in a telephone
interview that her house had been surrounded by Israeli armored vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of soldiers raided the house with dogs and searched every
room," she said. "They put me and the children in one room and my husband
in another with his hands taped together. The children shouted and cried
in panic."</TE>
<TE>   She insisted that her husband, a former construction worker in Israel,
had no connection to any political group.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Brig. Gen. Israel Ziv said that many of those arrested were
responsible for launching the Kassam-2 rockets and that weapons and
intelligence were gathered in the operation. But Israeli television
quoted security sources as saying that key people had escaped.</TE>
<TE>   And the army sent a smaller force back into the central Gaza town of
Deir al Balah early today after it said mortars were fired from there
into Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the main goal of its Gaza operation was to find the
manufacturing centers and launch sites for the 122-millimeter Kassam-2
rockets, which Hamas threatens to aim at Israeli cities in response to
Israel's aerial attacks on the Palestinian territories.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrests we made, as well as other people rounded up, will help us
piece together the picture and tighten the grip on this infrastructure of
activists and, in my estimation, on the manufacturing infrastructure,"
Ziv said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian leaders countered that the only thing that will silence
attacks on Israel is if the Jewish state ends its siege of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   "If Israel wants to stop these attacks, it should withdraw from the
Palestinian territories and return to the negotiating table," said Jihad
Wazir, the Palestinian Authority's deputy planning minister.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli analysts said Wednesday that no one is putting forward a
serious political or military blueprint for ending what has become a war
of attrition--at least 843 Palestinians and 256 Israelis have been killed
since September 2000--and that both sides are gradually escalating the
cycle of attack and counterattack.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat has been confined to the
West Bank city of Ramallah for more than two months while Israel has
attacked his government and security installations. He remains unwilling
or unable to control first suicide and now rocket attacks on Israel while
Israel's siege of the Palestinian territories continues.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners in Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's coalition
government, meanwhile, have rejected European efforts to intercede, as
well as a plan that Foreign Minister Shimon Peres crafted with
Palestinian negotiator Ahmed Korei. Sharon has refused to negotiate with
Arafat unless the Palestinian attacks stop.</TE>
<TE>   "We bomb the same targets with the object of humiliating Arafat and
forcing him to do something, which has no effect," said Israeli strategic
analyst Joseph Alpher.</TE>
<TE>   "We move in, arrest and kill some people . . . but what we do has
relatively little impact in terms of punishing, deterring or displaying
force. We do not have a military response that will change the situation,
and the Sharon government consciously avoids offering any political
response," Alpher said.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, he said, Arafat has not laid out a plan for "either military
victory or for peace."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told Congress that
Arafat did take one step the U.S. had sought: accepting responsibility on
behalf of the Palestinian Authority for an attempt to smuggle in 50 tons
of arms from Iran. But Arafat did not take personal responsibility and
continued to deny prior knowledge of the smuggling.</TE>
<TE>   Divisions within the Palestinian leadership appeared to open Tuesday
when Arafat had a violent argument with his West Bank security chief,
Col. Jibril Rajoub.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoub tried to repair the damage with a pledge of loyalty published
in Wednesday's Palestinian daily newspaper Al Quds.</TE>
<TE>   With the situation on the ground going from bad to worse, Avi Dichter,
the chief of Israel's Shin Bet security service, told a parliamentary
committee Tuesday that the government should consider building physical
barriers around Jerusalem and between Israel and the West Bank to reduce
Palestinian terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a physical separation between Israel and the Palestinian
territories has been put forward by politicians, but this is the first
time it has been proposed by a high-level security official. Sharon has
rejected the idea as a de facto concession of the West Bank to the
Palestinians.</TE>

<HD>Milosevic Sneers at Court, Challenges Its Legitimacy</HD>
<DH>Tribunal: Judge says panel has already rejected those arguments.
Prosecution provides a sketch of one young victim's ordeal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE
</DL>
<LD>After nearly two days of listening to charges that he led a
blood-drenched campaign of terror in the Balkans, Slobodan Milosevic on
Wednesday angrily challenged the legality of the international court
trying him for war crimes.</LD>
<LD>   The former Yugoslav president told a three-judge panel at the end of
Wednesday's court session in the Netherlands that his arrest was illegal
and that the trial violated his human rights. In his first statements
since his trial began Tuesday, Milosevic also accused Carla Del Ponte,
chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia, of orchestrating a "parallel trial" and "lynching" in the
media.</LD>
<LD>   "I challenge the very legality of this tribunal," Milosevic declared.
"This tribunal does not have the competence to try me. . . . This is of
prime importance for international law and justice in general."</LD>
<TE>   Chief Judge Richard May interrupted, reminding Milosevic that the U.N.
court had rejected those same arguments in a pretrial hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "The matters on which you are choosing to address us are matters on
which we have already ruled, as you would know if you had taken the
trouble to read our decisions," said May, a dry, no-nonsense Briton.
"Your views on the tribunal are now completely irrelevant to this trial."</TE>
<TE>   The defendant's protest and the judge's retort set the stage for
Milosevic's defense argument, scheduled for today. The former strongman
is expected to deliver a counterattack full of the combative fervor that
marked his years in power and his months in disgrace.</TE>
<TE>   Hinting at one line of defense, Milosevic complained Wednesday that
the case against him is based on evidence provided and manipulated by
British intelligence services.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know intelligence services give out selective information and
details," Milosevic said.</TE>
<TE>   Although he sneers at the court and may do his best to destabilize the
proceedings, Milosevic made it clear Wednesday that he has prepared a
rebuttal to charges of genocide and other crimes he allegedly committed
during conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo during the
1990s. He faces a total of 66 counts in the three indictments.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors on Wednesday focused mainly on the indictment involving
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. They
alleged that Milosevic's forces used systematic executions, sexual
assaults and terror during the forced deportation of about 850,000 ethnic
Albanians during the first six months of 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors called Milosevic the callous mastermind of the operation
and said evidence also implicates him in an attempted cover-up in which
soldiers dug up mass graves and moved the corpses to secret burial sites
near Belgrade, the Yugoslav and Serbian capital. Investigators discovered
the bodies last year.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Dirk Ryneveld used maps, videos and photos to recount the
saga of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, whose forced exodus into neighboring
Albania, Macedonia and Yugoslavia's smaller republic, Montenegro, caused
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to unleash a punishing air
campaign against the Milosevic regime. The images showed hills strewn
with corpses, refugees bent against cold winds, bedraggled columns herded
by Serbian troops.</TE>
<TE>   Ryneveld said a witness whom he identified as a "senior international
official" will testify that Milosevic, when asked about the abuses
inflicted on the refugees, responded "that the people he had seen were on
a picnic."</TE>
<TE>   In general, the prosecutor's opening statement offered little
information about much-anticipated testimony from witnesses who were part
of the Milosevic regime and are crucial to connecting him to crimes by
his troops. That may be because prosecutors are still putting the final
touches on the witness list.</TE>
<TE>   The Kosovo case seems the most straightforward because Milosevic was
the president of Yugoslavia at the time. His place atop the chain of
command is therefore clear. As for the two other cases, he wielded vast
power in Croatia and Bosnia while president of the neighboring Serbia
republic, but he was not the official commander in chief of the forces
accused of abuses there.</TE>
<TE>   In Kosovo, as in the other cases, there was a distinct plan and
pattern to the brutality against non-Serbs, Ryneveld said. Witnesses will
take the court on a heart-wrenching visit back to the killing fields, he
said. The prosecutor sketched the ordeal of one witness, a survivor of
the massacre of seven women and 12 children in April 1999 in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   The victims took refuge in a basement in one of the housing compounds
common among extended Albanian families. But Serbian and Yugoslav
soldiers stormed in and shot them all, according to the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   A 10-year-old boy survived the gunfire. He realized that his toddler
sister also was alive, but she was trapped under the corpses of their
mother and cousins, according to the prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "He could hear her calling to him," Ryneveld said. "Because he was
wounded himself, he was unable to lift his mother's body to save his
sister."</TE>
<TE>   The boy got out of the house before the soldiers burned it to the
ground, their victims along with it, Ryneveld said.</TE>
<TE>   "The memories still haunt him," he said. "That boy will testify to
this tribunal about those horrific events. . . These people are not just
statistics. They are innocent civilians who by no stretch of the
imagination could be considered legitimate military targets."</TE>
<TE>   As the prosecutor spoke in a quiet courtroom, Milosevic leaned forward
behind the defense table, looking intent, seeming to strain toward the
moment when he will get his chance to respond.</TE>

<HD>Shortfalls in Africa's Battle on Malaria</HD>
<DH>Health: Many nations are switching to cheaper, largely ineffective
alternatives as the disease grows drug-resistant, an aid group says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya
</DL>
<LD>As African countries decide how to fight a resurgence of malaria,
many are switching to drugs that are largely ineffective, a report by the
aid group Doctors Without Borders warned Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel like we're watching a train wreck," Daniel Berman, an
official with the Paris-based group, told a news conference here.</LD>
<LD>   Malaria is the leading killer in many sub-Saharan countries, with
children accounting for 90% of the estimated 1.8 million deaths each
year. Across the continent, public health experts are debating how to
replace chloroquine, to which the malaria parasite has become resistant.</LD>
<TE>   Bowing to cost pressures, several African countries have switched to
cheaper alternative drugs even though research has shown that they are no
more effective than the drugs they're replacing.</TE>
<TE>   The report by Doctors Without Borders, which is meant to help guide
African countries in their malaria policies, said the most effective
treatment should include artemisinin. The drug, an ancient Chinese
remedy, is derived from the wormwood plant.</TE>
<TE>Donors' Help Needed</TE>
<TE>   The report's author, Dr. Jean-Marie Kindermans, said artemisinin
derivatives have been used successfully for malaria in Asia for more than
a decade. They are fast-acting and work well with other combinations of
drugs, and no resistance has yet been reported, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of the drug is prohibitive for most African countries, which
rely on international donors for money to buy medicines. An adult dose of
artemisinin costs $1.30, compared with 25 cents for a dose of a less
effective treatment.</TE>
<TE>   But Kindermans said switching to artemisinin is affordable if donors
are willing to help. He said it would cost $19 million to prescribe the
more effective artemisinin combinations in five East African countries:
Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda and Tanzania.</TE>
<TE>   Several African countries recently abandoned chloroquine, which was
developed by Germans in the 1930s, after realizing that the drug was
ineffective in up to 80% of malaria cases. But the newer drugs, sold
under the brand name Fansidar, did not fare much better, the report said.
In Uganda, they have proved to be ineffective for 60% of malaria
patients, it said.</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing more effective drugs are available and not being able to give
them to my patient has been so difficult," said Diane Cheynier, a
physician at a Doctors Without Borders clinic in Burundi. "Treatment
exists that can avoid people dying unnecessarily. With the help of
donors, African governments can avoid the fatal error of going to
stopgap, Band-Aid solutions."</TE>
<TE>Disease's Toll Increases</TE>
<TE>   As the disease's resistance to drugs has increased, deaths from
malaria have soared across Africa. Nearly half of Burundi's 6.5 million
people contracted the disease in an epidemic that broke out a little more
than a year ago, killing thousands of people. In Tanzania, malaria
accounts for 300,000 deaths a year, according to government figures.</TE>
<TE>   Berman said the World Health Organization and the U.S. Agency for
International Development, which help African governments fight malaria,
had not done enough to promote the more effective Chinese treatment.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. official said Wednesday that the United States was "in the
mainstream" with its approach of supporting the current malaria treatment
policies of African governments.</TE>
<TE>   WHO officials could not be reached for comment. But Tuesday, a day
before Doctors Without Borders released its report, the U.N. agency
posted a statement on its Web site recommending use of the Chinese remedy
in Africa.</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Currency Plunges</HD>
<DH>Finance: 24% drop comes as rate controls are abandoned in a bid to
reassure investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela
</DL>
<LD>The national currency plunged against the U.S. dollar Wednesday
after President Hugo Chavez abandoned exchange rate controls to try to
stem capital flight and restore investor confidence in Venezuela's ailing
economy.</LD>
<LD>   The bolivar fell 24%, closing at 980.50 to the dollar, compared with
792.50 on Friday, the last trading day. Economists have said the bolivar
was overvalued by as much as 30%.</LD>
<LD>   The central bank will sell dollars to banks through an auction as part
of the new currency exchange system, said Domingo Maza Zavala, the bank's
director. It will auction $60 million a day starting Monday, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Reopening after a holiday weekend, several Caracas exchange houses and
banks postponed dollar sales Wednesday to wait for the price to
stabilize.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez announced the surprise decision to abandon a controlled
devaluation scheme and let the currency float freely late Tuesday. He
also announced a 7% cut in government spending to help close a projected
$8-billion budget deficit that threatens the oil-dependent economy.</TE>
<TE>   The measures reflect a new economic reality of low oil prices, capital
flight and investor jitters toward Latin America amid Argentina's
financial crisis and the slumping global economy after the terrorist
attacks on the U.S., Chavez said.</TE>
<TE>   International Monetary Fund spokesman Thomas Dawson praised
Venezuela's decision to abandon exchange rate controls as a step "in the
right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela had spent more than $3 billion since November to prop up the
bolivar. Business groups wanted the currency devalued to make Venezuelan
exports more competitive.</TE>

<LD>A man hauled into court for publishing a book by U.S. linguist Noam
Chomsky was acquitted of spreading separatist propaganda.</LD>
<LD>   Fatih Tas had faced a one-year sentence for printing "American
Interventionism," a translation of a collection of essays and lectures by
Chomsky in which he criticizes Turkey's human rights record. Propaganda
charges often are leveled at writers who criticize Turkey's treatment of
its 12 million ethnic Kurds.</LD>
<LD>   At the hearing, attended by Chomsky, prosecutor Bekif Rayir Aldemir
said he "understood that the book did not seek to divide the Turkish
nation" and accepted the defense's demand for an acquittal.</LD>

<HD>40 Mecca Pilgrims Killed in Bus Crash</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia
</DL>
<LD>A bus carrying Muslims attending the annual hajj, or pilgrimage, to
Mecca collided with a truck in eastern Saudi Arabia, killing 40 pilgrims
and injuring 10 others, the state news agency reported.</LD>
<LD>   The bus, from the United Arab Emirates, was carrying more than 60
pilgrims. The Saudi Press Agency said 37 Pakistanis, a Saudi, an Egyptian
and a Syrian died after the bus caught fire on the road leading from the
Saudi-Emirates border.</LD>
<LD>   In Egypt, a pilgrim died and 12 others were injured Wednesday when
their vehicle bound for Mecca overturned on a road in the northern Sinai
Peninsula, police said.</LD>
<TE>   The hajj to Mecca, the birthplace of 7th century prophet Muhammad and
home of Islam's holiest shrine--is one of the pillars of Islam. Muslims
who are financially and physically able are obliged to make the
pilgrimage at least once.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Saudi authorities are expecting as many as 2.5 million
people to perform the hajj, which begins Wednesday and runs for four
days. The figure is well above estimates by travel agents, who had
predicted fewer pilgrims because of the war against terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government usually does not announce the number of security
forces it deploys in Mecca during the hajj, but it is believed to be in
the tens of thousands.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the influx of pilgrims, officials have mobilized 50,000
people to serve the visitors.</TE>
<TE>   About 35 Muslims died last year in a stampede while performing the
symbolic stoning-of-the-devil ritual, which occurs toward the hajj's end.</TE>

<LD>A former member of Japan's Red Army terrorist group was sentenced
to 12 years in prison today for hijacking a plane to North Korea in 1970,
court officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A spokeswoman for the Tokyo District Court announced the sentencing of
Yoshimi Tanaka, 53, who was arrested in 1996 in Cambodia. He was trying
to flee to Vietnam in a North Korean Embassy car. He was later extradited
to Japan from neighboring Thailand.</LD>
<LD>   Tanaka belonged to the Red Army at the time and was one of the accused
hijackers. The hijacking, the first in Japan, prompted Japan to enact a
law setting a maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the crime.</LD>

<LD>The Scottish Parliament voted to ban fox hunting, making Scotland
the first part of Britain to outlaw the centuries-old sport in which
hunters on horseback charge across fields chasing foxes with a pack of
hounds.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, calling for an end to hunts with dogs, was introduced in
March 2000. To support the bill, animal rights groups dressed up as
rabbits and foxes outside the Parliament in the capital, Edinburgh.</LD>

not an anti-cruelty bill but an anti-human bill."</LD>

<LD>Russia's Supreme Court dealt another blow to prosecutors seeking to
uphold a treason conviction against military journalist Grigory Pasko,
striking down a 1990 order that restricted contacts between members of
the military and foreigners.</LD>
<LD>   It was the court's second ruling in two days in favor of Pasko, 40,
who was sentenced late last year to four years in prison for collecting
material on secret military exercises to give to Japanese journalists. On
Tuesday, the court threw out a 1996 order that classified certain
information on the grounds that the Defense Ministry kept the order
itself secret.</LD>
<LD>   Pasko's lawyer said the rulings would strengthen Pasko's hand when the
Supreme Court considers his appeal. A date for that has not been set.</LD>

<HD>Lindh's Plea Is 'Not Guilty, Sir'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Outside court, the widow of a slain CIA agent calls for
treason charges against the accused American Talib.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.
</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh told a federal judge Wednesday he is "not guilty,
sir," but outside the courtroom, the widow of slain CIA agent Johnny
"Mike" Spann said the 21-year-old Californian should be charged with
treason and executed.</LD>
<LD>   The presence of Shannon Spann and her husband's parents at the
courthouse for his arraignment underscored the belief of many Americans
that, because Lindh allegedly rebuked his U.S. citizenship and chose to
fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan, he should be tried for betraying
his country--a charge that carries the death penalty. Lindh could face
multiple life prison terms if convicted of taking up arms against his
country, but none of the charges carries a possible death sentence.</LD>
<LD>   "My view today is certainly that he should have been charged with
treason," Shannon Spann said. "But I haven't had the chance to speak to
the prosecutors yet and to understand what goes into making that
decision."</LD>
<TE>   Asked if she thought a life sentence would be too light for Lindh if
he is convicted, Spann said: "Certainly I would have preferred the death
penalty myself."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Spann had attempted to interrogate Lindh when he was being held
at a makeshift prison in Afghanistan in late November. Shortly afterward,
a prison riot broke out and Spann was killed, becoming the first U.S.
combat casualty in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh has never been directly implicated in Spann's death. But
prosecutors have said they are still considering a charge of treason
against the young man from Marin County. A treason conviction carries the
death penalty, but such cases are very difficult to prove in court.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the courtroom, Lindh told U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III
that he understood the charges, which include conspiracy to kill
Americans overseas, in the 10-count grand jury indictment filed against
him. Asked how he was pleading, Lindh said simply: "Not guilty, sir."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the rest of the brief hearing dealt with procedural matters.
Ellis said he wanted to set a trial date for late summer.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors and defense attorneys filed a joint legal brief
proposing a mid-November start date.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers said they anticipated the need to conduct an
investigation overseas, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan and
possibly Yemen. Lindh had traveled to those countries to pursue his
religious studies in Islam, later allegedly joining an Osama bin Laden
terrorist training camp.</TE>
<TE>   But Ellis said November "is way too far" off to start the trial. "It's
not appropriate," the judge said. "We need it sooner." He set a hearing
for Friday to discuss scheduling and other matters.</TE>
<TE>   When Wednesday's proceeding ended, Lindh smiled at his father, San
Francisco energy lawyer Frank Lindh, as he left the courtroom. Then Frank
Lindh started to approach Spann's father, Johnny Spann, to acknowledge
him, but a court officer separated the two men.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the Spann family described how they felt seeing Lindh in the
courtroom, shorn of hair and beard.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Spann said Lindh first turned his back on the United States
and now wants his rights protected as a criminal defendant.</TE>
<TE>   "He believes his extreme form of Islam sort of gives him the right to
wage jihad against the West, specifically against Americans," she said.
Now, "he has chosen to trust in the prosperity and protection of the
United States of America by saying he's not guilty of the things he's
dedicated his life to."</TE>
<TE>   But, she said, "we expect him to be held personally responsible for
all of the things he has done."</TE>
<TE>   Gail Spann, the dead CIA agent's mother, said that, even though Lindh
has not been charged with treason, he betrayed his country just the same.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike is a hero not because of the way he died but because of the way
he lived," Gail Spann said. "And I'd also like to say that John Walker is
a traitor because of the way he lived.</TE>
<TE>   "Go back to the time when he was 16 years old and go through his
history. What more can I say? It's so simple, and I hope that all
Americans will feel the same way that I do."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, media polls have shown that a majority of Americans believe
Lindh may be guilty of treason. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll two weeks
ago, for instance, found that 60% of the respondents disagreed with the
decision not to charge him with treason.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans will not tolerate traitors," said Spann's father, in a hint
that the family believes treason charges should be added against Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike believed in the justice system," Johnny Spann said. "He died for
it. He died for this way of life we enjoy. We also have that same faith
in this justice system, and we assume, we believe, that justice will
prevail."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's parents did not speak after the hearing and quickly left the
courthouse.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Lets Airlines, Security Company Continue Dealings</HD>
<DH>Safety: Staffing issues are cited in the decision to allow
trouble-plagued Argenbright to keep providing screeners after government
takeover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A company whose problems have become synonymous with lapses in
security is likely to keep providing screeners at some airports when the
government takes over from the airlines Sunday, government and industry
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the Transportation Department announced it would not
contract with Argenbright Security Inc. after the government assumes
direct control of airport passenger screening checkpoints.</LD>
<LD>   However, later in the week, the department quietly issued a notice
permitting airlines to continue to deal with Argenbright and be
reimbursed by the government in cases in which no other company can be
found.</LD>
<TE>   The government's difficulty in getting Argenbright out of the security
equation illustrates the challenges the new Transportation Security
Administration faces in taking charge of checkpoints at 429 airports with
regular airline service.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally, we would like to cut Argenbright out, but we don't have the
manpower," said a federal official who asked not to be identified. "The
airlines will act as a middleman for us."</TE>
<TE>   Argenbright is the nation's largest airport security company and the
sole contractor at 15 airports. In the West, Denver International is the
largest such airport.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear Wednesday how many airports would continue using
Argenbright screeners after this weekend, but industry and government
officials said it could be more than the 15 where the company has a
monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   "We are ready and prepared to work with [federal] officials to assure
the safety and convenience of the flying public," said company
spokeswoman Cynthia Faulkner.</TE>
<TE>   Argenbright has been linked to a series of highly publicized security
breaches. Last month, thousands of passengers were evacuated from San
Francisco International Airport after an Argenbright screener lost track
of a man whose shoes tested positive for a possible explosives residue.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Argenbright workers allowed a man carrying knives, a stun
gun and tear gas through a checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare.</TE>
<TE>   And in Philadelphia, the company had to pay a $1.2-million fine in
2000 for failing to perform required background checks on employees.</TE>
<TE>   Until now, airlines have been responsible for screening passengers.
Carriers usually opted to contract with the security company offering the
lowest bid. That created constant turnover and poor job performance among
security screeners. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress decreed that the
federal government should take over the job. By mid-November, the
security administration must have 30,000 federal screeners in place.
Sunday marks the beginning of a transition in which the agency will
assume the security contracts held by the airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials said that, wherever possible, the government will
find other security companies to replace Argenbright. Those airports at
which the company continues to operate will receive priority for federal
screeners when they start on the job in late spring and early summer,
they added.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN
</DL>
<LD>Iranian security forces have arrested Al Qaeda fighters fleeing
Afghanistan and are hunting others who have slipped across the border, an
Iranian newspaper reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   "Some Al Qaeda members who have illegally entered Iran have been
arrested, and the security forces are searching for the rest," the daily
Khorasan quoted Mohsen Tarkashvan, a member of Iran's parliamentary
national security commission, as saying.</LD>
<LD>   "Because of Iran's geographical position, there may be some Al Qaeda
members among Afghan trespassers who have slipped into Iran with fake
passports and visas," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Iran has strongly denied U.S. accusations that it has given refuge to
members of Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist network who crossed into
Iran after the defeat of their Taliban protectors in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi said last week that a "large number"
of Taliban supporters who had illegally entered Iran had been arrested
but that no Al Qaeda members were among them.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in southern Afghanistan repeated the U.S. charges against
Iran on Wednesday, saying camps had been set up in Iran near the Afghan
border for Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "We have received reports that special camps have been opened," said
Khalid Pushtoon, a senior aide to Gul Agha Shirzai, the governor of
Kandahar province.</TE>
<TE>   Iranian officials were unavailable to comment.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Base Attacked; Troops Return Fire</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Seven people are briefly held. Elsewhere, equipment
falls and kills a soldier.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces scrambled helicopter gunships and exchanged fire
Wednesday with attackers who shot at the American base in southern
Afghanistan, the Army said. No U.S. casualties resulted from the attack,
but at another base, a U.S. soldier was crushed to death by falling
equipment.</LD>
<LD>   The firefight at the Kandahar airport lasted 15 to 20 minutes, and the
shooting appeared to be coming from two positions north and west of the
airfield, said Maj. Ralph Mills, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command
in Tampa, Fla. U.S. troops shot illumination rounds and returned fire
with machine guns in the direction of the shooting, Mills said.</LD>
<LD>   Apache helicopter gunships were dispatched "to try to find out where
the fire was coming from and who was doing it," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Mills said seven people were held. Later, U.S. officials said the
detainees turned out to be part of the U.S.-backed Afghan security force
and were released. Mills said he did not know the size of the attacking
force.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's safe to say it was pretty ineffective because the
airfield was not penetrated at all," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The base, which has more than 4,100 troops and a detention facility
for Al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners, has come under fire before. On Jan.
10, gunmen in arid scrub north of the runway opened fire as a C-17
transport plane took off with 20 detainees bound for the U.S. detention
camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, an Afghan apparently under the influence of drugs
tried to penetrate the base's heavily guarded perimeter, touching off a
security alert that briefly grounded a plane. The man was taken into
custody.</TE>
<TE>   An Army soldier based at the Bagram airfield, about 25 miles north of
Kabul, died Wednesday of injuries he suffered when the heavy equipment he
was working on fell on him, Mills said. The soldier, whose name was being
withheld until his family had been notified, was pronounced dead at a
local medical facility where he was taken for emergency surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Eight U.S. soldiers were injured Tuesday evening when their Air Force
transport plane crashed, said Maj. Brad Lowell, another Central Command
spokesman. None of the victims, whose plane went down in a remote part of
Afghanistan, suffered life-threatening injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the crash was unknown, but it did not appear to be the
result of hostile fire, Central Command said.</TE>
<TE>   Lowell would not say what mission the plane was on or where it
crashed. The $75-million MC-130P is used to refuel helicopters flown by
special operations troops.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Special Forces troops and CIA operatives are leading the hunt in
Afghanistan for fugitives who were members of the former Taliban regime
and the Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   The interim Afghan government, moving to settle a violent power
struggle in the eastern region, insisted to two tribal rivals who have
fought for control of Paktia province that neither of them will be
governor.</TE>
<TE>   The government has said that Taj Mohamad Wardak, a former governor of
several other provinces, would become Paktia's governor.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of warlord Bacha Khan said the governorship belonged to
him. "This should not be decided in this way," said Khan's brother,
Wazir. "We shed blood for our rights, and we will never, never accept
this."</TE>
<TE>--- UNPUBLISHED NOTE ---</TE>
<TE>Beginning in stories published in 2006, the Afghan warlord Bacha Khan is
identified as Pacha Khan Zadran. (Second reference is "Pacha Khan.")</TE>

<HD>U.S. Strike on Iraq Still an Option, Bush Warns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush issued an ominous warning to Saddam Hussein on
Wednesday, saying the Iraqi president "needs to understand I am serious"
about launching preemptive strikes beyond Afghanistan to eliminate
terrorist threats against the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Make no mistake about it: If we need to, we will take necessary
action to defend the American people," Bush said in reply to a reporter's
question about his intentions toward Iraq. "I will reserve whatever
options I have."</LD>
<LD>   Echoing previous public messages to Baghdad, the president's latest
threat came as serious planning is underway in his administration for a
campaign to topple Hussein.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's remarks also came a day after former Vice President Al Gore
called for a "final reckoning" with Iraq, a nation he described as a
"virulent threat in a class by itself."</TE>
<TE>   In his State of the Union address last month, the president identified
Iraq, Iran and North Korea as "an axis of evil" that poses "a grave and
growing danger." The warning prompted consternation among many U.S.
allies in the campaign against Afghanistan's former Taliban rulers and
Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's language has also revived concern in foreign capitals that he
is resuming a unilateral approach to foreign policy. Such criticism
marked Bush's first months in office but was muted after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks as he painstakingly built a broad anti-terrorism
coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Among those voicing concern was Russian President Vladimir V. Putin,
who, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal this week, warned that
Iraq was "completely different" from Afghanistan and should not become a
target of unilateral military action.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials say no military action against Baghdad is
imminent. But Bush on Wednesday did not back away from his strong words
of two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking at the White House during a joint news conference with
Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, Bush left little doubt about his
determination to fight terrorism beyond Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   "I meant what I said the other night: that there are some nations in
the world which develop weapons of mass destruction with one intention,
and that is to hold America hostage and/or harm Americans and/or our
friends and allies," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he anticipates "working with the world to bring pressure
on those nations to change their behavior," but he pointedly left open
the possibility of military action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Iraq, Iran and North Korea, Bush in his January speech to
Congress declared that "the price of indifference would be catastrophic"
and warned that "I will not stand by as peril draws closer and closer."</TE>
<TE>   He said Wednesday that "I think that statement was clear enough for
Iraq to hear me, and I will reserve whatever options I have. I'll keep
them close to my vest. . . . Saddam Hussein needs to understand I'm
serious about defending our country."</TE>
<TE>   The administration expects to complete a full review of its policy
toward Iraq by the time Vice President Dick Cheney leaves next month for
the Middle East, where he will outline U.S. intentions.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell confirmed in testimony to Congress
on Tuesday that the administration was weighing options to bring down
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Gore spoke Tuesday evening to the Council of Foreign Relations in New
York. Although the unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate in 2000
has backed Bush's leadership in the counter-terrorism campaign, he also
gently chided the president for not adhering to a more multilateral
approach.</TE>
<TE>   "The administration in which I served looked at the challenges we
faced in the world and said we wished to tackle these--with others if
possible, alone if we must," Gore said.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration sometimes seems inclined to stand that on its
head--so that the message is: with others if we must, by ourselves if
possible."</TE>
<TE>   Bush deflected criticism Wednesday about the U.S. handling of
immigrants and suspected terrorists since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "My most important job is to protect innocent Americans, and it's
exactly what I'm going to do," he said after a Pakistani journalist
stated that the Pakistani community "has especially been targeted by law
enforcement agencies."</TE>
<TE>   "We're still under threat," Bush said. "But we treat people with
ultimate respect. . . . We never said, 'Let's go single out a particular
group of citizens.' "</TE>
<TE>   Bush said terrorist suspects are "being treated incredibly humanely
here and in Guantanamo Bay."</TE>
<TE>   "But I want to assure you we will do, within our power, within the
Constitution of the United States, what it takes to defend the American
people," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush met with Musharraf for nearly an hour in the Oval Office. Then
they spent an hour over lunch in the upstairs residence of the White
House.</TE>
<TE>   During their joint appearance, Bush lauded Musharraf's participation
in the campaign against terrorism and said the United States hopes to
"facilitate meaningful dialogue" between India and Pakistan so that they
can reach a peaceful resolution of their dispute over the Himalayan
region of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also said that the warming relations between the United States
and Pakistan, which supported the Taliban until Sept. 11, will not be
"just a short-term dance . . . so long as we share the same ideals and
values and common objectives."</TE>
<TE>   The White House said Wednesday that Bush has agreed to provide $200
million to Pakistan to help it pay down its debt.</TE>

<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration on Wednesday allowed three
small Washington-area airports to reopen under stringent security rules.</LD>
<LD>   College Park, Potomac and Washington Executive/Hyde were the last
three airports still closed since Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   Flights at the three airports, which serve private planes, cannot
resume unless airport managers have FAA-approved security procedures in
place and aircraft owners and operators undergo background checks. Pilots
must obtain a confidential ID code, file a flight plan with the FAA,
remain in contact with air traffic control and have a transponder to
allow controllers to track the plane.</LD>

security forces.</LD>
<LD>   Sameer Mohammed Ahmed Hada, 25, was trying to flee Yemeni authorities

of the 19 skyjackers from the Sept. 11 attacks, and also a brother-in-law
of one of the 17 men named by the FBI in an alert issued Monday warning
of a possible terrorist attack, according to a U.S. government source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Police said officers approached Hada as he left his house but that he
ran and tried to throw a grenade, which detonated in his hand, killing
him.</TE>
<TE>   Hada was the son of Ahmed Mohammed Ali Hada, a known Al Qaeda
operative, a U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested a man sitting in a car outside the younger Hada's
house at the time, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion came two days after the FBI issued a warning of more
terrorist attacks--either in the United States or against U.S. interests
in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they learned about Hada from his landlord. The landlord
called authorities after Hada's rental contract expired and he did not
provide the documents needed for renewal, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they began inquiries and learned that Hada was an active
Al Qaeda member in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   After Wednesday's explosion, security officers searched Hada's house,
seizing two pistols, documents, books, a cell phone and a list of phone
numbers, police said.</TE>

<HD>Pearl's Contact Now a Kidnap Suspect</HD>
<DH>Asia: Khalid Khawaja, an ex-Pakistani intelligence officer, says he
is mystified by the focus on him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>He was one of the first sources for abducted Wall Street Journal
reporter Daniel Pearl, and his rhetoric of wounded pride echoes the Pearl
kidnap notes.</LD>
<LD>   But Khalid Khawaja, an aging former Pakistani intelligence official
who counts himself a close friend and confidant of Osama bin Laden, is
nonetheless perplexed at a growing focus on him as a potential suspect in
the kidnapping.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, a top Pakistani government official told The Times that
investigators still consider Khawaja a suspect. A day earlier,
authorities arrested Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was believed to be a
key player in the kidnapping, but that failed to bring about Pearl's
release.</LD>
<TE>   Now some investigators appear to be leaning toward the theory that
Sheikh was just one operative, and perhaps not even the most important
one, in a sophisticated scheme.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working on that," the official said of the case against
Khawaja.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf said after meeting with President
Bush in Washington on Wednesday that he was "reasonably sure" that Pearl
was still alive and that "we are as close as possible to getting him
released." He did not elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   He characterized the kidnapping as "fallout" from his crackdown on
extremism, but he said he would not be deterred.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja, a media-savvy small-business man who does research and
development for the Pakistani navy, said he is mystified by the focus on
him. "They have tried to implicate me with that, but I am open, I am
honest, and I am not scared," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Implicating Khawaja would satisfy those who have divined the secret
hand of Pakistan's murky Inter-Services Intelligence agency, or some
rogue element of it, in the Pearl case. The supposed motivation: to
display their power despite Musharraf's crackdown on extremist groups the
ISI once aided.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja was forced out of the ISI and retired from the Pakistani air
force in 1988 for challenging former President Zia ul-Haq over his
dedication to Islamic causes. He said he worked on the agency's Afghan
operations in the late 1980s, when the U.S. government funneled millions
of dollars through the agency to moujahedeen groups battling the Soviet
invasion and proxy government in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja said he has maintained close contacts with Taliban members and
claims that he served as a back-channel link to them between the Sept. 11
attacks and the onset of U.S. bombing in Afghanistan in early October. He
showed e-mails that he said prove his case.</TE>
<TE>   But Hamid Gul, a former ISI chief, dismisses the possibility that
Khawaja or intelligence agents were involved in the Pearl kidnapping.
"Pakistan, ISI and the moujahedeen groups cannot benefit from this kind
of a thing," he said. "I think ISI is being targeted by the Western
media."</TE>
<TE>   In the days after Pearl disappeared Jan. 23, investigators twice came
to the doorstep of Khawaja's spacious house on the capital's west side.</TE>
<TE>   Last week they arrived in the predawn hours, but Khawaja said he had
slipped out and that his mother told them to go away. They left without a
search, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja since has been questioned twice but remains free. He has
co-written a plea for Pearl's release that was published by the Los
Angeles Times and has said he found Pearl likable. But he is angry that
the U.S. media and Pakistani government make so much of the abduction.</TE>
<TE>   "I have all my sympathy for Daniel Pearl," he said. "But Pakistanis
are all human beings too. Daily, every day, you see people killed and
kidnapped all the time, and our government never lifts a finger."</TE>
<TE>A Prime Source</TE>
<TE>   Two e-mail messages to foreign media, which included photographs of
Pearl in captivity, have called for the release of Pakistani prisoners of
the U.S. war in Afghanistan, and the return of the former Taliban
ambassador to Pakistan, a friend of Khawaja.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers' second e-mail threatened to execute Pearl within 24
hours and gave American journalists three days to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, we took captive only one Amreekan and our government kicked up
such a fuss," it said. "Are not those Pakistanis taken prisoner in Cuba
human beings?"</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja, who spoke with The Times just before authorities arrested
Sheikh, said he met with Pearl on Jan. 7 or 8 in Islamabad. The Journal's
South Asia bureau chief was eager to set up a meeting with a reclusive
Islamic cleric with a large following in the U.S. who may have counted
suspected "shoe bomber" Richard C. Reid as a disciple.</TE>
<TE>   It was not the first time Pearl had contacted Khawaja. In September,
the reporter called looking for contacts in Karachi, he said. "I gave him
two, three or four people in Karachi," Khawaja said. "He was nice. As a
person, I liked him a lot."</TE>
<TE>'He Would Call Me'</TE>
<TE>   None of those contacts, Khawaja insists, are the ones who authorities
now believe led Pearl into the hands of kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>   The two kept in telephone and e-mail contact over the weeks before
Pearl disappeared, according to Khawaja. "He would call me and confirm
things," Khawaja said. "We became friendly. And then he disappeared."</TE>
<TE>   Khawaja said he told Pearl he could not arrange a contact with Sheik
Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, who heads Jamaat ul-Fuqra (Party of the Poor).
Gilani also has helped convert hundreds of mainly African American
adherents in the U.S., called the Muslims of America, with chapters in
New York, Virginia, Colorado and California.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him at this particular time, it would be hard to meet him,"
Khawaja said.</TE>
<TE>   But authorities say Pearl made contact with people he thought were
Gilani intermediaries through e-mail notes, which they now believe were
signed with fake names used by Sheikh, the British citizen who was
arrested Tuesday, to lure him into the kidnapping trap.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Gilani has turned himself in to police. He remains in
jail, though no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   "My name is just being given just so they can say they made progress,"
Khawaja said. "Everyone knows very well I am not a suspect."</TE>
<TE>   "It is only a CIA racket," he told a reporter. "If you disappear after
you came to me, they'll blame it on me."</TE>

Cleveland that he never coerced bribes or favors, and he claimed the
government was out to get him, partly for his legislative actions
involving the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutor Craig Morford said Traficant "used his position as a
congressman to perform and promise to perform official acts and in
exchange he received free things."</LD>

<HD>Bush to Shift U.S. Policy on Climate Goals</HD>
<DH>Environment: The plan will focus on limiting the growth of carbon
dioxide emissions, as opposed to reducing them outright.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>President Bush today will announce a significant shift in the
nation's strategy to combat global climate change, effectively rejecting
a commitment made in 1992 to voluntarily reduce carbon dioxide emissions
and instead opting to merely limit their growth.</LD>
<LD>   The centerpiece of the president's policy links the level of growth of
carbon dioxide emissions to the economy's rate of growth, according to
several environmentalists and business representatives who have been
briefed by administration officials.</LD>
<LD>   That objective, they said, would allow carbon dioxide emissions to
grow at about the same rate they have for the last 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   The White House, in information released late Wednesday, said simply
that its policy would reduce the ratio of greenhouse gas emissions to
economic output, which it called greenhouse gas intensity, by 18% over 10
years. It did not say how much the emissions would increase over that
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than making drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions
that would put millions of Americans out of work and undermine our
ability to make long-term investments in clean energy--as the Kyoto
Protocol would have required, the president's growth-based approach will
accelerate the development of new technologies and encourage partnerships
on climate change issues with the developing world," the White House
said.</TE>
<TE>   The expected announcement appears to be a formal rejection of the
commitment made by the president's father, then-President George Bush, at
the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. The first President Bush said then that the
United States would voluntarily reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to
1990 levels by 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases are about 15% over 1990
levels. Under the current formula, emissions levels in 2020 could be 43%
higher than 1990 levels.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an undelivered promise, and now the president is saying he
has no intention of delivering on the promise," said David Hawkins,
director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate change
center.</TE>
<TE>   The administration spelled out its reasons for walking away from
ambitious targets of greenhouse gas reductions in the annual report on
the economy by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which was
released last week.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems with climate policy over the past decade has been
a focus on unreasonable, infeasible targets," the report says. "The
uncertainty surrounding the science of climate change suggests that some
modesty is in order. We need to recognize that it makes sense to discuss
slowing emissions growth before trying to stop it and eventually reverse
it."</TE>
<TE>   Most scientists believe that human-produced greenhouse gases are
largely responsible for the 1-degree increase in average global
temperature over the last century. The National Academy of Sciences
recently warned that global warming could trigger "large, abrupt and
unwelcome" climatic changes that could severely affect ecosystems and
human society.</TE>
<TE>   The United States emits about a quarter of the world's global warming
gases, far more than any other country.</TE>
<TE>   So when Bush last year rejected the Kyoto treaty--in which about 40
countries met in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 and agreed to reduce emissions by
an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels--he was roundly criticized by
European allies for turning his back on a serious global problem.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has been under diplomatic pressure to announce his global warming
policy before he travels to Japan this weekend. Reiterating the
president's objections to the Kyoto accord, spokesman Ari Fleischer said
Wednesday that the president believes it would hurt the United States
economy and "does not think it is fair" that developing countries such as
India and China did not face mandatory carbon dioxide reductions in the
first round of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not the right remedy to have a massive reduction below 1990
levels," Fleischer said. "If that were to go into effect, it would have a
screeching-halt effect on the economy, and people would lose their jobs
as a result."</TE>
<TE>   The president is not expected to require businesses to report their
carbon dioxide emissions or reduce them. Carbon dioxide emissions, the
major contributor to global warming from human activity, result from
burning coal, gas and oil.</TE>
<TE>   While outlining his climate change policy, the president also is
expected to unveil his administration's proposal for reducing pollutants
from electrical power plants, which are responsible for 40% of the
nation's carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   That proposal outlines the administration's plans for cutting three
pollutants--sulfur dioxide, mercury and nitrogen oxide--but it will not
mandate that power plants reduce carbon dioxide emissions.</TE>
<TE>   During his campaign, the president pledged to reduce carbon dioxide
emissions from power plants, but he reversed that promise early last
year. His administration argues that capping carbon dioxide emissions
would cripple electricity production from coal, which is abundant,
thereby limiting the variety of fuel sources available to utilities. It
also would make the country too dependent on dwindling natural gas
supplies, the administration says.</TE>
<TE>   The climate change plan includes voluntary programs to encourage
companies to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions and modifies an
existing program in which companies can voluntarily register their
emission-reduction plans. It would also set up a system to ensure that
businesses that reduce greenhouse gases now can get credit for those
reductions in a future trading system.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists criticized the president for failing to set up
mandatory programs, stressing that voluntary programs have existed for a
decade but carbon dioxide emissions keep increasing.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Morgan, who heads the climate change program at the World
Wildlife Fund, said the nonbinding target and voluntary programs expected
to be proposed by Bush add up to a "Valentine's Day gift to the coal and
oil industry."</TE>
<TE>   But representatives of the utility industry said voluntary programs
are best because they give companies flexibility to develop creative ways
to control carbon dioxide emissions without hurting their bottom line.</TE>

<HD>Grisly Accusations in Boys' Assault, Murder Cases Rock Close Mont.
Town</HD>
<DH>Crime: Man accused of kidnapping and sexual assault will later be
tried on charges he killed a 10-year-old and served the remains to
neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM MURPHY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUTTE, Mont.
</DL>
<LD>The three boys are ready to describe what happened in Nathaniel
Bar-Jonah's cramped, smelly apartment on the edge of the Montana plains.
How the oldest one was locked in the bedroom and forced to undress. How
his 9-year-old cousin had a rope put around his neck and was hoisted up
on a pulley to the kitchen ceiling. How he dangled there, naked and
choking, until the breath was nearly gone out of him.</LD>
<LD>   But the events these boys are preparing to detail in Bar-Jonah's
sexual assault and kidnapping trial that opened here Tuesday are only
part of the story. In May, another jury will hear what police found when
they searched Bar-Jonah's home, looking for clues to what happened to
10-year-old Zachary Ramsay, missing since 1996.</LD>
<LD>   They found a list with the names of 23 boys, including two of the boys
allegedly assaulted at his apartment, and Ramsay's. They found human bone
fragments in his garage. And they found coded, handwritten notes that
often referred to--and this is where the case took a turn for the
worse--food.</LD>
<TE>   "Barbecued kid," said one of them. "Little boy stew." And, "Lunch is
served on the patio with roasted child."</TE>
<TE>   There may be a day when a town like Great Falls, Mont., where
Bar-Jonah sold toys at flea markets and out of his garage for nine years,
is ready to deal with something like that. But it isn't now. Certain that
he would never get a fair trial in a community that barely sees a murder
a year, court officials moved this week's sexual assault trial 150 miles
away to Butte.</TE>
<TE>   Bar-Jonah's other trial on charges that he killed the Ramsay boy and
served the remains to his neighbors will be held in Missoula, on the
other side of the Rocky Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a small, close community. We're only 60,000 people," said
Cascade County prosecutor Brant Light, who is trying both cases. "And
when you lose a child walking to school, that may be something that
happens elsewhere, but it doesn't happen in Great Falls, Mont. It really
struck the heart of people."</TE>
<TE>'We Have a Good Defense,' Lawyer Says</TE>
<TE>   The 45-year-old fast-food cook has pleaded not guilty in both cases.
"He didn't do it," his attorney Don Vernay said outside the courtroom
Tuesday. "At this stage, we feel the case [against him] for a number of
reasons is not very strong. We have a good defense, and we're going to
pursue it."</TE>
<TE>   The 213-member jury pool assembled at the county courthouse in this
historic mining town is the largest ever called in a state court case in
Montana. After 28 jurors were dismissed for personal hardships by
District Judge Kenneth Neill, lawyers began questioning individual
jurors, a process that is expected to take most of this week.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted on the three counts of sexual assault, one count of
aggravated kidnapping and one count of assault with a weapon, Bar Jonah
could face up to 330 years in prison--a severe enough sentence that
prosecutors say they may not seek the death penalty in the murder case,
for which the evidence is far more circumstantial.</TE>
<TE>Gruesome Allegations From Acquaintances</TE>
<TE>   The case, played out in this wind-swept prairie town in the heart of
Montana wheat country, has assumed operatic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   There is the acquaintance, Debbra Baker, who came forward to say that
Bar-Jonah had cooked spaghetti sauce for her and her sons that he said
was made with venison. "I told him I know what venison tastes like, and
this was spoiled. It tasted funny. He got mad and took the whole thing
out to the trash," Baker recalled in an interview this week.</TE>
<TE>   There is the man who lived next door to Bar-Jonah's apartment, Doug
McGiboney, who had to take the new next-door neighbor's cat after the
couple moved into Bar-Jonah's unit because the cat refused to go into the
residence. "They had the apartment exorcised, and . . . the cat went back
in after that," McGiboney said.</TE>
<TE>   There is Bar-Jonah himself, a heavyset, sweet-faced man whose
psychologists have said has violent fantasies that are behind his
propensity for strangling or sitting on little boys until they can't
breathe. For years, he operated what neighbors called a child's paradise
in his garage, full of "Star Wars" action figures, trading cards and
Freddy Krueger dolls.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout this week's court proceedings, Bar-Jonah sat impassively at
the counsel table, dressed in khaki slacks, a blue sport coat and white
athletic shoes, his double chin tucked into his blue shirt and tie.</TE>
<TE>   In a last will and testament he sent to the Great Falls Tribune after
his arrest, Bar-Jonah entreated the public to "celebrate my death" if
prosecutors seek the death penalty against him. "I mean party on dude for
I'm going to a place where there is no more pain and sorrow," he wrote.
"Gee, it sure sounds like heaven time. Ooops! You know what? It is! Silly
me!"</TE>
<TE>   Bar-Jonah, born as David Brown, had a long history with the
Massachusetts legal system before coming to Montana. In 1975 and again in
1977, he pleaded guilty to dressing as a police officer and abducting
young boys, repeatedly strangling his victims, leaving them barely alive.</TE>
<TE>   "I took the larger boy into the woods," he told police after the 1977
attack. "I started strangling this boy and after three or four seconds,
he went limp. I assumed he was dead. I went back and got the smaller boy
out of the car and started strangling him. I stopped strangling him
because I realized the stupidness of what I was doing."</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to 18 to 20 years in jail, spending all but two of it
in a Massachusetts treatment center for sexual offenders. He then changed
his name to Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, a Jewish name, telling his therapists he
wanted to know what it felt like to be persecuted.</TE>
<TE>   Though doctors there at the center documented a history of torture and
cannibalism fantasies, two psychologists believed in him and recommended
that he be given a chance to try life on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-three days after his release in July 1991, Bar-Jonah was
arrested after getting into a car with a 7-year-old boy and sitting on
his leg. The judge agreed to a suspended sentence, with the understanding
that he would move to live with his mother in Great Falls.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Bar-Jonah, who worked a variety of odd jobs, had a job
shoveling snow near the alley where Zachary Ramsay walked to school. One
witness says Ramsay was in the company of a man on the day he
disappeared. Ramsay was crying, the witness said, and the man "seemed to
be giving him a hard time."</TE>
<TE>   But there is no witness, no physical evidence, and Ramsay's body has
never been found, hence a case prosecutors admit will be difficult to
prove.</TE>
<TE>   That is why Light says he is focusing so many resources on this week's
trial. If convicted on the assault charges, Bar-Jonah could be facing
effectively as much time as with a murder conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsay's mother, Rachel Howard, is not pressing for a conviction in
that case. "I still believe my son's alive, and until otherwise proven, I
will persist in that belief. God has shown me too many times, miracles
can happen," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, for her part, feels blessed that she never let her son Lucas
play alone with Bar-Jonah, despite his repeated requests to take him on
weekend trips. Now she is ready to testify about Bar-Jonah's venison
meal--one of several meals of spaghetti sauce, stew and "deer burgers"
served to family and friends, police believe, that allowed Bar-Jonah to
dispose of Ramsay's body.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I eat it? I try not to think about it," Baker said, her voice
trailing off. "Because I think it would drive me insane. Because I think
it could have been Lucas."</TE>

<HD>Promise to Fix Indian Trust Finds Skepticism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton acknowledged in court Wednesday
that a system handling $500 million a year in royalties from Indian-owned
land is still flawed and asked a judge to give her agency more time to
fix it.</LD>
<LD>   But after five years of presiding in a lawsuit alleging the
mismanagement of $10 billion in Indian money, U.S. District Judge Royce
C. Lamberth was skeptical, noting he had heard similar reform promises
from Norton's predecessor.</LD>
<LD>   "Secretary [Bruce] Babbitt sat right in that chair where you are and
assured me of a great plan and all this was going to happen and none of
it happened," Lamberth said. "How do I rely on what you . . . are telling
me now and how is it different from what Secretary Babbitt told me?"</LD>
<TE>   Norton said her department has hired outside consultants to help speed
reform efforts. She added that she is seeking an $84-million increase in
spending on trust reform and that her top deputies are devoted to fixing
the system.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very dedicated to doing this," Norton said. "I'd really like to
see this change take place . . . during my time as secretary."</TE>
<TE>   Norton was on the stand defending herself against a contempt of court
allegation for allegedly concealing the failure of key Indian accounting
systems and not complying with Lamberth's order to account for how much
the Indians are owed.</TE>
<TE>   She said progress has been made on both fronts but problems remain.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Gingold, the attorney for 300,000 Indians in the class-action
lawsuit, said Norton's promises don't change the fact that today the
trust fund is in crisis, despite the Interior Department spending $614
million to fix it.</TE>
<TE>   During occasionally combative exchanges, Norton conceded that key
accounting systems don't work and attempts to fix errors in historical
data are going slowly.</TE>
<TE>   Norton added that complying with the court's order to piece together
how much the Indians are owed may be impossible because records have been
destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, we have found ourselves with a system that is not
sufficient," she said. "We are working to put the changes in place, but
we still have a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Norton said her department deserves a "passing grade" in some reform
areas but needs improvement in others.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the alleged wrongdoing occurred during Babbitt's
tenure, Norton and Neal A. McCaleb, her assistant secretary for Indian
affairs, are on trial as the current officials in charge of the trust
fund.</TE>

<HD>Bloomberg's Latest Financial News: More 'Pain' for N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Budget: Media mogul, now mayor, says massive cuts are needed to
cope with $4.8-billion deficit facing the city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>In a sober wake-up call, New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg
unveiled a budget Wednesday filled with dramatic cutbacks, deferred
dreams and "pain all around" in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "The music has stopped. . . . We must now, all of us, face reality,"
said the mayor on a day when his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani,
received an honorary knighthood from the Queen of England and was
serenaded by a royal band an ocean away.</LD>
<LD>   Grappling with an unprecedented $4.8-billion deficit, much of it
brought on by the World Trade Center disaster, Bloomberg warned New
Yorkers that "there are no gimmicks or Hail Mary passes" to bail the city
out of its budgetary crisis. Dispelling any illusions about a quick
recovery, he noted that even larger deficits may haunt New York in future
years because of a drop in tax revenue and the estimated loss of 100,000
jobs.</LD>
<TE>   Bloomberg, a Republican media mogul who had not held political office
before, insisted New York will remain a world-class city and vowed to
keep the streets safe. Yet he spelled out plans to cut $1.8 billion in
spending sure to antagonize powerful labor unions and other special
interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most controversial reductions are $212 million--and 1,600
jobs--from the Police Department, $64 million from the Fire Department
and a whopping $361 million from the Board of Education. The mayor also
called for major cuts in libraries, homeless aid programs and senior
centers.</TE>
<TE>   No city agency was spared. Under the draconian budget, much of New
York's costly recycling program would be curtailed, parking fines would
be increased and the local tax on a pack of cigarettes would be raised.</TE>
<TE>   "This budget hurts everybody," Bloomberg told a City Hall gathering of
visibly downbeat department heads. "We don't think it hurts anybody
fatally. We're spreading the pain. There are no sacred cows here."</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department had been spared reductions during Giuliani's
eight years. Anticipating opposition, Bloomberg vowed that the police job
cuts--to be generated by attrition--will be made up if the city's
plunging crime rate rises again. He said the department would remain at
its current size of 39,100 and that 800 civilians would be trained to
replace officers at desk jobs, freeing them to work on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, however, was blasted by union officials, who said New
York's police force should not be slashed to plug a budget shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Assn., called the
plan "dangerous" and predicted it would hurt the department's morale.
(New York police have been working without a contract for several years,
and many believe that city officials have not negotiated with them in
good faith.)</TE>
<TE>   "They [officers] are afraid all their hard work these last few years
will be for naught," said Lynch, predicting weaker law enforcement under
Bloomberg's plan. "Precincts are already being strained for manpower."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, advocates for the poor sharply criticized cutbacks that
would halt an $80-million expansion of the city's day-care program as
well as agencies serving the city's subsidized housing and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see any beef in his proposals, no proactive plan to improve
schools," said Board of Education member Irving Hamer, attacking
Bloomberg's plan to halt all new school construction except for five
projects in Queens.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's comments, delivered during a nearly two-hour address, were
a statistical tour de force. Yet they lacked the dynamic tone of
Giuliani's messages.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, who was elected with the former mayor's help, refrained
from any direct criticism of him. But in laying out an ambitious plan to
plug a staggering budget gap, the mayor couldn't avoid some indirect
shots.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gone from a world where we generated surpluses every year to a
world where tax revenues do not pay for services," he said. There were
warnings about a fiscal crisis, Bloomberg added, but officials believed
"you could grow your way out of this and pray a little bit, and the
prayers were answered. But this time the prayers won't be there. Games
were played in the past. People presented numbers that didn't reflect
reality."</TE>
<TE>   More important, he said, the terrorist attacks exacerbated an already
worsening economic picture. Wall Street lost 25,000 jobs last year,
Bloomberg noted, and the financial center's overall profits dropped from
$21 billion to $8.5 billion. That translated into a loss of $800 million
in city revenue from taxes, a staggering financial blow, the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg urged City Council members--who will debate his $1.8 billion
in city cuts and must pass a budget by June 30--to forgo any thoughts of
raising taxes or laying off employees as a way to avoid reductions.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how his budget will play politically, but many
observers predicted months ago that the mayor's first budget would mark
the true start of his administration. Until now, he has enjoyed a
honeymoon period, meeting with union officials, minority leaders and
activists, exchanging pleasantries and avoiding comment on the fiscal
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "On the day when Bloomberg spells out the pain and tells each group
what they'll be experiencing, that's the day the new era at City Hall
begins," political consultant Hank Sheinkopf said shortly after the
mayor's razor-thin victory over Public Advocate Mark Green. "There's
going to be a lot of bad budgetary news for New York before things
improve."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Bloomberg pointed out Wednesday that slashing $1.8 billion
from the city's current budgetary spending levels is just the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   To make up the entire $4.8-billion gap, he said, New York City will
need to borrow $1.5 billion in specially issued bonds to pay for
operating expenses. The city was given permission to do this on a onetime
basis by the state Legislature shortly after the terrorist attacks,
Bloomberg noted. But he promised that this highly controversial practice,
which brought on the city's bankruptcy crisis 25 years ago, will be
carefully monitored.</TE>
<TE>   The balance of the $4.8-billion gap would be made up from deferred
salary and pension increases to unions, plus varied assistance from
federal and state officials, Bloomberg said. The mayor conceded that none
of these givebacks is guaranteed, adding: "This is a budget. It's all
subject to change."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg has promised to keep an open mind on conflicting proposals.
But he warned critics to identify other programs ripe for cuts if they
object to the reductions that he has identified.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, the mayor said, New Yorkers should be under no illusion
that the federal government will bail them out. President Bush has
pledged to help rebuild lower Manhattan with $20 billion, Bloomberg
noted, but that is the maximum the city should expect from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to have extra funds, but I'm not a good enough salesman," he
said. "And in a world where 49 out of 50 states look like they're going
to be running their own budgetary deficits next year? Let's get serious."</TE>

<HD>Verbal Back-Flips in the House</HD>
<DH>Debate: Campaign reform foes suddenly embraced the issue. They were
trying to love it to death, in fact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Even by the standards of the U.S. Congress, Wednesday's House
debate on campaign finance reform was a marvel of political subterfuge
and creative flip-flopping. Rarely have so many lawmakers gone to such
lengths to obscure their true heart's desire.</LD>
<LD>   Legislators who for years opposed banning the unlimited donations to
parties collectively known as soft money suddenly proposed doing just
that. A raft of proposed amendments that looked like they would
strengthen the main reform bill were, in fact, intended to kill it. And
though the reform measure was touted as ending the scourge of soft money,
it did not really go that far.</LD>
<LD>   Summing up the maneuvering that led both sides to accuse the other of
rank cynicism, Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said: "Sincerity is everything in
politics. If you can fake that, you've got it made."</LD>
<TE>   It was a momentous day for the House because lawmakers, after years of
casting votes on campaign finance bills they knew were doomed, were
finally considering a measure that could actually become law.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of emotion in the House today," said Rep. Zach Wamp
(R-Tenn.). "This is the end of a long process. The closer we get to
finality, the higher the temperature gets."</TE>
<TE>   After years of fund-raising scandals--culminating in the current
frenzy about the influence exerted by Enron Corp.--hardly anyone would
dare come out and defend the status quo.</TE>
<TE>   Republican House leaders were wary of a frontal assault on the
legislation, co-sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) and Martin
T. Meehan (D-Mass.), that would eliminate the soft money contributions to
national political parties by corporations, unions and individuals--money
that now totals hundreds of millions of dollars each election cycle.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP leaders devised a new strategy for defeating the measure:
killing reformers with kindness. They offered amendments that would push
even further and quicker to get soft money out of the political
system--so far and fast that they had no chance of becoming law.</TE>
<TE>   It was a strategy that underscored how hard it is for a politician to
be "against" reform in the post-Enron environment. Rep. Barney Frank
(D-Mass.) said the debate showed how much reform opponents had been
thrown on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "Hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue," Frank said.
"Whenever people are being intellectually dishonest in debate, it's an
implicit concession that they have lost the argument."</TE>
<TE>   The intense jockeying was also a tribute to how much higher the stakes
were in a debate that could rewrite the political rules that members of
Congress will have to live by for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   The day began with the Republican leaders making a fierce last-ditch
effort to organize their troops behind their strategy for derailing the
bill. The leaders called a meeting of all House Republicans, at which
attendance was mandatory. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas) and
others whipped up the packed room, which could be heard periodically
erupting into boisterous cheers. It was not a comfortable place for the
handful of Republicans there who back the Shays-Meehan bill.</TE>
<TE>   But in a sign of waning hope that the GOP leaders could defeat the
bill, House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) spent most of his time
talking about legislation to extend unemployment benefits, not the
campaign reform issue.</TE>
<TE>   When House Democrats huddled, by contrast, they sensed they were on
the brink of victory, and a historic one at that.</TE>
<TE>   "This day and this vote is the most important day I will be spending
in 25 years in the Congress," said House Democratic Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic strategy session focused on helping members sort
through the welter of amendments that would be offered during debate.
Reform proponents stressed the need to pass the bill in a form that could
be quickly approved by the Senate--avoiding the need for negotiations in
a conference committee, where reformers fear the legislation would die.
That meant voting against pro-reform amendments that looked good but were
designed to send the bill to conference. The situation was so complex
that bill sponsors printed up reams of cheat sheets to tell allies how to
vote on each amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Undeterred, the GOP leaders pushed ahead with their strategy of
out-reforming the reformers. They tried to exploit potential weaknesses
in the Shays-Meehan bill--that it abolish soft money donations only to
the national political parties, not state parties, and that the measure's
ban would take effect after the 2002 election, not immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "Shays-Meehan does not ban soft money," said Rep. Mark Green (R-Wis.).
"It's already midnight at the costume party. It's time for us to remove
our masks and see who we really are."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.), a longtime opponent of the bill:
"If it's good enough to ban soft money, why not do it now?"</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), one of the most unyielding
opponents of campaign finance reform, put himself in the unusual position
of proposing an amendment to ban all soft money donations, not just to
the national parties.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have the courage of your convictions and want to put your
money where your mouth is, vote for Armey," said Armey, who voted against
his own amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to strengthen the bill--and thereby kill it--failed. But the
Republican strategy put some reform proponents in an awkward position.
Just before voting against the Armey amendment, it sounded like Rep.
Thomas H. Allen (D-Maine) was giving a ringing defense of it.</TE>
<TE>   "A new plague has infected our elections: Soft money," Allen said. "If
this government is to remain a government of the people, by the people
and for the people, we must take soft money out of the system."</TE>
<TE>   But Allen and others argued that the Republican strategy was a cynical
exercise because lawmakers knew it was politically impossible for a total
ban to become law.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone claims to be doing the right thing," said Rep. Bill Pascrell
Jr. (D-N.J.).</TE>

<HD>Pushing Reform by a Power of 2</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers: Behind the bid to reform campaign financing are Democrat
Meehan and Republican Shays, an odd coupling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Christopher Shays is the product of the upscale neighborhoods of
Connecticut, a soft-spoken Republican and Christian Scientist who avoids
caffeine and declines alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   Martin T. Meehan grew up in a working-class Massachusetts town, a
lifelong Democrat and New England Patriots fan who tanks up on
high-octane tea every morning and prefers his Coors Light in the can.</LD>
<LD>   The two congressmen usually move in different circles, but lately
they've seen more of each other than they have their wives. Yoked to a
House bill that would blow to bits the current campaign finance system,
they are tampering with an arrangement most of their colleagues like just
fine, though few would ever admit it.</LD>
<TE>   And just as their lifestyles are polar opposites, so too are the
stakes of their crusade. In the weeks leading up to the historic vote,
Shays has been called a political traitor and informed in no uncertain
terms that if Republicans lose the House this year, it will be on his
head.</TE>
<TE>   Meehan, by contrast, has been hailed as a champion.</TE>
<TE>   "While Shays is an outcast in his caucus, Meehan is considered a hero
for us," said Rep. Dale E. Kildee (D-Mich.). "We're depending a great
deal on the credibility of Meehan. And the credibility of Meehan is
really very high." In the final hours before the vote, the potential
consequences of their quest were evident in their contrasting demeanors.</TE>
<TE>   Standing outside the House floor just before the debate began
Wednesday, the 56-year-old Shays seemed frazzled as his
colleagues-turned-rivals unleashed their own version of his beloved bill,
declaring the original a fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Shays is bucking his party, and maybe his president. House Speaker J.
Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) calls his bill "Armageddon." And fellow
Republicans are making his life miserable, literally turning their backs
on him in rebuff and namelessly chastising him to the media.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pushing a piece of legislation that is pitifully bad public
policy," said a party strategist.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris Shays will never be a committee chairman--certainly not under
this Republican leadership," vowed a leadership aide. "I can't imagine
how any future Republican leadership would ever think Chris Shays would
ever be a committee chairman."</TE>
<TE>   Shays has long been known as a maverick. "A pleasant man with a
stubborn streak . . . willing to risk everything," reads one
congressional abstract's assessment.</TE>
<TE>   His early political career was marked by acts of defiance. He
registered for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War and
acknowledges he would not have served if drafted. As a member of
Connecticut's statehouse, he went to jail for seven days in 1986 to
protest judicial corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Although no one expected mounting pressure from his colleagues to
derail him, Shays seemed caught Wednesday between principle and
partisanship. When House Republican leaders had a closed-door conference
to whip up opposition to the measure, Shays did not attend, explaining
afterward: "That was their time to do their thing."</TE>
<TE>   But neither did he appear at a news conference held by proponents of
the bill. "I was working," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even Democrats say Shays seems more gunshy than in previous rounds
over the much-debated measure. When he met with House and Senate
Democratic leaders on campaign finance strategy last week, he asked that
the press be barred from photographing the bipartisan group together.</TE>
<TE>   Scoffed one House Republican leadership aide: "You sell your soul, and
then you worry about appearances."</TE>
<TE>   For all of Shays' angst, his partner on the other side of the aisle
Wednesday looked focused and impassioned, a former prosecutor determined
to answer every assault hurled by critics of his bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's time for a gut check," he intoned on the House floor where
he and Shays stood vigil, leaving only long enough to grab a bite of
salmon.</TE>
<TE>   Meehan's Democratic loyalties were born in youth. The son of an
Irish-Catholic typesetter from Lowell, Mass., where he still resides,
Meehan grew up listening to John F. Kennedy speeches on long-playing
records. He kept a Robert F. Kennedy scrapbook. A Kennedy-phile still, he
recently named his son Bobby.</TE>
<TE>   But his resolve for reform comes from life experience. When Meehan was
11, his father, a smoker, underwent heart surgery, giving rise years
later to a legislative war on tobacco. His passion for campaign finance
reform started in 1992, when he ran for Congress and had to sell his car
and twice mortgage his house to pay for his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Meehan's political life has not always been blessed. His credibility
suffered when he promised to limit himself to four terms, then changed
his mind. Democrats in his state recently threatened to redraw his
district into oblivion--payback, his aides say, for being a "reformer."</TE>

<HD>Big Money Finds a Way Into Judicial Elections</HD>
<DH>Campaigns: Spending by interested parties takes off in many states.
Rivals spent $8 million on media over one Ohio seat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Big-money politics and TV attack-ad campaigns have invaded the
once-staid world of judicial elections in recent years, a trend that
highlights the difficulty of truly limiting the influence of money in
politics.</LD>
<LD>   Election spending by state supreme court justices has more than
doubled since 1994, according to a report to be released today. But
spending by interest groups has grown even faster, so much so that
candidates for judicial seats sometimes have been turned into bystanders
in their own races.</LD>
<LD>   In Ohio, Michigan, Alabama and Mississippi, business advocates and
trial lawyers staged multimillion-dollar media campaigns two years ago
over state supreme court seats. Nearly 12,000 such TV ads ran in Ohio
alone during 2000, and most of them either attacked or defended Justice
Alice Resnick, a liberal member of a closely divided state high court.</LD>
<TE>   Because the TV spots were deemed "issue ads" funded by independent
groups, they were outside the restrictions set by law. Although the state
spending limit for supreme court campaigns was $550,000, the media
campaign over Resnick's reelection cost an estimated $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   "In 2000, a new and ominous politics of judicial elections emerged,"
says a report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University
and the National Institute of Money in Politics. It cited a "flood of
spending, TV buys and negative ads" in several key states.</TE>
<TE>   Judges in 38 states are elected, either directly by the voters or
through a "retention" election, as in California. State supreme court
justices raised a total of $45.6 million for their 2000 campaigns, a 61%
jump over 1998.</TE>
<TE>   By coincidence, the report highlighting the growing influence of money
in judicial elections comes as Congress is seeking to limit the effect of
big money on federal elections.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of campaign finance reform want to stop the unlimited flow
of money into political parties. This so-called soft money fuels media
campaigns in which the parties tout the positions of their candidates or
deride the opposition. However, they stop short of telling the viewers to
"vote for Smith" or "dump Jones."</TE>
<TE>   Outside groups that fund issue ads are entitled to even greater
protection under the 1st Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech. As a
result, business advocates and trial lawyers can spend freely in hopes of
swaying judicial elections.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce targeted several states where the elected
judges were seen as overly friendly to plaintiffs and their lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "Business stepped up to the plate and said we need to focus on what
this state supreme court is doing to the business climate in Ohio," said
Andrew Doehrel, president of the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. "We have four
individuals on this court who say they are going to make the law, and
they are anti-business and anti-job creation." He was referring to the
4-3 liberal majority that struck down a state law that limits jury
verdicts.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a political campaign. It was an informational campaign.
We undertook to educate the electorate about this court," Doehrel said.</TE>
<TE>   The trial lawyers and unions say they poured money into the Ohio race
to counter big spending by business.</TE>
<TE>   "The corporations can just write a check. They figure they can buy a
state supreme court justice for $2 million in Alabama or Ohio. It's
legal, but we think it's not a good thing," said Richard Mason, executive
director of the Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers. He said the trial lawyers
spent about $1.5 million on the Resnick race, while the business groups
spent more than $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the spending barrage, Resnick was reelected with 57% of the
vote.</TE>

<HD>Senate Votes $45-Billion Boost in Farm Spending</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Ending a 1996 commitment to wean farmers from federal subsidies,
the Senate on Wednesday approved legislation that greatly expands farm
programs while spending record amounts on land and water conservation.</LD>
<LD>   The measure, approved 58 to 40, would authorize $45 billion in new
spending over five years, on top of an annual $8 billion or more
scheduled to go to farmers under existing law, farm groups said. By
comparison, the House voted last year to add $38 billion to farm spending
over five years.</LD>
<LD>   Both bills would boost aid to farmers in an election year that could
see control of the Senate decided by races in farm states such as South
Dakota.</LD>
<TE>   They would also chart a dramatically different direction than under
the last major farm bill, the 1996 Freedom to Farm Act. That law aimed to
phase out subsidies and expose farmers to the rigors of the free market.
But a collapse in commodity prices and other factors prompted Congress to
pass emergency bailouts nearly every year.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a long way yet to getting to where there were no farm
subsidies. But this reaffirms that the government will be in the business
of assisting farmers," said Don Lipton, spokesman for the American Farm
Bureau Federation, an Illinois-based organization of farmers and
ranchers.</TE>
<TE>   Both the Farm Bureau and Republican leaders criticized the Senate
bill, which was crafted by Democrats. Republicans said the bill was too
costly and threatened to upset an agreement within Congress, supported by
President Bush, to add $73.5 billion to farm spending over the next
decade.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said Wednesday that the Senate legislation "front-loads spending
into the first five years, leaving vital programs underfunded in the
years that follow."</TE>
<TE>   The Farm Bureau complained that the Senate measure would limit
payments to any one farm to $275,000, compared with $460,000 in current
law and $550,000 in the House measure.</TE>
<TE>   It also opposed portions of a measure that environmentalists consider
a major victory: a new commitment to conservation incentives to farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Faber, a lawyer for the group Environmental Defense, said the
Senate bill would spend $4.4 billion annually on conservation, up from
about $2 billion today.</TE>
<TE>   "This is huge--an overwhelmingly dramatic expansion of resources that
can be used to reward farmers and ranchers when they help the
environment," Faber said.</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, the money would go to farmers who use cropland to
restore wetlands and grassland. It also offers incentives to grow crops
in ways that create animal habitats or that reduce the use of pesticides
or their movement into the broader environment.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would also provide $375 million over five years to seven
states, including California and four other Western states, to buy or
lease water rights and improve irrigation efficiency. The intent is to
keep water in local rivers to help endangered fish.</TE>
<TE>   Lipton, of the Farm Bureau, said farmers would not be required to sell
water rights to states. But his group opposed the idea "because it really
does provide a toehold for the government to interfere with water
rights," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The House had provided a smaller commitment to conservation, Faber
said. Details must be worked out in a conference of House and Senate
negotiators.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would also give more assistance to grain and cotton
growers and add new subsidies for commodities, including milk, honey,
wool and lentils.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Democrats hailed the passage of the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Farmers have already seen prices drop every single year since the
current farm bill was approved," said Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.). "They're getting roughly half of the prices they were receiving
in 1996, and it will only get worse without this bill."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said the bill contains several
provisions of particular importance to California. Among them are
stronger criminal penalties for violating plant quarantine laws, an
attempt to protect crops from invasive foreign species. She said the bill
also includes provisions to boost California as a grower and refiner of
sugar cane.</TE>

<HD>White House Rules Out Tire-Safety Requirement</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>White House officials have rejected a federal safety rule requiring
sensors in car wheels to warn drivers of low tire pressure, prompting
strong criticism from consumer groups and a senior lawmaker.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter released Wednesday, John Graham, head of a White House
office that has final say over new regulations, suggested a
less-expensive alternative favored by some car makers but deemed inferior
by testers for Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports.</LD>
<LD>   Graham said in an interview that the alternative system has an
overlooked advantage: It would encourage auto makers to equip more
vehicles with anti-lock brakes. He estimated that overall, this
combination would save more lives. The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration should have considered that before rejecting the
alternative system, Graham said.</LD>
<TE>   "The differences between lives saved by the competing tire-pressure
monitoring systems alone have not been shown to be statistically
significant," Graham said. "In fact, the lifesaving effect for anti-lock
brakes is more compelling."</TE>
<TE>   Graham heads the regulatory section of the Office of Management and
Budget, a White House agency that oversees the federal bureaucracy.
Safety was the sole consideration in reaching the decision, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The tire-monitoring requirement is part of a sweeping auto safety bill
passed by Congress after the Firestone tire recall two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), a leading sponsor of the legislation,
sharply criticized the White House. "OMB is busy letting the air out of
the regulations. Is OMB ready to take responsibility for the lives lost
on our highways as the result of this regulatory stall?"</TE>
<TE>   Markey said that if the Bush administration believes all vehicles
should have anti-lock brakes, it should mandate that separately.</TE>
<TE>   The system favored by NHTSA uses a sensor in each wheel to directly
measure tire pressure. A light would alert drivers of a problem.</TE>
<TE>   The alternative suggested by OMB would indirectly monitor tire
pressure. Computers that operate anti-lock brakes would also be used to
detect under-inflated tires. These tires have a smaller diameter and
rotate faster, a difference the system can distinguish. A warning light
would also be used.</TE>
<TE>   The NHTSA system would cost an average of $66.50 per vehicle; the
alternative would cost $13.29.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has vowed to take a hard look at new
regulations. The OMB ruling could delay the tire safety requirements,
which are scheduled to take effect in 2004. Safety advocates said another
consequence is that some vehicles will be equipped with inferior warning
systems, while consumers willing to pay more could get the design favored
by the NHTSA.</TE>
<TE>   Sally Greenberg, a lobbyist for Consumers Union, said testing last
year by her organization noted a potential problem with the alternative
suggested by the White House: It can fail to warn the driver when all
four tires lose roughly the same amount of pressure, a common condition.</TE>
<TE>   The system suggested by the White House has other drawbacks. It
doesn't tell drivers which tire is under-inflated and only works when the
vehicle is moving.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, a sensor in each wheel also allows the driver to know if
tires are overheating, Greenberg said. Heat was cited as a major factor
in the tread separation failures of Firestone tires on Ford Explorers,
which killed at least 271 people and injured hundreds more.</TE>
<TE>   Graham acknowledged in his letter that the type of system NHTSA had
proposed was "capable of detecting low pressure under a greater variety
of circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA Administrator Jeffrey W. Runge said he would "look carefully" at
OMB's recommendation. He said his agency will work to set requirements
for an effective tire-pressure monitoring system.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry was pleased with the decision. The Alliance of
Automobile Manufacturers argues that individual car makers should be able
to offer either system.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not felt that NHTSA did an acceptable job in justifying its
decision," said Scott Schmidt, director of safety regulations for the
industry group. "We are gratified that OMB reached some of the same
conclusions we have. NHTSA can still come back and say, 'We did our
homework and we come out in the same place we were.' "</TE>

<HD>Ashcroft Tightens Gun Checks but Limits Use of Data</HD>
<DH>Safety: Using the FBI's lists of firearm owners to find criminals
is prohibited, the attorney general says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft moved Wednesday to close gaps that have
allowed untold numbers of illegal residents to buy guns, but he stood
firm in his opposition to a potentially powerful tool: allowing the FBI
to determine if terrorist suspects have purchased weapons.</LD>
<LD>   Ashcroft vowed to shore up a problem-plagued system for checking gun
purchases that has allowed illegal residents nationwide to purchase guns
from licensed dealers, even though such purchases are banned by federal
law.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a broader crackdown on immigration in the wake of the Sept.
11 hijackings, Ashcroft ordered federal agents to begin more vigorous
background checks on immigrants to determine if they are authorized to
buy a gun. And he took steps to promote more information sharing between
federal and state agencies as part of the gun check system.</LD>
<TE>   Ashcroft's plan drew mixed reviews from members of Congress and
activists involved in the gun control debate.</TE>
<TE>   The National Rifle Assn. and even some groups favoring gun control
applauded the toughened measures as an important way to keep guns out of
the hands of illegal residents, but others saw it as window dressing that
does not go nearly far enough.</TE>
<TE>   Particularly vexing to Ashcroft's critics was his refusal to allow the
FBI to use its nationwide database on gun purchases to do background
checks on criminal suspects who may have already purchased guns.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI sought in October to do a search of gun buyers in the
database, known as the National Instant Check System, and cross-check it
against the names of about 1,200 people detained after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks to determine whether any had bought guns.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft, a staunch defender of gun rights, rejected the request
because he believes the 1994 Brady Act, which authorized advance
background checks on people seeking to buy guns, does not allow the
database to be used for such investigative purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's stance infuriated Democrats in Congress last year, who
challenged Ashcroft's interpretation of the law and accused him of
allowing his strong views on the 2nd Amendment to "handcuff" the FBI's
terrorism probe. A measure is pending in the Senate that would
specifically authorize the FBI to check whether criminal suspects have
bought guns.</TE>
<TE>   But Ashcroft showed no willingness Wednesday to back down.</TE>
<TE>   Even as he unveiled the Justice Department's gun measures, he told
reporters that "we believe that the utilization of purchase records for
purposes other than the auditing of the system is prohibited by the Brady
law. . . . And for us to contravene that would be inappropriate. This
department considers living within the limits of the law as one of its
primary responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   Democrats in Congress said they were mystified by Ashcroft's position
in light of the vast expansion of law enforcement tools that the Justice
Department sought, and largely won, from Congress after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) said Wednesday that "it makes no
sense to deny these records to the FBI."</TE>
<TE>   A senior Democratic aide in the Senate, who asked not to be
identified, complained that "there's a double standard here. The biggest
concern we have is the hypocrisy of [Ashcroft] saying 'the current law
doesn't allow me to do that' after sending us a million proposals" after
the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department measures come a week after the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms put forth its own
plan for restricting gun purchases to legal immigrants. The ATF is
banning many purchases of guns by "non-immigrant aliens," such as
visitors in the country on student visas, and it is requiring foreigners
who bring firearms and ammunition into the United States to get permits
in many instances.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft's plan, expanding on the ATF's steps, will probably mean
background checks on as many as 50,000 potential gun buyers a month who
may be in the country illegally, Justice Department officials said. But
officials acknowledge that they don't have a firm handle on the number of
illegal residents who are regularly able to buy guns from licensed
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   NRA officials praised the steps that Ashcroft took Wednesday,
particularly his emphasis on funding states' efforts to update and
automate their criminal history files in order to improve the accuracy
and efficiency of the background check system.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole integrity of the [gun] database depends on its accuracy, so
we think this is a very positive move," said NRA spokesman Andrew
Arulanandam.</TE>
<TE>   Americans for Gun Safety, a nonprofit advocacy group that released a
report in January on how easy it is for criminals to get guns under the
chaotic background check system, also applauded the steps announced by
Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's doing is fixing a flaw in the system," said Matt Bennett, a
spokesman for the group. "There was a serious flaw, and this is really
going to help."</TE>
<TE>   But Mathew S. Nosanchuk, legislative counsel for the Violence Policy
Center, a liberal gun-control group in Washington, said Ashcroft's plan
"doesn't begin to address the underlying problems here."</TE>
<TE>   Illegal residents will still be able to slip through the cracks by
lying about their status and providing fraudulent documentation, he said,
and the FBI will still be unable to check the backgrounds of criminal
suspects after they have already purchased guns.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft, he said, "has this 'here today, gone tomorrow' approach to
enforcing the Brady law: Get the background check done as quickly as
possible, and if someone slips through the system and the system fails to
identify them, it's tough luck for public safety."</TE>

<HD>Amino Acid Linked to Higher Alzheimer's Risk</HD>
<DH>Health: Controlling homocysteine in blood raises hope of reducing
disease, study finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Elevated levels of a specific amino acid in the blood appear to
increase by as much as twofold a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's
disease, researchers reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The findings suggest there may, for the first time, be a way to
identify people who are at increased risk of the disease and can do
something about it, as blood levels of the substance, called
homocysteine, can be easily lowered by taking certain vitamin
supplements.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like cholesterol--too much is bad," said Boston University
neurologist Sudha Seshadri, who conducted the new research published in
Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. "We don't know exactly how
much is the optimal amount, but it seems that over a wide range, the more
you have, the worse it is."</LD>
<TE>   Previous research has revealed a similar association between high
homocysteine and the risk of heart attack and stroke. While no studies
have shown that lowering homocysteine prevents disease, clinical trials
testing that hypothesis for heart attacks and stroke are underway. Such
trials for Alzheimer's will probably now be proposed as well.</TE>
<TE>   "This points us in a testable direction [toward preventive measures],
and that's a significant step forward, no doubt about it," said Bill
Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the
Alzheimer's Assn., an advocacy group headquartered in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   The most common cause of dementia, Alzheimer's affects about 4 million
Americans. By age 65, about 5% of people are afflicted with the disease.
The prevalence rises to about 15% at age 75, and to as high as 45% by age
85, according to some studies. The disease has a relentlessly downhill
course, although there's a relatively long survival after diagnosis,
about seven years.</TE>
<TE>   The search for modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's has been
intense because there's nothing people can do about the three risk
factors for the disease identified previously: age, family history and
presence of a specific genetic trait called APOE epsilon 4.</TE>
<TE>   In the new study, Seshadri and several colleagues used data from the
Framingham Heart Study, in which several thousand people--all residents
of a town outside Boston and almost all of them white--have been examined
and subjected to various medical tests every other year since 1948.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1980s, homocysteine levels were measured in about 1,100
study participants whose average age was about 75, none of whom were
demented. By eight years later, 10% had developed dementia, most of it
attributable to Alzheimer's (as opposed to stroke or other vascular
disease).</TE>
<TE>   The 30% of people with the highest homocysteine levels had twice the
risk of developing Alzheimer's disease as people with average levels,
although even mild elevations appeared to add some risk.</TE>
<TE>   The findings held even when the researchers used statistical methods
to control for other things that may contribute to dementia risk or ill
health in old age, such as educational status, blood pressure, smoking,
alcohol intake, and presence of diabetes or previous stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Elevated homocysteine accounted for about 15% of the population's risk
for Alzheimer's disease. That means that if homocysteine were entirely
removed from the complicated risk equation, 15% of cases would be
prevented. In contrast, the APOE epsilon 4 genetic trait is somewhat more
powerful, accounting for about 20% of risk.</TE>
<TE>   There's a complicated and poorly understood link between vascular
disease and Alzheimer's. For example, it's widely known that some people
who suffer a stroke rapidly develop dementia. Recent research suggests
that occurs mostly in people who already have mild, often unrecognized,
memory loss. Stroke seems to unmask, or accelerate, their Alzheimer's.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings show that, regardless of the relationship that may
exist between homocysteine and vascular disease, it appears to affect
Alzheimer's in some way. It's possible that homocysteine is toxic to
brain cells, possibly by stimulating them excessively.</TE>

<LD>Templeton obituary--In the obituary of Bonnie Templeton on Feb. 5
in the California section, Templeton, the former curator of botany at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, was quoted as saying in
1993 that she had experienced discrimination against women in the
sciences during her career.</LD>
<LD>   While efforts to reach museum officials in advance of the obituary's
publication were unsuccessful, one of her former colleagues refuted some
of her points after the obituary appeared.</LD>
<LD>   William Emboden, senior curator of botany at the museum during
Templeton's tenure, said, "The Museum of Natural History did not
discriminate in hiring, promoting or providing staff with those things
necessary to their advancement. Bonnie was no exception. . . . We had
numerous distinguished women in all areas as our colleagues and we took
great pride in their achievements in both science and education."</LD>

<BD>TRIBUNE OLYMPIC BUREAU</BD>
<DL>KEARNS, Utah</DL>
<LD>Chris Witty was pretty fast for a sick lady Wednesday night, but she
doesn't know if she'll be back for Part 2.</LD>
<LD>   Roughly a month after receiving the diagnosis that she has
mononucleosis, Witty, the gritty grand dame of American speedskating,
made it to the starting line for the first half of the Olympic 500
meters. Her time of 38.37 seconds placed her 17th in a field of 33,
far behind defending gold medalist Canadian Catriona LeMay Doan's
Olympic record 37.30, but it gave her a boost.</LD>
<LD>   The strength she felt provided confidence that she will be able to
race well in her best event, the 1,000, on Sunday. "To be here and
start the first one is a victory," Witty said.</LD>
<TE>   Witty, 26, of West Allis, Wis., is a three-time Winter Olympian,
as well as a Summer Olympian in cycling. She owns silver and bronze
speedskating medals from Nagano in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Considered the strongest American medal hope here, she went into a
slow decline in late fall and early winter. When doctors told her
what illness was causing her fatigue, it was unclear if Witty would
be able to race in these Games.</TE>
<TE>   She has been on a low-key training program with extra rest ever
since. Wednesday, Witty went off in the ninth pair with Canadian
Susan Auch. The starter seemed to hold them extra long, and twice the
whistle blew calling the racers off the line for false starts. To be
extra cautious about disqualification, Witty said she held back, and
it probably cost her a personal best. She missed by just a hundredth
of a second.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt good," Witty said. "I feel like [power] is there. It could
be better. As the race went on, I felt good." The other Americans in
the race were Elli Ochowicz, 17, of Waukesha, Wis., 21st in 38.85;
Amy Sannes, 25, of St. Paul, Minn., 22nd in 38.86; and Becky
Sundstrom, 25, of Glen Ellyn, Ill., 23rd in 38.89.</TE>
<TE>   Ochowicz, the daughter of past U.S. Olympic medalist Sheila Young,
made her Olympic debut and is pointing to future Games. "I'm using
this for experience," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sundstrom, a 1998 Olympian, smiled and waved to the crowd after
her race, even though she hoped to go a little faster. Sundstrom, who
wore a speedskating necklace under her skintight suit that was a
recent gift from her boyfriend, marveled at the noise made by the
more than 4,800 spectators.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard not to smile when people cheer like that," Sundstrom
said. "Training went really well. That's why my expectation was
higher today."</TE>
<TE>   Witty has kept such a low profile lately, trying to recoup her
energy, that not even teammate Sundstrom knew what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   "Witty is a veteran," Sundstrom said. "She knows what she's doing
out here."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Witty wasn't sure how she'd feel before she raced, and
when she left the arena she said she wasn't sure if she will compete
in the second half of the 500 today or wait for the 1,000. She said
she would sleep on the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "If my energy is drained, I won't go," Witty said. "I'll see how I
feel."</TE>
<TE>   Witty is ready to fight her illness another day. She's just not
sure which day it will be.</TE>
