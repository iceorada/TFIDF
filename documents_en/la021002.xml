<HD>Remembering the Camaro</HD>
<DH>The last of its kind rolled off the assembly line in
August. This week, readers share tales of how the automotive icon has
touched them.</DH>

<LD>The legend under the Highway 1 banner says "Autos California Style."
It is not a boast but a promise we try to keep each week. This week's
issue is one of the better examples as readers reminisce about the
Camaros in their lives.</LD>
<LD>   That legend really should say "Autos Southern California style,"
because almost nowhere else has the automobile become so much more
than a mere conveyance. Our jobs, families and homes may reflect who
we are, but our cars and trucks often project who we want to be, how
we want to be seen. That's why we dress them up in custom wheels and
paint, in graphics and aerodynamic kits, in chrome and leather. We
want them to look good because that makes us look and feel good.</LD>
<LD>   Rare is the Californian who cannot recount in exquisite detail his
or her first car. Some vehicles, though, evoke more emotion than
others; reliable and technologically advanced as they are, it is hard
to get choked up about a new Accord or Camry. But turn the
conversation to Mopars and Mustangs, roadsters and rods, and see
where it goes.</LD>
<TE>   We recently remarked on the passing of one of those automotive
icons, the Camaro, which General Motors Corp. launched in 1967 to
fight Ford's Mustang and killed last month, along with its Pontiac
Firebird twin.</TE>
<TE>   The last Camaro, a red Z28, rolled off the assembly line Aug. 27.
The final Firebird had rolled off the line just minutes before.
Weakening sales, caused by years of corporate tinkering that reduced
the Camaro's sportiness and appeal, caused its demise.</TE>
<TE>   We asked readers to share Camaro memories, and the letters and
e-mails came from as far away as Texas and as close as downtown Los
Angeles. Some sent bittersweet stories, others funny tales. They were
a joy to edit, and we think you'll have fun reading this selection.</TE>

<TE>   25 Years and Going</TE>
<TE>   The Camaro has left an indelible imprint on my life. It was my
first car out of high school.</TE>
<TE>   I learned a lot of what Bob Seger calls "Night Moves" in the back
seat of one. Unless you are a pygmy or contortionist, this should be
left to professionals.</TE>
<TE>   Like most young kids with their first hot rod, I did quite a bit
of racing with it, both officially sanctioned and otherwise. Yeah, it
was a lot of fun beating up on a rival Mustang or Firebird.</TE>
<TE>   For 25 years now I have always owned a Camaro and I will continue
to do so, even though Chevy has decided to discontinue the model.
They can discontinue the car but they can't discontinue the memories.
Memories of simpler times, I guess. Memories of times when American
performance was supreme. When they build one like the original, I'll
be back.</TE>

<TE>   The Man Magnet</TE>
<TE>   She was not called a muscle car in January 1969 when she arrived
with a bow affixed to her gold hard top. She was the coolest car a
college coed could get for graduation, though. And I knew she was a
"she" because she attracted men right from the start.</TE>
<TE>   She was my first car and she continues to bring me pleasure in
spite of the obstacles of aging. She has outlived smog testing and
leaded gas, and her replacement parts now are from JY--junk
yards--not GM.</TE>
<TE>   She attracts more men than ever. Men have climbed out of their
trucks to ask if she's for sale. Some have stood patiently beside her
in parking lots, waiting for me to come back so they could ask about
her.</TE>
<TE>   Many have told me sad stories of how they once owned one like her,
but traded theirs in and now regret it. Sometimes, while we're
stopped at a traffic light, men in their cars check us out, smile at
us or give us a thumbs up.</TE>
<TE>   She has been a reliable pal, and I take good care of her. The
older she gets, the more fun we have.</TE>

<TE>   To the Moon and Soon Back</TE>
<TE>   I am still driving a 1968 six-cylinder Chevrolet Camaro I acquired
new from the dealer in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Because it now has 386,655 miles on it, it has been as far as the
moon and is now on the way back. The car also has appeared in a
television show spotlighting my research on California Indian
astronomy.</TE>
<TE>   I intend to pilot the Camaro to a safe return to Earth and an
odometer reading of 476,160 miles.</TE>

<TE>   Like Father, Like Son</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, my wife, Christine, our son Sean and I welcomed two new
additions to our family: first, a new Z28 Camaro, and then, after a
midnight race to the hospital, a new baby, Patrick.</TE>
<TE>   The Z28 was school-bus orange; Patrick was pinkish and clashed a
little with the Camaro during his ride home from the hospital, but we
kept them both anyway.</TE>
<TE>   In the fall of that year our little family headed north through
California and the Pacific Northwest. It was probably the perfect
time for us to take the trip. Each of us fit into our assigned seats,
the Camaro was fun to drive, and we have no negative memories of our
road trip with a baby, a toddler and a late '70s GM car.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick's experiences in our Z28 during his first year of life
must have left an indelible impression. Two years ago, at age 22,
Patrick bought his own new Camaro Z28--from the same dealership where
we purchased ours in 1978.</TE>

<TE>   Ageless Appeal</TE>
<TE>   How devastating that GM is killing the Camaro and Firebird.</TE>
<TE>   I bought my first Camaro (a dark-green beauty) in 1978 and kept it
for six years. Then in 1984 I bought a silver-gray Firebird that kept
me happy for 14 years. In 1998, I bought a 1995 black Camaro, which I
still own. So, I've driven only Camaros or Firebirds for the last 24
years.</TE>
<TE>   For me, they have always been the most stylish, the most fun and
the most affordable sports cars on the market (especially if you
can't afford a Corvette or the new Jaguar convertible).</TE>
<TE>   More to the point: Don't ever think that these fabulous sports
cars just appeal to the younger crowd. I celebrated my 68th birthday
this year.</TE>

<TE>   Blissful End to Search</TE>
<TE>   My future wife and I purchased our very first brand-new car in May
of 1969. It was a Z28 Camaro, Dusk Blue with blue interior, and in
August my brother drove us away from the church in it on our wedding
day. A year later, I was transferred to California with my job, and
we could no longer afford the $102 monthly car payments because my
wife was no longer working, so my brother got the car.</TE>
<TE>   We were transferred back to the Chicago area in late 1971 and
wanted to get the car back, but he had sold it.</TE>
<TE>   We spent the next 30 years searching for a replacement because we
had such fond memories of the original Camaro. We finally found a
close match on the Internet earlier this year, and after shipping it
out from Houston, we have spent seven months restoring it. So far,
we've invested $50,000.</TE>

<TE>   A Cats' Camaro</TE>
<TE>   In 1967, I had to have a Camaro. However, at that time the largest
engine was the 350, and the only one available had Chevy's
"wonderful" 2-speed automatic.</TE>
<TE>   Bought the car, and in 20 months put over 75,000 miles on it.</TE>
<TE>   Loved the car, absolutely.</TE>
<TE>   The only problem I encountered concerned the fan guard, which was
rather long.</TE>
<TE>   Cats would crawl in and sleep by the radiator to keep warm. This
was fine, but they were still there when I fired it up at 5:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Three cats and three fan belts were involved, and none of them
were ever the same.</TE>

<TE>   Urge to Merge Remains</TE>
<TE>   It was May 1982. Graduation was six weeks away. I was offered the
ultimate bribe: If I stayed home and went to the local university, I
would get a car; if I went away, I'd have to depend on public
transit. I took the car.</TE>
<TE>   She was bright, shiny and red--a new model that made heads turn. I
became the stylin' girl on campus, getting envious glances from girls
and head nods from guys. People stared when I drove down the street.
I loved watching them through the rearview. I was 18, it was summer,
I loved my life, I loved my car, I loved to merge.</TE>
<TE>   After six months, more bright, shiny red new-model Camaros started
competing with my popularity. The first scent of "lemon" came when
the inside door handle popped off. By the time we parted 11 years
later she had stranded me three times on the 405 Freeway, had gone
through differentials, timing chains, carburetors and a transmission.</TE>
<TE>   She was high-maintenance. But when all was well, I was queen of
the road and she was No. 1 in my heart. I loved her, I miss her and
merging has never quite been the same.</TE>

<TE>   The 'Work Truck'</TE>
<TE>   I own a 1984 Camaro Berlinetta that I bought new. It has 238,000
miles on it (one rebuilt engine, two transmissions).</TE>
<TE>   I have kept it up with paint, body work and maintenance and
primarily use it now as my "work truck." It runs better than the
other family cars and looks great--on the outside. I actually removed
the front seat so that I could carry long loads in it (two-by-fours,
etc.). The back seat has been turned down since I bought the car, so
it's like new.</TE>
<TE>   Great car! I'll never give it up!</TE>

<TE>   Old Faithful</TE>
<TE>   We were the best of pals for 27 years, my shiny red '68 Camaro and
I. On her maiden voyage we drove with friends in un-air-conditioned
splendor to Las Vegas to see "Fiddler on the Roof" and to rub elbows
with Elvis in the casino lobby.</TE>
<TE>   She was a handsome 3-speed, the recipient of many an admiring
glance.</TE>
<TE>   She faithfully carried me back and forth to work in the Conejo
Valley through fires, floods and snow--yes, there was enough snow on
the Ventura Freeway in Westlake one winter that it was hard to stay
on the road!</TE>
<TE>   She had a few mishaps along the way.</TE>
<TE>   One foggy September she caused my husband to be late to work on
the first day of his teaching job when a horse collided with her.</TE>
<TE>   The school principal laughed and said that now she'd heard all the
tardy excuses. My poor friend needed extensive body work.</TE>
<TE>   As she aged, she had the typical geriatric ills--broken muffler,
carburetor problems, old wires. We became friends with the new men in
our lives: auto club tow truck drivers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994 she was given a new home, in the Midwest. I cried as she
was driven out of sight.</TE>

<TE>   Car of Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   I was saddened to read that Chevrolet is going to discontinue
production of the Camaro. Growing up in the 1960s and '70s, I always
thought that a Camaro symbolized the ultimate in muscle cars.</TE>
<TE>   I got my first Camaro in 1986 and later bought the 25th
anniversary edition (in 1992).</TE>
<TE>   I put over 86,000 miles on that car and did nothing but change the
oil and put on a new set of tires.</TE>
<TE>   Camaro provided those who couldn't afford the Corvette the
opportunity to still feel the excitement of a fine road car. Too bad
that has to end.</TE>

<TE>   Roots in Van Nuys</TE>
<TE>   My passion for Camaros came at an early age. Having experienced
cruising Van Nuys Boulevard in the late '60s and early '70s, and
having family and friends that worked at the Van Nuys GM plant, you
could say that Chevys are in my blood.</TE>
<TE>   Now that I can own and restore these cars, I have two: a 1969
RS/SS and a 1967 RS. Both were built at the Van Nuys plant.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what's more fun, building or driving these cars.</TE>

<TE>   From a Trident to a Ticket</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, at age 70, my grandmother said she wanted to own and
drive a "real" car after spending several years with a Trident
three-wheel electric cart after having had a heart attack. She
purchase a used 1967 RS with a 327-cubic-inch V-8 for $2,300 and my
mother taught her to drive.</TE>
<TE>   "Oma" passed her driver's test and started making up for all the
time spend on the Trident. She got pulled over for speeding on
Colorado Boulevard, and I'll never forget the look on the officer's
face when he handed her the ticket and she asked, "What should I do
with this?" I cannot listen to Jan and Dean's "Little Old Lady From
Pasadena" without smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Oma passed away in 1977. I own the car now, with 39,000 miles on
the odometer.</TE>
<TE>   We didn't go far, but we sure got there fast!</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California automotive buffs will be heading to Irvine on
Sunday for the 20th anniversary of the Newport Coast Concours
d'Elegance.</LD>
<LD>   Aston Martin is the featured marque at the show, one of a quartet
of large-scale concours, or classic automobile shows, held in
California each year (Pebble Beach, Palos Verdes and Torrey Pines are
the other venues), and racing legend Sir Stirling Moss will be on
hand to talk about them.</LD>
<LD>   Other features of the daylong show include an automotive fine arts
exhibit, a Corvette display to commemorate the 50th anniversary of
Chevrolet's two-seat sports car; and a selection of cars that raced
for speed records on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.</LD>
<TE>   Proceeds from the concours benefit the nonprofit Assessment and
Treatment Services Center, a 28-year-old organization that works with
families to divert children from behavior that interferes with school
success and the development of healthy personal relationships.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are $25 for adults and $20 for seniors. Children under 12
are admitted free. A family package of four tickets for $75 also is
available. Parking is $5.</TE>
<TE>   The concours is being held this year at Hidden Valley Park in
Irvine, just off Irvine Center Drive next to the Verizon Wireless
Amphitheater and Wild Rivers Park.</TE>

<HD>Fortunately, There's a Ferrari Enzo Most of Us Can Afford</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ferrari's new flagship, the two-seat, mid-engine Enzo, was officially
unveiled last week at the Paris Auto Show. But don't bother putting
in an order--the super car will be limited to 349 production models
and all have been spoken for.</LD>
<LD>   It is expected that the V-12 Enzo, rated at 660 horsepower with a
218 mph top speed, will sell for $675,000 or more, so most of us
couldn't afford one even if Ferrari decided to make more.</LD>
<LD>   But there's hope. Mattel's Hot Wheels unit, which regularly hits
the market with Thumbelina-sized replicas of new cars, has an
exclusive arrangement with Ferrari to do models of its vehicles. In a
first for both companies, the Hot Wheels Enzo was introduced the same
day the covers were pulled off the real Enzo in Paris.</LD>
<TE>   The Hot Wheels model is a 1:18 scale metal replica with wheels
that turn and doors that open, a cargo area and an engine
compartment. Ferrari engineers and designers worked with the Hot
Wheels crew in El Segundo to make sure all the details were in the
little devil.</TE>
<TE>   Best of all, it costs only $25.</TE>
<TE>   A Compact SUV by VW?</TE>
<TE>   Those who can pass on a Ferrari, even a scale model, but think the
world needs more sport utility vehicles can take heart: Volkswagen
seems to be planning another addition to the segment.</TE>
<TE>   The company, which introduced its Touareg SUV last week at the
Paris Auto Show, originally said the upscale model, jointly developed
with Porsche (which has its version, the Cayenne, coming soon to a
showroom near you), was to be VW's only foray into the market.</TE>
<TE>   But the trade journal Automotive News Europe reported that Falko
Schling, Volkswagen's director of group quality assurance, told a
conference during the show that the company will come to the market
with a model for what VW calls a "people segment." It would be a
compact SUV, smaller and less expensive than the Touareg.</TE>

completely ignore the limits. When I follow the law and slow down as
I approach schools, I'm tailgated and passed by reckless and
thoughtless drivers. It's very dangerous. Are drivers allowed to
determine on their own whether to slow down near schools?</LD>

<TE>   Answer: Under the law, drivers must obey the 25-mph speed limit in
a school zone if there are children--18 years or younger--nearby. The
law applies whenever schoolchildren are arriving or departing. If
they are standing in front of the school, waiting on corners or
walking along sidewalks, drivers must reduce speeds to 25 mph, law
enforcement officers said.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers must comply with the law whether they're driving through a
high school or an elementary school zone.</TE>
<TE>   It's also important for drivers to understand that under the
law(California Vehicle Code, section 467), a pedestrian is anyone who
is walking or using a "human-powered device" such as a skateboard,
wheelchair or roller skates.</TE>
<TE>   Bicyclists are not considered pedestrians, but drivers still must
use caution, especially when children are riding in bike lanes.</TE>
<TE>   In a recent survey conducted by the California Institute of
Transportation Safety at San Diego State University, school crossing
guards from Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San
Francisco counties reported that only 25% of motorists obeyed the
25-mph speed limit around schools when children were present.</TE>
<TE>   Parents often are the offenders, said Los Angeles City Councilman
Dennis P. Zine, a former sergeant in the LAPD traffic division and
now a reserve officer. Anyone who drives kids to school or drives
past a school as students are arriving or departing knows what chaos
occurs.</TE>
<TE>   Lines of vehicles clog surrounding streets. Harried parents
double-park and let their children dash out into the street between
cars. Some parents stop in the middle of the street to pick up
children, or speed dangerously through intersections and around
corners to get their children to school before the bell rings.</TE>
<TE>   Teen drivers who roar out of school parking lots and "show off
their fast cars" also pose a danger, Zine said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's insanity," said Long Beach Police Sgt. Rich Meyer, adding
that his department and other law enforcement agencies are taking an
aggressive approach to protecting pedestrians and enforcing the law.</TE>
<TE>   Besides cracking down on speeders, police also are focusing on
crosswalk safety.</TE>
<TE>   In Long Beach, plainclothes officers attempting to cross streets
at intersections and crosswalks have resulted in as many as 150
citations in a 10-hour period, Meyer said. Violators speed past or
swerve around the officers. Some "yell and make obscene gestures,"
Meyer said. "It boils down to the fact that everybody is in a hurry."</TE>
<TE>   It's particularly disturbing when drivers won't allow children
safe passage at a crosswalk.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, drivers must yield the right of way to
pedestrians, whether they are using a marked or unmarked crosswalk at
an intersection.</TE>
<TE>   The law, Vehicle Code section 21950, also states that pedestrians
bear some responsibility for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   They cannot suddenly leave the curb or other place of safety and
walk or run into the path of a vehicle that is close and poses
immediate danger.</TE>
<TE>   Pedestrians also are prohibited from unnecessarily stopping or
delaying traffic in a crosswalk. If pedestrians are attempting to
cross streets controlled by a traffic signal or police officer, they
must use only marked crosswalks.</TE>
<TE>   People often are unaware of crosswalk laws, officers said.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic safety around campuses in the Los Angeles Unified School
District has been such a concern over the years that school security
officers have been given the authority to cite lawbreakers.</TE>
<TE>   The next step should be motorcycle patrols at schools to catch
violators, Zine said. He is working with the LAUSD to secure a state
grant to pay for such a plan.</TE>
<TE>   From January to June 2002, two children died and 134 other
youngsters, ages 18 and younger, were injured in pedestrian and
bicycle-related traffic accidents in Los Angeles during school
arrival and dismissal times, according to LAPD data.</TE>
<TE>   "More schoolchildren get hurt by cars than get shot or stabbed
around schools" in Los Angeles, said Mike Bowman, assistant to the
chief of the LAUSD police.</TE>

<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>Winslow Homer's watercolor "The Woodcutter," Fitz Hugh Lane's "Sunset
at Gloucester Harbor" and Georgia O'Keeffe's "Open Clam Shell" and
"Closed Clam Shell" cannot be viewed at any museum in New York City
or Paris.</LD>
<LD>   They're in Texas--where they usually aren't on public display at
all. But those and nearly 60 other pieces borrowed from private,
public and corporate collections across the state are on display
through Nov. 17 at the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth.</LD>
<LD>   "Celebrating America: Masterworks From Texas Collections" features
paintings, sculptures, watercolors and photographs by celebrated
artists from 1771 to 1969.</LD>
<TE>   Through the exhibit, John Singleton Copley's early 1770s oil
portraits of Jabez and Sarah Brown Bowen, a wealthy and influential
New England couple, have been reunited for the first time in 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   The paintings were together for more than two centuries, including
an extended display at the Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School
of Design. But the portraits were sold--his to someone in Houston,
hers to someone in Amarillo, Texas--in the early 1980s through the
Kennedy Galleries of New York.</TE>
<TE>   When Jane Myers, the museum's chief curator, found out that both
were in Texas, she worked to include them in the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Myers said she also was surprised that some corporations had such
extensive art collections.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Turns to a Famous Alum</HD>
<DH>Movies* The Widescreen Festival at CSULB has chosen recent
graduate Steven Spielberg as an artist-in-residence. His selections
screen this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced with an identity crisis, the Widescreen Film Festival, now in
its eighth year at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center at Cal State
Long Beach, reached out to one of the university's latest and
certainly most prestigious graduates for help--Steven Spielberg--and
he accepted. The Oscar-winning director is serving as the festival's
first honorary artist-in-residence and has chosen a collection of
eight films that have inspired him.</LD>
<LD>   Screening tonight is "Day for Night" followed by "On the
Waterfront" on Thursday, "The Godfather," "Rebel Without a Cause" and
"Easy Rider" on Friday and "Dr. Strangelove," "8 1/2" and "Raging
Bull" on Saturday. Only one of the films, "Rebel Without a Cause" is
being shown in a wide-screen format (though the festival's name
remains the same).</LD>
<TE>   Each of the films has a particular resonance for Spielberg and
filmgoers. Federico Fellini's "8 1/2" (1963) and Francois Truffaut's
"Day for Night" (1974) represent two different odes to filmmaking.
The latter has added resonance for Spielberg, since Truffaut, the
legendary New Wave director, appeared in "Close Encounters of the
Third Kind." Elia Kazan's "On the Waterfront" (1954) remains one of
the most powerful and timeless melodramas ever made about corruption
and redemption; "Dr. Strangelove" (1964) continues to be a consensus
favorite among Stanley Kubrick's idiosyncratic works; Nicholas Ray's
"Rebel Without a Cause" (1955) and Dennis Hopper's "Easy Rider"
(1969) are nice companion pieces about rebellion and maverick
filmmaking. Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" (1972) and Martin
Scorsese's "Raging Bull" (1980) are two of the greatest films by
filmmakers of Spielberg's generation.</TE>
<TE>   "This change in the festival resulted in Steven coming back to
school and taking classes," explains festival artistic director Gary
Prebula. "During the one-and-a-half years of mystery [surrounding
Spielberg's return], the professors got a new sense of pride in the
students. He re-energized the film and electronic arts department
with his presence. Oddly enough, the festival board was in the
process of re-evaluating our mission statement, which was too
limited. Wide-screen movies were not enough to attract audiences and
we didn't have a handle on how to expand it.</TE>
<TE>   "So we consulted with [co-artistic director associate professor]
Rory Kelly and [Film and Electronic Arts department chair] Sharyn
Blumenthal. She suggested we design the festival for students, while
still maintaining the public screenings, and Rory came up with this
artist-in-residence idea and immediately suggested that we go after
Steven." Spielberg returns this week from a "Minority Report"
promotional tour in Europe and is finishing post-production on his
upcoming film, "Catch Me If You Can," so his attendance at the
festival is unlikely, according to a spokesperson for the director.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Spielberg collaborator, cinematographer Allen Daviau
("E.T."), will screen and discuss the director's seminal short,
"Amblin," for cinematography students. The festival, meanwhile, will
offer several guest speakers who will provide their own personal
insights. Included are actress Eva Marie Saint ("On the Waterfront")
and actor-filmmakers Peter Fonda ("Easy Rider"), James B. Harris
("Dr. Strangelove") and Paul Mazursky, whose cult favorite "Alex in
Wonderland" (1970) was inspired by "8 1/2." Fellini plays a small
role in the film as himself.</TE>
<TE>   "The maestro [Fellini] invited me to Rome, and I was on a plane
the following day," Mazursky recalls. "I spent four days and four
nights with him and finally got him to agree to do it. Later, I got a
call from his assistant saying he had changed his mind. I pretended
not to understand and flew to Rome to start production. I met Fellini
at his favorite restaurant, Caesarina, and he did it."</TE>
<TE>   For Saint, working with Kazan and Marlon Brando and the rest of
the talented ensemble cast on her Oscar-winning debut was the thrill
of a lifetime. "I loved being on location and Kazan was quiet but had
an aura of strength. And Marlon was amazing. When he dropped that
glove of mine in rehearsal and picked it up and used it and massaged
it, it was very sensual. It was a tribute to his genius that Kazan
allowed us to shoot this happy accident."</TE>
<TE>   As for Fonda, who produced, co-wrote and starred in "Easy Rider,"
he is proud to be a part of a film that has become such a cultural
touchstone. "What pleases me most is that this film about the
independent spirit, made during the era of '60s rebellion, is now a
national treasure through an act of Congress," he says referring to
the film being placed on the National Film Register.</TE>

<HD>A Little Celestial Help?</HD>
<DH>Jorge Moreno thanks the heavens for the boost resulting
from his Latin Grammy for best new artist</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number 23 has followed singer-songwriter Jorge Moreno like a
mystical star since the day he was born, April 23, 1975. And there it
was again on the door of his Los Angeles hotel suite, Room 1723, like
an omen on his arrival for this year's Latin Grammy ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   The seven also holds meaning for the creative Cuban American, who
was competing for the prestigious best new artist award. Was the
remaining number a sign he would win? Was he "The One"?</LD>
<LD>   Whether by superstition or celestial intervention, Moreno really
needed a victory.</LD>
<TE>   His self-titled debut album received critical acclaim when it was
released last November on Maverick Musica, the Latin music division
of Madonna's Maverick Records label. But his fledgling career soon
faltered, struggling against radio resistance and a spotty tour
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Billboard magazine had called the doe-eyed artist "daring" and his
album "breathtaking."</TE>
<TE>   He also got an early push by an appearance on national TV during
last fall's prime-time 50th anniversary tribute to "I Love Lucy,"
performing his supercharged rendition of "Babalu" with the children
of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball.</TE>
<TE>   His career seemed destined to take off. But that show was
practically the last time anybody heard of Jorge Moreno, even in his
hometown of Miami, where his father was a veteran Latin record
executive.</TE>
<TE>   His artful album was like a movie released too soon to be
remembered come Oscar time. He seemed overshadowed by fellow
new-artist nominees with newer albums, such as Colombia's Cabas, and
those who had played recent concerts, such as Puerto Rico's Circo.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno flew into town feeling a little neglected. But then he
paused at the door of his hotel room, contemplating the lucky number.</TE>
<TE>   For a moment, the aspiring star thought of his great-grandmother,
Maria Villar, an exile who had lost her husband and her only son in
Cuba's political violence under Fulgencio Batista's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno, a child of divorce, was close to the woman who had been
his nanny, taught him Spanish and stuck up for him, right or wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Before her death in 1994--on May 23--Moreno asked for a sign that
she would still be watching over him from beyond. Do something. Make
the lights flicker, suggested the teenage troublemaker who had been
expelled from a dozen schools--public, parochial and military.</TE>
<TE>   For years, he noticed nothing. Moreno had grown out of his
delinquent graffiti period and his scary Gothic stage.</TE>
<TE>   He had started writing his own songs, an original and arresting
blend of romantic ballads, traditional salsa and contemporary,
British-influenced pop.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he joined a select roster on Maverick Musica. By
chance, his separate deal as a songwriter with EMI Publishing was
signed the same day. It was May 23, 2001--exactly seven years after
his great-grandmother's death. It was the sign Moreno had been
waiting for.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the announcement at last month's awards show: The man in
Room 1723 was the Latin Grammys' best new artist. Introduced briefly
by fellow Miamian Gloria Estefan during the telecast, Moreno stood
and waved. Privately, he had already thanked his great-grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I do conjure up the numerology in my head," says Moreno,
27, during an interview in the lobby of his hotel after his victory.
"But the difference between coincidence and divine influence is what
somebody feels."</TE>
<TE>   Being named best new artist has had very real rewards for the
young man who not long ago was sending out his demo recordings in
pizza boxes to get the attention of busy record executives.</TE>
<TE>   Five days after the Latin Grammys, Moreno was being interviewed
for the first time on Super Estrella, L.A.'s powerful contemporary
Latin music radio station, which had ignored his album the whole
year.</TE>
<TE>   It was Monday, Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   This week, the station programmed Moreno's second single, "Mi
Sufrimiento." The song's irreverent video, produced by the former
film student, earlier debuted on MTV Espanol. Moreno also finally got
a national tour, which kicks off next month in California. Then there
are the corporate sponsorships--new opportunities to plug cars, soft
drinks and beer.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, everybody decided they wanted to get to know him, and
we started to get these tremendous offers," says Maverick Musica
President Bruno del Granado. "It's like night and day. Up until the
Latin Grammy nominations, it was us knocking on doors, and a lot of
it was falling on deaf ears."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno blames it partly on "Babalu." He thinks the TV performance
backfired.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people were confused with me," he says. "As a first
impression, it was kind of weird, like, 'Who's this guy dressed like
Ricky Ricardo singing "Babalu"?' It maybe didn't seem as hip and cool
to the young generation as I felt it."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno's style is distinguished by his ability to seamlessly blend
bicultural influences. His musical sensibilities draw on everything
from the Beatles to Benny More, the revered Cuban vocalist of the
'40s and '50s.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno's distorted, electronic rendition of More's "Como Fue" is
hidden on the album, starting after a long silence at a significant
point on the final track: 7:23.</TE>
<TE>   From the start, industry insiders warned that his music was too
different to be played on radio. They suggested he try to be more
pop.</TE>
<TE>   "People were trying to pitch me as the next Enrique Iglesias or
the next Ricky Martin," he recalls. "I have nothing against those
cats. They're cool for what they do. But it's not my style, it's not
my look, it's not my anything.... And I didn't want to be that. I
wanted to be me. I wanted to be the first Jorge Moreno."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, he's the second. His older brother is also named Jorge,
after the great-uncle who was murdered in Cuba as a result of his
anti-Batista activities. But since the younger boy, the youngest of
four siblings, was born on the feast day of San Jorge (St. George),
his great-grandmother pleaded with his father, Tony, to name him
Jorge too.</TE>
<TE>   The senior Moreno, who had witnessed his uncle's killing as a
child, now laughs about his "two Georges." Luckily, the elder one
always went by his middle name, Antonio. The younger Jorge also stood
out as the most devilish one in the family and as the most
sentimental, always remembering birthdays and taking flowers to his
great-grandmother's grave.</TE>
<TE>   The Latin Grammy winner learned a lot about the business from his
father, whose label, Musical Productions, had two Latin Grammy
contenders in tropical music. But the young artist is still amazed by
how people suddenly took an interest after his award.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not complaining," says the singer, who has survived two
serious car crashes in three years, "because I'm lucky just to be
here."</TE>

<HD>BBC Tailors Its News Broadcast</HD>
<DH>Television* Expansion into the U.S. continues with a
Washington-based program for its cable channel and PBS.</DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's still the "BBC World News," but now it's coming to U.S. viewers
from Washington, not just London.</LD>
<LD>   The British Broadcasting Corp., having quietly expanded
distribution of its nightly newscasts to almost the entire United
States, last week started tailoring the programs to American viewers
in a bid to attract an even wider audience.</LD>
<LD>   The programs, available on public television stations and the BBC
America cable and satellite channel, now air live from a Washington
studio, and they lead with stories chosen based on their importance
to American audiences. They are anchored by Mishal Husain, a
Washington-based correspondent for the BBC.</LD>
<TE>   Her low-key style--not even a necklace in sight on two recent
nights--and the show's straightforward graphics and reporting are in
stark contrast to the flashier newscasts offered on the broadcast
networks, cable news channels and even public TV's "The News Hour
With Jim Lehrer." But the content marks the real difference from the
U.S. alternatives: Monday's show focused on international
negotiations over Iraq, but it also looked at the killing of street
children in Honduras and the Sri Lankan peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Audience growth since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks
prompted the move to a Washington studio, said Husain, who was
previously based in Singapore and London. "We want to build on that,"
she said. It's part of a long-term push to expand the BBC brand in
the U.S., which may ultimately include challenging CNN and Fox News.
BBC News Chief Executive Richard Sambrook said in a June speech to
the National Press Club that he hopes one day BBC will offer a
24-hour news channel in the U.S., although BBC executives said even
the multichannel broadband services are at or near capacity, so no
such move is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   BBC newscasts were first offered in the U.S. in November 1998, on
just 14 public stations. They are now seen on 212 PBS stations,
reaching 85% of U.S. TV viewers, as well as on BBC America, which is
available in 30 million households. Word of mouth among the stations
has spurred the steady expansion, said Terrel Cass, president and
general manager of New York station WLIW, which distributes the show
to public television. "It's a foreign perspective on the news, and we
don't see that in the United States. If nothing else, it gives the
USA a look at what the rest of the world thinks of us."</TE>
<TE>   Audience figures are sketchy, but WLIW says about 800,000 viewers
tune in nationwide each night, compared to the nearly 30 million who
watch one of the broadcast network newscasts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite common wisdom that American viewers aren't much interested
in foreign news, there has always been a small, devoted audience for
the international perspective. For five years, many public stations
aired "World News for Public Television," a taped newscast from
London's ITN, but it went off the air in the U.S. at the end of 2001,
after it was unable to raise needed corporate underwriting in a
difficult economic climate. That gave a boost to the BBC. Los
Angeles' KCET, for one, replaced the ITN newscast with the
English-language "Journal" from Germany's DeutscheWelle, then in July
began airing ""BBC World News" at 5 p.m. It is also carried on Orange
County's KOCE at 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Journal" often focused too much on German and European issues,
said Douglas Chang, KCET director of programming, explaining the
switch. Even so, some viewers preferred that to the BBC, which they
feel is too close to an American perspective, he said, but the BBC
reporting team has the advantage of being "almost unrivaled" in its
presence around the world.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., BBC News at 7 p.m. has proven so popular that
WHUT, Howard University's station, in August added a second live BBC
newscast, this one from London, at 10 p.m. In September, WHUT added a
third daily live broadcast, at 7 a.m. After the 10 p.m. broadcast
started, a grateful viewer sent a $200 donation, even though the
station doesn't solicit funds.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's move to make the program more American-friendly has
been controversial with some public television stations. Cass said
WLIW "did not encourage" the switch, fearing that the show might lose
its foreign perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that it strengthens the traditional BBC core of
international reporting, it's a plus," said Adam Clayton Powell III,
general manager of Howard University Television. "But by no means
should they try to make these news broadcasts more 'American,'
because that would dilute their value. The value to us is, you are
able to turn your TV set on ... just as if you were in a hotel room
in London." He said he's thrilled when the program leads off with a
story from places that CBS, ABC and NBC are unlikely to be.</TE>
<TE>   But KCET's Chang said the change could help ensure that the
program puts world events into a context that Americans might not
automatically have.</TE>
<TE>   Husain, the show's anchor, said that by being based in Washington,
more guests can come into the studio, believing that face-to-face
interviews are more illuminating than when a guest is merely talking
to a camera. "There's a different kind of debate and engagement with
a guest sitting in the studio next to you," she said. "It's a better
level of debate."</TE>
<TE>   She said the focus on international stories will remain, with
reports from "places most American networks wouldn't report from. We
have correspondents around the world and we'll draw on them as much
as before." But a U.S. presence, she said, will allow her "to key
more into what is different for the American audience and draw out
things of interest."</TE>

<LD>"American Masters" starts its 17th season tonight with a love letter
to that undisputed master of country music, Willie Nelson.</LD>
<LD>   More entertaining and endearing than illuminating, "Willie Nelson:
Still Is Still Moving" is most moving when producer-director Steven
Cantor focuses on the kinship between Nelson and his older sister and
bandmate, pianist Bobbie Nelson, and with the members of his
close-knit band, fittingly called Family.</LD>
<LD>   In one scene, Bobbie brushes her 69-year-old baby bro's gray and
auburn tresses as he relaxes, eyes half-closed, in the tour bus in
which they spend so much of their lives.</LD>
<TE>   Longtime friend and collaborator Waylon Jennings, who died shortly
after taping his interview, makes some of the funniest, and most
incisive, comments about Nelson. Regarding his singular vocal
phrasing, Jennings says: "I always told him, 'You start in yesterday
and wind up tomorrow.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cantor traces the oft-told story of Nelson's journey from his
cotton-picking youth in Abbott, Texas, living with his grandparents
after his parents divorced, through his rocky apprenticeship as a
square peg trying to squeeze himself into the round holes of
Nashville's country music scene in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   It takes us on through the superstardom Nelson attained as one of
the Texas outlaws who breathed new life into country in the '70s with
their rough-and-rowdy outsiders' ways and more intensely personal
brand of songwriting.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson has been in the public arena for so long that revelations
about his life, at this point, are few. Those that crop up here tend
to slip out, as when Nelson confides to admirer Dave Matthews that
his career-making song "Crazy" begins with a hook he copped from an
old Floyd Tillman song.</TE>
<TE>   The spotlight falls on the various loves of his life: golf,
horses, martial arts, the American family farm, sister Bobbie, his
seven children and above all, his music.</TE>
<TE>   More of Willie Nelson, the man, instead of so much of Willie, the
country music icon, might have come through with input from any of
his three ex-wives on how life unfolded while married to a man who
seems to live for touring and recording. He briefly enumerates the
evils of alcohol that prompted him to stop drinking, but the show
never addresses his stance on cannabis, for which he has run afoul of
authorities on occasion.</TE>
<TE>   There's reference to the strong jazz current that runs through his
compositions, but nothing from Nelson or anyone else about how or why
a kid from a Podunk town in Texas developed so sophisticated a style
of composition and singing. And his infamous battle with the IRS that
wound up costing him $17 million is dispensed with as little more
than an inconvenience.</TE>
<TE>   The pace is too leisurely, especially in the final half hour, and
at times it all feels a tad insular watching the lives of so many
people--musicians, road crew, relatives and friends--revolving almost
completely around the wants and needs of Willie.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he's such a benign presence, and so staggeringly gifted a
songwriter, singer and guitarist, the overriding impression is that
there are a lot worse things these folks could devote themselves to
than the well-being of the Red Headed Stranger.</TE>
<TE>   "Willie Nelson: Still Is Still Moving" airs at 9 tonight on
"American Masters" on KCET.</TE>

<HD>The Ratings Game: How L.A. Is Different</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Exactly how popular is "Smallville," the WB network series that began
its second season last week? Like so many things pertaining to TV
ratings and research, it depends on where you happen to look.</LD>
<LD>   Around the country, the show about Superman as a teenager is a
modest success relative to the major networks, clocking in at just
49th on the prime-time charts. Around Los Angeles, however, the
series takes off like you-know-who, last week roughly doubling its
national average.</LD>
<LD>   Television ratings have been in the news more than usual this past
week, as the networks launch new programs and bring back old ones,
heralding the start of the new TV season. These results are analyzed
as if they contained nuclear secrets, as opposed to clues as to
whether "Good Morning, Miami" will live to see Thanksgiving.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the figures generally reported are Nielsen Media Research
estimates gauging the viewing habits of 272 million U.S. residents,
spread across 106.7 million homes--a tale of the tape that often
tells a quite different story than data for the Los Angeles-Orange
County viewing area, which by itself accounts for 5% of the nation's
TV households. And while you doubtless harbor certain preconceptions
about L.A.--or New York or Cincinnati--and what each city's
inhabitants are apt to watch, some of the findings may surprise you.</TE>
<TE>   These next few paragraphs, by the way, will be received
enthusiastically by the Tribune Co., owner of both the Los Angeles
Times and KTLA. Although this can't be helped, rest assured that
given my penchant for biting the hand that feeds me, I don't plan to
make a habit of it.Still, the truth is that WB network programs
perform vastly better on KTLA than they do in the U.S. as a whole--a
pattern that has long held true, since the L.A. area features seven
VHF stations (that is, channels 2 through 13), allowing upstart
networks to compete on a more even footing.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, in much of the country WB, UPN and even Fox programs
run on weaker UHF affiliates positioned in TV's nosebleed section, on
channels from the 20s to the 60s. As a result, those networks' series
tend to be far more competitive in Los Angeles and certain other big
markets than they are nationally.</TE>
<TE>   As a case in point, KTLA's telecasts of "Smallville" and "Gilmore
Girls" together ranked No. 1 in the L.A.-area last Tuesday, averaging
an 8.5 rating--doubling the average number of homes they attracted
nationwide, where the WB finished fourth for those two hours. (Each
rating point, whether in L.A. or nationally, represents 1% of
available households.)</TE>
<TE>   Granted, some of the local-versus-national discrepancies would
seem predictable. The Emmy Awards, for example, drew 18% of homes in
KNBC-TV's viewing area, a third more than watched the event on a
national basis--not a surprise, given that such showcases represent a
prime opportunity to root for friends and against enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, not all the stereotypes apply. Take "The Tonight Show With
Jay Leno" and "Late Show With David Letterman." Many doubtless assume
that the hipper Letterman shines in big cities, while Leno's act
plays better in the corn-fed heartland.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds logical, only that's not the case. Due in part to the
long-standing weakness of CBS' New York and L.A. stations relative to
their network-owned rivals, Leno has consistently eclipsed Letterman
in the country's two largest media markets--the towns all those
stars, news personalities and their publicists call home.</TE>
<TE>   Take last week, when "The Tonight Show" averaged a 4.9 rating in
the L.A. area--or about 260,000 homes--to a 2 rating (a little over
100,000) viewing "Late Show." The disparity was smaller in
Letterman's home base of New York City, but Leno still beat him there
by a solid 4.4 to 3.1 rating margin.</TE>
<TE>   If independent TV stations frequently outperform their national
averages in L.A.--a case station officials are eager to make, since
they get to sell a few local commercials during network
programs--none are more overlooked than the Spanish-language outlets,
which have long complained that their share of ad dollars isn't
commensurate with their audience.</TE>
<TE>   So while we in the media breathlessly focused on last week's
network premieres, the Univision telenovela "El Privilegio de Amar"
(The Privilege of Love) actually drew a higher rating locally on KMEX
than "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "That '70s Show," "60 Minutes II" or
"WWE Smackdown."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, in fact, with KNBC-TV and KCBS-TV sucking most of the
air out of the market, KMEX ranked third for the night.</TE>
<TE>   In some respects, the local standings can provide a source of
civic pride. More of your neighbors watched "NYPD Blue,"
percentage-wise, than did so in the rest of the country, while
significantly fewer viewed the "Big Brother 3" finale. Fox's
critically lauded "The Bernie Mac Show" posted a 9.3 rating in L.A.
versus a 4.9 nationally, reducing the time-slot victory by ABC's more
conventional Damon Wayans vehicle "My Wife and Kids" from a
nationwide runaway to a local photo-finish.</TE>
<TE>   Other statistics are interesting, if hard to categorize. Compared
to national ratings, "Friends" fared better in L.A. but "Will &amp;
Grace" and "ER" did worse. Witty, urbane "Frasier" was seen in more
homes nationwide, though a higher percentage of L.A.-area viewers
stuck around for "Hidden Hills"--a new sitcom that derives its name
from a small community located just off the Ventura Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "Survivor: Thailand" rang up an 11.9 rating in L.A., just a hair
below the national average. In the asphalt jungle of New York, the
show clocked in at a mere 9.6.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Survivor's" highest rating? Look no farther than the
aforementioned Cincinnati, where the show notched a whopping 24.6
rating--meaning nearly a quarter of that city's homes tuned in, over
twice the national average. My best guess is that with the Bengals
opening the football season 0-4 and the Reds finishing 19 games out
of first place, Ohioans are either desperate for entertainment or
fuzzy on whether the whole "Outwit. Outlast. Outplay" thing
constitutes a legitimate sport.</TE>
<TE>   Pundits have long noted that all politics is local--really just a
fancy way of saying that people care most about that which is closest
to them. From that perspective, consider this little exercise a
reminder that most TV viewing begins at home, and when it comes to
taste, your friends and neighbors aren't necessarily as smart--or
stupid--as a cursory glance at the weekly Nielsens might lead you to
believe.</TE>

<HD>VeggieTales Take Plunge With Big-Screen 'Jonah'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Phil Vischer, executive producer, co-writer, co-director and about
half the voice cast for "Jonah--A VeggieTales Movie," is a man who
practices what he preaches. When Vischer learned several years ago
that two Christian bookstores--the primary distribution outlet for
the faith-based, computer-animated VeggieTales video series--had
pooled their resources to rent a movie theater and had charged
admission for people to watch the latest VeggieTale on the big
screen, he did not threaten to unleash a pack of lawyers. He forgave,
and then he got an idea.</LD>
<LD>   "We called them and pointed out that this was just a little bit
illegal, and asked that they donate any profits to charity, which
they did," says Vischer, whose Chicago-based Big Idea Productions
Inc., formed with Mike Nawrocki, a friend since Bible college days,
has produced "VeggieTales" since 1993. "But then we got to thinking
that this was kind of an interesting little grass-roots idea."</LD>
<LD>   Big Idea began sanctioning such theatrical premieres of new
half-hour videos, and when one event in Florida drew an audience of
16,000 for two screenings one Saturday morning, Vischer knew the
stage had been set for producing a full-length feature film.</LD>
<TE>   "Jonah--A VeggieTales Movie," drawn from the biblical story of
Jonah and the whale, is the company's first theatrical feature and
the first film to be released under Artisan Entertainment's FHE
Banner Pictures banner. It features the standard VeggieTales
cast--Larry the Cucumber, Bob the Tomato, Archibald Asparagus, Pa
Grape and a gourd named Mr. Lunt--and the characters still espouse
Judeo-Christian values, although in a manner more closely resembling
John Cleese than John Bunyan.</TE>
<TE>   That combination of moralizing and satirizing has caught on with
parents, who have made VeggieTales a multimillion-dollar franchise
with more than 30 million videos sold. "Jonah" was intended to be one
of those videos, but when work began on it in 1998, it quickly became
clear to Vischer and Nawrocki--who is the film's co-writer,
co-director and much of the other half of the voice cast--that it
could not be contained within a half-hour or 45-minute video.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike settled on a 'Titanic'-like story device [Jonah's story is
set in biblical times but is framed by a second, modern-day story],
and he started writing it, but when he'd hit Page 17 he still hadn't
gotten to the story of Jonah yet," recalls Vischer. "I said, 'Where
are you going with this, Mike?' and he said, 'I'm having fun!' So we
thought, 'OK, maybe this wants to be bigger.' "</TE>
<TE>   It goes without saying that the script deviates from the biblical
tale, and not simply because the title prophet is played by an
asparagus. In the film, Jonah's companions include a turbaned half-
caterpillar/half-worm named Khalil, a deadpan camel named Reginald,
and three bush-league buccaneers Pythonesquely called the Pirates Who
Don't Do Anything.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the decadent citizens of Nineveh, Jonah's ultimate
destination, lie, cheat, steal and hit each other in the face with
fish. There is also a roof-raising gospel number set in the belly of
the whale.</TE>
<TE>   By the spring of 1999, the script had been completed and the songs
composed (mostly by Vischer, Nawrocki, Kurt Heinecke and David
Mullen), but Vischer decided the studio was not quite ready to tackle
a feature. Production did not begin until mid-2000, by which time the
company had produced 15 VeggieTales episodes.</TE>
<TE>   By then, key creative personnel from the big animation shops had
joined the 100-member Big Idea staff in Chicago, including story
supervisor Tim Hodge, who came from Disney's studio in Orlando, Fla.;
producer Ameake Owens, who came from DreamWorks; and executive
producer Dan Philips, who had worked in computer imagery for Disney
and DreamWorks.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that Ameake and Dan brought to the table was
putting this film up in front of the company and getting reactions to
it," Nawrocki says. "Normally, Phil and I would go in and write a
script and then produce it right from the script, with the
storyboards very close to what you saw on the written page. But we
put this film up on story reels and critiqued it, rewrote it, changed
the ending and changed things in the beginning and the middle to make
the ending make sense. All that was new to us."</TE>
<TE>   The decision nine years ago to create a cast of vegetables with no
limbs, hair or--in most cases, clothing--was a major part of what
enabled the Big Idea team to produce a half-hour of
computer-generated animation, which prior to VeggieTales had never
been done in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   By using such simple characters, Nawrocki says, "we could really
concentrate on the emotion of the body language and the animation of
the eyes, though our animation director, Marc Vulcano, will tell you
that being able to emote with a limbless vegetable is sometimes
harder than having all the limbs to work with."</TE>
<TE>   Going from home video to the big screen, however, meant revising
the simplistic character designs.</TE>
<TE>   "The big changeover on the aesthetic side for production design
and art direction was to maintain the style of these characters that
all the fans like, but to increase their visual complexity so that
when we have a close-up or medium close-up on the big screen, it's
more interesting to look at," Philips says.</TE>
<TE>   The "Jonah" cast includes many more incidental characters than in
any of the videos, as well as scenes that include 700 veggie extras.</TE>
<TE>   Studios specializing in computer-generated imagery frequently
write their own software for various phases of production, but for
"Jonah," only Maya 4.0, bought off the shelf, was used. Streamlining
the software pipeline was one way of keeping the budget for the
independently produced film to roughly $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most noticeable difference for fans of the videos is
in the film's lighting and texturing, which is added after the basic
character animation. Outside help had to be recruited for the
lighting phase to keep the film on schedule.</TE>
<TE>   While previous Christian films such as the G-rated "Joshua," and
the more apocalyptic PG-13 "Left Behind" and "Omega Code" series,
have met with conditional mainstream success, FHE and its parent
company have pulled out all the stops in promoting and marketing
"Jonah" to a wide audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It is by far the most extensive promotional campaign this company
has ever had, including our release of 'The Blair Witch Project,' "
says Amir J. Malin, chief executive of Artisan Entertainment. In
addition to the expected tie-ins with church youth organizations and
Christian and country radio stations, there are promotions with Chuck
E. Cheese's restaurants, Wal-Mart, Barnes &amp; Noble, Safeway Stores and
Papa John's Pizza.</TE>
<TE>   FHE will release "Jonah" on 950 screens on Friday, with the intent
of expanding to 1,500 two weeks later. Although the release is
nationwide, the target markets have been carefully chosen.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not devoting our initial release strategy to the Northeast
of the United States," Malin says. "When you look at the demographics
of the VeggieTales series, pockets like New York, Boston and many
areas of the Northeast do not have a large and devoted fan base. But
the Midwest, the South, the Southeast and the central West are
extremely strong components."</TE>
<TE>   Which raises the question: Can a film that, in today's
marketplace, is still considered a niche picture break through with
the kind of splash created by "Shrek"? Or, perhaps more pertinently,
by 1998's "The Prince of Egypt," DreamWorks' animated retelling of
the Moses story, which grossed more than $100 million domestically?</TE>
<TE>   Vischer, for one, has faith. "Yes, it is a niche," he says, "but
it's a huge niche; it's the mother of all niches."</TE>

<LD>   Lincoln Center Seeks Architect to Shape Space</LD>
<LD>   Officials at New York's Lincoln Center, looking for a designer to
shape 6.3 acres of public space as part of a $1.2-billion
redevelopment effort, have invited five architects to submit
proposals.</LD>
<TE>   Twelve resident companies share the 16-acre Lincoln Center site,
including the Juilliard School, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York
City Ballet, the New York City Opera and the New York Philharmonic,
and the complex's individual venues will conduct separate
architectural competitions.</TE>
<TE>   The first of those is Avery Fisher Hall, home of the New York
Philharmonic, which expects to name an architect in November.</TE>
<TE>   The public-space invitation to architects calls for designers to
form teams, each including a master planner and landscape architect,
along with graphics and lighting consultants.</TE>
<TE>   A winner is to be chosen in December. The five invited architects
are:</TE>
<TE>   * Santiago Calatrava, a Spanish designer whose work includes an
addition to the Milwaukee Art Museum that was completed last year.</TE>
<TE>   * Cooper Robertson &amp; Partners, a New York firm whose work includes
campus plans for Trinity College, Hartford, Conn.; and the master
plan for the community of Celebration, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   * Diller &amp; Scofidio, a New York husband-and-wife team who recently
won the assignment of designing a new home for the Institute of
Contemporary Art in Boston. Elizabeth Diller and Ricardo Scofidio in
1999 shared a MacArthur "genius" fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   * Foster &amp; Partners, the London-based firm, led by Sir Norman
Foster, that designed the new German Parliament in Berlin and is
working on a new Hearst Corp. headquarter building in New York.</TE>
<TE>   * Richard Meier, New York-based designer of the Getty Center in
Los Angeles and the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona, Spain.</TE>
<TE>   The Meier and Foster firms are among the finalists for the Avery
Fisher Hall job (along with Madrid-based Jose Rafael Moneo, designer
of L.A.'s Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels). They're also among
the six design teams vying to redesign the World Trade Center site in
Lower Manhattan.</TE>

<TE>   Famed Printmaker Gives Art to Rutgers</TE>
<TE>   Artist June Wayne, who revived printmaking in the 1960s at her
famed Tamarind Lithography Workshop in Los Angeles, has donated 3,325
artworks valued at $5.47 million to the Mason Gross School of the
Arts at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   The gift includes 2,555 prints and four tapestries by Wayne; the
rest were created by 128 other artists who have worked with her. Two
hundred of the donated prints will be sold at auction in New York on
Nov. 21 to benefit the Rutgers Center for Innovative Print and Paper.</TE>
<TE>   To further enhance its status as a hub of modern printmaking,
Rutgers also has appointed Wayne a research professor at the
university. She will lecture, work with students and create work with
the center's staff of printers, typographers and papermakers.</TE>

<TE>   Repairs to Begin</TE>
<TE>   at El Rey Theatre</TE>
<TE>   Repairs at the El Rey Theatre are expected to begin next week, but
the theater's owner said Tuesday that the busy concert venue will
probably remain closed for the rest of October.</TE>
<TE>   The damage occurred Sept. 15 when a production company filming a
Faith Hill performance for a TV special overloaded a ceiling truss
with lighting, said Rodney Nardi, the owner of the 1936 building in
the Miracle Mile district.</TE>
<TE>   Several concerts have been canceled or relocated since the
incident. No announcement has been made about the Bright Eyes
concerts scheduled for Oct. 10 and 11. Other shows still on this
month's schedule include Tammy Faye Bakker, Sweden's (International)
Noise Conspiracy and an electroclash package featuring Peaches and
Chicks on Speed.</TE>

<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Fox News Channel Bests Cable Rivals for Viewers</TE>
<TE>   The Fox News Channel remained the most-watched cable news channel
in the third quarter, continuing the dominance it first attained at
the beginning of the year. It was the only news channel to add
viewers, compared to a year earlier, when all cable news outlets
showed a surge in viewing because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   According to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday,
Fox's average number of viewers for a day in July, August and
September was 626,000, up 23% from a year earlier. CNN had an average
516,000 viewers, down 26% from the third quarter of 2001 (although
the network said that if the post-Sept. 11 period is factored out
from last year, it gained 54%).</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC, with an average 250,000 viewers, was off 35%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KCBS-TV Moving Up</TE>
<TE>   Its Midday Newscast</TE>
<TE>   KCBS-TV Channel 2 will shift its midday weekday newscast from noon
to 11 a.m. next week to avoid overlap with the noon newscast on
sister station KCAL-TV Channel 9. That means the jointly operated
Viacom stations together will offer 11 hours of local news
programming each weekday, none of it overlapping.</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the change, KCBS will move the soap opera "The
Young and the Restless" from an 11 a.m. start to 11:30.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   AFI Fest 2002 will pay tribute to Michael Caine with screenings of
six of his older films Nov. 11-13 at the Skirball Cultural Center and
with a showing of his latest, "The Quiet American," at ArcLight
Hollywood on Nov. 17.... Jazz saxophonist Joshua Redman's show
tonight at the Knitting Factory in Hollywood has been canceled, but
he will perform there as scheduled Thursday.</TE>

<HD>Studios Turn Up the Heat for DVD Sales</HD>
<DH>Movies* Sometimes, the home release earns more than the
theatrical showing. So 'Scorpion King' brings on the fire-eaters and
dancers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GINA PICCALO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The crowd of photographers trained cameras on the billboard for the
Hollywood spectacle of the evening: a movie scene reenactment
complete with an ear-splitting explosion of flames, an elevated stage
crowded with beefy men in warrior costumes dueling it out with
make-believe swords and a flock of young women dressed as belly
dancers writhing nearby.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, the flames grew taller, the music grew louder and the
star warrior rappelled down a wire over the audience, landing near a
trio of camels for the grand finale. Moments later, the entire
caravan, writhing women, camels and all, crossed Sunset Boulevard to
the Virgin Megastore across the street, where confused shoppers were
rapidly overrun by belly dancers, snake handlers and jugglers.</LD>
<LD>   "Can you believe this is all for a DVD release?" one woman asked
as she waded through the crowd. "Unbelievable."</LD>
<TE>   But for Universal Studios' home video marketing team, which
planned the Monday night extravaganza to publicize the rollout of the
DVD release of "The Scorpion King," the promotional event was worth
every dime. "We're going to have people rushing to retailers," said
Craig Kornblau, vice president of home video for the studio, as he
rattled off the chains that will carry the new release, which arrived
in stores on Tuesday.The mammoth traffic-stopping affair underscores
the importance Hollywood attaches to the sale of DVDs, a 5-year-old
technology that has become a major moneymaker for the studios--often
exceeding the profits studios earn from feature releases. The feature
release of a "franchise" film like "Scorpion King" (which was a
spinoff from Universal's popular "The Mummy" series) serves as a
platform for the lucrative DVD and video release, which can in turn
heighten interest in doing a sequel.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the home video release of "The Scorpion King,"
Universal hopes to earn more than $36 million in the first week of
sales, more than the first week of box office for the film's
theatrical release. (The film's total domestic gross was $90.3
million.)</TE>
<TE>   "One of the profound things that have happened in the DVD market
is the raw amount of consumer consumption," said Robert Chapek,
president of Buena Vista Home Entertainment. "Back in VHS days,
consumers only bought about five (videos) a year.... Now, in the DVD
world, it's like a brush fire. People are buying on average 15 titles
a year."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, after the big explosions and parade of stars
("Scorpion King" co-star Kelly Hu flew in from the Canadian set of
"X-Men" for the event), the real challenge appeared to be rounding up
the cast to cross Sunset Boulevard. "Could I please have all the
harem girls and all the warriors join the camels," an announcer
shouted. Few people responded. The camels bared their teeth and
circled the parking lot. The harem girls mugged for a slew of
photographers. Hu furrowed her brow as the costumed warriors
surrounded her.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the shopping center, the group moved toward the entrance of
the Virgin Megastore, which was, according to event publicists,
supposed to receive the first DVD of "The Scorpion King" via camel.
Instead, the camels were parked near the street as the caravan moved
into the shopping center.</TE>
<TE>   All this excitement is taking place just as studios prepare for a
record-setting fall for DVD releases. "We should see how high is up
this quarter," noted Chapek.</TE>
<TE>   More films are being released this season on DVD than ever before,
because the public has such a voracious appetite for the technology,
studio executives say. DVD "has reinvigorated the home entertainment
business," said Mike Dunn, executive vice president of 20th Century
Fox Home Entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Twentieth Century Fox expects its animated feature "Ice Age," due
out two days before Thanksgiving, to earn $300 million in home video
sales, or twice its $175-million box office draw.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, home video was primarily targeted to cinefiles and
parents who bought animated features for their children. Now,
however, DVDs contain features like games and outtakes that appeal to
a broader demographic group. "It's bringing new people into the
marketplace," said Dunn.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, every studio is scrambling to land release dates early
and get their DVDs out first. Although the season to market home
video traditionally begins Nov. 1, in time for holiday shoppers,
studios are launching family-friendly titles by late September.
Released in mid-September, Disney/Pixar's "Monsters, Inc." sold 11
million DVDs and videocassettes in the U.S. and Canada, beating
first-week sales for DreamWorks SKG's animated feature "Shrek" and
falling second only to Disney's videocassette release in the early
1990s of "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   But DVD sales records are broken almost as quickly as they are
set. Home video releases for big movies, like "Panic Room" or
"Spider-Man" are scheduled almost every week. "They're lined up like
airplanes over O'Hare," said Universal's Kornblau.</TE>
<TE>   For the studios, the first week of a DVD release is crucial;
that's when 40% of the sales take place, according to home video
marketers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to build on the audience awareness that was there
initially," said Universal's Kornblau. "We have to bring it all back
so people are willing to spend more money to own this movie ... to
create that urgency to buy."</TE>
<TE>   Hence Universal's big show in Hollywood for "Scorpion King." It
seemed to be making an impression. Outside the Virgin Megastore, a
few clerks gawked at the harem girls who teased shoppers with an
impromptu performance. "It's awesome!" said one male clerk to a
co-worker. "Did you see the guy eating fire outside?"</TE>

<HD>The Mondavis Toast the Arts</HD>
<DH>Culture* A $10-million gift helped build a UC Davis venue
that will open Thursday with a gala.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert and Margrit Mondavi, the wine tycoons who contributed nearly
$30 million to the opening of the COPIA wine and food museum in Napa
last year, this week mark another grand opening: a performing arts
facility at UC Davis.</LD>
<LD>   The Robert and Margrit Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts, UC
Davis, a $57-million project, will open with a gala on Thursday. The
sandstone-clad center includes an 1,800-seat theater and a more
flexible 250-seat studio theater space. Until now, the largest indoor
venue on campus has held about 1,300.</LD>
<LD>   The opening, which will feature the San Francisco Symphony, gives
Davis more options for presenting a variety of cultural events and
adds a venue for the university's music, theater and dance
departments. The 104,000-square-foot building was designed by
Portland, Ore.-based BOORA Architects.</LD>
<TE>   About $10 million toward the center came from the Mondavis, who
live near Davis, in the Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Mondavi, 89, founded the Robert Mondavi Winery in Oakville in
1966. That venture has grown into an empire that includes 16 labels.
Mondavi retains the title of chairman emeritus. Margrit Biever
Mondavi serves as vice president of cultural affairs at the winery.
An additional $25 million in Mondavi money is earmarked for a Robert
Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Science at the university.</TE>
<TE>   The University of California Board of Regents also contributed to
the cost of building the performing arts center, with a loan of $15.4
million; other public and private donations accounted for the rest of
the cost.</TE>
<TE>   Other performers in the 106-event, first-year schedule include
Yo-Yo Ma, Pat Metheny, Philip Glass, the Academy of St. Martin in the
Fields, Joshua Bell, the Boys Choir of Harlem and a touring
production of "Rent."</TE>

8:30 with perhaps its funniest show to date, as a stunned George
witnesses the unraveling of a long-held family secret.</LD>
<LD>   Lopez, a stand-up comic who was staked to the sitcom last year by
executive producer Sandra Bullock and her company, is back as George,
an aerospace assembly-line worker in L.A. who wins a promotion to
plant manager. But he has returned as a much more self-assured
performer who has also managed to lose last season's distracting
habit of popping his eyes while delivering punch lines. And it's a
good thing, because the premiere is stuffed with killer lines from
writer Rachel Sweet, with Lee Shallat Chemel ably handling direction.</LD>
<LD>   A chance meeting with a relative tonight results in George
learning that the father his mother Benny (Belita Moreno) had told
him had been dead for nearly 40 years instead may be alive. Benny
tries to explain why she deceived him, but that only seems to make
things worse.</LD>
<TE>   "Who knows what else she lied to me about?" George muses. "Maybe
Santa Claus does like Mexican kids!"</TE>
<TE>   He fantasizes about his father (played by Esai Morales) in some
truly funny flashback and dream sequences, and George begins
wrestling with the idea of trying to track him down. The wife
(Constance Marie as Angie) and kids (Masiela Lusha as Carmen and Luis
Armand Garcia as Max) provide some support, but they have their hands
full with their own problems, namely a sickly dog they rescue from
the streets.</TE>
<TE>   "The George Lopez Show" had its moments last year, but now the
series appears to have found the rhythm it needs to become a breakout
hit. Now if the Lopezes can only find George's dad.</TE>

<LD>Round 1 of the new TV season has gone to CBS, as a double dose of
"Everybody Loves Raymond" and two editions of "CSI"--including record
tune-in for the original--helped lift the network past NBC, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   NBC did hold a solid advantage among key young-adult demographics
thanks to strong performances from "Friends," "Frasier," "The West
Wing," "ER" (off 5% from its 2001 opener), and its new Sunday-drama
lineup of "American Dreams," "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" and
"Boomtown."</LD>
<LD>   "Criminal Intent," in fact, looks to be a third hit under the "Law
&amp; Order" umbrella, drawing its biggest Sunday audience yet against
formidable competition from ABC's "Alias" and HBO's "The Sopranos,"
which drew almost 11 million viewers despite being received by only
about a third of U.S. homes.</LD>
<TE>   "The Practice" won its time slot, though viewing was down more
than 20% versus last year's premiere. "My Wife &amp; Kids" was among
ABC's few other standouts, easily surpassing Fox's "The Bernie Mac
Show" on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "CSI: Miami" and NBC's Sunday shows, new series
generating solid sampling generally drafted off existing hits, such
as "Good Morning Miami" and "Hidden Hills," which followed "Will &amp;
Grace" and "Frasier," respectively. Results were mixed for CBS on
Friday, as "Hack" showed promise--siphoning viewers away from Fox's
"John Doe"--while "Robbery Homicide Division" lost over a third of
that audience.</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Film Festival Picking Up Steam</HD>
<DH>Movies* It's not Cannes or Sundance, but the local event is
getting beyond growing pains with help from studios and stars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the fall of 1997, the Hollywood Film Festival was born in
controversy.</LD>
<LD>   No sooner had Carlos de Abreu, its flamboyant founder, author and
entrepreneur, announced plans to hold his festival that October than
he found himself deflecting criticism that he was brazenly attempting
to steal the limelight from the more prestigious American Film
Institute's Los Angeles International Film Festival, opening only a
week later.</LD>
<LD>   Rather than ruffle more feathers, De Abreu pushed up the festival
the following year to August, where it remained until this year.</LD>
<TE>   While it still has a long way to go to ever rival Cannes, Sundance
or Toronto in the pantheon of film festivals, the Hollywood Film
Festival has not only managed to survive some bumps along the road,
but it has also attracted top stars and film executives.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rydell, one of the festival's founding members, credits the
studios' insatiable appetite for publicity and De Abreu's
determination for overcoming many hurdles in the festival's six short
years.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no avoiding that there is an edge of promotion in all of
this," Rydell said with a soft chuckle. "That's part of it. But as
long as its heart is in the right place, as long as the festival
continues to encourage young filmmakers and foreign filmmakers ...
that is the pulse of the Hollywood Film Festival. That is what gives
it merit."</TE>
<TE>   Rydell, who directed "On Golden Pond," "For the Boys" and the TV
movie "James Dean," calls De Abreu a "very determined promoter."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to hand it to Carlos," he added. "Everybody was against
him at the start, and he managed to survive."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, few people in the industry were predicting that the
festival would be around long.</TE>
<TE>   To make matters worse, the festival that year became the subject
of embarrassing publicity when the sponsor of a dinner honoring the
festival reportedly paid one of L.A.'s top restaurants, L'Orangerie,
with a check for $35,006 only to have it bounce.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant sued the sponsor, Marie-Jacelyn Rousseau of Mustang
Films, a French company with an L.A. office, along with De Abreu and
the festival, in Los Angeles Superior Court. De Abreu and the
festival were later dropped from the suit when it was determined that
they had no role in making the arrangements for the dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sued, we had nothing to do with it, and therefore, me and
the festival were dropped from the suit," he recalled. "I had nothing
to do with this. It's old news."</TE>
<TE>   The main criticism of the festival in the intervening years was
that it had trouble attracting quality films that would boost its
image among competing festivals. It is still struggling to achieve
this, but along the way, it has managed to attract major studios,
which have embraced the festival as a publicity tool.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, the festival will kick off at the ArcLight theaters in
Hollywood with the world premiere of DreamWorks' "The Ring," a horror
thriller starring Naomi Watts as a newspaper reporter who probes the
case of four teenagers who met with mysterious deaths exactly one
week after watching a weird video. Not coincidentally, the festival
is bestowing its "Hollywood Breakthrough Acting Award" on the
English-born actress while also honoring DreamWorks co-founder
Jeffrey Katzenberg with the first "Tex Avery Animation Award," given
to an individual or group that has nurtured and advanced the art form
of animation.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of this year's festival will be the screening
Thursday at the ArcLight of the comedy "My Wife Maurice," by French
director Jean-Marie Poire, who is scheduled to participate in a
question-and-answer session.</TE>
<TE>   The festival will close Sunday night at the ArcLight with a
screening of Paramount Pictures' "Narc," which stars Ray Liotta and
Jason Patric in the story of a former narcotics officer who is lured
back to investigate the murder of a policeman. Festival officials
said Tom Cruise, one of the film's producers, has committed to
attending.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, about 1,200 guests are expected at the festival's
closing black-tie awards banquet at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in
Beverly Hills. In addition to Watts and Katzenberg, the festival will
honor actress Jodie Foster, directors Martin Scorsese and McG,
screenwriter Robert Towne, producers Douglas Wick and Lucy Fisher,
and Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America,
to name a few.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers say that celebrities who have already committed to
attend include Halle Berry, Drew Barrymore, Danny DeVito, Cameron
Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio, Colin Farrell, Lucy Liu, Garry Marshall,
Matthew McConaughey, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Steven Spielberg, Billy
Crystal, Benicio Del Toro and Elizabeth Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   The festival is sponsored by Yahoo Movies, Hollywood Video, the
European Union Commission and Hollywood's two trade publications,
Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. The money for the festival comes
from sponsorships as well as revenues generated from ticket sales and
passes. Organizers predict that more than 25,000 people will attend
this year's festival.</TE>
<TE>   De Abreu, 48, disclosed that Tom Hanks has been named actor of the
year for "Road to Perdition," Jennifer Aniston actress of the year
for "The Good Girl," and "Minority Report" was named film of the
year. To select the winners, the festival first asks 35 producers,
industry executives and agents to suggest six nominees in each
category. The names and movies with the most votes are placed on Web
sites run by "Entertainment Tonight," Yahoo Movies and Hollywood
Video, where the public can vote for the winners.</TE>
<TE>   Although he knows many key players in Hollywood, De Abreu is not
an industry insider.</TE>
<TE>   Exiled from Mozambique after colonial rule in that Portuguese
colony was overthrown in a military coup in the mid-1970s, De Abreu
fled to South Africa and then to Portugal. He later deserted the
Portuguese air force and went to Brazil before landing in the U.S. in
1977. From there, he became a marketing executive with Cartier
jewelers, married Janice Pennington, a model who displays prizes on
Bob Barker's popular TV game show, "The Price Is Right," co-wrote
with his wife a book about his life and wrote another book, "Opening
the Doors to Hollywood: How to Sell Your Idea, Story, Book,
Screenplay, Manuscript."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, he discovered that no one had thought of naming a film
festival after the industry's hometown, so he contacted the state of
California and registered the rights to what he believed was a
marketable brand name: Hollywood Film Festival. Indeed, he has
managed a host of Web sites geared to the Hollywood brand.</TE>
<TE>   De Abreu likes to boast that his festival "bridges the gap between
established Hollywood and the global creative community."</TE>
<TE>   In years past, the festival relied on the Paramount studio in
Hollywood to screen some of its films, but because of heightened
security stemming from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this year's
screenings are being held at the ArcLight in Hollywood. Industry
panels will be held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Tickets for
each screening are available for $8, and a festival package allowing
entry to all screenings, parties, seminars and the closing gala costs
$695.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, De Abreu has added a humanitarian dimension to
the festival. Last year, for example, the festival honored 1996 Nobel
Peace Prize co-winner Jose Ramos-Horta for his work on behalf of the
oppressed people of East Timor. This year, the festival will play
host to a humanitarian symposium, chaired by Jody Williams, who won
the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize for her work toward the banning and
clearing of land mines.</TE>
<TE>   One of De Abreu's long-range visions is to swing a TV deal for his
closing-night gala, not unlike the Golden Globes on NBC, which is
hosted by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the Hollywood Film Festival to be known as just
another little film festival in town," he says. "I want it to be
known as an international film festival--that whatever we do here is
boosted around the world."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In this week's diary of a mad suburb, we find that autumn has
arrived, the children have gone back to school and a pregnant woman
is chasing ants around her new kitchen, the one with the brushed
stainless-steel appliances and the new chrome toaster, all sullied by
these ants. Ants. Ants. Everywhere ants.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like I have to get up 10 minutes early just to start killing
them," my wife notes.</LD>
<LD>   "And we appreciate that," I say.</LD>
<TE>   In the last few weeks, she's become like a character out of "The
Sopranos," pregnant and homicidal at the same time, killing things
just as she is giving life to others. It's one of those
contradictions you find a lot in an American suburb.</TE>
<TE>   "I think," she tells me, "you're going to have to crawl under the
house and spray."</TE>
<TE>   Sure, I could do that. But this is her war. Fights it like this
every fall. And if she's not slaying ants, who knows where her
attention may turn.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't bring me into this," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, look!" she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Huh?"</TE>
<TE>   "They're coming from under the stove," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As Cheever and Updike found, a suburb is no place for a grown man.
A suburb is a great place for a kid or a mom or a nice tomato garden.
But not necessarily for a man.</TE>
<TE>   Men need more activities. They need a trout pond in the mountains,
or a ballpark on a city street. A suburb has neither of these. All a
suburb has is, well....</TE>
<TE>   "Ants," I say to my friend Bill. "You guys have ants?"</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he says, "everyone has ants this time of year."</TE>
<TE>   "So what do you do about them?"</TE>
<TE>   "We just learn to love 'em," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Fat chance. Not in the suburbs. Generally, a suburb is not a place
renowned for its tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect Bill is climbing under the house right now with a
flashlight and a can of Raid and wondering if he's being watched by
creatures that can see in the dark. Skunks. Black widows. The widows'
attorneys. Sweating a little, all of them.</TE>
<TE>   That's what Bill is doing. Firing his big blue can of unscented
Raid in the dark at ant trails, real and imagined, then high-tailing
it back to the warm glow of a football game on TV. I know Bill too
well. I know his wife, too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Back at our house, meanwhile, the Sopranos are taking a stab at
tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what Bill says?" I ask my wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill says they like their ants," I tell her. "Can't get enough."</TE>
<TE>   "Really?"</TE>
<TE>   "That's what he said."</TE>
<TE>   "Then you can take him our ants," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "What about him?" I ask.</TE>
<TE>   To this day, I have poor communication skills, a shortcoming I
blame on a childhood of listening to Chicago politicians mangle the
language, then get reelected anyway, time and again. One hand on the
microphone, another doing deals behind your back.</TE>
<TE>   Daley. Roman Pucinski. Even Abe Gibron. What kind of role models
were these for Chicago's school kids? You'd sit in class learning
about syntax, then go home and listen to a bunch of marble-mouthed
public figures substituting "da" for "the" and "dere-fore" for
"therefore" on the evening news.</TE>
<TE>   After a childhood of that, it's no wonder my marriage has moments
of absolute unclarity. It's amazing I can speak at all.</TE>
<TE>   "Oooooo," my wife says.</TE>
<TE>   "What now?"</TE>
<TE>   "The baby just kicked," she says.</TE>
<TE>   My wife stands there rubbing her tummy, big as a bowling ball and
active, too. She is now seven months along with this miracle
pregnancy, proof that no matter how busy God gets, he still
appreciates a good chuckle at the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the baby even wakes my wife in the night, a moment she
just has to share with me and the dog, happily spooning right next to
her, dreaming our male dreams, throwing touchdowns and destroying our
enemies in our sleep.</TE>
<TE>   "Whaaaah?" I mumble. "What's wrong?"</TE>
<TE>   "He's kicking again," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Go back to sleep," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, look at that," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Ants?"</TE>
<TE>   "The full moon," she says peering out the window. "It's going over
the mountain."</TE>
<TE>   So at 3 in the morning, my wife, the dog and I sit at the window
watching the harvest moon go over the spine of a nearby mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, look, look," she says as if spotting angels in the moonlight.</TE>
<TE>   "OK already, I'm looking," I say.</TE>
<TE>   The dog licks my ear. The baby kicks my wife's bladder. Who says a
long marriage lacks intimacy? We sit there watching the moon, while
being caressed and pummeled. She rubs her belly. I palm my tired
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "My tummy, it's hard as a drum," she says, to which I respond,
"He's all muscle, like his father," to which she responds, "But I
think he's smart, too," to which I respond, "Whadaya mean by that,
exactly?"</TE>
<TE>   Imagine 20 years of marriage filled with conversations like this.
Each day, dialogue right out of Proust.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So, this is how our nights often go lately. The days aren't quite
as memorable, though last weekend we had a thrilling soccer game, in
which we allowed three quick goals--Bam! Bam! Bam!-- and I finally
threw my pen to the ground in disgust, which was kind of embarrassing
in retrospect a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   I haven't thrown anything at a soccer game in three years, not
since I slammed my clipboard to the ground and caught my ankle bone
instead. Ouch. Still have the scar.</TE>
<TE>   It's something you never forget, throwing something at a soccer
game, in front of friends and foes, neither of which will ever let
you live it down. In a suburb, they save such moments like baby
teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm leaving," I say to my wife, after explaining the
soccer fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally," my wife asks. "Where to?"</TE>
<TE>   "Back to college," I say.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, back to college. A new career. A fresh start. Back to a place
where eager young minds like mine are appreciated and nurtured.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, your daughter needs some bookshelves put up," my wife says.
"Maybe you could visit her."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm on my way," I say.</TE>
<TE>   And with visions of fresh starts and frat parties, I head off
again for college. A place of genuine tolerance. Cradle of the
American dream.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Old New York's professional night crawlers threw a gargantuan
retro-decadent party in the East Village on Monday night to toast the
city's mythic nocturnal life and introduce ClubNation, the first
national convention of the nightclub industry.</LD>
<LD>   The glory days of New York City nightclubbing were re-created at
Webster Hall, a cavernous, 5,000-capacity space that was the scene of
some of the wildest alternative parties 100 years ago--and that this
week has served as the site for ClubNation's "four-day-and-night
bender" of panel discussions, exhibits, talent showcases and parties.</LD>
<TE>   Kicked off on Sunday afternoon and attracting an estimated 5,000
clubland professionals from around the nation, the convention has
lived up to its "unconventional" billing. While Rob Bookman, an
attorney for the New York Nightlife Assn., and Tim Santamour, a
prominent nightlife activist, seriously discussed their frustrations
with city leaders during a panel on "Nightclubs and the Law," vendors
showed off their goods in an exhibit hall that also featured a DJ and
go-go dancers. Some companies set up typical booths, such as the
Wedge, from Boston, which sells lemon slicers for bars, but others
had more fun. Alize offered free body-painting and served up its
flavored-cognac drinks from a Hawaiian-style bar. Although no Los
Angeles nightclubs were represented on the panels, other West Coast
venues, such as DNA Lounge in San Francisco and Ra in Las Vegas,
showcased their dancers and DJs. The convention ends tonight with
another big bash that includes the Golden Turntable DJ awards, which
organizers are calling "The Academy Awards of Dance Music."</TE>
<TE>   Monday night's Bartenders Ball, the highlight of the convention's
nightly events, was rife with revelers and denizens dressed in the
elaborate costumes of nightlife heydays. Mixed in with a small but
noticeable vanilla Wall Street crowd and other straight-up club
industry types were saloon prostitutes and lounge lizards; club
gangsters and club kids; drag queens in bridal wear or Cher wear; and
fetish-inspired men, women and all genders in between.</TE>
<TE>   "Since [former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's] regime, it's been very
hard for the nightclubs and entertainers to survive, but this crowd
is really doing a lot to keep nightlife alive in this city, and
they're making it OK for alternative people, creative people and
freaky people to come out and have fun again," said a graphic artist
and belly dancer who goes by "Miss Webb" and was dressed like a
corseted Bowery hooker. "I really applaud them for fighting to keep a
safe haven where people can express themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers of ClubNation are hoping it becomes an annual forum.
Monday night's bash, they declared, reinforced their position that
valuable social trends are started in nightclubs, and that city
leaders should view their establishments as big business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a critical time for New York," said Chi Chi Valenti, a
20-year veteran of the scene and the ball's co-producer and mistress
of ceremonies. "This is an ultraconservative time. The gentrification
of the entire city is the biggest single thing. I think we have more
important things to do in America this year than to keep going after
the nightclubs, and I think ClubNation is going to make a really good
point of that. It's a bad time for clubs, but if you look around you,
there are still plenty of people wanting to go out and express
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   People like the stunning and statuesque Rose Wood, who restores
antiques by day and is a burlesque and strip-tease dancer by night.
Dressed in a rhinestone-encrusted, semi-sheer Middle Eastern harlot
costume, Wood said the efforts of leaders to turn the city into
another Disney World undermines the creative spark it is renowned
for.</TE>
<TE>   "New York has represented one of the pinnacles of nightlife for
the world, and the attempts by the former mayor to suppress this
source of cultural rejuvenation is altogether wrong," she said. "I
love this party. I know a lot of the people. I love how everybody is
dressed. It's a place where you can express yourself freely."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nightlife Dynasties</TE>
<TE>   The Bartender's Ball was produced by three of the city's
old-school dynasties: Jackie 60, named after a club where Valenti
manned the door; fashion designer Patricia Field, who has been
dressing clubgoers for two decades but is best known today for
costuming "Sex and the City"; and Susanne Bartsch, of early 1990s
Copacabana nightclub fame.</TE>
<TE>   While hip-hop, reggae, and dance music thumped in two of Webster
Hall's smaller lounges, the two-story main ballroom, with a VIP area
hosted by Heineken, was the venue for the historic annual ball, which
invites bartenders from all over the city to come out from behind
their bars and be served for a change.</TE>
<TE>   The Jackie 60 gang staged a musical extravaganza that chronicled
the nocturnal habits of New Yorkers in the 19th and 20th centuries,
from the secret transvestite bars of post-Civil War Greenwich Village
to the Bowery's notorious opium dens to the speak-easies of the
Prohibition. A fetish performance by the House of Domination and a
burlesque troupe were also featured in a show that lasted too long
for partygoers who were anticipating the arrival of internationally
known DJ Louis Osbourne, son of rock star Ozzy Osbourne. Now living
temporarily in Los Angeles, the world traveler came to ClubNation to
make his mark on the electronica scene in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   When Osbourne, 27, finally appeared after 1 a.m., he spun his
turntables for 25 minutes before he was asked to take a break so the
Jackie 60 show could continue. "This is not the way Louis builds a
party," his girlfriend, Louise Lennon, 28, said backstage.</TE>
<TE>   By the time a frustrated Osbourne returned an hour later to play
his hypnotic house and tribal music, almost no one was left on the
dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a Moulin Rouge type of thing," said Lina Gines, 21, a
coat-checker from Club Twirl who was trying to make sense of the
Jackie 60 production.</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge on crack," interjected her friend, Leslie Guadalupe,
21, who also works at Twirl.</TE>
<TE>   "Not crack," Gines answered. "I think it's Moulin Rouge with some
porno."</TE>

<HD>A Dirty Secret Is Out: Cleanliness Can Be Bad for Your
Kids' Health</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Howard Hughes were alive, he would just die.</LD>
<LD>   Everything seemed to be going according to neurotic-compulsive
plan. The army of household cleaners and disinfectants, including a
new undercover corps disguised as aromatherapy, has been growing by
the day. Disinfectant wipes, now available in every size and scent,
are as ubiquitous as Kleenex, and wee bottles of liquid alcohol-based
hand cleanser clink alongside keys and lipstick in bags and
briefcases. Disposable instant mops line the shelves. We had entered
the Age of the Germaphobe.</LD>
<LD>   For parents, especially, the message was clear: A clean house is a
good house, a safe house, a healthy house. If we loved our children,
we would raise them on sleek, blinding white floors. Our grout would
be pure as the driven snow. We would banish dust bunnies as if they
were dragons, dog hair as if it were toxic waste. Dirt is unnatural,
dust is the enemy, freedom is slavery, etc.</LD>
<TE>   Then along came a little study titled "Environmental Exposure to
Endotoxin and Its Relation to Asthma in School-Age Children," the
title page of which should be framed and hung in every home in
America. Because this European study, published in the September
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, suggests that dirt,
even those weird gritty crumbs lurking beneath your child's bed, is a
good thing.</TE>
<TE>   Analyzing the environments and asthma rates of more than 800 farm
children in Switzerland, Austria and Germany, researchers discovered
that increased exposure to germs from animal waste coincided with a
markedly low rate of allergies.</TE>
<TE>   Only 3% of the farm children suffered from asthma, 4% from other
allergies. In cleaner households, 6% of children had asthma and 11%
suffered from hay fever.</TE>
<TE>   According to the researchers, exposure at a young age to
endotoxins--bits of bacterial cell walls from farm animals and other
sources--may strengthen the immune system. In other words, a house
can be too clean to be healthful.</TE>
<TE>   This could mark the first time in history that the New England
Journal of Medicine has better newsstand sales than People.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at the Journal of the American Medical Assn.,
preliminary findings from another study indicated that early exposure
to multiple animals also lowers the chance of a child developing
allergies.</TE>
<TE>   A study of 474 children found that those exposed to two or more
cats or dogs during the first year of life were half as likely to
become allergic to pets, ragweed, grass and dust mites.</TE>
<TE>   Dog hair and dirt as childhood inoculations. How much better could
it get?</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, there has been a theory bouncing around for years that
connects the recent surge in allergy rates--asthma has almost doubled
since 1980, according to the CDC--with our growing obsession with
cleanliness.</TE>
<TE>   According to the "hygiene hypothesis," humans have always had
close contact with dirt and animals, and this exposure to bacteria
stimulated the immune system. A sheltered, over-wiped immune system,
some researchers say, tends to be high-strung and will overreact to
pollen, particles and dust.</TE>
<TE>   For most people, this blazing burst of information will be right
up there with the invention of disposable diapers, the remote control
and democracy. Because now, armed with scientific analysis, people
can walk through their homes, as streaky and dusty as they may be,
with a new perspective. That's not nauseating crud peeking out from
beneath the refrigerator, it's an allergy prevention program. Those
are not reproachful nests of dog hair crouched in the corners of the
dining room, but asthma treatments. That is not a dirty kitchen
floor, that is a time-honored method of making healthy, happy immune
systems.</TE>
<TE>   Now if those researchers would only take another look at the
nutritional possibility of French fries....</TE>

<LD>One Foot in America</LD>
<LD>   Yiddish is the language and culture of Jewish people who lived
long ago, in such countries as Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Russia and
Romania. Yiddish combines words derived from many sources including
German, Hebrew, French and Polish. Many Yiddish words have become
English words such as "schlep" (to carry or drag things), "chutzpah"
(to have nerve or act boldly), and "bagel" (a small, leavened round
bread).</LD>
<LD>   Between 1880 and 1920, many Jews came to America looking for a
better life. Most spoke Yiddish and brought their culture and customs
with them to communities they formed in New York City, particularly
in a neighborhood called the Lower East Side. Because they missed the
"old country," these Jews continued doing things they did back home,
such as dancing to klezmer, their original folk music, speaking
Yiddish and eating such foods as borscht (beet soup), pickles and
bagels.</LD>
<TE>   You can see how these immigrants created their new world in
America Sunday at the Skirball's family festival "One Foot in
America: The Lower East Side." The bustling neighborhood will be
re-created with vendors selling pickles and egg creams from
pushcarts, and with live klezmer music, dancing, street games and
storytelling. Learn Yiddish words and perhaps trace your family roots
back to Ellis Island, the place where many immigrants first arrived
in New York. The festival is part of Yiddishkayt, Los Angeles'
weeklong festival celebrating Yiddish culture. For more information,
call (310) 440-4500 or visit www.skirball.org.</TE>

<HD>Close Vote Reveals Wide Gap on LA Weekly's Labor Issues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The LA Weekly's advertising and promotional employees have voted not
to unionize, but months of contention leading up to Friday's
balloting appear to have left a residue of discord and disillusion at
the city's leading alternative newspaper.</LD>
<LD>   The question was decided by a two-vote margin: 15 eligible
employees cast ballots against joining Local 201 of the International
Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which already represents
the paper's journalists and other editorial employees; 13 voters
supported expanded unionization at the Weekly, which is a major
profit center in the national chain of alternative papers owned by
New York-based Village Voice Media.</LD>
<LD>   Under federal law, the organizing effort cannot be formally
renewed for one year.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, it was a very close vote," said Beth Sestanovich, the
Weekly's publisher. "I have to deal with the fact that almost as many
of our advertising and promotional people wanted the union as didn't.
We took the position that there were good solid business reasons not
to unionize the advertising side, and we stand by our views on that.
But clearly, there are issues we need to resolve with those who want
the union, and my office is open to address them."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Sestanovich said, she believes the union's
organizing campaign was misleading and divisive. "It became
unnecessarily personal," she said. "At the beginning there were union
accusations that management was breaking the law. That softened to
almost breaking the law and, then, to could be breaking the law. From
start to finish, all of it was unfair and untrue.</TE>
<TE>   "I found it to be a disillusioning experience in many ways," the
publisher said. "Just because this newspaper is editorially pro-union
doesn't mean everybody here should be a union member. But it's over
and I'm happy to move on to the next thing. It's time for others here
to decide whether they are too."</TE>
<TE>   Some staff members already seem to have made that decision.
"Management invested a lot of resources in this campaign and threw
everything they had at us in order to defeat our union," said staff
writer Erin Aubry Kaplan, president of the Weekly's Local 201. "We
believe there were improprieties, including management coercion of
individual voters at the last moment, though we probably won't be
able to do anything about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Worse from our standpoint is that management used this campaign
to permanently demonize the unionized half of the Weekly's staff.
That's certainly altered our perception of our managers. We're all
doing a lot of soul-searching right now."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Howard Blume, the local's vice president, is
similarly troubled. "The risk here is that alternative journalism
becomes little more than just an alternative way to make big bucks
and not an alternative way of doing business," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "When we cover the news, we ask our readers to look at businesses
holistically, that is, we tell our readers that it's not enough to
judge a corporation like Nike solely on its ability to make
acceptable shoes or UNOCAL on its effectiveness at drilling for oil.
We say that it also matters how a company goes about its
business--how well it safeguards the environment or treats its
workers. Well, if that same standard were applied to our company
today, the verdict would be troubling."</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan also appeared to reject Sestanovich's overture. "I'm not
interested in healing, because it just sounds like a cover-up," she
said. "I'm interested in the issues, and they are not resolved. This
isn't going to die. This campaign was a defining moment for us
because it showed people here in their true light as nothing has
before. We assumed the paper stood for certain things, and it turns
out not all of it does."</TE>

<TE>   More Hitchens Fallout</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Hitchens' abrupt resignation last week as the Nation's
first Washington-based correspondent since I.F. Stone, continues to
excite comment on both sides of the Atlantic.</TE>
<TE>   Guardian media writer Oliver Burkeman writes in the paper's Monday
edition that Hitchens' resignation signals more than personal
disenchantment:</TE>
<TE>   "It can sometimes seem as if being disagreed with is as vital as
oxygen" to Hitchens, Burkeman writes. Still, "something significant
is clearly afoot, when a self-styled 'contrarian' abruptly resigns
from a magazine which has published him for two decades on the
grounds that--well, on the grounds that everyone else disagrees with
him."</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, the Guardian writer notes, Hitchens has "been
rapidly distancing himself from the left-wing establishment,
vociferously attacking extremist 'Islamo-fascism'--a phrase he
coined--and those on the left he accuses of being its apologists."</TE>
<TE>   These views, Burkeman argues, have become a problem not simply for
the Nation, but for the American left as a whole: " ... More
traditional left-wing commentators in the U.S. have been hamstrung in
the face of Islamic extremism, unable to square their commitment to
multiculturalism and tolerance with the condemnation of doctrines
that reject everything for which they have previously fought?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   John Banville, who lives in Dublin, is a novelist and former
literary editor of the Irish Times:</TE>
<TE>   "My new novel, 'Shroud' was just published last week, and I'm
still involved with that. At the moment, though, I'm working on a
little nonfiction book on Prague for Bloomsbury, part of a series
they're doing of short literary looks at various cities.</TE>
<TE>   "I originally suggested that they let me do Turin, but they said
they'd already commissioned a book on Florence. So, I suggested

<DH>For Ava Chin, writing about being a child of divorce and
compiling others' feelings was cathartic and revealing</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARIA ELENA FERNANDEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The divorce was like a car accident I heard happen behind me.... I
couldn't say how it had happened or who might have been at fault ...
I could only describe how they looked after the collision."</LD>
<LD>   --Jen Robinson, from "Split: Stories From a Generation Raised on
Divorce" (Contemporary Books)</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   The moment parents divorce, the life of their child becomes a
succession of splits: emotions ebb and flow from one parent to the
other; home, in most cases, is no longer one house but two; and
memories are slotted into "before" and "after" categories.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been researched and written about the long-term impacts
of divorce on children--the facts and interpretations always filtered
through the eyes and ears of a social scientist, psychologist or
academic. Some experts insist the psychological and emotional damage
on children is irreversible; others maintain it is a traumatic event
people can grow and recover from.</TE>
<TE>   But little has been heard from the children themselves.</TE>
<TE>   As a member of the generation of children who grew up amid the
divorce revolution of the 1970s, Ava Chin has always wanted to hear
from her peers. "When I was a kid, I heard all the dour statistics of
what it was like," said Chin, 32, who edited the essays that make up
"Split," a new anthology of intimate accounts by Gen-X writers from
families of divorce.</TE>
<TE>   "We were more likely to drop out of school, get pregnant when
we're young and get married and then divorced. But none of these
things fit my profile or that of my friends when we were in school,"
Chin said. "I had always wondered what it was like for the other
kids. What was it like for them to watch their home life split in
two?"</TE>
<TE>   Chin, a former editor of Vibe and Spin magazines who recently
moved to Los Angeles from New York, set out to find out by tapping
writers in their 20s and 30s across the country. She asked them to
write about how their parents' divorce affected them at the time and
now, knowing full well it would prove to be a daunting assignment.
She too had been trying to complete such an essay for 15 years; her
father left her mother when she was pregnant with Chin, who did not
meet him until she was 27.</TE>
<TE>   "Even for professional writers, it was really difficult to write
these essays and deal with past issues and write about them
objectively," said Chin, a postgraduate literature and creative
writing student at USC. "But they all identified as a kid of divorce
and were enthusiastic about trying to write about it--until they
actually sat down to write it. Mine came out in different
permutations. At first, they were all too emotional, too overwrought.
It got to the point I really doubted I was going to be able to do it,
which is why I didn't pressure anybody else."</TE>
<TE>   As the writers of "Split" poignantly depict in stories that cover
everything from their parents' breakup to their own abilities (or
lack thereof) to commit, divorce--and its aftermath--is a gray world
in which there are few common experiences, no absolute truths and no
easy answers.</TE>
<TE>   "We just hated having two families where we'd had one before,"
wrote Matt Briggs, a fiction writer who lives with his wife and
daughter in Seattle. "We hated being two different people, where
before we could just be our parents' kids."</TE>
<TE>   But within the pages of "Split" there also is resilience and hope,
which is what Chin wanted to portray in her own revealing account,
"The Missing."</TE>
<TE>   "An essay forces you to be objective about the past and helps put
the past in perspective and enables you to move on," Chin said. "The
worst thing is to carry this baggage from childhood to adulthood. I
hope that other kids of divorce will be able to look at it and see
their own stories, as well as help the people who are involved with
[those kids] gain a better understanding of them." For freelance
writer and editor Michelle Patient, growing up meant dealing with the
divorce of her parents, their weddings to other people and the
subsequent endings of those second marriages. None of it ever made
any sense to her. Still, at 32, Patient has settled down into
marriage and motherhood.</TE>
<TE>   "I do believe that love can endure if you give it room to evolve,"
Patient wrote in her essay, "Rootless." "I learned this from my
grandparents--my true relationship role models--who continued to love
each other, through wars and illnesses and affairs and children and
travels, for nearly 60 years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Appalled by Responses</TE>
<TE>   The idea for Chin's book struck her four years ago as she sat on a
panel of half a dozen other twentysomethings for an HBO talk-show
pilot that never aired. Among the questions posed to the diverse
urban group: Is marriage still relevant?</TE>
<TE>   "I was appalled by the responses of everyone around me," Chin
said. "They were saying that marriage is just a contract, a social
institution, and that it doesn't mean anything."</TE>
<TE>   Chin also knew she wanted to have kids but was frightened by the
prospect.  "One of the things that had jolted me out of thinking that
I was going to be young forever, that I could just work on my career
forever," she said, "was thinking about becoming a mother and
wondering how could I be a good parent if I don't even know what
happened between my parents."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the writers, in fact, discovered they knew very little
about the problems that led to their parents' separations. But all
could describe in detail the day their parents announced they were
divorcing. In "Entropy Factor," Alexandra Wolf explains she never
understood why her mother left her father because she doesn't recall
them ever arguing. Her 9-year-old brother, she wrote, was so
"blissfully unaware that when they called us in for the big talk he
thought they were going to announce that we were getting a canoe."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the writers, including Wolf, fretted that their essays
would expose too much and hurt loved ones. Wolf even asked her
parents to promise they would never read her essay. Others worried
they did not know the facts and therefore could not write the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to boil it down and say this is what happened,"
said Wolf, who lives in Brooklyn. "There are infinite varieties for
how things play out and infinite personalities in the world. I spent
a lot of time in anguish over my parents and how to tell this story
without hurting anybody. It made me realize that there was a lot of
stuff that I was still upset about, and now I'm angry about things I
wasn't angry about before. It wasn't so much denial, but a failure to
connect the dots between certain problems I have now, or patterns I
see in myself. I had never examined my life through that lens
before."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Game of Chance</TE>
<TE>   Neither had John Stinson, a fiction writer and fund-raiser for
Teach for America in Baltimore whose parents separated when he was 21
and in college. On the verge of marriage five years ago, Stinson
realized he didn't know what he wanted in a wife and had no idea how
to live up to the demands of commitment. Now, at least, he knows he
wants to be married, although he doesn't lose sight of how unresolved
and unsettled he still feels about his parents' divorce. In his
essay, Stinson compared marriage to a game of chance. "There were
millions of combinations ... the pairs were parts of a wheel game.
Sometimes you got red, sometimes black," he wrote. "Why should I take
it more seriously than that?" But at the end of the essay, he does
decide to take it seriously. "I want to dismiss the notion that it's
a game altogether now that I am a potential participant. That is the
cry of the solipsist. I am certainly guilty of that. It's a lack of
faith and courage, two things I probably will need to make a marriage
work."</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Lowe, director of the Center for the Family at Pepperdine
University in Malibu, has read most of the books and studies about
divorce in the U.S. No researcher, he said, could portray the
repercussions of divorce on children more thoroughly than the
children who have lived through it, matured, and processed it.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always the possibility that when a researcher is
conducting interviews or research on a subject, results can be
filtered through the researcher's presumptions, the questions asked,
or the interpretations they used to make sense of the facts," Lowe
said. "When you have people telling their own story, you can see the
complexity of the issue and the nature of a person's experience.
There's a benefit to this even for those of us in the social
sciences."</TE>
<TE>   Chin's father married and divorced three more times after he left
her mother. Chin now maintains contact with him even though they are
not close. Once, she asked him why he had married so many times. His
answer: "You fall in love. You decide to marry. If it doesn't work
out, you get a divorce."</TE>
<TE>   "He made it sound so simple, like an if-then statement in basic
mathematics," Chin wrote at the end of her essay. "But I suspect not
even he truly believes this, that you can walk away so unaffected,
debt-free."</TE>

<LD>"I'm Archie Wilkins," Archie said to the boy. "These are my folks. We
live just out of Red Rock. We raise corn ... and that's our wagon
over there. Our horse is Blackie...."</LD>
<LD>   Was he talking too much? Archie wondered.</LD>
<LD>   Pa asked the boy's name.</LD>
<TE>   The boy lowered his eyes and answered, "Martin Malone, sir."</TE>
<TE>   Meeting a stranger who might come and live with him made Archie's
heart pound a little. Was the boy's heart pounding, too?</TE>
<TE>   "This is fine Iowa country with good fresh air here," Ma said.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, ma'am," Martin said. "And I've been watching animals from
the train window. I've never seen a cow or horse before."</TE>
<TE>   "Do you think you might like helping out on a farm?" Pa asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe so," Martin answered. "I'd sure like looking after that
Blackie horse you got there."</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later Archie and his family strolled aside to
discuss the matter. Archie said he thought it would be all right with
him to take in Martin for a while and see how things work out.</TE>
<TE>   Just then a little girl appeared and ran toward Martin. "Are we
going to stay here, Martin?" she begged. "Are we going to live in
this place?"</TE>
<TE>   "Who is that?" Ma asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's Cora," the agent answered. "She is Martin's little
sister."</TE>
<TE>   Archie, Ma and Pa gasped. They didn't know that Martin had a
sister.</TE>
<TE>   How could they take Martin now? How could they break apart a
brother and sister? Why, that would be awful.</TE>
<TE>   "Mercy," Ma sighed. "How can we take two children? Where would
they sleep? What if the crops are not good this year and we have too
little food?"</TE>
<TE>   Archie blinked in the bright sunlight. What would they do now?</TE>

<LD>Somehow, on a runway, just about any concoction can pass for fashion.
But out on the street, real people with real bodies, jobs and budgets
put fashion to the test.</LD>
<LD>   More than one designer has scoured the bustling streets here for a
sense of what's in, what's out and what will be the next hot look.</LD>
<LD>   As designers finished showing their spring 2003 lines recently,
fashion professionals and amateurs alike gave photographers plenty to
see. Already, next spring's trends for gladiator sandals, sunset
colors and alluring corsets and bustiers are showing up on the
streets.</LD>
<TE>   Some New Yorkers seemed to know that a great hat turns the
ordinary into the extraordinary.</TE>

<LD>Is there a cook alive who doesn't love lemon?</LD>
<LD>   One squeeze and it elevates a thyme vinaigrette, transforming a
fall salad.</LD>
<LD>   Lemon curd captures the essence of the fruit, the intense
combination of zest and juice brightening a rich base made with eggs
and butter. It's a simple formula--but nothing else packs the same
silky punch, whether the lemon curd is spread on pound cake, scones
or muffins, or folded into whipped-cream toppings and vanilla
puddings.</LD>
<TE>   And for those who really worship lemon there's the Baked Alaska
Lemon, a light dessert that uses the lemon shell as a container for
lemon sorbet and is topped with swirl of meringue. It's a refreshing
conclusion to a meal, quick and easy and make-ahead.</TE>

<HD>The Strands of Luxury</HD>
<DH>If any dish deserves a glorious new vogue, carbonara is it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY GREEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We weren't wrong to fall in love with spaghetti carbonara in the
1970s. We were early. We did it before we realized that Parmesan is
better grated from a block of aged Parmigiano-Reggiano than shaken
from a can.</LD>
<LD>   And we were innocent. We couldn't quite keep our sauces straight.
Often as not, we substituted carbonara's eggs for the cream of a
fettuccine Alfredo, exchanging a supple texture for a heavy one. As
for what we did to the noodles, adding oil to the cooking water,
flinging partly cooked spaghetti at the wall convinced that a done
strand would stick, then rinsing this flogged pasta in cold water....
Your honor, we seek the mercy of the court. We were young.</LD>
<LD>   Then came Italian chemist Marcella Hazan, so beloved even
strangers call her Marcella. Her meticulous series of books on
Italian food, starting in the 1970s and progressing through the '80s
and '90s, introduced Americans to the kind of Italian food that
Italians might actually recognize. She won my heart with spaghetti
carbonara. She offered a recipe radically different from the heavy,
salty-sweet American standard, while raising a skeptical eyebrow over
its supposed origin as a World War II dish concocted by Italians for
American servicemen yearning for bacon and eggs. She describes the
earthy flavor as "unmistakably Roman."</LD>
<TE>   But by the time Hazan fixed the recipe, and the right ingredients
found their way into stores, America was abandoning the dish. Young
cooks were too busy discovering osso buco, risotto and baby
artichokes to bother with a pasta synonymous with restaurants that
had canned peas on the menu and "My Way" on the jukebox.</TE>
<TE>   If fashion wasn't hard enough on spaghetti carbonara, do-gooders
weighed in. Health officials began to rumble ominously about perils
posed by fresh eggs, and dietitians stepped up scolding about the
deleterious effects of fat and salt. Carbonara was not just out--it
was, we were led to believe, out to get us.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, if only a steaming plate of it would mug me this very minute.
I can think of no better food. That an entire generation has missed
out on the dish seems unfathomable, faintly criminal, every bit as
wrong as the worst excesses inflicted on the dish by my own
generation and my parents' before Hazan came along. If any food got a
bum rap, spaghetti carbonara is it. If any dish deserves
rehabilitation, a glorious new vogue, this is it.</TE>
<TE>   First, forget the stuff about it being heavy. It's a light dish,
light enough to have been a traditional starter. Moreover, food
poisoning from the eggs is the remotest of risks, unless the cook
cracks the eggs hours before making it, then leaves them sitting
around.</TE>
<TE>   But spaghetti carbonara isn't a dish for newborns, convalescents
or people who have a fearful relationship with food. It's for food
lovers. It's food best eaten warm, right from the stove, in the
kitchen, as dinner for two. The preparation of spaghetti carbonara
could not be more congenial. It comes replete with its own dynamic,
its own tantalizing tempo and heady succession of good smells.</TE>
<TE>   Always start by setting out a large pot of water on the stove. It
will be boiling by the time you need it. By the time the cork is
squeaking in the Chianti bottle or some robust tannic red--a food
wine--the air should be moist, with steam running down the
windowpanes. As your guest swirls the first taste of wine, you are
tossing out the garlic from the infused oil and adding the pancetta.</TE>
<TE>   Your guest suddenly looks wolfish. For mercy's sake, give the
guest some olives! Better yet, hand over the watercress so the guest
can pluck off the stems and drop the leaves into a bowl for quick
tossing with olive oil and red wine vinegar. Served as a main course,
the only thing you'll need with spaghetti carbonara is a side dish,
or palate cleanser, of a watercress salad. Arugula works too. But not
lettuce. It needs to be a peppery green.</TE>
<TE>   The pancetta's ready. The parsley is chopped. You cut a slice of
Parmesan for your guest to nibble, then hand him the grater, the
Parmesan and the Romano. This second cheese, the slightly sharp
sheep's milk answer to Parmesan, will give the dish some piquancy.</TE>
<TE>   You've got a steaming pot to check. You raise the lid, making sure
the water level is still high. Pasta needs room to cook properly. You
add a dramatic dash of salt, which causes the water to roil--you feel
like a magician. It subsides, and you slip in the pasta and adjust
the heat so the pot doesn't boil over. Most important, you stir it
with a long-handled spoon and set the lid at an angle for the steam
to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Now you crack your eggs into a serving dish--Hazan prefers a flat
ceramic roasting dish to a bowl; easier to toss. You add the grated
cheese, the parsley and the pepper, tell your guest a story, listen
and laugh. Reheat the pancetta that you've deglazed with a splash of
white wine. Toss back the last of your first glass of wine.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to check the pasta. Fish out a strand. Look at it. The
change in color is so distinct, from wheat gold to translucent amber,
you'll always know a done noodle by its hue from this day forward.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes the theater, the draining of the pasta. You give the dog
a nudge--the big dope should not be napping in the path between stove
and sink. As you drain the pasta, you don't leave it to sit. You
decant it quickly from the strainer to the serving tray with the
eggs, and toss. The water trapped in the noodles will loosen the mix.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the cheese smells rise, you add the bacon. Your guest
might faint with anticipation, but because there are only two of you,
in only seconds your plates are full, your wineglasses are full, you
are winding the hot pasta on your forks and toasting this good life.</TE>

<TE>   Marcella Hazan's Spaghetti Carbonara</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound pancetta, cut in 1/2-inch-thick slices, or its
equivalent in good slab bacon</TE>
<TE>   4 cloves garlic</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup dry white wine</TE>
<TE>   1 1/4 pounds spaghetti</TE>
<TE>   2 eggs</TE>
<TE>   1/2 ounce freshly grated Romano cheese</TE>
<TE>   2 ounces freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons chopped parsley</TE>
<TE>   Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, cut the pancetta or bacon into strips not quite
1/4-inch wide.</TE>
<TE>   Lightly mash the garlic with a knife handle, enough to split the
cloves and loosen the skin; discard the skin. Place the garlic and
olive oil in a skillet and turn the heat to medium-high. When the
garlic turns a deep gold, about 2 minutes, remove it and discard.</TE>
<TE>   Place the strips of pancetta or bacon in the pan and cook until
they just begin to crisp at the edges, stirring often, about 5
minutes. Add the wine and let it bubble away for 1 to 2 minutes, then
turn the heat off.</TE>
<TE>   Add the spaghetti to the boiling water, and cook until al dente,
about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain.</TE>
<TE>   Break the eggs into the serving bowl in which you'll be tossing
the pasta. Beat them lightly with a fork, then add the Romano and
Parmigiano-Reggiano, a liberal grinding of pepper and the chopped
parsley. Mix thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Add the spaghetti to the bowl and toss rapidly, coating the
strands well. Briefly reheat the pancetta or bacon over high heat,
turn the entire contents into the bowl of spaghetti and toss
thoroughly again. Serve at once.</TE>

carbohydrates; 19 grams protein; 1.69 grams fiber.</TE>
<TE>   Note: Although many recipes call for uncooked eggs, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture has found them to be a potential carrier of
food-borne illness and recommends that infants, the elderly and
immuno-compromised people avoid raw eggs.</TE>

<HD>A Great Restaurant's Secret Ingredient</HD>
<DH>Here's a hint: It's nowhere on the menu.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN STABINER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chefs make news just like any other celebrity. We hear about it all:
The one who moved into a bigger place, the one who favors wild
striped bass, the one who would like the world to know that he has a
new theory about eggplant.</LD>
<LD>   When Jar, a West Hollywood shrine for carnivores, went through
three front-room managers in less than a year, though, the news never
rose above industry scuttlebutt. The front of the house--everything
in a restaurant but the food--is like the little girl in the nursery
rhyme. When it's good, it's very, very good, and when it's bad, the
customers simply don't come back.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to attitude as smooth as a veloute, the front of the
house includes all the things you don't notice unless they displease
you: The temperature of the room, the color of the walls, the
lighting, the soundtrack, the wait staff's uniforms, the way the host
greets you and seats you, the pacing of the service.</LD>
<TE>   What seems like a seamless environment, when it works right, is,
in fact, the result of endless planning and preparation. An offhanded
inquiry about how you like the tamarind sauce is part of an almost
military strategy, based on a deceptively simple question: "What can
we do," says Jar co-owner Suzanne Tracht, "to make you happy?"</TE>
<TE>   The less obvious the effort, the better. Lucques co-owner and
front-room maven Carolyne Styne, a short, slender blond whose drive
matches the buzz in her main dining room, strives for what she calls
"invisible service--everything's taken care of, and the customer
never had to ask for it." She doesn't just happen by after the
entrees are served. It's a conscious decision not to bother people
too soon, and not to wait so long that she can't solve a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Peel, an owner of Campanile, quotes "The Wizard of Oz" to
define his service philosophy: " 'Pay no attention to that man behind
the curtain.' " Illusion is key.</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, most restaurateurs paid far less attention to
what went on in the front of the house, according to Peel, who worked
at Ma Maison more than 20 years ago. "At Ma Maison, it was, 'Service?
They're carrying plates to the table,' " he says. The ones who
did--Valentino, Spago and a handful of others--were legendary
exceptions. "But in many ways service is more important than the
food, now. Think of all the places with mediocre food and great
service, and they're packed--because people feel welcome, taken care
of, and they can get what they want."</TE>
<TE>   When every self-respecting restaurant seems to have a seasonal
heirloom tomato salad on the menu, the "out" in "dining out" becomes
more important. The restaurant business has come to bear an odd
resemblance to the automotive industry: If there are tons of great
meals out there, just as there are tons of luxury sedans, then the
difference--a restaurant's brand identity--is in how you serve what
you serve. In a business with a high mortality rate, in an economy
that does not smile on extravagance, the way the customer feels is a
make-or-break issue.</TE>
<TE>   Tracht is a tiny, tailored woman with a peaceable air--an unlikely
adversary for a man with a big knife. But there he was, an irate
customer waving his cutlery at a waiter. Tracht knew she had to do
something. No matter how impossible a customer gets, the staff stays
gracious. An apology, and a quick retreat, did the trick. "I can fix
the food, cold potatoes, a burned steak," she says, "but not rude
service. People will go tell 12 friends and never come back."</TE>
<TE>   Tracht's main dining room exudes a flattering reserve, from the
noncommittal chairs (Are they gray or green?) to a peachy light that
makes everyone look 10 years younger. The linens are white, the wood
accents are pale; the whole place whispers quality. There is no room
here for histrionics, neither from customers nor from the staff.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attentive but Restrained</TE>
<TE>   The front of the house always has a personality, just like the
kitchen does. For a while, in the '80s, front rooms were full of
ingratiating waiters. (Hi. I'm Bob. I'm going to help you chew your
food.) In the '90s, there were the power waiters and wine folk who
could keep pace with the most can-you-top-this demands. These days,
restaurants aspire to a more restrained, but ever-helpful kind of
service: attentive but not overbearing, informed but not about to
tell you which side of the road the tomatoes grew on, concerned from
a respectful distance about the customer's contentment. If there is
one consistent indicator of the current dining gestalt, it is the
music that plays in otherwise very different dining rooms around the
city:</TE>
<TE>   "World music," says Bonnie Beck, who has been the manager at Jar
for three months.</TE>
<TE>   "World music," says Styne.</TE>
<TE>   "World music," says Dana Caskey, co-owner of the House, in
Hollywood, which feels like a boho graduate-school cousin to the
other, sleeker spots. No matter what the trappings, the message,
these days, is cosmic calm.</TE>
<TE>   Even the way you wait for your table is part of the orchestrated
experience. There was a time when waiting an hour was a heady part of
dining out; the very fact that customers were stacked at the bar like
airplanes waiting for takeoff meant that this must be the place to
be. No more. If a patron has to wait at all, the front room staff
tries to make it as much fun as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Lucques was designed around the inevitability of waiting, with
what Styne calls the "living-room area," a rectangle of overstuffed
couches and chairs at the center of the dining room. A good thing,
since the dining room tends to fill at a reasonable pace from 6 p.m.
to about 8, and then, as though the extras had been called to the
set, people begin to pour in. The first onslaught occupies the living
room, and the second wave stands four deep at the bar, waiting for
their drinks to be passed to them over other people's heads.</TE>
<TE>   It works so well that some customers are disappointed if they
don't have to hang out, or if their favorite couch is taken. Lucques'
owners have conspired, from the exposed brick to the warm walls, to
make customers feel "hugged by the room," according to Styne, and no
one wants to feel left out.</TE>
<TE>   At Jar, Tracht's goal is to whisk people to their tables as
quickly as humanly possible. She and Beck have studied the rhythm of
the room. They know that people eat in 60 to 90 minutes on Saturday
nights, because they want to make a movie or a party, but that the
meals on Friday nights can take more than two hours; people who show
up on Fridays see the meal as the evening's activity. So they book
fewer parties on Fridays and hope for the best: no more than 15
minutes from greeting to seating.</TE>
<TE>   If it doesn't work, they avoid what Beck calls "the hypoglycemic
moment" with a free drink and appetizer at the long, curved bar. A
hungry customer is a cranky customer; no one is allowed to linger
without a snack, let alone bump their elbows on a right angle.</TE>
<TE>   There are times, though, when even food won't do it. Some
customers feel the need to prove how important they are by
announcing, loudly, that they do not wait. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to interact with them constantly," Beck says, "give them
updates, tell them, 'They're just paying the check,' so they don't
feel anxious. What you don't want is to be pretentious--to make them
feel lucky that they have a table at all."</TE>
<TE>   Even the host's clothing reflects the theme. Styne and Beck wore
skirts over cigarette pants on a recent evening, but Styne's was a
hip, crisp little scarf with aspirations and Beck's was a floaty Zen
number that fit with the liquid decor.</TE>
<TE>   Caskey, who co-owns he House with chef Scooter Kanfer and came to
hospitality by way of corporate jobs in steel and technology, handles
the front room at the House even though he admits that he still gets
the Jacks--Nicklaus and Nicholson--mixed up. He figures it's an
advantage, since big shots might like a quiet meal once in a while,
just like everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "When Meryl Streep comes in--and she did," he says, with a note of
pride, "I don't want everyone falling all over themselves. Have a
level of comfort that's equal."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Everyone Gets Prepped</TE>
<TE>   Everyone has to be prepared for surprises. Caskey admits that he's
working with a "volatile genius" in Kanfer, and he wants diners to
appreciate that "she puts a little bit of her soul onto every plate."
So the partners play with the environment just to keep people primed
for the unexpected: mismatched flatware, comic nicknames for many of
the regular dishes and an eagerness, among the wait staff, that just
might convince a diner to try something out of the ordinary. Nobody
bothered to overhaul the old house that houses the House--they just
painted it, put nice little shades on the light fixtures, and stepped
back to let the food shine.</TE>
<TE>   It is all an illusion. The inclusive feel of Lucques, the Zen of
meat at Jar, the grad school goofiness at the House, are all a piece
of performance art--and the staff, the actors, work from a careful
script.</TE>
<TE>   Really effortless service, whether formal or casual, requires
endless attention to detail. Once you're at your table (and if you're
a regular, your table preference is probably in the computer along
with other salient facts), the waiter approaches having survived an
audition to get the job, days of shadowing a more experienced
employee, and quite possibly a written test to make sure he or she
can tell you the temperature to which your roast pork will be cooked.</TE>
<TE>   Campanile has a "service meeting" every night before dinner
begins, and the agenda always includes a breakdown of the evening's
reservations, to see who's sitting where, and which VIPs are on the
roster. At the House, Caskey and Kanfer interview all prospective
servers, and then Caskey monitors them, to make sure the "smile
factor" is always there.</TE>
<TE>   As in any family, there are rivalries; the person who runs the
front has to make sure that the members of the staff, as well as the
customers, are happy. "In general there's an innate jealousy on the
part of the wait staff," Beck says, "because the people in the
kitchen are hidden from all the problems we have in the front of the
house."</TE>
<TE>   Peel, who has spent his working life in the kitchen, watches for
resentments from the other side. "The kitchen thinks, those waiters,
they walk around in clean clothes, they never sweat, they make a lot
of money writing down orders."</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the customers who resent it if they feel they
are not getting as much attention as someone else is. "When a server
spends too much time with a table because they're regulars, or
personal friends," says Tracht, "it's noticeable to the other
customers. They get jealous, like children--and they're right. It's
rude."</TE>
<TE>   Whoever runs the front of the house, whether an owner or a
manager, quickly learns that it is a calling, not a job. Styne and
her partner, Suzanne Goin, decided not to close their restaurant for
a vacation this summer; between that and getting ready to open a
second restaurant in November, Styne had no home life. She finally
gave herself a day-and-a-half off so that she could play with her
daughter before kindergarten began, and mentions more than once how
lucky she is to have a husband who loves the restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Caskey fairly lives at the House, allowing himself "a couple of
hours" in the morning and before the dinner rush to keep up an
exercise regimen. And Beck lets out a laugh about her life, or lack
of it. "I do everything," she says. "Catering, marketing, staff and
scheduling, correspondence, parties here and off site,
troubleshooting all day long," in addition to being at Jar from 6 to
10, five nights a week.</TE>
<TE>   All that, just to make strangers feel happy for a couple of hours,
strangers who will likely go home thinking that the chocolate caramel
tart is the cause of their bliss. A great front-room person is not in
it for the recognition; they have what Styne calls an "innate
co-dependent need to serve." In the tradition of people who are nice
for a living, neither she nor Peel nor Beck will say exactly what
went wrong with Beck's predecessors, except that they were not quite
prepared to play that kind of part.</TE>

<LD>If you're trying to cut fat and calories, a custard is about the last
thing you're going to reach for.</LD>
<LD>   This one is different. It's a flan with the golden caramel sauce
and creamy smooth texture you'd expect. But instead of making it with
the usual amount of sugar, eggs and cream, I've lightened this
classic dessert by using nonfat milk, nonfat half-and-half and nonfat
egg substitute.</LD>
<LD>   I know, it sounds like a recipe for disappointment. But trust me,
this flan feels and tastes rich. A bit of lime brightens the flavor
too.</LD>
<TE>   And since you might just get carried away with how good it is,
I've designed the recipe to make individual servings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In early fall, the Hollywood farmers market--always a lively
scene--abounds in high-quality specialty produce that's hard to find
elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Fuyu persimmons from the San Joaquin Valley are showing up at
markets, but this early in the season they're pale and bland. For the
next week or two it's better to look for Giant Fuyus (really an
ancient Japanese variety called Gosho), which are already sweet,
juicy and tender--too delicate for commercial stores, in fact. They
can be eaten firm or soft, but don't keep well. At Hollywood, the
Peacock and Burkart farms, both from Dinuba, now have fine specimens.</LD>
<LD>   The season is brief for freshly harvested dates at the soft,
moist, rutab stage. Sandra Agnew has luscious Honey and Empress dates
grown by her brother, Everett Da Vall, in Indio. His great-uncle and
namesake selected these varieties from seedlings sown in 1916, at the
dawn of California's date industry.</LD>
<TE>   California grows most of the nation's crop of quince, a bumpy
relative of the apple that turns pink and develops an exquisite spicy
aroma when cooked, but they're rare even at farmers markets. Kim and
Clarence Blain of Lake Hughes have round, fuzzy yellow Smyrna
quinces, along with sweet Concord grapes and flavorful Last Chance
peaches.</TE>
<TE>   Cahuilla Mountain Farm of Aguanga, which started selling at this
market just more than a month ago, displays an inspired selection of
organic heirloom varieties, such as ribbed Costa Romanesca zucchini
with a nice nutty flavor; oval Red Torpedo onions; soft, stewable
Hungarian Heart tomatoes; and Jimmy Nardello sweet peppers, perfect
for frying. Tutti-Frutti Farm of Lompoc also has gorgeous peppers,
including bright red, meaty Lipstick, dusky Chocolate and ferocious
red habaneras, the world's hottest.</TE>
<TE>   Bob and Pat Poole of Redlands offer four kinds of sweet potatoes,
all recently harvested, from classic yellow-orange Garnet to dry,
whitish Satsuma Imo. With Halloween approaching, they've got splendid
pumpkins: the regular orange Tom Fox, unusual blue-green Queensland
Blue and small, ghostly white Lumina, which always sells out fast.</TE>
<TE>   And for the next two weeks, Santa Barbara Pistachio Co. of
Ventucopa will bring freshly harvested pistachios, still in their
green-and-pink hulls. Much appreciated in the Mideast, but rarely
sold in America, they are moister, softer and sweeter than the common
roasted nuts, with a herbaceous aroma that hints at eucalyptus. In
addition to Hollywood, they'll be at the Santa Monica Wednesday and
Organic (Saturday) markets.</TE>

<DH>Is a box of artisanal spaghetti worth the splurge? We test
11 brands and make a surprising discovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUSS PARSONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Artisanal pastas--dried noodles made (at least ostensibly) in small
batches by traditional methods and sold for higher prices--seem to be
everywhere these days. Shop at any high-end grocery store and you'll
find at least three or four brands.</LD>
<LD>   Think of them as the new olive oils: rustic, simple ingredients
that have been raised to new heights by careful manufacture and by
cooks always hungry for the next level of refinement.</LD>
<LD>   But spaghetti is such a simple ingredient, can there really be
that much difference among brands? Can one really be worth three or
four times the price of another? And what does artisanal pasta mean,
anyway?</LD>
<TE>   Shopping online and in local markets, we rounded up eight examples
of pricey spaghetti of varying degrees of "artisanality." Then we
threw in three commonly available ringers to test how much difference
there was between the high-priced stuff and the rest.</TE>
<TE>   We cooked 2 ounces of each spaghetti in a quart of rapidly boiling
water to which we'd added a tablespoon of salt. When the pastas were
done, we drained them and dressed them with a tablespoon of olive
oil.</TE>
<TE>   At first, choosing among these naked noodles seemed like picking
different shades of beige. By themselves, they were nearly identical,
differing mainly in slight degrees of wheat flavor and resilience.
But it gradually dawned on us that while the pastas themselves were
pretty tough to tell apart, some of them seemed to have a much
stronger olive oil flavor than the others.</TE>
<TE>   Intrigued, we pulled out our five favorite brands and tasted them
again dressed only in a tablespoon of cheap bottled tomato sauce.
With three of them, the result was exactly what you'd expect--nice
pasta flavor accompanied by thin, scorched sauce.</TE>
<TE>   But two of the samples were different. With these, this same sauce
tasted full and rich. What had seemed scorched with the other pastas
emerged as a deep roasted flavor. It was the spaghetti equivalent of
those expensive Riedel wineglasses--flavors and aromas seemed
amplified and clarified.</TE>
<TE>   When the brands were revealed, both of our favorites were made by
Latini--the regular red-box brand and the Senatore Cappelli type made
from an heirloom wheat variety. That Latini fared so well was no
shock; it's the dried pasta of choice for most of the great Italian
restaurants in this country.</TE>
<TE>   But why do these noodles work so well? One reason is obvious once
you look closely enough: The surface of the raw artisanal noodles are
rough, rather than smooth. This is true in varying degrees; the
Latini noodles were by far the roughest, almost to the point of being
grainy.</TE>
<TE>   After the starches have swelled during cooking, the difference
isn't so obvious. But it's still enough to allow the spaghetti to
hold more sauce, amplifying its flavor.</TE>
<TE>   Dried pastas have had their ups and downs. For a period in the
1980s, they were scoffed at by foodies as inferior to fresh. That is
over. Since the '90s, imports of Italian dried pasta, already high to
begin with, have increased by an average of 7% per year.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, it's important to recognize that dried pastas are
not fresh pastas that have been dehydrated. It's not a raisins and
grapes thing. Except for dried egg noodles, which are a very small
part of the market, dried pastas are made from different ingredients,
in a different way. Fresh pastas are made from eggs and soft wheat
flour ground from the seeds of the wheat variety Triticum vulgare and
are rolled out. Dried pastas are made from water and hard semolina
flour ground from Triticum durum and are extruded--pressed through
dies.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, by Italian statute, dried pastas can contain nothing but
semolina and water. With many Italian firms opening factories in the
United States to manufacture the noodles they sell here, one way to
tell if it's the real thing is to read the ingredient labels. If they
contain additions such as niacin, iron or folic acid, they were made
in America, no matter if the label reads "Italy's No. 1 Pasta."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's nothing inherently superior about Italian-made
pastas. In fact, many of them have their roots in this country.
Though Italy is the world's leading producer of durum wheat, it
cannot grow enough to keep up with the world's hunger for Italian
noodles. This year Italy will import about 650,000 tons of durum
wheat from the U.S.--more than half of what is grown in this country.</TE>
<TE>   This is nothing new. Until the early 20th century, Italy's great
sources of durum wheat were the Ukraine and Volga River valley. The
very best pastas were labeled "Taganrog," for the Russian port city
on the sea of Azov, near the Black Sea, from which they were shipped.
This source dried up in the 1920s during the great Russian famines
brought on by drought and Stalin's collectivization.</TE>
<TE>   This in part led to Mussolini's drive to improve the nature of
Italian wheat varieties, which was spearheaded by the pioneering
wheat geneticist Nazareno Strampelli. One of his key developments was
the Senatore Cappelli strain, which has been revived commercially by
Latini.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the secret to great pasta isn't just the material it's made
from, it's also the way it is made. That is a process that has been
refined over hundreds of years and is still being refined today.</TE>
<TE>   First, the flour and the water are kneaded together. If you have
ever tried to do this at home, especially using gluten-rich semolina
flour, you know how difficult it can be.</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, the dough for dried pasta was kneaded in a long
wooden trough called a madia. To work the stiff dough, men would
tread on it with their bare feet. One batch could require a full
day's walking, with the men perched atop the dough holding onto a
rope for balance.</TE>
<TE>   Anna del Conte observes in "Portrait of Pasta" (Paddington Press,
1976), "As people commonly went barefoot in those days, one could
wonder if therein was the secret of historic flavors, never to be
recaptured!"</TE>
<TE>   In 1833, Ferdinand II, the despotic King of the Two Sicilies,
ordered an inventor named Cesare Spadaccini to find a better method
of kneading the dough. Spadaccini worked on it for a year and then
unveiled his new invention: a mechanical man with bronze feet.</TE>
<TE>   This, perhaps predictably, went nowhere. More successful was a
water-powered kneading machine introduced in Naples at about the same
time that used a series of paddles mounted on rods.</TE>
<TE>   Once the dough is formed, it must be pressed through dies and cut
into shapes. Originally, the dies were cut out of wood, then bronze.
Teflon dies, which were introduced in the '70s, were considered a
major advance because they were much easier to clean and, because of
the reduced friction, kept the dough cooler.</TE>
<TE>   After the noodles have been cut into shapes, they must be dried.
This is not nearly as simple as it seems. Moisture evaporates only
from the surface, and once the surface of a noodle has dried out it
hardens, preventing the moisture from the interior from evaporating.
Left to its own devices in a stable climate, pasta would form a dry
crust around the outside and leave the interior wet, prone to
acidification and hospitable to unfriendly bugs.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a combination of drying and moistening to allow pasta to
dry thoroughly, and the alternating hot winds and moist sea breezes
around Naples are among the reasons so much of the industry has
historically been centered there.</TE>
<TE>   With industrialization, pasta makers began to use two closed
rooms, one hot and dry and one cooler and more humid. Today's
factories have streamlined that process with climate-controlled
drying chambers that operate much faster.</TE>
<TE>   All this detail is of more than historical significance. Indeed,
the technologies used in cutting and drying pasta are at the heart of
the differences between artisanal and mass-market spaghetti today.</TE>
<TE>   The rough surface of the artisanal pastas, which help to make them
so friendly to sauces, are created by the old-fashioned bronze dies.
The new Teflon ones may speed production, but they also make a noodle
that is too slippery to grip sauce in the same intimate way.</TE>
<TE>   Less well-known is the difference in drying technology. While
modern methods can dry pastas in less than four hours using
temperatures around 185 degrees, most artisanal makers favor an
old-fashioned process that takes nearly two days to dry the pasta at
between 105 and 115 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   The debate between the two factions is quite heated itself. The
new ways, the Latinis say, result in "nonexistent flavors and aromas
and a standardized 'plasticized' pasta." On the Professional Pasta
Web site (www.professionalpasta.it), the industrialists slap back,
saying, "the use of low temperatures in drying pasta ... not only has
no sense at all, but is an absurdity from the productive point of
view."</TE>
<TE>   But it's hard to attribute the Latini pasta's sauce-adhering
consistency solely to the low-temperature drying or the brass dies,
since other pastas that claim to use both techniques did not fare as
well in our tasting.</TE>
<TE>   Carlo and Carla Latini, a husband-and-wife team who have been
making pasta only since 1990, live in the small town of Osimo in the
region of the Marches--more or less the inside of the knee of the
Italian boot.</TE>
<TE>   Like many born-again artisans, they do not come from pasta-making
families. Carlo's family grew mainly vegetables, as well as some
wheat. The Latinis got into the pasta trade via the wheat connection.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Latinis don't actually make the pasta they sell under
their name. They grow the wheat (and have some of it grown under
their supervision) and then have it milled and turned into pasta
according to their exacting specifications at Pastificio Mennilli, a
small family-run factory in Abruzzo.</TE>
<TE>   Their continuing passion for wheat is obvious, not only in their
plans to release every year four "grand cru" pastas labeled by wheat
variety. On their Web site, they describe the Senatore Cappelli as if
it were a movie star: "A beautiful plant; it stands [almost 6 feet]
tall ... the ear is of a warm ash blond, it has a long black mustache
and a very big grain."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that, as much as anything, is the definition of
artisanship--the ability to look at a stalk of wheat and see a
leading man.</TE>

<TE>   Spaghetti With Raw Tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe from Italian chef Gianfranco Vissani hinges on a trick
of technique--the rough stirring of the pasta and tomatoes. Vissani
refers to this process as "mantecare," the word used to describe
beating cheese into risotto. It is collected on the Italian side of
the Latini Web site and translated here. The key to it is using very
ripe tomatoes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 pound plum tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   15 basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound spaghetti</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   In plenty of rapidly boiling salted water, briefly cook the
tomatoes just until the skins loosen, 10 to 15 seconds. Drain the
tomatoes and rinse under cold water. Peel them, cut them in half
crosswise and squeeze out the seeds and water. Chop them coarsely and
place them in a wide serving bowl with the basil, and cover with the
oil.</TE>
<TE>   Cook the spaghetti in the same water until al dente, about 9
minutes, drain it and add to the tomatoes. Stir them together roughly
until the mixture is cool. Season to taste with salt and pepper and
stir in a tablespoon of the cooking water.</TE>

<TE>   Spaghetti With Mussels and Tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 15 minutes</TE>
<TE>   This recipe comes from Anna Del Conte's sadly overlooked "Portrait
of Pasta" (Paddington Press, 1976).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   2 quarts mussels in their shells, about 3 pounds</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 pound peeled, seeded and chopped tomatoes or canned chopped plum
tomatoes</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound spaghetti</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons parsley, chopped</TE>
<TE>   Place the mussels in a large pan. Cover it and cook them over high
heat until they open, 2 to 3 minutes, shaking the pan. Remove the
meat from the shells and discard the shells. Strain the liquid that
remains at the bottom of the pan through a cheesecloth and reduce it
over high heat if necessary. You will need about 1 cup liquid.</TE>
<TE>   Put the oil and garlic in a skillet and heat over medium heat. Add
the tomatoes (if you are using canned tomatoes, discard the liquid
first), and boil, uncovered, over medium heat for 5 minutes. Add 1/2
cup of the mussel juice and adjust the seasoning.</TE>
<TE>   Add the remaining mussel juice to rapidly boiling salted water and
cook the spaghetti until tender, about 9 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Add the mussels to the tomato sauce, reduce the heat to low and
heat them gently for 5 minutes. Stir in the parsley.</TE>
<TE>   Drain the pasta and turn it into a hot serving dish. Pour the
sauce over it and mix well.</TE>

<LD>While the Latini pastas were the best in our tasting, we also liked
the spaghetti from Rustichella d'Abruzzo, another artisanal Italian
product, as well as from La Molisana and Barilla, Italian brands made
in the U.S. In addition, we tasted spaghetti from Favorita d'Abruzzo,
DeCecco, Ronzoni, A.G. Ferrari and Pasta di Gragnano.</LD>
<LD>   Most artisanal pastas cost $3.50 to $4.50 for a half-kilo package
(just over a pound). Both Latini spaghettis are available at Bristol
Farms for $4.09 a pound or online from A.G. Ferrari &amp; Co. for $3.95,
plus shipping. Latini pastas can also be found at independent markets
such as Wine Exchange in Orange, Bay Cities in Santa Monica, Monte
Carlo Deli in Burbank and the original Irvine Ranch Market in Irvine.</LD>

<LD>The key to a well-cooked scallop--one with a dark golden crust and a
melting tender middle--is a very hot pan. Put your skillet on the
fire first, then add some oil and sear the scallops for just a couple
of minutes on each side.</LD>
<LD>   The dividend for the cook, of course, is speed. What could be a
faster or more sophisticated main course?</LD>
<LD>   If you're in the mood to splurge, buy "dry-pack" or "day boat"
scallops, which stand up to searing much better than the ordinary
scallop because they contain much less water. Dry scallops are not
treated with the chemicals often used to retain scallops' size and
shape, so you also get a truer, more delicate scallop flavor.</LD>
<TE>   Serve this scallop dish with a crusty French baguette. All you'll
need are some sweet nectarines laced with a little Grand Marnier to
complete the meal.</TE>

<TE>   Seared Scallops in Mediterranean Broth</TE>
<TE>   Active Work and Total Preparation Time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   1 stalk celery, diced</TE>

<TE>   1 carrot, diced</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, minced</TE>

<TE>   1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes, with juice</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon saffron threads</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest</TE>
<TE>   1/8 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   1/4 teaspoon salt</TE>

<TE>   3 teaspoons capers</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons canola oil</TE>
<TE>   12 scallops, if very large slice in half horizontally so they are
no more than 1 1/2 inches thick</TE>
<TE>   Cook the celery, onion and carrot in the olive oil in a skillet
over medium-high heat until transparent, about 5 minutes. Add the
garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the wine and
simmer 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the tomatoes and the chicken stock.
Add the saffron, orange zest, pepper flakes, salt, olives and capers.
Reduce the heat to medium and continue to simmer while preparing the
scallops.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over high heat. If the
scallops are very moist, pat them dry with paper towels. Add to the
skillet and sear about 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Do not try to
move the scallops until they release easily. The scallops should be
golden brown on the outside but still tender inside.</TE>
<TE>   Divide the broth among 4 large shallow soup bowls. Place 3
scallops in the middle of each bowl.</TE>

rule I don't like Sauvignon Blanc--but this is a real good bottle of
wine. It's really clean and crisp. Typically, Sauvignon Blanc can be
herbal and have a lot of veggie characteristics, but not this one. It
has riper aromas, more honey and fig, which I really like. It goes
with barbecued salmon or sea bass; add a salad with tomatoes and
bingo--you're there."</LD>

<LD>DEAR SOS: While traveling on business, I had dinner at the Colonial
Inn Restaurant in Concord, Mass. They served the best chicken pot pie
that I ever had. Would it be possible to get the recipe?</LD>
<LD>   DALE SMITH</LD>
<LD>   Fontana</LD>
<TE>   DEAR DALE: This pot pie is made with puff pastry. The filling
should be bubbling hot when the pastry sheet is laid over it to
ensure that it will puff up. Also, score the sheet before putting it
in the oven. It will make the pot pie prettier.</TE>
<TE>   Send requests to Culinary SOS, Food Section, Los Angeles Times,
202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012 or e-mail to:
cindy.dorn@latimes.com. Please include your last name and city of

<TE>   Colonial Inn Pot Pie</TE>
<TE>   Active Work Time: 30 minutes * Total Preparation Time: 1 hour, 15
minutes</TE>
<TE>   3 cups chicken stock</TE>
<TE>   1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup (1/2 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 large carrot, diced</TE>
<TE>   1 large onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   3 stalks celery, diced</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup flour</TE>
<TE>   2 cups whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup frozen peas</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon salt</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon Old Bay seasoning</TE>
<TE>   1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed</TE>
<TE>   1 egg</TE>
<TE>   Bring the chicken stock to a boil in a deep skillet. Add the
chicken breasts, reduce the heat to a simmer and poach the chicken
until cooked through, about 15 minutes. Remove; when cool enough to
handle, chop and set aside. Reserve the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium heat
and add the carrot, onion and celery. Cook until soft, about 10
minutes. Add the flour and stir steadily for 3 minutes. Then add the
stock slowly, stirring, to avoid lumps. Bring to a boil, then reduce
the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Raise the heat to medium and add the cream; cook for 10 minutes.
Add the peas and chicken, salt and pepper to taste, and the Old Bay
seasoning. Cook until hot throughout, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Heat the oven to 425 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Place the mixture in a shallow 2-quart baking dish. Lay the puff
pastry sheet on top, trimming it to fit the dish. You might want to
score the top for a prettier presentation. Bake until the pastry is
puffed and lightly golden, 15 minutes. Combine the egg and 1
tablespoon of water and brush over the pastry. Return the pie to the
oven and continue baking until puffed up and a little more golden, 2
to 3 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Zamarod challow is so laden with spinach, cilantro and dill that it
deserves its Afghani name (sometimes spelled zamarrud chalau), which
means emerald rice. The fresh, herbal flavor is backed up by the
fragrance of basmati rice. Kabul Cuisine in Reseda mixes in a couple
of pieces of grilled chicken to make the dish substantial.</LD>
<LD>   Kabul Cuisine will pack most of its food to go. While waiting,
browse in the market that occupies half the site. Along with spices,
rose water, pomegranate syrup and other Middle Eastern essentials,
there is a halal meat counter, and a display of jewelry, clothing and

<HD>Cabs Have a Winning Year: 1999</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROD SMITH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Things are looking up for Napa Valley vintners. Many Cabernets from
the troubled 1998 vintage may remain unsold, but the top '99s, now
entering the market in force, are getting more takers, and with good
reason. These are the vibrantly rich, supple, structured wines of
Cabernet lovers' dreams.</LD>
<LD>   As usual, the late-released Cabs from Rutherford show the
vintage's highest potential. Cabernet Sauvignon is Napa Valley's
signature varietal, and Rutherford is the valley's premier Cabernet
appellation--particularly its western half, where producers such as
Staglin, Niebaum-Coppola, Frog's Leap and Galleron consistently make
magnificent wines.</LD>
<LD>   It was no accident that legendary Napa Valley wine men such as
Gustav Niebaum and Georges de Latour founded their estates on the
gentle southeast-facing slopes around Rutherford, where the vines
grow on well-drained alluvial soils, basking in the morning and
midday sun but getting early relief from the harshest afternoon heat.
There's a sweetness to the summer heat there, thanks largely to the
slightly cooler exposure along with a localized Pacific influence. A
faint sigh of cool, moist air from the Russian River Valley tempers
the hottest days.</LD>
<TE>   It's a subtle influence. A person trudging through a Rutherford
vineyard in August might not feel it. But the vines do, and it shows
in their fruit.</TE>
<TE>   The 1999 Cabernet Sauvignons being released this fall are mostly
fine examples. They're just the kind of Napa Valley Cabernet I like:
beautifully concentrated and full-bodied, but lucid and defined; they
are voluptuous wines, but not the dense, heavily extracted fruit
bombs that come from hotter growing seasons.</TE>
<TE>   From aroma through finish, a fine Cabernet from Rutherford tells a
story with a moral. For the '98 wines, it went something like, "Don't
let it rain during bud-break and bloom, and don't let the
temperatures get too high or too low." I can still feel the soggy
chill that gripped the valley through much of April and May, and
maybe the vines can too. They never fully caught up after that, and
many of the wines still lack the low notes that come with complete
ripeness.</TE>
<TE>   Wild spring weather hindered flowering and pollination, reducing
the size of the '98 crop. That's not a bad thing in itself, because a
smaller crop generally means more concentrated flavor, but cool
temperatures slowed ripening, and then ferocious heat spikes up to
114 degrees had the same effect, because photosynthesis in grape
vines all but stops when temperatures hit the high 90s.</TE>
<TE>   The weather during the '99 growing season was an entirely
different story. The spring was stable and dry, if cool. Summer
heated up slowly and remained moderate.</TE>
<TE>   "It couldn't have been more different from '98," says Frog's Leap
founder and winemaker John Williams. "It was another small crop that
ripened late, but it lacked the nervous quality some people find in
the '98s. The wines have a lot of intensity, but not from the high
sugars you get with too much heat. They have more subtle character."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the widespread perception of '98 as a relatively weak
vintage, vintners were unwilling to drop their prices (as European
producers would have done) and the pipeline backed up into their
warehouses. Now come the '99s at the same prices ($65-$125),</TE>
<TE>   The Frog's Leap '99 is certainly intense and solidly structured,
with earthy black fruit flavor and a rich tobacco-like note, but it
also has the juicy succulence of the best Rutherford vintages.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the best year I've seen in California," agrees Gary
Galleron, a Napa Valley native and veteran consulting winemaker who
produces several single-vineyard wines under his own label.
"Everything got ripe, with brilliant colors and flavor that rings
like a bell." The '99 Galleron Morisoli Vineyard is a sleek beauty
with powerful fruit, elegant structure and a nicely integrated
savory-sweet oak component.</TE>
<TE>   Staglin Family Vineyards produced one of the most impressive
Rutherford Cabs in memory. Its ravishing perfume heralds a cavalcade
of dark fruit flavors focused by the distinctive high-toned savor of
Cabernet Sauvignon. "It was a long, slow ripening," recalls Staglin's
consulting winemaker Celia Masyczek. "It wasn't a mad dash, like '97.
Any time you've got an extended harvest with moderate temperatures,
that's where you can really pay attention to how the grapes taste and
choose exactly the right moment to pick."</TE>
<TE>   A stone's throw away at Niebaum-Coppola, winemaker Scott McLeod
produced two stunning Cabs: the sumptuously intense yet tightly wound
Rubicon and the richer, more rustic Cask. McLeod says he was
particularly pleased with the quality of the '99 vintage, having been
unable to produce a Rubicon in '98. "The '99 season reminded me of
'97," he says. "It was a classic Napa vintage moderated by weather
that didn't spike. That kind of vintage makes you glad you're in the
Cabernet business."</TE>
<TE>   In '98, says McLeod, his 35-year-old vines never developed the
violet perfume that he feels is the soul of Rubicon. "Fruit from the
Garden Block, the cornerstone of Rubicon, gave up the ghost early,"
he says. "It never was balanced. But in hindsight I'm glad we don't
have a '98 Rubicon out there. While other producers are struggling to
sell their '98s, we can start with a clean slate."</TE>

<LD>This wine pours an inky red with fuchsia highlights and smells like a
bushel of blackberries. Though it pushes the limit of ripe fruit, it
manages to retain an elegant balance. Working with grapes from vines
planted 100 years ago, Joe Battaglini has produced a benchmark Zin,
one that goes beautifully with food. Too bad he made only 530 cases
of it. Hurry, this is pure pleasure in a glass.</LD>
<LD>   About $29. Available at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, (949)
650-8463; Wine Exchange in Orange, (714) 974-1454; and the Wine Club
in Santa Ana, (714) 835-6485. Also available at the winery, (707)

<HD>Developer Seeks to Revive Streets of Downtown Anaheim</HD>
<DH>Real estate: The $65-million plan would include apartments,
stores and a new library around City Hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROGER VINCENT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles developer that played a role in the revitalization of
Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, Old Pasadena and Birch Street
in Brea is looking to do the same thing for downtown Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   CIM Group plans to build a $65-million project of apartments,
stores and a new library in the historic blocks around City Hall in
Orange County's second-largest city.</LD>
<LD>   The city's Redevelopment Agency is negotiating with CIM to
redevelop three sites along Broadway Avenue near such landmarks as
Disney Ice, Center Street Promenade and the former Carnegie Library.
The sites primarily are used for parking but will become part of a
district devoted to art, culture and education, said Anaheim
spokesman John Nicoletti.</LD>
<TE>   Creating a larger residential population in downtown Anaheim would
build more street life, strengthen the Center Street Promenade as an
attraction, and increase the city's economic base, said Shaul Kuba, a
CIM principal.</TE>
<TE>   A trend toward that kind of "place making" has been growing across
the country for several years, said Dean Schwanke, who analyzes real
estate development trends for the Urban Land Institute, an industry
trade group based in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to create a sense of place for an area that might
lack it," Schwanke said. "More and more people are looking for that
environment in their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Planners who want to encourage street life often combine
residential development with office and retail uses. The expectation
is that retailers will serve office workers by day and residents in
the evening, putting people on the sidewalks around the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Redevelopment officials presented the proposal to the City Council
on Tuesday and may recommend adoption this month. Construction could
begin within six months if the developer and city officials can agree
on terms. The proposal calls for Anaheim to sell the property to CIM,
which would develop the sites.</TE>
<TE>   CIM would pay for the development through its CIM California Urban
Real Estate Fund, a pool of money raised by institutional investors
including the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the
California State Teachers Retirement System for investment in urban
developments on the West Coast.</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim was settled in the mid- 1800s by German farmers. The city
thrived as a citrus producer until the post-World War II population
growth in Southern California turned orange groves into subdivisions
and the Santa Ana freeway opened the city to manufacturing and
tourism--most notably Disneyland, which opened in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   The city's business districts have struggled for decades as
business owners and retailers have come to view Anaheim primarily as
a tourist destination and moved to rising business centers such as
Irvine and Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As proposed, the project would include:</TE>
<TE>   * An 80,000-square-foot library on the site surrounding the
historic Carnegie Library, now the Anaheim Museum, at the northwest
corner of Broadway and Anaheim Boulevard. It would replace the city's
main library a few blocks away. It would have a second-story terrace
connected to the Carnegie building and have separate floors for
children and teens. Also on that site would be a four-story apartment
building that would have stores on the ground floor and 100 to 130
rental units with subterranean parking.</TE>
<TE>   * Seventy to 90 loft-style apartments, with retail stores on the
ground floor, at the northeast corner of Broadway and Lemon Street.</TE>
<TE>   * Eighty to 100 rental lofts at the southwest corner of Center
Street Promenade bounded by Clementine Street and Broadway. An
additional 150 to 200 apartments would be built atop an existing
parking structure adjacent to the Wells Fargo Bank building at the
corner of Broadway and Harbor Boulevard.</TE>

<HD>Automakers See Moderate Sales Rise</HD>
<DH>Retail: September's results are mixed among U.S. car
brands. But comparisons are skewed by terror attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>U.S. auto sales rose moderately in September and were nearly flat
over the first three quarters compared with 2001, suggesting that
consumers aren't significantly worried over about economic malaise,
turmoil in stock markets and the prospect of war with Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of passenger cars and trucks rose 2.9% last month compared
with September 2001, and the overall market inched up 1% over the
first three quarters compared with the same period in 2001.</LD>
<LD>   "The September University of Michigan [consumer confidence] survey
shows that consumers continue to view vehicle buying conditions very
favorably," said Jarleth Costello, Ford Motor Co. senior economist.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless General Motors Corp. saw its U.S. vehicle sales tumble
12.7% last month, while DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group soared 18.1%
and Ford rose marginally amid a market full of interest-free loans
and other financial incentives to customers.</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts and executives expected sales to slow down in
September, when GM suspended the no-interest loans in the first half
of the month but reinstituted them for the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "After a huge August, the slowdown in September demand was in line
with our expectations," said auto analyst John Casesa of Merrill
Lynch.</TE>
<TE>   "Our September sales performance was softer than expected,"
conceded Bill Lovejoy, GM's group vice president of North America
vehicle sales, service and marketing. "However, when you consider our
exceptional sales performance in July and August, lean inventories
and the competitive environment, we expected there would be some
weakening in September sales."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ballew, GM's chief market analyst, called September "a
one-month aberration" and said it was not a reason to worry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't read too much into it," Ballew told reporters in a
conference call. "GM sales were up 10% in the third quarter."</TE>
<TE>   GM has been churning out sales for more than a year since it
introduced interest-free loans in September 2001 shortly after the
terrorist attacks on the U.S., and the momentum was bound to slow.</TE>
<TE>   "September last year was pretty remarkable, and the industry had
taken some pretty dramatic steps to push sales, so I wouldn't want to
look at the year-over-year comparison as telling a story," said David
Garrity, an auto industry analyst at American Technology Research.</TE>
<TE>   Chrysler's leap isn't surprising either, he said, noting the
company's profit and volume woes of last year and its late
participation in no-interest loans.</TE>
<TE>   The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for September was 16.3
million units, up incrementally from 16.18 million vehicles in
September 2001. Last year's sales finished at 17.1 million, the
second best on record.</TE>
<TE>   "We are encouraged by the company's improving market share trend,"
said Jim O'Connor, group vice president of North America marketing,
sales and service at Ford, whose sales rose marginally by 1.6% in
September, excluding its European luxury brands. "This provides
tangible evidence that we are starting to get some traction from our
revitalization plan."</TE>
<TE>   But bad news for Ford came Tuesday from Wall Street, where UBS
Warburg had harsh words for Ford's turnaround plan and lowered its
share price target from $9.50 to $7.</TE>
<TE>   "We see no end to considerable operational problems that Ford
Motor is facing today," UBS Warburg analyst Saul Rubin wrote in a
report. "A far more significant restructuring/resizing of the motor
business than currently envisaged is inevitable, in our view, and the
only question is when it will occur. The sooner the better."</TE>
<TE>   Ford lost $5.45 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Ford nevertheless joined GM in offering expanded no-interest
financing on 2003 models. GM is offering 60-month interest-free loans
on most 2002 and 2003 cars and trucks or cash rebates up to $4,000
through the end of this month.</TE>
<TE>   Ford is offering 36-month, no-interest loans on almost all its
vehicles through Jan. 2, or rebates up to $2,000 on trucks and SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   The interest-free financing represents considerable lost income to
the automakers, which can make good profits from their financial
arms. The rush of consumers to take advantage of the deals also draws
away customers from subsequent months such as September.</TE>
<TE>   Most other manufacturers reported generally improved sales last
month over September 2001, but the comparison is skewed by the sudden
drop-off in sales in the week following the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks and the subsequent flurry of incentives to lure consumers
back into showrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Over the first three quarters of this year, luxury imports showed
modest to strong growth, with Infiniti up 21.8%, Lexus up 9%, BMW up
7.3%, Mercedes-Benz up 2.8%, Acura up 1.9% and Audi up 0.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Other foreign brands were healthy: Mitsubishi up 14.1%, Nissan up
7.6%, Honda up 3.9%, Toyota up 3.5% and Mazda up 2.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Korean brands continued their strong showing, with Hyundai up
14.7% over the first nine months of the year and Kia up 13.3%</TE>
<TE>   Volkswagen was the only major automaker whose sales fell over the
first three quarters, by 1.2%.</TE>

<LD>A Beverly Hills investment advisor has agreed to repay $310,000 in
overcharges stemming from what the Securities and Exchange Commission
called unequal treatment of clients from 1997 through 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC, which announced the settlement Tuesday, also censured
Daniel H. Renberg and his Renberg Capital Management Inc. and levied
a $40,000 fine. Renberg didn't admit wrongdoing. His attorney said
Renberg made nothing on the transactions and believed there were
legitimate reasons for them.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC charged Renberg with failing to obtain the best execution
costs for clients. He had purchased securities at the best
open-market prices for clients with tax-free accounts, then sold some
of the securities from those accounts to clients with taxable
accounts, always charging more than the open-market price, the SEC
said.</LD>

<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick's pledge to cover the
losses of employees who invested in company stock was welcomed by
some Tuesday, but others said the surprise gesture would do little to
placate angry workers, shareholders and creditors.</LD>
<LD>   Winnick made the $25-million offer during five hours of harsh
questioning from federal lawmakers, who were focused on allegations
that Global Crossing used improper accounting to hide the firm's
precarious financial condition from the public while insiders such as
Winnick reaped millions through stock sales.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's oversight and
investigations panel were caught off guard. "You just shocked a lot
of people, and you should be proud of that," said subcommittee
Chairman James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.).</LD>
<TE>   Skeptics viewed Winnick's move as an attempt to "inoculate"
himself from investigations of the company and into his sale of $124
million in stock on May 23, 2001, after insiders warned of problems.</TE>
<TE>   All told, Winnick cashed out more than $600 million in Global
Crossing stock. The $25 million represents about 4% of that.</TE>
<TE>   "He's hoping that it will seem to be enough of a contrite gesture
that he will appear to share the pain," said Nell Minow, editor of
the Corporate Library, a Web site devoted to corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   "But he's got a lot more left over once that is gone, and I don't
think the government will be satisfied with that."</TE>
<TE>   Noting that Winnick also challenged other executives to "step up
and write a check," Minow said chief executives under scrutiny for
questionable transactions probably are watching Winnick's pledge "to
see if it works."</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing workers had mixed reactions.</TE>
<TE>   The offer from Winnick "is like having somebody pick your pocket
and then offering to give you back the lint," said Michael Nighan,
who has led a group of former employees trying to recoup millions in
cut-off severance pay.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked and pleased," said an employee who asked not to be
named.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess there are those who would say that he's doing this to
save his reputation, but no one else has come forward with this kind
of gesture, and there are many CEOs in a similar position."</TE>
<TE>   Winnick has been criticized for selling shares and for spending
lavishly on a Bel-Air mansion as his company crumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick's testimony was preceded by that of Lenette Crumpler, who
works at a company purchased by Global Crossing. Crumpler, a single
mother with 31 years of service, blamed the loss of $86,000 in 401(k)
holdings on "men of gluttonous greed."</TE>
<TE>   The $25 million is meant to cover the amount Global Crossing
employees invested in stock through the company's 401(k) investment
plan. Winnick's offer covers only contributions made by employees to
the plan, not company matches. At its peak, the plan was worth more
than $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick attorney Terry Christensen dismissed claims that Winnick's
offer was insincere.</TE>
<TE>   He said Winnick discussed the idea with him several months ago,
but the plan was rejected. Christensen said he did not know that
Winnick had decided to go ahead with it until he announced it
Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were designed to stop or slow down or impact any of the
other [investigations], I would have told him to save his money,"
Christensen said.</TE>

<HD>Eisner Aims Low on Recovery</HD>
<DH>Earnings: Disney's chairman downplays growth in 2003, as
well as ABC's performance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner said Tuesday that the stock
market has overreacted to Disney's problems. But the recovery he is
forecasting, analysts say, underscores just how tough times have been
for the once-dominant entertainment giant.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech at a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. investor conference in
Manhattan, Eisner said he expects Disney to post "strong double-digit
EPS [earnings per share] growth in 2003."</LD>
<LD>   The consensus of analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call is for
Disney to earn 56 cents a share in fiscal 2002, which ended Monday,
and 71 cents a share in fiscal 2003. That would be a 27% increase,
easily meeting Eisner's double-digit standard.</LD>
<TE>   On the other hand, the company earned 95 cents a share as recently
as 1997, and nobody is projecting a quick return to that territory.</TE>
<TE>   "We do expect the company will grow profit substantially,"
Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias said, adding,
however, that there are "a lot of uncertainties."</TE>
<TE>   Although she expects the Disney theme parks to rebound and
contribute significantly to growth, Styponias said a war with Iraq
could lead to another falloff in vacation travel, like the disastrous
decline that followed the Sept. 11 terror attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, in a question-and-answer session after his speech,
acknowledged the ongoing talks toward combining Disney's ABC News
operations with those of rival AOL Time Warner Inc.'s CNN, but called
reports of an imminent deal "very premature." He noted those
discussions have been ongoing for several years and added: "I
wouldn't rank this as more than a 50/50 possibility at this point."</TE>
<TE>   With ABC-TV's lineup a distant third in the ratings, behind NBC
and CBS, analysts have called the TV season critical to Disney's
performance. Eisner again sought to lower expectations, saying he
doesn't expect ABC to quickly regain the No. 1 spot; the goal,
instead, is "to achieve a clear shift in momentum."</TE>
<TE>   Staff writer Richard Verrier contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Manufacturing Shrinks First Time in 8 Months</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. manufacturing contracted in September for the first time in
eight months, an industry survey showed Tuesday, the latest sign that
the economic recovery is hobbling into the final quarter of 2002.</LD>
<LD>   Business investment "is very weak right now and I just don't see
any signs of recovery," said Jeffrey Immelt, chief executive of
General Electric Co., during a trip to Seoul. "The U.S. economy is in
a period of slow growth."</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management's factory index dropped to
49.5, reflecting a slowdown in production and declining employment,
from 50.5 in August. The index had been greater than 50, signaling
growth, since February.</LD>
<TE>   Still, a survey Monday showing manufacturing in the Chicago area
contracted for the first time in eight months had analysts bracing
for a much more substantial decline, said Steven Ricchiuto, chief
economist at ABN Amro Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, construction spending fell in August for a fourth
straight month, the longest string of declines since April to July
2000, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A decrease in business spending for new offices and factories
pushed down the value of all construction spending by 0.4% in August,
the Commerce Department said. The $159.2-billion value of
construction of nonresidential buildings is the lowest in six years.</TE>
<TE>   For its manufacturing report, the Tempe, Ariz.-based ISM group
surveys more than 400 companies in 20 industries, including clothing,
printing, transportation, furniture and plastics. Manufacturing
accounts for about one-sixth of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The production index, a gauge of work being performed, fell to
50.9 in September from 55.6. The employment index declined to 44.9
from 45.8.</TE>
<TE>   The index of inventories fell to 43.6 from 45.2, indicating
inventories are being run down at a faster pace.</TE>
<TE>   The new orders index, which accounts for about a third of the
total, rose to 50.9 from 49.7 in August.</TE>
<TE>   The backlog of orders index fell to 44.5 from 45. The new export
orders index dropped to 51.8 from 52.7. The index of prices paid for
supplies rose to 62.5 from 61.5.</TE>

<HD>Mission Energy's Debt Rating Is Cut to 'Junk'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison Mission Energy's credit rating on $5.3 billion of its debt was
slashed to "junk" status Tuesday by Moody's Investors Service, which
cited concern over weak power markets.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's said Mission Energy's efforts to reduce its debt are being
hampered by low power prices and a slumping market for surplus power
plants and generating capacity.</LD>
<LD>   Irvine-based Mission Energy is an independent power producer and
energy trader that is a subsidiary of Rosemead-based Edison
International, which also owns Southern California Edison, the
state's second-largest power utility.</LD>
<TE>   Moody's cut Mission Energy's senior unsecured debt to Ba3, three
notches below what is generally considered investment-grade debt.</TE>
<TE>   The rating firm said it was concerned that revenue from the
company's power generation in the Midwest, which represents a sizable
portion of its cash flow, will decline beginning in 2003 because of
the expiration of contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Mission Energy spokesman Kevin Kelly said the company is confident
it will be able to sell the output from those plants.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said the company's credit rating had been under review since
July and considering the tough environment for power producers, the
downgrade did not come as a surprise. The ratings cut included a
number of Mission Energy-affiliated companies.</TE>
<TE>   "EME believes it has ample liquidity to meet its needs and has
more than $500 million of undrawn credit lines and available cash,"
Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's concurred in its report, noting that Mission Energy has
only $173 million in debt coming due in 2004, and then nothing more
until 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Mission Energy has taken steps to conserve cash and
improve its operations, Kelly said. It suspended development of new
power plants last year, trimmed its debt by $700 million over the
last year and is selling minority interests in its power plants.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Edison International rose 21 cents to close at $10.21 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>European Stocks' Dismal Year</HD>
<DH>Outlook: After a steep slide, few experts see a lasting
rebound soon as investors refocus on structural problems in the
economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>Battered and bleak, European stock markets are among the world's
worst performers this year, and few analysts see much hope of a
sustained turnaround soon.</LD>
<LD>   The view across Europe's economic landscape is sobering. A Mideast
war looms. Consumer confidence has plunged. Technology stocks have
suffered even bigger losses than U.S. tech shares. Telecommunications
companies need multibillion-dollar bailouts.</LD>
<LD>   What's more, the economic magic long promised by the European
Union and its move to a single currency is belied by statistics in
countries such as Germany, where the economy is growing at a meager
1.4% real rate this year, the unemployment rate is nearly 10%, and
neither the unions nor the government is willing to trim costly
social and welfare programs.</LD>
<TE>   Stock markets have fallen steeply around the globe, but Europe's
slide has been markedly nasty. Since the beginning of the year,
Germany's blue-chip stock index is down 44% in local currency terms.
The Swedish market has fallen 46%, the French market is down 39% and
the Spanish and Italian markets both are off 35%.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the U.S. blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index is
down 26%. Japan's Nikkei-225 index is down 13%. European markets
suffered bigger losses than the U.S. S&amp;P 500 in 2001 as well.</TE>
<TE>   What to do? Many European market analysts don't know. They
grimace. They sneer. They scratch their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Although share prices are expected to rally today on the heels of
Wall Street's snap-back on Tuesday, many experts don't see fuel for a
lasting rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "The mood is very gloomy at the moment," said Friedrich Heinemann,
a researcher at the Mannheim European Center for Economic Research.
"The European economy has been dependent on exports. It is tied to
the locomotive of the U.S., but with the U.S. down, there's no energy
pulling the European economy anymore. There's no internal demand."</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the U.S. economy and the peaks and valleys of its
financial markets are seldom underestimated in Europe. Roughly
one-fifth of corporate Europe's revenues come from the U.S.,
according to a recent survey in the Economist.</TE>
<TE>   The slump on Wall Street, and the possibility of a war with Iraq
that could send oil prices soaring, are again reminding Europe that
its fortunes remain tied to larger spheres.</TE>
<TE>   Some European officials have tried to put the best face on stocks'
dismal showing this year, saying it has to be viewed in the context
of troubled markets worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Others see deeper problems. "People don't trust the markets
anymore, they don't trust the products, they don't trust the
companies," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, director of 7 Investment
Management in London.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're looking at now is the detritus of 20 years of bull
markets, corporate greed and mishandling of funds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Germany said it will shut down its tech-stock
market--the Neuer Markt--next year. When it was created in 1997, the
Neuer was supposed to be Europe's rival to the U.S. Nasdaq market.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Neuer Markt's shares have lost 96% of their value
from the market's peak in 2000. That is far worse than the Nasdaq's
76% drop from its 2000 peak.</TE>
<TE>   A rebound in the euro currency's value against the dollar earlier
this year stoked hopes that Europe was becoming more alluring to
global investors. But since late June the euro has stalled out.</TE>
<TE>   Even though key measures of stock valuation show European markets
now are cheaper than the U.S. market, investors again are focused on
long-standing structural problems in the economy that European
governments are reluctant to address for fear of angering unions and
pensioners.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a decade of calls for labor market reforms, the major
economies of Germany and Italy are shackled by generous welfare and
social benefits that eat away at the gross domestic product. France
has made some reforms in recent years, but analysts are troubled by
recent trends favoring unions.</TE>
<TE>   Germany is the extreme case of what's troubling Europe. With a
population of 82 million, Germany is Europe's biggest economy,
comprising one-third of the euro zone. But it is anemic. Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder--who won a tough reelection last month with union
backing--is showing no indications that he'll introduce significant
economic reforms. Retail sales are down from a year ago and 4 million
people are unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are quite pessimistic," said Christoph Hausen, an economist at
Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "We have these problems and we're still
struggling after 12 years with the unification of east and west
Germany."</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts also see hopes fading that more capital will become
available to European entrepreneurs through equity markets in the
longer run.</TE>
<TE>   Europeans traditionally have been more timid than Americans in
playing the stock market. They invest a much lower percentage of
their savings and pensions in equities. The boom of the late 1990s,
however, enticed many Europeans to enter the bourse.</TE>
<TE>   But the euphoria was fleeting as portfolios have plunged. Experts
worry that many individuals who have fled the stock market in recent
months will never return.</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market culture in Germany is a relatively recent
phenomenon," Heinemann said. "They got in during the boom and made
these big gains. Now, they are shocked. I don't think people will
turn completely away. Maybe about one-third will not come back."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that also may be true of many U.S. investors. But 7
Investment Management's Urquhart Stewart said there is a significant
need to rethink European approaches to business--and to personal
finance.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be a tightening up of regulatory control and
corporate governance," he said. "But the real remedy is education....
We've had a nanny state for so long with state education funds,
corporate pension schemes and paid university education [that] nobody
knows how to manage their own funds."</TE>
<TE>   Janet Stobart in The Times' London bureau and Achrene Sicakyuz in
the Paris bureau contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Fannie Mae Interest Rate Risk Eases; Shares Jump</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mortgage giant Fannie Mae said Tuesday that it increased its
protection against falling interest rates last month, easing concern
that its profit margins would be squeezed.</LD>
<LD>   The news spurred a rally in Fannie Mae stock and prompted
investors to turn away from Treasury bonds as some traders bet the
mortgage financier would need to buy less government debt. Shares of
Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of U.S. mortgages, rose $5.68 to
$65.22, and shares of Freddie Mac, the second-biggest mortgage buyer,
rose $3.25 to $59.15.</LD>
<LD>   Fannie Mae said a measure of its interest-rate risk narrowed,
reversing a five-month trend that worsened as the lowest rates in
decades fueled a surge in home refinancing.</LD>
<TE>   Faster-than-expected prepayments on loans in Fannie Mae's
$747-billion portfolio raised speculation that income from assets
would fall before the company could refinance its debt to lower
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae said its so-called duration gap shrank to minus-10
months in September from minus-14 months in August. Although smaller,
the gap still is outside the company's desired range of plus or minus
six months.</TE>
<TE>   Fannie Mae stock had tumbled 18% over the last 2 1/2 weeks as
interest rates dropped to the lowest levels in more than four
decades.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've already seen is costing them some future earnings, and
that's one reason the stock got hit," said Mike Ancell, an analyst at
Banc of America Capital Management in St. Louis. "But it seems to be
less of a problem than some folks thought it was."</TE>
<TE>   The August duration number fueled speculation that Fannie Mae
would have to protect itself from refinancing by increasing purchases
of interest-rate derivatives and U.S. government debt.</TE>
<TE>   Investors retreated from government bonds Tuesday as dealers
expected Fannie Mae will be less likely to purchase Treasuries, which
are a more expensive option than adding new mortgages. The yield on
the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 3.72% from Monday's close
of 3.60%.</TE>

<HD>Results of FCC's Media Studies Are Released</HD>
<DH>Regulations: The agency is expected to use the findings to
provide justification for future rules on ownership.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Media consolidation has not reduced the diversity of programs on
television and radio, although concentration of ownership may result
in more TV commercials and similar slants in news coverage, according
to government studies released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission requested the 12 studies as
part of its review of media-ownership rules, which cap the growth of
broadcasters and restrict TV stations from merging with newspapers
and radio stations in the same market.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 18 months, appellate judges in Washington repeatedly
have overturned or remanded the FCC's media-ownership rules, saying
they lacked adequate justification. As a result, FCC Chairman Michael
K. Powell has said his agency will unveil a new set of
media-ownership rules by next year.</LD>
<TE>   "The FCC is going to use these studies to provide the
justification for all these future rules," said Richard E. Wiley, a
former FCC chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The studies, prepared by the FCC and various universities,
generally offered support for Powell and large media companies that
are seeking to repeal or relax the rules.</TE>
<TE>   One study, conducted by Joel Waldfogel, professor of business and
public policy at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania, suggested that consumers are using the Internet
increasingly as a substitute for television news.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the rise of the Internet, some have argued that the
media-ownership rules no longer are needed.</TE>
<TE>   Those findings, however, appeared to be contradicted by a Nielsen
Media Research survey of 3,000 consumers, who said they relied mostly
on broadcast TV, cable news and daily newspapers to stay informed. In
this study, more than 83% said they relied on TV for national news
compared with 21% who used the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "These studies represent an unprecedented data-gathering effort to
better understand market and consumer issues so that we may develop
sound public policy," Powell said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   But FCC officials declined to comment further on the surveys,
saying they did not want to spin the results in any particular
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Chester, founder of the Center for Digital Democracy,
questioned whether the studies offered an unbiased view of the media
rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The studies released today reveal a deeply flawed perspective
that--while ratifying the chairman's view--fails to adequately assess
the realities of the news and entertainment media marketplace,"
Chester said. "A research agenda on this critical issue should be
developed and conducted outside of the FCC--not with staffers who
must please the chairman."</TE>
<TE>   Though some worry that increased media consolidation will result
in less local programming, a study by FCC staff concluded that
network-owned TV stations provided 23% more local news and public
affairs programming than network affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   The same study concluded that TV stations that are jointly owned
with newspapers received higher ratings, won more awards and produced
more programs. Those results will provide ammunition to media
corporations, including Tribune Co. (parent of the Los Angeles
Times), that are seeking to repeal the newspaper-television
cross-ownership ban.</TE>
<TE>   A study by David Pritchard, media law professor at the University
of Wisconsin, found that of 10 commonly owned newspaper-television
combinations, five had a similar slant in covering the final weeks of
the 2000 presidential election, while five had different slants.</TE>
<TE>   The release of the studies starts the clock ticking for the FCC's
long-anticipated review of the media rules. The commission will give
interested parties 90 days to comment on the studies and the proposed
rule changes. It promises to complete the process by next spring.</TE>

<HD>Global Chairman Defends Sale of Stock</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Winnick tells House panel that he was unaware of
firm's dire straits when he sold shares for $124million. He pledges
$25 million to workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick told a congressional panel
Tuesday that he was unaware his company was in dire financial straits
when he pocketed nearly $124 million by selling company stock last
year, and he sought to make amends by pledging $25 million of his own
money to compensate workers whose retirement savings dissipated as
the share price slumped to mere pennies.</LD>
<LD>   But members of the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigations disputed Winnick's portrayal of himself as a detached
leader who was not active in the company's day-to-day affairs.
Instead, they said Winnick was "well aware" of the telecommunications
upstart's controversial practice of swapping transmission capacity on
its network with other firms to boost revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Winnick's testimony and financial offer were aimed at dispelling
growing legal and political pressure on the Los Angeles telecom
mogul, whose company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
January amid an industrywide meltdown.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time Winnick has spoken publicly about Global
since the bankruptcy filing. He was subpoenaed by the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's business maneuvers and Winnick's stock trades
are being examined by the House investigations subcommittee, the
House Financial Services Committee, the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick and other executives at Global Crossing and Qwest
Communications International Inc. have been accused of doing swap
deals to fool Wall Street. Subcommittee investigators describe the
deals as "sham transactions" because they allegedly involved an equal
exchange of assets. That allowed each company to book revenue right
away and hide the corresponding purchase price as a long-term
expense.</TE>
<TE>   Under repeated questioning by members of the subcommittee, Winnick
said he was unaware of the telecommunications company's deteriorating
financial condition before he sold nearly $124 million worth of
Global stock on May 23, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick blamed his company's financial fall on an industry
meltdown triggered by a global economic slump and massive
overbuilding in the telecom industry. This year, Global Crossing
agreed to be sold to two Asian companies for $250 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Global Crossing's bankruptcy, based on the facts known to me, is
a result not of any fraud, but of a catastrophe that befell an entire
industry sector," Winnick said.</TE>
<TE>   But documents released by the subcommittee this week suggest that
Winnick took a far more active role in trying to burnish the
financial image of his faltering company.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick acknowledged that his efforts included meeting with an
executive of energy trader Enron Corp., which also swapped
transmission capacity with phone companies.</TE>
<TE>   And Rep. James C. Greenwood (R-Pa.), chairman of the
investigations subcommittee, said other documents and interviews his
panel has conducted with Global Crossing employees indicate that
Winnick was "well aware of Global Crossing's strategy to use an ever
increasing number of swaps to meet Wall Street's revenue
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood got Winnick to admit that he talked daily with former
company Chief Executive Tom Casey and that Casey had expressed
concern about Global's financial condition weeks before Winnick's May
stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood read from the minutes of an April 16, 2001, Global
Crossing management committee meeting in which Casey warned panel
members, "We do not have room for more reciprocal deals. The company
... is running at an expense rate that is ridiculous."</TE>
<TE>   But Winnick denied that Casey painted such a dire financial
picture of Global Crossing at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't come out with the same interpretation as you, Mr.
Chairman," Winnick said.</TE>
<TE>   The subcommittee also released documents that showed a former
Global Crossing executive was so concerned about the company's future
that he suggested shopping the company to a buyer to rescue it.</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market can be fooled, but not forever, and it is
fundamentally insightful and always unforgiving of being misled,"
wrote Leo Hindery, who briefly served as Global Crossing's chief
executive.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick described the June 2000 memo as a "cover your booty"
document, meant to provide an explanation for what he described as
Hindery's unauthorized overtures to an investment banking firm on
behalf of Global Crossing.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, who founded Global Crossing in 1997, was one of five
current and former company executives who testified Tuesday. The
panel also heard from four officials from Qwest, including Chief
Operating Officer Afshin Mohebbi and Joseph Nacchio, who resigned as
chief executive in June amid an SEC investigation but remains a
consultant with the company.</TE>
<TE>   In defending his use of swaps, Nacchio said he backed the move
after input from his top executives and Qwest's outside auditor,
Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, we had no reason to doubt Arthur Andersen's advice,
then one of the country's leading accounting firms," Nacchio said.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick told the panel that he would donate $25 million to a fund
to help former Global Crossing workers. The money reflects the amount
of cash that workers put into their 401(k) plans after the 1999
merger of Global Crossing and Frontier Corp., a local phone company
based in Rochester, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "I let them down, not because we engaged in fraud or insider
trading but because we ran into a very difficult economic period" as
a company, Winnick said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked by Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) whether he would make a
similar gesture, Nacchio demurred.</TE>
<TE>   "Qwest is not bankrupt" like Global Crossing, Nacchio said. "It
has a pension plan."Before Winnick and Nacchio spoke, the
subcommittee heard from two women who worked for Qwest and Global
Crossing. They blasted company management, saying executives left the
lives of thousands of workers in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   "Our leaders were men of gluttonous greed who told shareholders to
hold on while they were unloading their stock options and bailing out
fast," said Lenette Crumpler, who worked at Frontier.</TE>
<TE>   "So many middle-class American dreams have been shattered."</TE>

<LD>Carlsbad, Calif.-based Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Tuesday that
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. agreed to lend it $21 million to complete a
manufacturing facility for an experimental lung cancer drug. The deal
expands a year-old collaboration between the firms.</LD>
<LD>   Isis licensed the drug, Affinitac, to Lilly in August 2001 in
exchange for royalties on sales of the medication and as much as $200
million in equity, fees and milestone payments. Affinitac, the first
drug developed by Isis, is in late-stage clinical trials.</LD>
<LD>   During a call with analysts, Isis Chairman and Chief Executive
Stanley T. Crooke cautioned that the deal "does not imply any
knowledge about the progress" of the clinical trial. Results won't be
known for months, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Isis shares rose 34 cents to $10.20 on Nasdaq. Lilly shares rose

<HD>Rally Jump-Starts Fourth Quarter; Dow Climbs 4.6%</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The index notches its best gain since July 29
as investors are encouraged by upbeat profit outlooks and an
Iraq-U.N. accord.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After suffering through the worst quarter in 15 years for U.S.
stocks, Wall Street started the fourth quarter on a bright note
Tuesday as the Dow industrials notched their best gain in more than
two months.</LD>
<LD>   Investors were encouraged by upbeat earnings outlooks from a
variety of companies and by an accord between Iraq and the United
Nations that tempered fears of war.</LD>
<LD>   Also, after major indexes tumbled to multiyear lows in the third
quarter--which ended Monday--investors were primed for a rally,
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "The market has gotten so oversold, if it senses any corporate
confidence it will respond positively," said Subodh Kumar, strategist
at CIBC World Markets in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The rally came despite reminders that the market's underlying
problems haven't gone away. The day's economic reports were
lackluster, and the U.S. responded negatively to the U.N.-Iraq pact.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure the fundamental news that came out [Tuesday] really
jibes with the reaction in the market," said Thomas McManus,
strategist at Banc of America Securities in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In active trading, the Dow soared 346.86 points, or 4.6%, to
7,938.79 as all 30 of its members rose. It was the biggest gain for
the Dow since July 29.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index rallied 32.63 points, or
4%, to 847.91, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose
41.66 points, or 3.6%, to 1,213.72. Two stocks rose for every one
that fell on the New York Stock Exchange, while winners edged losers
by 4 to 3 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The gains came one day after the Dow and S&amp;P 500 closed out their
worst quarter since the crash of 1987. In the quarter, the Dow fell
17.9% and the S&amp;P 500 17.6%.</TE>
<TE>   On the corporate earnings front Tuesday, a diverse group of
companies that included Walt Disney, Verizon Communications, Dell
Computer and Forest Labs provided comments that "were encouraging in
one way or another" for 2003, Kumar said.</TE>
<TE>   Phone giant Verizon gained $2.14 to $29.58 after saying it will
meet its 2002 profit forecast. Drug maker Forest Labs soared $7.84 to
$89.85 after saying earnings in the latest quarter will beat
analysts' consensus estimate. Disney climbed 56 cents to $15.70 after
Chief Executive Michael Eisner said he expects "strong double-digit"
profit growth next year.</TE>
<TE>   Dell, meanwhile, said after regular trading ended that its
third-quarter sales would beat forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The rally got underway in earnest after U.N. and Iraqi negotiators
said Baghdad agreed to a resumption of weapons inspections, which
gave some relief to investors fearing war between the U.S. and Iraq.
However, the Bush administration termed the agreement inadequate and
said inspections shouldn't resume without a new, more forceful U.N.
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "As I talk to individuals and professionals I get the sense that
Iraq is weighing more heavily on the minds of investors than some
people realize," said Mark Keller, chief investment officer at A.G.
Edwards Asset Management in St. Louis. "Certainly, the market seems
to react to each development."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, investors seemed to shrug off reports that construction
and manufacturing spending remain weak and that auto sales slowed
last month. A string of weak economic reports has spurred speculation
that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates again to buoy the
fragile recovery.</TE>
<TE>   But Treasury bond yields jumped Tuesday as some investors moved
money from bonds to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Teen clothing retailer Aeropostale sank $8.90, or 58%, to $6.50
on a reduced profit forecast. Other clothing firms that cater to
teens also fell. Abercrombie &amp; Fitch lost $1.47 to $18.20, Pacific
Sunwear of California fell $1.11 to $19.25, Quiksilver fell $1.49 to
$21.10 and Wet Seal lost $1.02 to $8.98.</TE>
<TE>   * Oil prices rose toward 19-month highs as the threat of a severe
storm disruption to Gulf of Mexico oil and gas operations pushed
crude up 38 cents a barrel to $30.83 in New York trading. Oil stocks
rose in tandem: Exxon Mobil gained $2.02 to $33.92, ChevronTexaco
jumped $2.86 to $72.11 and ConocoPhillips tacked on $1.87 to $48.11.</TE>
<TE>   * IBM rose $2.86 to $61.17 after winning a 10-year, $1.12-billion
contract to manage computers and telecommunications for Boots,
Britain's largest pharmacy chain.</TE>

<HD>Nintendo Cuts Profit Forecast on Slow Sales</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: It cites weak demand for its consoles. News
casts shadow on shares of some game publishers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALEX PHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nintendo Co., creator of the "Super Mario Sunshine" video game, is
heading into financially stormy times as sales of its consoles fall
short of expectations.</LD>
<LD>   Buffeted by a weak economy in Japan, the Kyoto-based game company
Tuesday cut its profit forecast by 11% to $657 million for its fiscal
year ending March 31.</LD>
<LD>   The company cited slower demand in Japan for its GameCube and Game
Boy Advance consoles, coupled with a strong yen that devalues sales
in North America and Europe, where it reaps more than half its
revenue.</LD>
<TE>   The announcement cast a shadow on shares of several U.S. game
publishers.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of THQ Inc., which gets 26% of its revenue from Game Boy
titles, hit a 52-week low of $18.35 before closing down $1.67 to
$19.13. Activision Inc. lost $1.83 to close at $22.10. Electronic
Arts Inc., which is more closely aligned with Sony Corp.'s
PlayStation 2 console, rose 63 cents to $66.59. All three companies
trade on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Nintendo said it expects to sell 10 million GameCubes during its
fiscal year, down from earlier estimates of 12 million. It also cut
projected sales of its hand-held Game Boy Advance consoles to 15
million from 19 million. Game Boy Advance software also is expected
to take a hit, down 12% to 50 million cartridges.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of GameCube software, where Nintendo makes the bulk of its
profit, are expected to exceed estimates by 53%, rising to 55 million
copies from a forecast of 36 million.</TE>
<TE>   The results include a $183-million cash gain from selling its 49%
stake in Rare Ltd., a Britain-based game developer, to Microsoft
Corp. last month.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Nintendo's revisions should not be taken as a sign of
flagging demand for games. Michael Pachter, analyst with Wedbush
Morgan Securities, said better-than-expected sales of GameCube
software indicate the reverse--that the video game market is headed
for another record year.</TE>
<TE>   As for the weakness in sales volumes, Nintendo pointed to an
extended recession in Japan and weak demand in Europe. Sales in North
America, however, remain strong, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are healthy here in the U.S.," said Perrin Kaplan, vice
president of marketing for Nintendo of America. "We continue to
expect growth here."</TE>

<HD>Woes Spreading Beyond Ports</HD>
<DH>Commerce: Retailers and manufacturers face a dilemma: wait
for the ports to open or pay a premium to ship by air.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Steele stared Tuesday morning at the fine print on his shipment
status report, trying to figure out which of his company's shorts and
sweatshirts were stranded at sea by the West Coast ports closure.</LD>
<LD>   "Rough day today," said Steele, a freight traffic manager for
Irvine-based O'Neill Clothing, which sells surf wear and other casual
clothes.</LD>
<LD>   With about half of its apparel for the holiday shopping season
missing in action, the Irvine sportswear firm is among thousands of
manufacturers and retailers across the country concerned about how
the trouble at the ports will affect their businesses.</LD>
<TE>   Officials at shoemaker Sole Technology Inc., for example, wonder
whether the Lake Forest company will be able to deliver some of its
latest skate shoes to retailers in time for the Christmas season,
spokesman Timothy Nickloff said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very, very difficult time," Nickloff said. "All three of
our brands are basically out there."</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a shipment from China takes two weeks to arrive in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, many apparel importers are facing a decision--whether to
hope the lockout ends in time to get their shipments, or to bite the
bullet and pay the premium for air freight.</TE>
<TE>   Importing apparel by air would cut into margins, "but better to
cut in on their margins and deliver products than not deliver at
all," said Dan McInerny, a Surf Industry Manufacturing Assn. board
member who owns Hub 360, an industry Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "This could go on for a day, a week, a month. Who knows? So it's a
real crapshoot for some of these companies."</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Klinefelter, a retail analyst at brokerage firm U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, said some apparel retailers, such as
Limited Brands Inc. and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co., anticipated the
ports' problem and put some key holiday items on air-cargo flights
instead of ships.</TE>
<TE>   But "the majority of specialty apparel retailers we talked with on
Monday are waiting until Friday before they pull the trigger on
choosing to switch to air shipping versus ocean shipping for future
key receipts," he said in a note to clients Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Klinefelter also said retail giant Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported
that "the majority of [its] Christmas merchandise has been received,"
so the goods currently blocked at the ports are mainly for restocking
store shelves after the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill Clothing, which gets 80% of its products through the ports
of Los Angeles and Long Beach, decided Monday to make the switch from
sea to air, said Toby Bost, executive vice president of operations.</TE>
<TE>   The move could double the company's shipping costs and won't help
it get the goods that are en route or stuck at the ports, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all on the edge of our seats," Bost said. "It's not a very
good outlook for anybody in the clothing industry, given the time of
year especially."</TE>
<TE>   Most in the industry seem to expect that the problems at the ports
will be resolved fairly quickly. Meanwhile, the owner of the Hermosa
Beach-based Becker Surf &amp; Sport chain figures he can juggle products
for a while.</TE>
<TE>   "I can substitute one guy's sweatshirt for another guy's
sweatshirt, or one pant for another pant," said Dave Hollander, who
operates five stores in Southern California. "There's plenty of
T-shirts to go around."</TE>
<TE>   Sole Technology also says it has enough products stocked in its
warehouses to pacify retailers for now, and O'Neill Clothing expects
air shipments to begin arriving quickly.</TE>
<TE>   But having endured the effect that last year's terrorist attacks
and a wobbly economy have had on their businesses, local apparel
manufacturers and retailers clearly are frustrated by this latest
setback.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill Clothing, which is the apparel licensee for Santa
Cruz-based wetsuit maker O'Neill Inc., expected record sales this
year, Bost said.</TE>
<TE>   As of last week, revenue was up 30% compared with 2001, boosted by
strong products and more money spent on advertising and marketing.</TE>
<TE>   "This definitely has the potential to take some of the momentum
out of a banner year," he said. "How many more [bad] cards can be
dealt to an already poor economy?"</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James F. Peltz contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Government Proposes Rollover Standards</HD>
<DH>Autos: A driving test, long sought by safety advocates,
would be part of criteria for ratings starting with 2003 cars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN O'DELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The federal government on Tuesday proposed long-awaited road test
standards for vehicle rollovers in response to a congressional
mandate to begin rating 2003 model cars and light trucks using an
actual driving test.</LD>
<LD>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's proposal is
designed to give consumers a more realistic look at the stability of
various vehicles than the present static rating system provides.</LD>
<LD>   NHTSA estimates that almost 275,000 passenger vehicle rollovers
occur each year, almost all of them single-vehicle accidents. The
agency says that 31,000 serious injuries occur in rollovers each year
and almost 10,000 fatalities were reported in rollovers logged in
2000.</LD>
<TE>   Safety advocates have been calling for dynamic stability testing
for decades. Such tests became a government requirement after the
2000 Firestone tire recall that involved hundreds of rollover
incidents with Ford Explorer SUVs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better late than never," said Clarence Ditlow, head of the
Washington-based Center for Auto Safety.</TE>
<TE>   "The first proposal for this kind of test came before NHTSA 30
years ago, but the auto industry has always opposed it and government
has always caved in. It took the Explorer-Firestone debacle to get us
where we are today."</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA's rollover test proposal calls for using two types of
mechanically controlled driving maneuvers to augment the present
static five-star rating system. That system has been used for the
last two years and is based on a formula that predicts a vehicle's
propensity to roll in a single-vehicle accident based on height and
width measurements. By using mechanical controls rather than human
drivers, NHTSA says, the tests will be more consistent.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA offers two alternatives for rating vehicles. One would
combine scores from the static and dynamic tests into a single
rating. The other would add to the present static rating system--five
stars for the most stable vehicles, one star for the least
stable--with a separate rating for vehicle maneuverability.</TE>
<TE>   Automakers have opposed the static measurement, claiming that it
does not take into account suspension and chassis tuning, electronic
stability control, tire quality and other factors that can affect
stability.</TE>
<TE>   The maneuvers proposed by NHTSA, supported by some automakers and
opposed by others, are a "fishhook" turn at speeds of up to 50 miles
per hour and a "J" turn at speeds of up to 60 mph. The J turn
involves one sharp change of direction. The fishhook requires two
directional changes in quick succession and is a more demanding test
of stability at speed.</TE>
<TE>   Although most new models would be tested, NHTSA would not test
every vehicle every year, just as it doesn't do annual crash testing
on every make and model.</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry is expected to be divided on the proposal. The
Washington-based Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which
represents most major carmakers in the U.S., was unable to make a
recommendation to NHTSA because of disagreements among its members,
said Scott Schmidt, the trade group's safety regulation manager.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co., for instance, both had
proposed a fishhook-type maneuver to the agency in early discussion
of the test procedures. Nissan Motor Co. opposed the test.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. each proposed placing
vehicles in a centrifuge to accurately measure the forces needed to
make them lose their footing--a test that NHTSA sources said would be
explored as an alternative to the present static test's mathematical
formula.</TE>
<TE>   The dynamic test plan, required under the Transportation Recall
Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation, or TREAD, Act of 2000,
is open for public and industry comment for 45 days, after which the
agency will prepare a final version.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a bill that would have set a $10 recycling
fee, the first in the nation, on each of millions of new televisions
and computers sold in California. The fee, which would have begun in
2004, was expected to generate up to $240 million a year for grants
to municipalities, materials handlers, nonprofit groups and
electronics manufacturers to encourage recycling.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of computers and televisions are piling up in offices and
homes because the state banned them from landfills last year. Davis
expressed concern "that this program is not the most efficient or
most cost-effective approach for California."</LD>

<LD>Global sales of semiconductors rose 2.2% in August from July and rose
14% from August a year ago, figures that show the beleaguered
industry is tracking a broadly based upturn, a trade group said.</LD>
<LD>   The 14% increase in August, to $11.9 billion, from the same month
a year ago was the first double-digit increase from the industry's
cyclical low in 2001, the worst-ever year for the chip industry, the

<LD>   In a move to shore up the morale of its remaining workers,
WorldCom Inc. won court permission to hand $36 million in severance
payments to laid-off employees.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan also allows
WorldCom to retract $1.4 million in severance payments promised to 19
laid-off company executives before the company filed for bankruptcy
protection in July, as a multibillion-dollar accounting scandal
unwound. In lieu of the lucrative settlements, the 19 will receive
the same package as the rank-and-file workers: up to 26 weeks of
salary and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The decision allows each of some 4,250 laid-off workers to receive
an average of $9,000 to supplement the $4,650 WorldCom already paid.</TE>

<LD>   Enron Corp. and its creditors sought a federal judge's permission
to sue 10 former officers of the energy company, including Chairman
Kenneth L. Lay, Chief Executive Jeffrey K. Skilling and Chief
Financial Officer Andrew S. Fastow.</LD>
<TE>   The move comes as people familiar with the case say Fastow plans
to surrender to federal authorities in Houston as soon as today.</TE>
<TE>   The company and creditors said their request should be heard on an
emergency basis because Fastow and others "may try upon learning of
the filing of this lawsuit to dissipate assets" that should be used
to repay Enron creditors, owed at least $50 billion.</TE>

J. Gonzalez to file lawsuits in a Texas court alleging fraud, civil
conspiracy, gross negligence and other violations of legal
obligations.</TE>

<LD>The publisher of Rosie magazine is filing a $100-million lawsuit
against former talk show host Rosie O'Donnell for abruptly pulling
out of their business partnership last month.</LD>
<LD>   Gruner &amp; Jahr Printing &amp; Publishing Co. said in court papers that
O'Donnell's decision to quit Rosie magazine has or will cost it "in
excess of $100 million in damages." The filing claims that O'Donnell,
who announced Sept. 18 she was quitting the magazine, breached her
contract and publicly disparaged the magazine.</LD>
<LD>   O'Donnell plans to countersue, a spokeswoman said.</LD>

<LD>   M&amp;F Worldwide Inc. won a judge's approval to settle a lawsuit
challenging the fairness of the company's $128-million purchase of
billionaire Ronald Perelman's stake in movie camera maker Panavision
Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Licorice processor M&amp;F and controlling director Perelman were sued
in Delaware Chancery Court in 2000 by shareholders who said the
financier was selling his 83% stake in Panavision to get rid of an
under-performing investment.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-part trial, interrupted by a settlement offer rejected
by a judge, Perelman agreed in July to take back his Panavision
shares and return the cash and stock.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of M&amp;F fell 11 cents to $4.64 on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Lockout Has Silver Lining: Lighter Freeway Traffic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sure, the labor strife that has closed the ports of Los Angeles and
Long Beach is taking an economic toll on workers, shippers and
others. But there are some people who wouldn't complain if the
lockout continued for a few more days.</LD>
<LD>   They are the motorists who are finding that without all those
hulking big rigs hauling goods in and out of the ports their drive
has been, well, smooth sailing.</LD>
<LD>   "Beautiful" was the description California Highway Patrol Sgt.
Thom Filkins gave for his drive Tuesday morning to a court hearing in
Long Beach. "Where you normally have stop-and-go traffic, it was
free-flowing."</LD>
<TE>   It should be no surprise either. The ports of Los Angeles and Long
Beach--the busiest in the nation--generate about 34,000 daily truck
trips, most of which hit the freeways between 8 a.m. and 7 p.m. The
Long Beach, Harbor and San Gabriel River freeways are all major truck
routes serving the harbor. On the Harbor Freeway, 18-wheel big rigs
account for nearly 20% of the traffic, according to state officials.</TE>
<TE>   So, when all of those trucks are suddenly idled, traffic is bound
to improve.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Hampton, a media relations manager who lives in West Los
Angeles and commutes to Long Beach, said he noticed a dramatic
improvement in his commute this week.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last two days, I don't think I've seen a container truck
on my way to work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hampton said his commute usually is 50 minutes long.</TE>
<TE>   "Today my drive was under 40 minutes," he said. "That is very
unusual."</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for the state Department of Transportation said the
agency could not immediately gauge the effect of the lockout on
freeway speeds in the region.</TE>
<TE>   But other transportation experts said a drive along any southern
Los Angeles County freeway will show that the lockout has markedly
improved life for motorists in the gridlock-plagued region.</TE>
<TE>   David Roseman, a Long Beach traffic engineer, said he saw a
significant change in the traffic when he drove into downtown Los
Angeles this week.</TE>
<TE>   "On the 101 and the 405 [freeways] I only saw one tanker truck,"
he said. "Usually, it's wall to wall trucks."</TE>
<TE>   But the extra elbow room on the freeways is not likely to last.
Once the port lockout ends, truck traffic in Southern California is
expected to gradually increase because of expanded trade with Pacific
Rim countries.</TE>
<TE>   According to one estimate, truck trips from the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach are expected to reach nearly 92,000 per day by
2020.</TE>
<TE>   The impending truck traffic boom has spurred the Southern
California Assn. of Governments to propose four exclusive truck lanes
(two in each direction) on a 37-mile stretch of the Pomona Freeway
from downtown Los Angeles to Ontario. The Pomona Freeway, a heavily
used truck route, carries more than 46,000 trucks per day.</TE>
<TE>   In May, a coalition of government agencies also offered several
options for improving the Long Beach Freeway, including adding
elevated truck lanes and truck bypass lanes that allow truckers to
avoid congestion at key interchanges.</TE>
<TE>   If such improvements are adopted, Roseman said, the current
truck-free roadway scene could be a glimpse into the future.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be a prediction," he said.</TE>

<HD>Woes Spreading Beyond Ports</HD>
<DH>Economy: The labor dispute is putting a strain on
independent truckers who move port-related cargo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Truck driver Jose Luis Martinez doesn't care whether labor or
management is to blame in the dispute that has shut down the ports of
Long Beach and Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, near an idled berth on a main drag at the Port of L.A.
called Terminal Way, he cared only that the wallet he would bring
home to his wife and two daughters would be empty for the third time
in four days.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez is an independent, short-haul trucker who moves just
about any port-related cargo, save for produce or other perishable
goods, with his blue-green Kenworth T600 big rig.</LD>
<TE>   As such, he's a victim of the dispute between the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union and the Pacific Maritime Assn.</TE>
<TE>   To make ends meet, he and his family depend on the flow of goods
to and from the nation's busiest port complex.</TE>
<TE>   But the PMA's lockout at ports all along the West Coast continued
Tuesday, the result, the industry group said, of orchestrated worker
slowdowns that made shuttering operations more cost-effective than
keeping them open. For its part, the ILWU contends that the PMA is
trying to break the union and eliminate jobs.</TE>
<TE>   There are 10,500 to 12,000 truckers--the majority of them
independent--who normally make as many as three visits a day to the
ports, according to the California Trucking Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The labor dispute, which has disrupted the ports for at least part
of the last five days, is putting great strain on drivers such as
Martinez, who are paid at rates that have dropped considerably since
the trucking industry was deregulated in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an economic disaster" for them, said Stephanie Williams,
vice president of legislative and regulatory affairs for the trucking
association.</TE>
<TE>   If the lockout continues much longer, Williams predicted, "there
will be bankruptcies by small trucking companies that won't be able
to stay in business for a week under circumstances like this."</TE>
<TE>   The last five days have been frustrating for 37-year-old Martinez,
a native of Jalisco, Mexico, who lives in Bellflower with his wife,
Esther, and daughters Mayrane, 12, and Dayanara, 3.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday evening, Martinez arrived at the port just minutes
before the PMA locked the gates. The lockout continued on Saturday,
normally a lucrative working day.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, having heard that the lockout was over, Martinez
arrived at the ports for work at 6 a.m., only to be turned away
without a load four hours later as a second lockout began.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday is my day to be with my family," Martinez said. "We
usually go out to dinner."</TE>
<TE>   But last weekend, with no cash in his pocket, they didn't go
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Martinez was lucky to land a shipment of beer that had
been moved off the port's property before the second lockout. He
hauled it to Orange.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, however, there was no work to be found.</TE>
<TE>   "I need to work to keep my family fed," said Martinez, whose wife
does not have a job.</TE>
<TE>   He drove around the ports late Tuesday morning hoping to stumble
onto some business.</TE>
<TE>   Most other truckers had given up on locating any work, leaving
normally clogged roadways around the ports wide open.</TE>
<TE>   By late in the day, Martinez too had decided to pack it in. "I'm
going to stay home," he said, "until the harbor is ready."</TE>
<TE>   In a good year, Martinez said, he grosses about $50,000. That's
less than two-thirds of what the average dockworker manning the
picket lines earns in union wages in a year, according to the PMA.</TE>
<TE>   From his pay, Martinez must take out excise taxes, fuel and tire
and maintenance costs. He said that reduces his income to $22,000 to
$25,000 in a good year.</TE>
<TE>   This is not shaping up to be a good year.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no savings," Martinez said. "It's a lot of stress."</TE>

<HD>Webcasters Closer to Royalties Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Under pressure from an influential lawmaker, record labels and
Internet broadcasters moved closer Tuesday to a compromise on
royalties that could help small online radio stations stay in
business.</LD>
<LD>   The record labels' proposals, however, struck some Webcasters as
presenting a painful choice: They could stay small and qualify for
reduced royalties, or grow and be hit with fees that only the largest
companies could afford to pay.</LD>
<LD>   House Judiciary Committee Chairman F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.
(R-Wis.) gave negotiators until Friday to strike a deal. Otherwise,
he will try to push a bill through the House that would suspend
royalties for six months. The bill's prospects are uncertain because
of stiff opposition from performing artists' unions, the AFL-CIO and
some top Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   Many small Webcasters say they will go out of business if they
don't get relief from the royalties approved by the librarian of
Congress, which amount to $92 per listener per year for all-music
stations. The day of reckoning is Oct. 20, when about three years'
worth of royalties are due to be paid to record labels and performing
artists.</TE>
<TE>   One proposed deal would let small Webcasters pay labels and
artists a sliding percentage of their operating expenses or gross Web
site revenue, whichever is greater. The record labels and large
Webcasters, meanwhile, are discussing a reduced per-song rate over a
longer term to avoid the expense of the current rate-setting process
of biennial arbitrations.</TE>
<TE>   The large Webcasters also are eager to prevent the terms of the
small Webcasters' deal, which they view as a sign of desperation,
from setting a precedent that could be applied to them.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America and artists'
representatives, on the other hand, are determined not to subsidize
the growth of Webcasting--particularly not when the beneficiary is as
big as Yahoo Inc., AOL Time Warner Inc. or RealNetworks Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Artists' representatives say that even though they appreciate the
exposure Webcasters give them at a time of shrinking playlists on
over-the-air stations, they are resisting cuts in royalties because
these are direct payments that can't be confiscated by the labels.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup Taps Masin as COO</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc. named Verizon Communications Inc. President Michael T.
Masin as chief operating officer on Tuesday, reaching outside as the
financial giant tries to move beyond scandals that have slammed its
stock.</LD>
<LD>   Also, Citigroup Chairman Sanford I. Weill said he will leave the
boards of AT&amp;T Corp. and United Technologies Corp., two firms whose
CEOs serve as directors on Citigroup's board.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a broad investigation of Citigroup's practices, New
York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer is probing whether Jack Grubman, former
star telecom analyst at Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit,
improved his recommendation on AT&amp;T stock after Weill asked him to
reexamine his research in 1999.</LD>
<TE>   At the time, Salomon was having trouble getting an assignment in
underwriting AT&amp;T Wireless' mammoth initial stock offering. Citigroup
later managed to get a piece of the deal and received about $45
million in fees.</TE>
<TE>   Weill's decision to quit the AT&amp;T and United Technologies boards
is aimed at lowering the potential for conflicts of interest between
the bank and clients, analysts said. "Weill is trying to put
Citigroup's conflicts behind it and this is another step toward doing
that," said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's
Center for Corporate Governance.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment of Masin, 57, also is an effort to address
governance issues, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Masin will serve as chairman of a new business-practices committee
at Citigroup that will lead companywide efforts to impose limits on
practices that led to the investigations by Spitzer and other
regulators, the bank said. The committee includes all of Citigroup's
division heads and reports to Weill.</TE>
<TE>   Masin "is there to give a fresh, noninvestment-banking approach to
a more above-board way to do business," said Stephen Berman, who
helps manage $9 billion in assets, including Citigroup shares, at
Stein Roe Investment Counsel.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup is in settlement talks with Spitzer and federal
regulators over its business practices and the conduct of its
analysts during the bull market. On Monday Spitzer sued five telecom
executives, alleging that they directed underwriting business to
Salomon in the 1990s in return for hot new stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup shares rose $1.35 to $31 on the New York Stock Exchange
on Tuesday. The stock is down 39% year to date.</TE>

<HD>With His Donation Comes His Name</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Winnick Family Children's Zoo in Los Angeles, Maury Laham, 71,
stood at the railing of the sea lion exhibit as two sleek animals
frolicked in the rushing water below. His 8-year-old granddaughter
shrieked in delight, but he did not look happy.</LD>
<LD>   "Some of my money probably went into building this place," he
said, shaking his head.</LD>
<LD>   Laham is a stockholder in Global Crossing Ltd., the
telecommunications company founded by Los Angeles multimillionaire
Gary Winnick. The company filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28. At
its peak, Global's market value was $54.5 billion. Winnick testified
before a congressional panel Tuesday amid allegations that fraud
bolstered the fortunes of the firm.</LD>
<TE>   Before Global Crossing's stock tanked, Winnick sold more than $600
million of shares over recent years. Proceeds from those sales funded
generous donations from the Winnick Family Foundation, his personal
charity.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the Winnick name is emblazoned on the 1-year-old children's
wing of the Los Angeles Zoo. It also adorns a new section of the Los
Angeles Central Library and a cafeteria at Long Island University,
Winnick's alma mater. The Winnick Family Heritage Hall is under
construction at the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, and the
Simon Wiesenthal Center is planning a Jerusalem branch that will bear
the Winnick name.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad someone got something worthwhile out of that money,"
said Laham, who lives in South Pasadena. "The stock isn't worth 2
cents."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, shares of Global Crossing are currently valued at 2.2
cents in over-the-counter trading.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but his
activities are being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Justice Department and other federal agencies.</TE>
<TE>   None of the organizations that accepted Winnick's naming money are
thinking of giving it back. Yet. But the money puts them in an
uncomfortable position.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe in this era of Enron and WorldCom, nonprofits should have
some kind of a prenuptial agreement that says they can remove the
name if the person gets in trouble later," said Brad Goodins,
director of the Center for Corporate Citizenship at Boston College.
"It's a whole new world out there, and when you accept a donation,
you just have to hope it will not come back to bite you later."</TE>
<TE>   Don Youpa, head of the Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn., which raises
funds for the zoo, said he doesn't expect problems to arise from the
$2-million gift to renovate the children's area.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the company name that is on the sign," Youpa said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Los Angeles Public Library express no regrets
about the $1-million donation that the Winnick Family Foundation made
to create the Winnick Popular Library, which opened two weeks ago in
the main library downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "It allowed us to expand and improve an area that is of tremendous
benefit to the 13 million people who visit the library every year,"
spokesman Peter Persic said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has not heard any complaints from people who use the
area that holds bestsellers, popular movies, CDs and magazines.</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult to avoid the name at Long Island
University's C.W. Post campus, Winnick's old stomping grounds.
Already built is the Arnold S. Winnick Student Center cafe, named for
his father.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an all-you-care-to-eat facility," university spokeswoman
Rita Langdon said. "You can get pizza, Greek food, Mediterranean,
anything you want."</TE>
<TE>   Under renovation nearby is a Tudor administration building that
will be known as Gary Winnick House.</TE>
<TE>   The Winnick wing of the Skirball center is set to be completed
next year. "He paid off his pledge--$5 million," a Skirball
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for Winnick to get his name on a Wiesenthal center in Israel
have been downsized, but officials at the Los Angeles-based
organization said it had nothing to do with his troubles.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the center said Winnick would donate $40 million toward
the $120-million conference center and museum, to be called the
Winnick Institute Jerusalem. Since then, the project's scope has
expanded while Winnick's pledge has been reduced to between $10
million and $15 million. His name will appear on a single building.</TE>
<TE>   "This was all decided a long time before any of the troubles,"
said Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean of the Wiesenthal Center.</TE>
<TE>   But now that the troubles have arrived, does Hier think it would
be better--if only for public relations--to cancel the donation and
keep Winnick's name off the building?</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing has been proven. The man has not even been charged," Hier
said. "It would be unethical to make a decision like that now. It's
not the American way."</TE>

<HD>Iraq Agrees on Details for New Inspections</HD>
<DH>Weapons: Regime will allow scrutiny of all areas except
'presidential sites.' Move may blunt U.S. drive for a tough new U.N.
resolution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>Under intense international pressure, Iraq agreed Tuesday on details
for new U.N. inspections to assess whether the country is developing
weapons of mass destruction, but it continued to hold back access to
some key sites.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement stopped short of offering unfettered inspections of
"presidential sites"--eight compounds covering a total of about 12
square miles and containing more than 1,000 buildings--as demanded by
the Bush administration. Experts have said free access to these sites
is needed to determine whether Iraq has accumulated nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons as well as the missiles needed to deliver
them.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the Iraqis went further than many observers expected
at this juncture, apparently hoping to divide the U.N. Security
Council and keep Russia, France and China from acceding to U.S. and
British demands for a new resolution mandating stringent, far more
aggressive inspections backed by the threat of force.</LD>
<TE>   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Hans Blix, who met with Iraqi
representatives at the International Atomic Energy Agency
headquarters in Vienna, is scheduled to brief the Security Council on
the agreement Thursday. If given the green light, he says, he could
have inspectors on the ground in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Initial reactions at United Nations headquarters in New York
suggested that Iraq had gained at least some new support in the wake
of Tuesday's agreement. With British Prime Minister Tony Blair facing
opposition within his ruling Labor Party to the use of force against
Iraq and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell insisting that a new
resolution is needed before inspections can proceed, it was a day in
which advocates of a hard line toward Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
found themselves on the defensive.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe the inspection regime that existed previously
is adequate to the challenge we're facing today with Iraqi
intransigence," Powell told a news conference in Washington. He said
there was no "magic calendar" dictating when inspectors should
return.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe they should go back in under the old inspection
regime," Powell said. "We do not believe they should go in until they
have new instructions in the form of a new resolution."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, speaking with reporters earlier in the day, urged
the U.N. to stand up to Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The United Nations must show its backbone," he said. "And we'll
work with members of the Security Council to put a little calcium
there."</TE>
<TE>   Despite events in Vienna, political observers at the U.N. still
believe that Iraq eventually will face a more rigorous inspection
regime, along with carefully defined consequences if it fails to
comply. An Anglo-American draft resolution that began circulating
quietly at the U.N. late Tuesday calls for the use of "all necessary
means to restore international peace and security to the area" if
Iraq fails to provide a complete list of any weapons of mass
destruction within 30 days of the measure's passage and does not
allow unfettered movement of inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   With the Vienna accord, the Iraqis "are agreeing to the easy stuff
now," said Joseph Cirincione, director of the Nonproliferation
Project at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "They are playing to their audience, which includes Russia, which
has continued to say there is no need for a new, tougher resolution,"
he added. "This is an effort to confine the U.N. Security Council to
a simple reconfirmation of existing resolutions."</TE>
<TE>   The terms reached Tuesday in Vienna were essentially a restatement
of the existing U.N. resolutions governing inspections. The two sides
said they did not discuss a 1998 memorandum of understanding between
the Iraqis and the U.N. that ended surprise inspections at the
presidential sites, agreeing to leave that issue to the Security
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Amir Sadi, the leader of Iraq's delegation, discounted the
importance of inspecting the sites at all. "Quite honestly, I don't
understand why it is so critical," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From the inspectors' viewpoint, Iraq's agreement to a renewed
inspection regime--the first since inspectors left the country four
years ago--and the removal of limitations on some sites previously
designated as "sensitive" reflected some progress.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a willingness to accept inspections that has not existed
before," Blix told reporters in Vienna after the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Blix said the Iraqis gave inspectors "immediate, unconditional and
unrestricted access" to all locations except the presidential sites.
He said that is considerably more access than inspectors had when
they were forced to leave Iraq at the end of 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis also delivered four CD-ROMs with the records they are
required to keep on the acquisition of any "dual-use"
equipment--items that can have both military and civilian
applications--as well as any changes in previously inspected sites,
such as the movement of machines or construction of buildings.</TE>
<TE>   The material is so voluminous that it will take days for U.N.
teams to evaluate it, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The polite, accommodating tone that the Iraqis took in Vienna
suggested an attempt to walk softly with U.N. officials while
simultaneously repulsing U.S.-led efforts to require more rigorous
inspections. However, tough language came from Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   In Iraq, an unidentified spokesman on Iraqi television called the
intentions of the U.S. and Britain "evil." The spokesman accused the
two countries "of beating the war drums" to force Iraq to give up its
sovereign rights.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's chief concession in Vienna was its agreement to allow
inspectors full access to dozens of key installations previously
deemed "sensitive" by the Iraqis, often on an ad hoc basis.
Inspectors could visit such sites only with prior notice and in the
company of a senior Iraqi official.</TE>
<TE>   At times, inspectors would arrive at such sites and be forced to
wait at the entrance for hours--sometimes even a day--until an Iraqi
official arrived. Often, only a small number of inspectors then were
allowed to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Former biological weapons inspector Timothy McCarthy, now at the
Monterey Institute in California, recalled inspectors arriving for a
surprise visit at the General Intelligence Service's headquarters in
1997. They were stopped at the gate and forced to wait outside in the
summer heat--nearly 130 degrees--for several hours until a
sufficiently senior official appeared to escort them.</TE>
<TE>   "We were standing on the top of white U.N. vehicles that are
reflecting the heat and peering over the walls to see if there was
any movement of vehicles while we waited," McCarthy recalled. When an
official finally showed up, only two of about 50 inspectors at the
site were permitted to enter.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqis pledged Tuesday to make these sites as accessible as
others.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq also agreed to let inspectors fly into Saddam International
Airport in Baghdad rather than the military airport about 50 miles
away. Inspectors said the change not only will speed up their work
but also shows a concrete sign of Iraq's willingness to cooperate.</TE>
<TE>   At U.N. headquarters, Iraq's accommodating tone and willingness to
open the sensitive sites rekindled a push to weaken--or head off
completely--the tough new Security Council resolution sought by the
U.S. and Britain. Fundamental differences over the issue have so far
prevented any formal presentation of the draft measure to the
council, and events in Vienna appeared likely to accentuate those
differences.</TE>
<TE>   Russia, which U.S. officials had earlier indicated was becoming
more receptive to the tougher U.S. approach toward Iraq, said the
Vienna meeting's outcome precluded the need for any new Security
Council action.</TE>
<TE>   "We think the agreement with Iraq is a good opportunity to let the
inspectors return," said Sergei Treplekov, a Russian U.N. delegation
spokesman. "For the present, we don't see the need for a new
resolution."</TE>
<TE>   Moscow is worried that war with Iraq would jeopardize its
considerable economic interests in the Persian Gulf nation as well as
its political influence in the region.</TE>
<TE>   Yahya Mahmassani, the Arab League's ambassador to the U.N., also
applauded the meeting as a "good step forward."</TE>
<TE>   "It shows the Iraqis are cooperating and things are going well,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, there were reports that France was preparing an
alternative, two-stage plan for consideration. The French draft
reportedly contained much of the tough language already crafted by
Britain and the U.S., but called for passage of a second resolution
to approve the use of force if Iraq fails to meet the conditions.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, Blair spent part of his day attempting to calm growing
public unease over what is seen as a rush toward war. Addressing
delegates at his Labor Party's annual conference in the northern city
of Blackpool, he called upon "the bold side of the British character"
to stick to demands that Iraq disarm.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, and in particular dealing with a dictator, the only
chance of peace is a readiness for war," he said. "If at this moment,
having found the collective will to recognize the danger, we lose our
collective will to deal with it, then we will destroy not the
authority of America or Britain but of the United Nations itself."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Planning for Regime Change Has Quietly Begun</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has quietly begun planning the transition to
a new government in Baghdad, built around a leader emerging from
inside Iraq and a foreign military presence flexible enough to meet
challenges in the country's three distinct regions, according to
senior administration officials.</LD>
<LD>   In contrast to military plans that are already on President Bush's
desk, the transition planning is still in a very early stage. But it
reflects the growing sense of inevitability about both a conflict
with Iraq and a regime change, even though Bush has not yet made the
decision to go to war.</LD>
<LD>   It also reflects growing pressure from Congress and U.S. allies to
address problems that might come up after a conflict in the
historically unstable country.</LD>
<TE>   "Militarily, it may not be that difficult for the United States.
The problems will start afterward. It will be a lot more difficult
than in Afghanistan," said Remy Leveau, a former French diplomat in
the Middle East now at the Institute for Political Studies in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe and the Middle East, government officials have been
concerned for months about whether the United States has thought
through the long-term challenges of reshaping Iraq and the danger
that ethnic, religious and tribal tensions could pull the country
apart.</TE>
<TE>   To address those issues, the National Security Council and the
State Department were directed last month to develop a transition
plan. Although the process is embryonic, the working assumptions and
tentative conclusions underscore how different the process would be
from dealing with Afghanistan after the ouster of the ruling Taliban
there.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to prevent political fissures, the U.S. goal is to help
create a federal democracy that would allow the various regions and
tribes some degree of autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be some effort at reconciliation and some commitment
to a single state that is not broken up into three pieces, that will
have a representative, democratic model as its political basis,"
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee last week.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't deceive ourselves--in our conversations on this
subject, we recognize that we are on the cusp of a very, very
demanding and long-term commitment if we go down this road," he said.
"It will take time, and I can't tell you how many years."</TE>
<TE>   Powell also conceded that trying to "raise up a government" from
Iraqis both in the country and in exile would not quickly produce a
model democracy.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. planners now oppose either a government-in-exile or a
candidate emerging from within the opposition based outside the
country to replace President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they favor allowing events on the ground to play the
biggest role in determining the new leadership, with the U.S.-backed
opposition largely in a supporting role, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that there's a strong possibility that either an
individual or group of leaders inside Iraq could emerge with sizable
support and look like the natural leaders, the natural next wave,"
said an administration official.</TE>
<TE>   Added a State Department official: "No Hamid Karzai is going to be
anointed beforehand," a reference to the militia commander who was
selected at an international conference to lead Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The new focus is due in part to the administration's assumption
that an invasion would probably lead to the death of Hussein--either
during the confrontation or, more likely, at the hands of one of his
inner circle--the sources added.</TE>
<TE>   The first Bush administration and the Clinton administration made
similar assumptions, which failed to become reality in the 11 years
after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. But U.S. planners predict the odds
would increase sharply if the fate of those around Hussein also hung
in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   In a bid to hold the fractious country together during the
transition, the United States is exploring the possibility of using
three or more leaders from Iraq's main ethnic and religious
communities to jointly run the country until elections can be held.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials are still pressing for these leaders to come
from the established opposition, who are known to U.S. officials. But
those officials are now in the minority, administration sources say.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the State Department is bringing together more
than a dozen opposition groups, as well as individual Iraqis in
exile, to make plans for the transition.</TE>
<TE>   Since July, four groups have been meeting in the United States and
Europe to work on issues ranging from a transitional justice system
to new principles for an Iraqi federation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have great ideas, and a lot of them will be ones we endorse
and hope to see incorporated in a new Iraq, but they are nonbinding,
exploratory discussions," said the State Department official.</TE>
<TE>   European allies and other key players are skeptical about the
prospects for establishing a democracy any time soon in a region
where democracy is largely unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "The worry is that any successor to Saddam Hussein is likely to be
another military dictator," said British lawmaker Phyllis Starkey of
Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor Party.</TE>
<TE>   To help ensure stability, administration planners say the role of
foreign troops should vary by region.</TE>
<TE>   The largest foreign intervention would be in the central region
around Baghdad, the stronghold of the ruling Baath Party, U.S.
officials say. One of the key questions is how deep to cut into
government ministries, the military, public institutions and even
government-run businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the Communist Party in the Soviet Union. You had to be
a member to get a good job or a promotion, even in universities. Does
that mean you have to fire all university professors who belonged to
the Baath Party? Obviously not," said a well-placed U.S. official.
"That applies to every branch of government, including the military.
After all, there are a lot of former Communists running the new
Russia. But you do have to remove key players and symbols of the
regime."</TE>
<TE>   In mountainous northern Kurdistan, the main foreign military role
would probably be protecting the oil fields at Kirkuk and Mosul and
ensuring that they did not become targets of rival groups trying to
establish spheres of influence, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   But there would be less need for foreign forces to fill a
political or security vacuum, because the two main Kurdish parties,
both of which are part of the U.S.-backed opposition, have already
begun their own political transitions. They have their own security
forces, which have been partly protected from Hussein's army by the
"no-fly" zones patrolled by U.S. and British warplanes.</TE>
<TE>   The big question mark concerns a foreign role in the southern
desert and marshes, which are dominated by Shiite Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the region we know least about," said the well-placed
source.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. role in this region is likely to range from protecting
Iraq's other large oil fields to dealing with humanitarian problems.
Those would probably include a massive migration, both of returning
refugees and of displaced people forced out of the marshes by
Hussein's regime.</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Defeated Seven Times, a Boy Again Faces 'the Beast'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>
<AU>SONIA NAZARIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enrique wades chest-deep across a river. He is 5 feet tall,
stoop-shouldered and cannot swim. The logo on his cap boasts
hollowly, "No Fear."</LD>
<LD>   The river, the Rio Suchiate, forms the border. Behind him is
Guatemala. Ahead is Mexico, with its southernmost state of Chiapas.
"Ahora nos enfrentamos a la bestia," immigrants say when they enter
Chiapas. "Now we face the beast."</LD>
<LD>   Painfully, Enrique, 17, has learned a lot about "the beast." In
Chiapas, bandits will be out to rob him, police will try to shake him
down, and street gangs might kill him. But he will take those risks,
because he needs to find his mother.</LD>
<TE>   When he was 5 years old, she left him in Honduras and joined
hundreds of thousands of women from Central America and Mexico
seeking work in the United States. An estimated 48,000 youngsters go
north alone every year, many to search for their mothers.</TE>
<TE>   This is Enrique's eighth attempt to reach El Norte. First, always,
comes the beast. About Chiapas, Enrique has discovered several
important things.</TE>
<TE>   In Chiapas, do not take buses, which must pass through nine
permanent immigration checkpoints. A freight train faces checkpoints
as well, but Enrique can jump off as it brakes, and if he runs fast
enough, he might sneak around and meet the train on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   In Chiapas, never ride alone.</TE>
<TE>   In Chiapas, do not trust anyone in authority and beware even the
ordinary residents, who tend to dislike migrants.</TE>
<TE>   Once the Rio Suchiate is safely behind him, Enrique beds down for
the night in a cemetery near the depot in the town of Tapachula,
tucking the "No Fear" cap beneath him so it will not be stolen. He is
close enough to hear diesel engines growl and horns blare whenever a
train pulls out.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery is a way station for immigrants. At sunup on
any given day, it seems as uninhabited as a country graveyard, with
crosses and crypts painted periwinkle, neon green and purple. But
then, at the first rumble of a departing train, it erupts with life.
Dozens of migrants, children among them, emerge from the bushes, from
behind the ceiba trees and from among the tombs.</TE>
<TE>   They run on trails between the graves and dash headlong down the
slope. A sewage canal, 20 feet wide, separates them from the rails.
They jump across seven stones in the canal, from one to another, over
a nauseating stream of black. They gather on the other side, shaking
the water from their feet. Now they are only yards from the rail bed.</TE>
<TE>   On this day, March 26, 2000, Enrique is among them. He sprints
alongside rolling freight cars and focuses on his footing. The
roadbed slants down at 45 degrees on both sides. It is scattered with
rocks as big as his fist. He cannot maintain his balance and keep up,
so he aims his tattered tennis shoes at the railroad ties. Spaced
every few feet, the ties have been soaked with creosote, and they are
slippery.</TE>
<TE>   Here the locomotives accelerate. Sometimes they reach 25 mph.
Enrique knows he must heave himself up onto a car before the train
comes to a bridge just beyond the end of the cemetery. He has learned
to make his move early, before the train gathers speed.</TE>
<TE>   Most freight cars have two ladders on a side, each next to a set
of wheels. Enrique always chooses a ladder at the front. If he misses
and his feet land on the rails, he still has an instant to jerk them
away before the back wheels arrive.</TE>
<TE>   But if he runs too slowly, the ladder will yank him forward
and send him sprawling. Then the front wheels, or the back ones, could
take an arm, a leg, perhaps his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Se lo comio el tren," other immigrants will say. "The train ate
him up."</TE>
<TE>   The lowest rung of the ladder is waist-high. When the train leans
away, it is higher. If it banks a curve, the wheels kick up hot white
sparks, burning Enrique's skin.</TE>
<TE>   He has learned that if he considers all of this too long, then he
falls behind--and the train passes him by.</TE>
<TE>   This time, he trots alongside a gray hopper car. He grabs one
of its ladders, summons all of his strength and pulls himself up. One
foot finds the bottom rung. Then the other.</TE>
<TE>   He is aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique looks ahead on the train. Men and boys are hanging on to
the sides of tank cars, trying to find a spot to sit or stand. Some
of the youngsters could not land their feet on the ladders and have
pulled themselves up rung by rung on their knees, which are bruised
and bloodied.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Enrique hears screams.</TE>
<TE>   Three cars away, a boy, 12 or 13 years old, has managed to grab
the bottom rung of a ladder on a fuel tanker, but he cannot haul
himself up. Air rushing beneath the train is sucking his legs under
the car. It is tugging at him harder, drawing his feet toward the
wheels.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let go!" a man shouts. He and others crawl along the top of
the train to a nearby car. They shout again.</TE>
<TE>   The boy dangles from the ladder. He struggles to keep his grip.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully, the men crawl down and reach for him. Slowly, they lift
him up. The rungs batter his legs, but he is alive. He still has his
feet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GETTING ABOARD</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Enrique guesses there are more than 200 migrants on board, a tiny
army of them who charged out of the cemetery with nothing but their
cunning.</TE>
<TE>   Arrayed against them are Mexican immigration authorities, or la
migra, along with crooked police, street gangsters and bandits. They
wage what a priest at an immigrant shelter calls "la guerra sin
nombre," the war with no name. Chiapas, he says, "is a cemetery with
no crosses, where people die without even getting a prayer."</TE>
<TE>   All of this is nothing, however, against Enrique's longing for his
mother, who left him behind 11 years ago. Although his effort to
survive often forces her out of his mind, at times he thinks of her
with a loneliness that is overwhelming. He remembers when she would
call Honduras from the United States, the concern in her voice, how
she would not hang up before saying: "I love you. I miss you."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique considers carefully. Which freight car will he ride on?
This time he will be more cautious than before.</TE>
<TE>   Boxcars are the tallest. Their ladders do not go all the way up.
Migra agents would be less likely to climb to the top. And he could
lie flat on the roof and hide. From there, he could see the agents
approaching, and if they started to climb up, he could jump to
another car and run.</TE>
<TE>   But boxcars are dangerous. They have little on top to hold on to.</TE>
<TE>   Inside a boxcar might be better.</TE>
<TE>   But police, railroad security agents or la migra could bar the
doors, trapping him inside. If the doors closed accidentally, he
might die. Migrants say temperatures inside climb to 100 degrees, and
people kneel to ask God to stop the train. Some suffocate, and others
stand on their bodies to reach tiny air holes above the doors.</TE>
<TE>   A good place to hide could be under the cars, up between the
axles, balancing on a foot-wide iron shock absorber. But Enrique
might be too big to fit. Besides, trains kick up rocks. Worse, if his
arms grew tired, or if he fell asleep, he would drop directly under
the wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique settles for the top of a hopper. He holds on to a grate
running along the rim. From his perch 14 feet up, he can see anyone
approaching on either side of the tracks, up ahead or from another
car. Below, at each end, the hopper's wheels are exposed: shiny
metal, 3 feet in diameter, 5 inches thick, churning. He stays as far
away as he can.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't carry anything that might keep him from running
fast. At most, if it is exceptionally hot, he ties a nylon string on an
empty plastic bottle, wraps it around his arm and fills the bottle
with water when he can.</TE>
<TE>   Some immigrants climb on board with a toothbrush tucked into a
pocket. Others bring a small Bible with telephone numbers, penciled
in the margins, of their mothers or fathers or other relatives in the
United States. Maybe nail clippers, a rosary or a scapular with a
tiny drawing of San Cristobal, the patron saint of travelers, or of
San Judas Tadeo, the patron saint of desperate situations.</TE>
<TE>   As usual, the train lurches hard from side to side. Enrique holds
on with both hands. Occasionally, the train speeds up or slows down,
smashing couplers together and jarring him backward or forward. The
wheels rumble. Sometimes each car rocks the other way from the ones
ahead and behind. El Gusano de Hierro, some migrants call it. The
Iron Worm.</TE>
<TE>   In Chiapas, the tracks are 20 years old. Some of the ties sink,
especially during the rainy season, when the roadbed turns soggy and
soft. Grass grows over the rails, making them slippery.</TE>
<TE>   When the cars round a bend, they feel as if they might overturn.
Enrique's train runs only a few times a week, but it averages three
derailments a month, by the count of Jorge Reinoso, chief of
operations for Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab, the railroad. One year
before, a hopper like Enrique's overturned with a load of sand,
burying three immigrants alive. Enrique rarely lets himself admit
fear, but he is scared that his car might tip. El Tren de la Muerte,
some migrants call it. The Train of Death.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is struck by the magic of the train--its power and its
ability to take him to his mother. To him, it is El Caballo de
Hierro. The Iron Horse.</TE>
<TE>   The train picks up speed. It passes a brown river that smells of
sewage. Then a dark form emerges ahead. "Rama!" the immigrants yell.
"Branch!" They duck.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique grips the hopper. To avoid the branches, he sways from
side to side. All of the riders sway in unison, ducking the same
branches--left then right. One moment of carelessness and the
branches will hurl them into the air. Matilda de la Rosa, who lives
by the tracks, recalls a migrant who came to her door with an eyeball
hanging on his cheek. He cupped it near his face, in his right hand.
He told her, "The train ripped out my eye."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A DREADED STOP</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Each time the train slows, Enrique goes on high alert for la
migra.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants wake one another and begin climbing down to prepare to
jump. If the train speeds up again, everyone climbs back up. The
movement down and up the ladders looks like a strangely choreographed
two-step.</TE>
<TE>   But slowing down at Huixtla, with its red and yellow depot,
can mean only one thing: Coming up is La Arrocera, one of the most
dreaded immigration checkpoints in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique has defied La Arrocera before. This time, he arrives in
the heat of noon. Tension builds. Some migrants stand on top of the
train, straining to see the migra agents up ahead. As the train
brakes, they jump.</TE>
<TE>   The train lurches sideways. Enrique leaps from car to car, finally
landing on a boxcar. The train stops. He lies flat, face down, arms
spread-eagle, hoping la migra won't see him. But several agents do.</TE>
<TE>   "Bajate, puto! Get down, you whore!"</TE>
<TE>   "No! I'm not coming down!"</TE>
<TE>   There is no ladder all the way to the top. Maybe they won't come
up after him.</TE>
<TE>   "Get down!"</TE>
<TE>   "No!"</TE>
<TE>   The agents summon reinforcements. One starts to climb up.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique scrambles to his feet and races along the top of the
train, soaring across the 4-foot gaps between cars. As he runs, three
agents follow on the ground, pelting him with rocks and sticks, an
experience many immigrants say they have here. Stones clang against
the metal. Enrique flees from car to car, more than 20 in all,
struggling to keep his footing each time he leaps from a hopper to a
fuel tanker, which is lower and has a rounded top.</TE>
<TE>   He is running out of train. He will have to go around La Arrocera
alone. It may be suicidal, but he has no choice. More stones ping off
the train. Enrique scurries down a ladder and sprints into the
bushes.</TE>
<TE>   "Alto! Alto! Stop!" the agents shout.</TE>
<TE>   As Enrique runs, he hears what he thinks are gunshots behind him.</TE>
<TE>   Except in extraordinary circumstances, Mexican immigration agents
are barred from carrying firearms. According to a retired agent,
however, most have .38-caliber pistols. Some of the shelter workers
tell of migrants hit by bullets. Others tell of torture. Before long,
Enrique will meet a man whose chest is pockmarked with cigarette
burns. The man tells him that a migra agent at La Arrocera branded
him.</TE>
<TE>   In the scrub brush, though, Enrique worries less about agents than
about madrinas with machetes. The name for these men is a play on
words: These civilians help the authorities, as a madrina, or
godmother, would, and administer madrizas, or savage beatings. Human
rights activists and some police agencies say the madrinas commit
some of the worst atrocities--rapes and torture--and are allowed by
authorities to keep a portion of what they steal.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique runs on. He crawls under a barbed wire fence, then under a
double strand of smooth wire. It is electrified. At night,
Guillermina Galvez Lopez, who lives at La Arrocera, hears the trains
and, not long afterward, the piercing screams of immigrants, wet from
the swampy grass, who run into the wire.</TE>
<TE>   "Help me! Help me!" they wail.</TE>
<TE>   Ten times in 10 months, train riders have carried to her front
door men and boys without arms, legs or heads. In 1999, Clemente
Delporte Gomez, a patrolman with Grupo Beta Sur, the government's
migrant rights organization, watched a young Salvadoran slip on
railroad ties near La Arrocera. Train wheels cut him in two at the
midriff. Delporte saw the Salvadoran's heart flicker three times.
Then it was still.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique knows he has plunged deep into bandit territory. At least
three, maybe five swarms of robbers, some with Uzis, some on drugs,
patrol the three-mile dirt paths that immigrants must use to go
around La Arrocera, authorities say. They seem to operate with such
impunity that Mario Campos Gutierrez, a supervisor with Grupo Beta,
thinks the authorities collaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Before taking these paths, migrants hide their money. Some stitch
it into the seams of their pants. Others put a bit in their shoes, a
bit in their shirts and a coin or two in their mouths. Still others
bag it in plastic and tuck it into intimate places. Some roll it up
and slip it into their walking sticks. Others hollow out mangoes,
drop their pesos inside, then pretend to be eating the fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique figures he doesn't have enough money to bother.</TE>
<TE>   Last time he sneaked past La Arrocera, he was lucky because he was
careful. He stuck with a band of street gangsters. This time he is
alone. He focuses on the thought that will make him run the fastest:
"I cannot miss the train."</TE>
<TE>   If he misses the one he just left, he knows he will be a sitting
duck, waiting for days in the bushes and the tall grass until another
one comes.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique races so fast he feels the blood pounding at his temples.
The grass, growing in three-foot tentacles, lassos his feet. He
stumbles, gets up and keeps running. He passes an abandoned brick
house. Half the roof is gone.</TE>
<TE>   The house is notorious. Not long before, Grupo Beta had found a
bed of bricks inside, covered with emerald green leaves from a plant
that looked like a bird of paradise--and two soiled pairs of panties
crumpled on the dirt floor. Women are raped here, most recently a
16-year-old assaulted repeatedly over three days.</TE>
<TE>   Many are gang-raped, including a Salvadoran woman, four months
pregnant, who was assaulted at gunpoint by 13 bandits along the
railroad tracks to the south. Nearly one in six immigrant girls
detained by authorities in Texas says she has been sexually assaulted
during her journey, according to a 1997 University of Houston study.
Some girls journeying north cut off their hair, strap their breasts and
try to pass for boys.  Others scrawl on their chests: "TENGO SIDA. I have
AIDS."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique does not stop. He reaches the Cuil bridge, where the
railroad spans a 40-foot stream of murky brown water. This, migrants
and Grupo Beta officers say, is the most dangerous spot. Bandits haul
mattresses up into nearby trees, eat lunch and wait for their prey.
As immigrants cross the bridge, the bandits drop out of the limbs and
surround them. Other robbers hide along the tracks above and below
the bridge, which is thick with bushes and vines. One fishes in the
river or cuts grass with a machete, like a fieldworker, and whistles
to the others to set a trap.</TE>
<TE>   Just a month before, bandits ambushed five Salvadorans as they
crossed the bridge at 4 a.m. They tried to run. The bandits shot one
in the back. Four months later, three Salvadorans and a Mexican, all
in their 20s, were killed. The Salvadorans, their hands tied behind
them, were shot in the head. The Mexican was stabbed. All they had
left was their underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique dashes across the bridge and keeps running. Mountains
stand to his right. The ground is so wet that farmers grow rice
between their rows of corn. He can feel heat and humidity rising from
the loamy earth. It saps his energy, but he runs on.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he stops, doubled over, panting.</TE>
<TE>   He is not sure why, but he has survived La Arrocera. Maybe it was
his extra caution, maybe it was his decision to run, maybe it was his
attempt to lie flat and hide atop the boxcar, which delayed his
getting off the train and gave the bandits an opportunity to target
migrants ahead of him.</TE>
<TE>   He is desperate for water. He spots a house.</TE>
<TE>   The people inside are not likely to give him any. Chiapas is fed
up with Central American immigrants, says Hugo Angeles Cruz, a
professor and migration expert at El Colegio de la Frontera Sur in
Tapachula. They are poorer than Mexicans, and they are seen as
backward and ignorant. People think they bring disease, prostitution
and crime and take away jobs. Some cannot be trusted. People in
Chiapas talk of being robbed by migrants with guns and knives. They
tell of an older woman who welcomed an immigrant into her home and
was beaten to death with an iron pipe.</TE>
<TE>   Boys like Enrique are called "stinking undocumented." They are
cursed, taunted. Dogs are set upon them. Barefoot children throw
rocks at them. Some use slingshots. "Go to work." "Get out! Get out!"</TE>
<TE>   Drinking water can be impossible to come by. Migrants filter ditch
sewage through T-shirts. Finding food can be just as difficult.
Enrique is counting: In some places, people at seven of every 10
houses turn him away.</TE>
<TE>   "No," they say. "We haven't cooked today. We don't have any
tortillas. Try somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   "No, boy, we don't have anything here."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes it is worse. People in the houses turn the immigrants
in.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique sees another migrant who has managed to make it around La
Arrocera. He, too, needs water badly, but he doesn't dare ask. He is
afraid of walking into a trap. To immigrants, begging in Chiapas is
like walking up to a loaded gun.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go," Enrique says. "If they catch someone, it will be me."</TE>
<TE>   He approaches a house and speaks softly, his head slightly bowed.
"I'm hungry. Can you spare a taco? Some water?" The woman inside sees
injuries from the train-top beating he took during his last attempt
to go north. "What happened?" she asks. She gives him water, bread
and beans.</TE>
<TE>   The other migrant comes nearer. She gives him food too.</TE>
<TE>   A horn blows. Enrique runs to the tracks. Other immigrants
who have survived La Arrocera come out of the bushes. They sprint
alongside the train and reach for the ladders on the freight cars.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique climbs up onto a hopper. The train picks up speed.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, he relaxes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   STAYING AWAKE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Iron Worm squeaks, groans and clanks--black tankers,
rust-colored boxcars and gray hoppers winding north on a single track
that parallels the Pacific coast. Off to the right are hillsides
covered with coffee plants. Cornstalks grow up against the rails. The
train moves through a sea of plantain trees, lush and tropical.</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon, it is 105 degrees. Enrique's palms burn when
he holds on to the hopper. He risks riding no-hands. Finally, he
strips off his shirt and sits on it. The locomotive blows warm diesel
smoke. People burn trash by the rails, sending up more heat and a
searing stench. Enrique's head throbs. The sun stings in his eyes,
and his skin tingles. He moves around the car, chasing patches of
shade. For a while, he stands on a narrow ledge at the end of a fuel
tanker. It is just inches above the wheels.</TE>
<TE>   He cannot let himself fall asleep; one good shake of the train,
and he would tumble off.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, street gangsters, some deported from Los Angeles, prowl
the train tops looking for sleepers. Many of the migrants huddle
together, hoping for safety in numbers. They watch for anyone with
tattoos, especially gangsters who have skulls inked around their
ankles--one skull, police say, for every person they have killed.
Their brutality is legendary. Immigrants tell of nine gangsters who
hurled a man off their train, then forced two boys to have sex
together or be thrown off too.</TE>
<TE>   Some migrants nap on their feet, using belts or shirts to strap
themselves to posts at the ends of the hoppers. Others struggle to
stay awake. They take amphetamines, slap their own faces, do squats,
talk to one another and sing. At 4 a.m. the train sounds like a
chorus.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Enrique is terrified of another beating. Every time someone
new jumps onto his car, he tenses. Fear, he realizes, helps to keep
him awake, so he decides to induce it. He climbs to the top of the
tank car and takes a running leap. With arms spread, as if he were
flying, he jumps to one swaying boxcar, then to another. Some have
4-to-5-foot gaps. Others are 9 feet apart.</TE>
<TE>   The train passes into northern Chiapas. Mountains draw closer.
Plantain fields soften into cow pastures. Enrique's train slows to a
crawl. As the sun sets, he hears crickets begin their music and join
the immigrant chorus.</TE>
<TE>   The train nears San Ramon, close to the northern state line. It is
past midnight now, and the judicial police are probably asleep. Train
crews say this is where the police stage their biggest shakedowns.
One conductor says the officers, 15 at a time, stop the trains. They
grab fleeing migrants by their shirts. The conductor has heard them
say: "If you move, I'll kill you. I'll break you in two." Then, "Give
us what you've got, or we send you back."</TE>
<TE>   At nearby Arriaga, the chief of the judicial police, or Agencia
Federal de Investigacion, denies that his agents stop trains in San
Ramon and rob immigrants. The chief, Sixto Juarez, suggests that any
robbing is done by gangsters or bandits who impersonate judicial
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique greets the dawn without incident. He puts Chiapas behind
him. He still has far to go, but he has faced the beast eight times
now, and he has lived through it.</TE>
<TE>   It is an achievement, and he is proud of it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ACTING OAXACAN</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Around noon, he reaches Ixtepec, a southern crossroads in Oaxaca,
the next state north, 285 miles into Mexico. As his train squeals to
a stop, migrants jump down and look for houses where they can beg for
a drink and a bite to eat. La bestia might be behind them, but most
are still afraid. Two of them are too frightened to go into town.
They offer Enrique 20 pesos and ask him to buy food. If he will bring
it back, they will share it with him.</TE>
<TE>   He takes off his yellow shirt, stained and smelling of diesel
smoke. Underneath he wears a white one. He puts it on over the dirty
one. Maybe he can pass for someone who lives here. He resolves not to
panic if he sees a policeman, and to walk as if he knows where he is
going.</TE>
<TE>   He takes the pesos and walks down the main street, past a bar, a
store, a bank and a pharmacy. He stops at a barber shop. His hair is
curly and far too long. It is an easy tip-off. People here tend to
have straighter hair.</TE>
<TE>   He strides purposefully inside.</TE>
<TE>   "Orale, jefe!" he says, using a phrase Oaxacans favor. "Hey,
chief!" He mutes his flat, Central American accent and speaks softly
and singsongy, like a Oaxacan. He asks for a short crop, military
style. He pays with the last of his own money, careful not to call it
pisto, as they do back home. That means alcohol up here.</TE>
<TE>   He is mindful about what else he says. Migra agents trip people up
by asking if the Mexican flag has five stars (the Honduran flag has,
but the Mexican flag has none), or by demanding the name of the
mortar used to make salsa (molcajete, a uniquely Mexican word), or
inquiring how much someone weighs. If he replies in pounds, he is
from Central America. In Mexico, people use kilos.</TE>
<TE>   In Guatemala, soda is called agua. Here in Mexico, agua is water.
A jacket is a chamarra, not a chumpa. A T-shirt is a playera, not a
blusa.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Enrique glances into a store window and sees his
reflection. It is the first time he has looked at his face since he
was beaten. He recoils from what he sees. Scars and bruises. Black
and blue. One eyelid droops.</TE>
<TE>   It stops him.</TE>
<TE>   He was 5 years old when his mother left him. Now he is almost
another person. In the window glass, he sees a battered young man,
scrawny and disfigured.</TE>
<TE>   It angers him, and it steels his determination to push northward.</TE>

<HD>Enmity Escalates in Port Talks</HD>
<DH>Labor: The union leader walks out of a mediation session
and decries the presence of armed guards. Retailers press Bush to
intervene.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND, JOSEPH MENN and DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hopes of a quick end to the labor conflict that has closed West Coast
ports dimmed Tuesday when a union president stormed out of a meeting
with a federal mediator, angered that port employers were accompanied
by armed bodyguards.</LD>
<LD>   Wall Street analysts watched the ongoing dispute with concern and
warned that a prolonged lockout could further damage a fragile U.S.
economy. Meanwhile, container vessels loaded with shoes, bananas,
auto parts and other imports continued to stack up outside harbors
from San Diego to Seattle, which have been shut down since Sunday.
Losses have been estimated at $1 billion a day.</LD>
<LD>   Asked about the lockout Tuesday morning, President Bush said,
"We're worried about it. We're closely monitoring it." He declined to
comment on the possibility of invoking the Taft-Hartley Act, which
gives him the power to call for an 80-day cooling-off period.</LD>
<TE>   Retail groups stepped up their lobbying for federal intervention.
"We cannot overstate the gravity of the current situation," said
Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, in a
letter to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The AFL-CIO has also heightened its involvement, monitoring the
fast-changing situation with almost hourly phone calls to the
International Longshore and Warehouse Union and pressing the
administration to stay out of the talks.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said Tuesday afternoon that they would discuss
reopening talks, perhaps at another location and with limits on the
number of participants, but said they would no longer deal with
Joseph Miniace, chief negotiator for the shipping lines. The shipping
lines rejected that condition. Both sides, however, said they were
eager to negotiate a contract and get the docks moving again.</TE>
<TE>   Frustration and distrust have been running high on both sides, and
tensions boiled over at the meeting in Oakland on Tuesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Hurtgen, director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, had traveled to California hoping to persuade the union to
accept federal mediation. The union has a tradition of not allowing
outside parties into negotiations, but agreed to discuss the process
with Hurtgen.</TE>
<TE>   Union President James Spinosa and four members of the union's
negotiating team sat in one fifth-floor conference room while Miniace
and the Pacific Maritime Assn. negotiating team of about 15 sat in
another. Hurtgen shuttled between them.</TE>
<TE>   In the hall stood two armed off-duty police officers who arrived
with Miniace, who said they have been his bodyguards since he
received death threats 10 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Less than an hour into the talks, Spinosa learned that the guards
were armed and quickly left the building along with his entire team.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to tolerate this," Spinosa shouted to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtgen pursued them to the building entrance asking that they
reconsider, but the union team pulled away in a minivan.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt it was life-threatening," Spinosa said later at a news
conference at the union's San Francisco headquarters. "It's
outrageous to this membership....We feel this set of negotiations has
taken a turn for the worse."</TE>
<TE>   The shipping lines defended the use of bodyguards, citing the
death threats.</TE>
<TE>   National union leaders condemned the employers group. Bringing
armed guards was "unprecedented and outrageous, calculated to
intimidate if not scuttle the agreement," the AFL-CIO's Ron Blackwell
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hurtgen later issued a statement saying the presence of security
guards was "inappropriate and a breach of bargaining protocol."</TE>
<TE>   "While today's development was unfortunate, I am pleased that the
parties agreed to meet, and that they came together this morning. I
remain hopeful that these negotiations can move forward, and I
continue to offer my assistance," Hurtgen said.</TE>
<TE>   On the substance of the talks, Spinosa said he was keeping the
core issue of technology off the table until the association revamped
its proposal. Instead, Tuesday's discussion covered union proposals
for its members' pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, "we are very, very far apart," Spinosa said. He also
rejected the shipping lines' request that the union sign an extension
of its former contract--a condition of reopening the ports. The union
agreed to daily extensions from July 1, when the three-year pact was
due to expire, until Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn. locked out workers Sunday night after a
series of alleged union slowdowns that the employers said cut
production by more than half. Terminal operators said it was less
expensive to shut the ports than to operate them under a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   At the sprawling ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, dockworkers
maintained picket lines at terminal gates, holding aloft signs
calling for unity and a fair contract.</TE>
<TE>   Like everywhere else in the harbor, the long arms of Seaside
Transportation's cranes were idle and cocked skyward. The roadway
outside, normally jammed with trucks waiting to pick up cargo, was
empty except for an occasional passing car. "We're being locked out,
but we'd love to work," said one dockworker, who declined to give his
name.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis follows more than four months of contract negotiations
between the longshore union and the Maritime Assn., which represents
shipping lines and terminal operators. The parties are at loggerheads
over the control of information technology at the ports.</TE>
<TE>   The association wants to accelerate the use of computers,
scanners, remote cameras and other tools that will eliminate hundreds
of high-paid union clerk jobs. The union has said it would agree only
if the association expanded union jurisdiction to jobs that are now
considered management or covered by other unions. Both sides say the
outcome of these talks could critically affect their long-term
survival.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating the economic fallout from the West Coast port shutdown
is nearly impossible because the effects are so broad and
unpredictable, hitting different parts of the economy with varying
speed and velocity. But many economists agree that the damage already
totals in the billions of dollars and will escalate quickly if the
shutdown extends beyond a week.</TE>
<TE>   Even after the port dispute is resolved, there will still be
lengthy delays on the waterfront as the backed-up cargo works its way
through a transportation system that has been thrown into disarray.</TE>
<TE>   An economic report issued by Goldman Sachs on Tuesday warned that
"a sluggish U.S. economy could sustain another hard body blow if a
shut-off in exports and imports at West Coast ports over the past few
days were to continue much longer."</TE>
<TE>   "The shutdown comes at a particularly disruptive time, as
retailers stock their shelves for the holiday," the report said. "For
that reason, the Bush administration is apt to be aggressive in
attempting to end the shutdown as soon as possible, although
officials will be sensitive to possible political fallout if they
appear to be taking sides in the labor dispute."</TE>
<TE>   A study by Martin Associates, a consulting firm, estimates that a
five-day port closure will cost the U.S. economy at least $934
million a day. Meanwhile, scores of unloaded cargo ships on the West
Coast remained at anchor or tied to their docks. The line is expected
to grow as more ships arrive in the days ahead. Locally, 70 unloaded
vessels remained at anchor or in their berths at the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, the third-largest harbor complex in the
world. And 31 more ships are scheduled to arrive in the next two
days.</TE>
<TE>   If the lockout ends and union members go back to work, the waiting
ships will be taken into port by harbor pilots and docked in the
order of their arrival. The effort probably will proceed around the
clock until the cargo is unloaded.</TE>
<TE>   Although the terminal gates have been relatively calm in Southern
California, non-longshore port workers elsewhere reported increasing
tension and violence. Dozens of equipment repair and maintenance
workers, who belong to the International Assn. of Machinists, were
called off the job at terminals in Oakland by their union leaders
after a mechanic was allegedly punched in the jaw by a longshore
picket.</TE>

<HD>Brides Pay Princely Sum to Be Cinderellas</HD>
<DH>More people of modest means are opting for opulent
weddings. Some want carriage rides and fireworks. Packages start at
$40,000 at Disneyland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The marriage of Renee Rodriquez to Michael Matthews was a first-class
affair, from the engraved formal invitations to the designer gown and
the platinum china.</LD>
<LD>   "It was extremely regal," said Carmen Blandino, the Glendora
wedding planner who helped orchestrate the ceremony at the stately
St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church in Dallas. "It was royal
American."</LD>
<LD>   Royalty, however, didn't pick up the $42,000 tab that included
extras such as limousine and shuttle bus service, a makeup artist for
the bride and a towering wedding cake designed to look like a pile of
presents.</LD>
<TE>   That task fell to the bride's parents, two Dallas school district
workers who dipped into their retirement kitty to help pay the bills.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't regret anything," said mother of the bride Yolanda
Rodriguez, whose family still was buzzing about the gala months
later. "It was perfect."</TE>
<TE>   Opulent weddings are nothing new for the well-to-do. But in recent
years, more people of modest means have been springing for ever more
lavish ceremonies. Nationwide, the average wedding cost has risen to
$22,360, according to Conde Nast Bridal Group, a division of Conde
Nast Publications Inc. That's a 47% increase since 1990. The trend
has helped fuel an array of businesses offering such diverse services
as bridal carriage rides and fireworks displays.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Ivey, who runs an Irvine company that provides disc jockeys
and lighting, chalks up the cost increase to brides trying to
outdo--or at least keep pace with--one another.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to get caught up with what their girlfriends have done
in the past," Ivey said. So they take steps such as ramping up room
decor with fancier chairs, elaborate centerpieces and ambient
lighting.</TE>
<TE>   "You never saw lighting at weddings 10 years ago," Ivey said. "You
never saw crushed velvet linen.... Now it's almost become the
standard that you're going to have some kind of fancy linens. The
same with flatware. People are renting trees to bring into a
ballroom. I never saw that 10 years ago, and it's become commonplace
now."</TE>
<TE>   Two trends of the last decade helped boost wedding extravaganzas.
One, the booming economy, made extras such as limousines and designer
gowns--once out of reach for the masses--more affordable. And
secondly, the median age for getting married has risen, meaning
couples increasingly have the means to kick in their own money if
parents can't foot the bill for expensive options.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1982, the average age of a bride has climbed to 27 from 20,
according to Conde Nast Bridal Group. And the length of engagement
has doubled to 16 months, which means more time to spend more money
and plan more elaborate weddings.</TE>
<TE>   Whether the wedding industry will remain flush is an open
question, given the uncertainties in the economy and the stock
market.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, there's a lot of daddies out there going, 'Oh man, I
didn't expect this when I signed those contracts,' " said Eileen
Moneghan, president of the Assn. of Bridal Consultants in New
Milford, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, weddings are a lagging economic indicator.
And many weddings this season, planned months or even years in
advance, still reflect the free-spending spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Brides are shimmying into gowns that cost as much as the entire
wedding once did. A Vera Wang designer gown, for example, can cost up
to $12,000. Many couples hire both a photographer and a videographer
to record the big event.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment may include chamber music, strolling violinists and
a full orchestra. An entire restaurant may be rented out for the
rehearsal dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Location is critical. Hotels are still common, but couples also
are booking museums, sprawling estates and even lighthouses.
Increasingly, couples stage "destination weddings": ceremonies in
far-flung locations where nuptials give way to vacations.</TE>
<TE>   Blandino, the consultant who planned the Rodriquez-Matthews
wedding last year, said she recently orchestrated a medieval-style
wedding at Benedict Castle in Riverside, a structure fashioned after
a castle in Spain. The groomsmen dressed like musketeers and wore
swords.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland began offering after-hours ceremonies in the theme park
in May 2001. The bride and her father can be ferried through the park
in "Cinderella's Crystal Coach," led by a white horse and a footman.
And after vows are exchanged, they can celebrate at a reception in
Fantasyland in front of King Arthur Carrousel.</TE>
<TE>   Prices start at about $40,000 for packages that include the
ceremony and reception. Disneyland also will provide extras, such as
rides, fireworks and a visit from Mickey, for an additional fee.</TE>
<TE>   The park hosted its first after-hours wedding last year, and the
second was held Sept. 15, when Rebecca Dent and her fiance, Brian
Devers, tied the knot in front of Sleeping Beauty Castle. Dent, a
25-year-old grade-school teacher from San Diego, had accepted Devers'
wedding proposal in front of the castle too.</TE>
<TE>   "It is my dream to do this, and we are both so excited," she said
before the wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Fischoff, a Cal State Los Angeles professor who teaches on
popular culture, sees all the fanfare over weddings as a waste of
money--another sign that Americans are "profoundly enslaved" to
whatever's in vogue.</TE>
<TE>   The peer pressure can be palpable. Socially, weddings have become
a couple's first opportunity to define themselves as a host and a
hostess, said Colin Cowie, an event planner whose haute couture
weddings can cost $1 million or more.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is this your wedding," he said. "It's the first time you
make a statement of style."</TE>
<TE>   Melanie Dayani, 27, and Adam Smith, 28, made a splashy style
statement in August when they tied the knot at the Ritz-Carlton
Laguna Niguel in Dana Point before 210 friends and family members.
The three flower girls had fresh flowers sewn into their hemlines.
The silk tablecloths in the reception room matched the bridesmaids'
dresses and were covered with organza overlays trimmed in satin and
topped with 3-foot-tall silver vases overflowing with white lilies,
hydrangeas and orchids. The entertainment included a 20-piece
orchestra. Two dozen portable trees were hauled in as part of the
decorations.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great excuse to have a great party," Dayani said before
the wedding, "and have everyone you love around you."</TE>
<TE>   Elaborate weddings have been a boon to wedding consultants, whose
services are needed for complex affairs. Some consultants who made
$20,000 annually a decade ago are making up to $100,000, said Ann
Nola, director of the Assn. of Certified Professional Wedding
Consultants in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Consultant Blandino, owner of bridal gown and special events
company Princess &amp; Lords in Glendora, said business is up about 35%
compared with last year.</TE>
<TE>   And consultants aren't the only ones reaping benefits.</TE>
<TE>   G&amp;F Carriages in Riverside said its business has tripled over the
last five years, mostly because of wedding work. The company does
about 10 weddings a month and is building a "Cinderella" coach shaped
like a pumpkin.</TE>
<TE>   Audrey Torres and Arturo Aceves hired G&amp;F in July to take them
around the city of Orange after their wedding and then drop them off
at the reception.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I was a little girl, I've always wanted that little
fairy tale," the bride said. "Prince Charming taking off with ...
Cinderella."</TE>
<TE>   Many modern weddings require so much upfront investment that some
companies now insure them. WedSafe Inc. of Beverly Hills will
guarantee weddings against all kinds of mishaps, including broken
gifts, damaged gowns and members of the ceremony falling ill.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had several instances of people knocking over a table full
of crystal," Chief Executive Roger Sandau said. "We've had occasions
where the father of the bride suffered a heart attack the day of the
wedding and the entire wedding is postponed. You've got a
grief-stricken bride."</TE>
<TE>   A change of heart, however, is not covered.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody buys wedding insurance because they think the other person
will change their mind," Sandau said. "If that's the worry, you
probably have larger problems."</TE>
<TE>   All the extras add up. Some people even take out second mortgages
on their home--something consultant Lindsey Smeets said she advises
against.</TE>
<TE>   "What if the wedding lasts five years, and the parents are paying
on the wedding 15 years?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   To avoid the sinkhole of premarital debt, wedding coordinators say
couples must establish a budget and define their priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "Some girls will say, 'I have to have a dream gown, and my dream
gown is a St. Pucci,' " Blandino said. "OK, your gown is going to
cost you $5,000 and the budget is $10,000. Now we know we're going to
have a picnic in the park."</TE>
<TE>   Yolanda Rodriguez said she has no regrets about the $42,000 she
spent on her daughter's wedding, even though the costs soared past
the original budget of $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We borrowed as much as we could against our annuities," said
Rodriguez, a Dallas resident and school district administrator.
Although she expects that it will take five years to replenish the
fund, Rodriguez says she has memories that she and other family
members will always cherish. Months after the event, she said, people
"were still talking about how beautiful it was, how elegant, how
everything just fit into place."</TE>
<TE>   For many Latinos, a wedding is considered the birth of a new
family and therefore a reason for huge celebration. When it comes to
their children, Latinos often outspend other ethnic groups, even when
their income is lower, said Derene Allen, vice president with
Santiago Solutions Group, a San Francisco firm that develops
multicultural business strategies.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the wedding must be a grand affair, Latino couples often
get help from padrinos, extended family or prominent members of the
community who pitch in to help shoulder the cost, said Blandino, who
specializes in Latino weddings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the whole purpose of the padrinos system," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the trend for grander weddings, however, sometimes even
the wealthy draw the line.</TE>
<TE>   Although Dayani's mother, who paid for her wedding, splurged on
lobsters and oysters on the half shell, the bride rejected the
hotel's suggestion for an offshore fireworks display to top off the
night, saving $25,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure they could have made it even more grand," she said. "But
some of it was just over the top."</TE>

<LD>Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher and philanthropist who founded TV
Guide in 1953 when only 9% of U.S. households had television sets and
built the weekly magazine into a household staple that made him one
of the wealthiest men in America, died Tuesday. He was 94.</LD>
<LD>   Annenberg, who amassed an impressive collection of art and shared
his millions with educational, medical and art institutions, died at
his home in Wynnewood, a suburb of Philadelphia, of complications
from pneumonia. He also maintained a 205-acre estate in Rancho
Mirage, Calif.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, Leonore, known as Lee, was with him when he died, said
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, who announced his
death.</LD>
<TE>   The founder of Seventeen magazine as well as TV Guide, Annenberg
also had published the Philadelphia Inquirer. He founded the
Annenberg School for Communication at Penn in 1958 and the Annenberg
School for Communication at USC in 1971 and donated nearly $300
million to each. The largest single donor in USC history, he also
created the Annenberg Center for Communication at USC in 1993 to mesh
and promote communication technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Geoffrey Cowan, dean of USC's Annenberg School, said the
philanthropist's "vision of communication as a tool for public good
shall continue to inspire and motivate students and faculty ... for
generations to come."</TE>
<TE>   USC President Steven B. Sample called Annenberg "a pioneer, a
visionary, an exemplary philanthropist and, above all, an
extraordinary human being" and praised his "devotion to the ideals of
promoting greater human understanding through education and
communication...."</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg, former ambassador to Britain and courtier to presidents
from Dwight D. Eisenhower on, was praised by former First Lady Nancy
Reagan on Tuesday as "an individual who had a generous heart and a
lifelong compassion for the young people of our nation. He gave of
himself as a statesman, a philanthropist, a patriot."</TE>
<TE>   "Walter Annenberg's legacy is not the fortune he amassed," she
said in a prepared statement, "but the unprecedented gifts he
bestowed on the youth of our country. Walter Annenberg accomplished
what no government program ever could. His life was spent with
meaning and purpose--through his singular efforts in the arts,
education and in charitable circles from coast to coast."</TE>
<TE>   President Bush issued a statement Tuesday calling Annenberg "a
shining example of generosity, patriotism and dedication to serving
others."</TE>
<TE>   "As a business leader and an innovator, he understood the media's
impact on American culture and encouraged television to be a positive
influence on society," Bush said. "Mr. Annenberg firmly believed that
strong education was the key to a quality citizenry, and his
commitment to education reform has benefited innumerable lives
through research, support for scholarships and greater accessibility
to educational programming through public television."</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg held many titles and won many awards during his long
life--including the Medal of Freedom, presented to him by President
Reagan in 1986--but the most important to him was that of U.S.
ambassador to the Court of St. James, where he served from 1969 to
1974. The coveted diplomatic position, which was bestowed by
President Nixon, symbolized what the son of a poor Jewish immigrant
had sought throughout his life--acceptance by the powerful.</TE>
<TE>   "This man has given me the greatest honor of my life," Annenberg
said of his friend shortly after Nixon resigned the presidency in
1974 because of the Watergate scandal. "For that I shall be always
grateful to him."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Nixon Eisenhower, daughter of the late president, said
Tuesday that the family and the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace
would remember Annenberg most "for his extraordinary friendship."</TE>
<TE>   "At the lowest point in my father's life, in the months following
his resignation," she said in a statement issued by the library,
"Walter Annenberg called or wrote almost weekly, reminding his old
friend ... that there were still ways he could serve his country.
Annenberg's loyalty, optimism and adherence to the credo 'Never give
up' inspired my father and so many others whose lives Walter
influenced."</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg returned to the White House in 1993, where President
Clinton announced that the billionaire had donated $500 million to
advance elementary and secondary education in the nation's schools.</TE>
<TE>   Matched by private and federal funds, that grant provided an
eventual $1 billion for five-year projects at 18 school districts in
large cities and rural areas from New York to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Colvin, deputy director of the Hechinger Institute on
Education and the Media at Columbia University, said Tuesday that
most of the projects, including that in Los Angeles, focused on
teacher development. In Los Angeles, he said, the Annenberg funding
supported the pairing of elementary, middle and high schools with
university experts to improve teacher skills and raise standards for
student achievement. In other cities, notably New York and
Minneapolis, funds were used to improve arts education by hiring
hundreds of teachers of art, dance and music.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in 1993, Annenberg had donated $365 million in a single
day--$120 million each to USC and Penn; $100 million to the Peddie
School, a prep school he had attended; and $25 million to Harvard
University.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Hubert Annenberg, whose personal net worth was listed as $4
billion by Forbes, which ranked him 39th in its 2002 edition of the
400 Richest People in America, was born March 13, 1908, in Milwaukee,
the only son among the nine children of Sadie and Moses Annenberg.</TE>
<TE>   The extraordinary rise to riches of father and son was chronicled
in a 1999 book, "Legacy: A Biography of Moses and Walter Annenberg,"
by Time and Fortune magazine writer Christopher Ogden.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg's father, the most influential person in Walter's life,
had emigrated from an East Prussian village to Chicago as a child. As
a youngster, the senior Annenberg peddled groceries, tended bar and
swept stables.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Annenberg, called Moe, set the first stones for the
foundation of the family fortune when he joined the Hearst
organization during the newspaper chain's circulation wars with the
Chicago Tribune. Offering clever promotional plans, he climbed
rapidly, and by 1920 he was moved to New York as general circulation
manager of all Hearst publications.</TE>
<TE>   Young Walter moved with his family to Long Island and enrolled at
the Peddie School in Hightstown, N.J. Deaf in one ear and with a
speech impediment, which he eventually overcame, Walter was somewhat
shy and withdrawn as a boy. But he participated in football,
basketball and track in high school, and the school yearbook
prophetically described him as the "best businessman" in his class of
1927.</TE>
<TE>   He attended the Wharton School of Finance at the University of
Pennsylvania, but dropped out after one year to join his father's
business as a bookkeeping assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Independently of Hearst, Moses Annenberg had gained control of the
daily Racing Form and the Morning Telegraph, the two most widely read
horse-racing publications. The Telegraph folded in 1972, but the
Racing Form remained a staunch money-maker in the Annenbergs'
Triangle Publications and was fondly referred to by Walter as "the
old brown cow that always gives milk."</TE>
<TE>   In 1936, Moses Annenberg bought the Philadelphia Inquirer, which
was to become his son's base of operations for more than three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   In 1939, when Walter was a vice president of Triangle, his father
was indicted for income tax evasion and bribery--an incident that had
a searing effect on the son. Walter was also indicted on charges of
"aiding and abetting," but those counts were later dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Moses Annenberg was sentenced July 1, 1940, to three years in the
federal penitentiary at Lewisburg, Pa. He paid $9.5 million in back
taxes and interest, stripping the family of much of its wealth, and
served two years in prison. Released in June 1942, he died the next
month of a brain tumor.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment and prosecution were considered at least partly
politically motivated. Annenberg had made the Inquirer a champion of
conservative Republicans in his circulation war with the Philadelphia
Record, and New Dealers by several accounts wanted to punish the
publisher.</TE>
<TE>   But Walter Annenberg took the incident as a personal badge of
shame, and also as an inspiration for his lifelong attempt to assuage
the blot on the family honor.</TE>
<TE>   After his father's death, Walter Annenberg stepped into the
presidency of Triangle, the family holding company that then owned
the Inquirer, the Daily Racing Form and the Morning Telegraph and
little else.</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, he demonstrated a genius for creating or
acquiring media that an eager public would accept as essential to its
leisure pursuits, much like his father's Racing Form. His first was
the magazine Seventeen for young girls, which he founded in 1944 with
his sister Enid Haupt as editor. The first issue sold 400,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   In 1945, Walter bought one of Philadelphia's leading radio
stations and two years later made it a television station. He
continued to buy radio and television stations in Pennsylvania, New
York, Connecticut and Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Within a year of his 1953 creation of TV Guide, circulation was 1
1/2 million and ad revenue was $750,000. The guide quickly became the
country's largest-selling weekly magazine. It had a circulation of
about 17 million in 1988, when Annenberg sold Triangle to Australian
publisher Rupert Murdoch for $3 billion.</TE>
<TE>   David Sendler, Annenberg's editor of TV Guide for 14 years, said
Tuesday that he could sum up his former publisher by relating one
thing: "He would call me frequently and end the conversation by
saying, 'Dave, remember: quality, quality, quality.' And he meant it.</TE>
<TE>   "He understood the magazine was more than bread-and-butter
profiles and also involved serious journalism," Sendler said.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg's mother referred to the successful Seventeen and
phenomenal TV Guide as "Walter's epiphanies." With their creation,
the son had clearly stepped far beyond the shadow of the father.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile in Philadelphia, Annenberg made money with the Inquirer,
but won no accolades there for good journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Long after Annenberg sold the Inquirer to Knight Newspapers in
1969, Mike Mallowe wrote in Philadelphia Magazine: "Walter, as editor
and publisher, spent ... 27 years solidifying his reputation as an
ogre who savaged the integrity of reporters; belittled their
professional skills; ignored their news judgment; and jeopardized
their credibility in a series of self-centered, petty crusades."</TE>
<TE>   In those days, Annenberg forbade mention of his diverse
enemies--from television star Dinah Shore to the Philadelphia 76ers
basketball team--in his papers or broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Annenberg expanded his horizons westward, building
Sunnylands, a 205-acre retreat for himself and presidents in the
secluded desert playground of Rancho Mirage.</TE>
<TE>   With his typical business expertise, he briefly owned the company
that controlled water rights to his sand pile, and tapped wells for a
nine-hole golf course, swimming pool and private lake, and the
25,000-square-foot mansion he created.</TE>
<TE>   At Sunnylands, where Annenberg spent four or five months a year,
he maintained what biographer John Cooney described as "a lifestyle
reminiscent of a Renaissance Venetian doge. It is impossible not to
be awed by such a display of wealth as well as by the man who can
wear such an immense home with ease."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon became the first head of state to seek refuge in the
compound. Soon followed Presidents Ford, Reagan and George H.W. Bush,
and not only the prince of Wales, but also the queen of England.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't really matter, of course, what [an] establishment
happened to represent," Mallowe wrote, "just as long as Walter
Annenberg was a fully accredited and accepted member of it."</TE>
<TE>   When Queen Elizabeth II came to call in 1983, Annenberg hosted a
small luncheon for 20, seated at two round tables in the pink
marble-floored "inside-outside" house. The queen customarily sits to
a host's right, but for Annenberg she made an exception.</TE>
<TE>   "She thoughtfully suggested that she sit on my left," he said at
the time, "because I have a hearing problem with my right ear."</TE>
<TE>   In his continuing quest for acceptance and respectability,
Annenberg used philanthropy as well as hospitality, giving more than
$2 billion to artistic, educational and political causes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he gave $150 million to the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting for a "university of the air" study-at-home education
program. White House intimates said the gift was a major reason
behind Reagan's decision to award Annenberg the Medal of Freedom "for
his lifetime of achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg donated $50 million to the United Negro College Fund in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his bequests, privately and through the nine family
foundations he controlled, were without strings. Others had too many
strings, and at least one designated recipient--the city of New
York--said no thanks.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, Annenberg had offered New York's Metropolitan Museum of
Art a $40-million package including subsidies for 10 years and
construction of a communications center. He envisioned it as a
film-making center that could create a videocassette version of "The
Golden Book of Knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   Many trustees, city councilmen and New Yorkers in general saw the
proposal as Annenberg's attempt to seize control of the Met. After a
bitter public debate in which Annenberg wrote open letters to New
Yorkers by means of full-page newspaper advertisements, the museum
and the city rejected the gift.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something for the public," he said, still stung by
the rejection years later, "and I still believe in that idea of
making all of the world available to all peoples."</TE>
<TE>   Even England's causes enjoyed Annenberg's largess, as the
ambassador with no diplomatic training sought to win over a hostile
press and public. He contributed lavishly to the restoration of St.
Paul's Cathedral, a cause personally important to Queen Elizabeth,
and to the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, the British Museum, Eton
and the National Gallery. He also lent 32 of his fabled French
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings for exhibit by
London's Tate Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder that Queen Elizabeth made him an honorary knight
commander of the British Empire or that the London Daily Mail noted
when Annenberg's tour of duty ended: "Santa Claus Is Leaving."</TE>
<TE>   A large, imposing man who favored impeccably tailored,
conservative clothes in his public business and social hours,
Annenberg preferred a choir robe for his private moments. In 1978, he
even wore it to sit for a portrait painted by his friend Andrew
Wyeth.</TE>
<TE>   "We [once] went to a service at Westminster Cathedral and admired
the way the choir was dressed," Annenberg said. "We found they had
just got new robes from Whipple [a London manufacturer of church
garments], so we went there and ordered a pair for ourselves. They
are the most comfortable things in the world for wearing around the
house."</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg was ridiculed throughout his life for malapropisms and
awkward, arcane elocution that was believed to stem from
overcompensation for his stuttering.</TE>
<TE>   One area of Annenberg's life in which nobody criticized him was
his art collecting, begun at the urging of his sister Enid and
continued with a passion for more than four decades. Unlike most
wealthy collectors, Annenberg personally selected his purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing his 1989 purchase of a 1905 Picasso, "Au Lapin Agile,"
for $40.7 million, he said: "I sold stock to buy the Picasso and
these other things because they're much better to look at than
securities in a box."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991 he decided to donate 50 masterpieces to the Metropolitan
Museum in New York, where he thought that they could be seen by the
largest number of people.</TE>
<TE>   A traveling exhibition of his collection that stopped at the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art in 1990 fueled hopes that Annenberg
might give all or part of his holdings to the institution, but
insiders knew that those hopes were farfetched. Although he had spent
a great deal of time in Southern California, he had no formal
relationship with the museum. Shortly after he announced the bequest
of his collection to the Met, he gave LACMA $10 million, which was
viewed as a consolation prize by many in the art community. The
museum appointed him an honorary lifetime trustee in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg's gift to LACMA went to the museum's endowment and
included an acquisition fund for Impressionist and Post-Impressionist
artworks. Among pieces purchased from the fund is "Paysages et
Interieurs," a 1899 painting by French artist Edouard Vuillard. In
2000 the Annenberg Foundation made an additional gift of $1 million
to the Los Angeles museum to create the Wallis Annenberg Curatorial
Fellowship.</TE>
<TE>   The traveling exhibition was a rare public showing of one of the
world's most valuable collections in private hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't stand having them not here with me," he once said of his
reluctance to lend out the art even more. "Every day I pay each one a
long visit."</TE>
<TE>   "This is my family," he once said of the paintings and other
objects. "I adore these things."</TE>
<TE>   Annenberg married Veronica Dunkelman in 1938, and the couple had
one daughter, Wallis, and a son, Roger, who committed suicide in 1962
at the age of 22. The couple divorced in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   In 1951, Annenberg married Leonore Cohn Rosensteil, a noted
Beverly Hills hostess often on the list of best-dressed women. In
addition to his wife, Annenberg is survived by Wallis, of Los
Angeles; two sisters, Haupt of Greenwich, Conn., and Palm Beach,
Fla., and Evelyn Hall of New York City and Palm Beach; seven
grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A private family service will be held, and public services are
being planned in Philadelphia and Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Senate Sets Debate on War Plans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK and RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A divided Senate is preparing to open a landmark debate over whether
to authorize military action against Iraq, a move that could
transform decades of U.S. defense policy, roil domestic politics just
a month before congressional elections and open the way for an
international conflict of potentially vast cost.</LD>
<LD>   The debate, which could begin as early as today, will force the
Senate to set aside virtually all other business for days, clearing
the decks for the kind of deliberation about war and peace that has
not consumed Capitol Hill since the divisive vote to authorize the
Persian Gulf War in 1991.</LD>
<LD>   The final wording of the resolution Congress will consider was
still being negotiated Tuesday. President Bush has made it clear that
he will settle for no less than broad latitude to act, regardless
whether he secures the United Nations' backing.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't want to get a resolution which ties my hands," Bush said
Tuesday, criticizing a bipartisan proposal by leaders of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee to focus the use of force more narrowly
than he wants.</TE>
<TE>   Bush is scheduled to meet with top Senate and House leaders today
in hopes of reaching an agreement on the resolution's final wording.</TE>
<TE>   Senior aides said a deal may be struck between the White House,
House Republican leaders and House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.), who has been far more hawkish about Iraq than other
leading Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very close," said a senior Gephardt aide.</TE>
<TE>   That would make for easy House passage of the resolution but leave
open the prospect of a more contentious debate in the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not there yet," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.)
said of the push for compromise wording on the resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Almost lost in the jockeying over the resolution's fine points is
that Congress is poised to, in effect, endorse a historic shift in
U.S. strategy--moving from the Cold War reliance on deterrence and
arms control to an approach that accepts preemptive attack as a
legitimate way to defend against terrorists and regimes suspected of
having weapons of mass destruction that could pose a threat to the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of a real argument about what America
should do in the post-9/11 era," said John Hulsman, a foreign policy
analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.</TE>
<TE>   "After 10 years of sleepwalking through victory in the Cold War,
we've woken up to the fact that the end of history has not yet come,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The basic question facing Congress is not whether but how the
United States will counter the perceived threat of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's regime--a more controversial question than when Bush
struck Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   There is little doubt about the outcome of Congress' vote; the
main question is whether Bush wins by a large margin or an
overwhelming one. Still, there is an edgy uncertainty in the halls of
Congress as each lawmaker prepares to take a stand.</TE>
<TE>   Although most are inclined to rally behind Bush, many
lawmakers--like many of their most vocal constituents--are uneasy
about launching a unilateral attack without broad international
support or further diplomatic initiatives. Polls show that many
voters have the same view.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Americans also have questions about the urgency of the
threat and the risks we face from Iraq," said Sen. Charles Hagel
(R-Neb.). "Not the threat itself, but the urgency of the threat."</TE>
<TE>   That puts Congress, usually a reactive institution, in the unusual
position of taking the political risk of running ahead of public
opinion. But with only a month to go before crucial midterm
congressional elections, it is clear that many Democrats have
concluded that the political risk of opposing Bush is even greater
than the risks of backing a military venture about which they have
many questions. Some lawmakers fear that the political backdrop of
the debate will keep it from becoming a genuine give-and-take about
lofty policy alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe you are going to see the Senate at its best,"
said Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.).</TE>
<TE>   Other critics say that the political pressure on Democrats to mute
their opposition and suppress their reservations will produce a
debate far less probing than in 1991, when Congress approved a much
less sweeping military authorization.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a huge debate over a very limited resolution" in 1991,
said Ivo Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a
nonpartisan think tank. "We will have a puny debate over whether the
U.S. can go preemptively to war."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Senate may begin debate today or Thursday, the final
climactic votes will not come until next week--both because senators
are expected to speak at length and because many lawmakers will be
traveling to Hawaii for a Friday funeral for Rep. Patsy Mink
(D-Hawaii).</TE>
<TE>   Senate leaders had hoped to begin debate Tuesday but postponed it
to give more time to the negotiation seeking compromises on the
resolution's wording. Many lawmakers and administration officials
want the broadest possible bipartisan backing from Congress to
strengthen Bush's hand in organizing a balky international community
around his cause.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution Bush sent to Congress two weeks ago requested
open-ended powers to use any means he determines appropriate to
respond to Iraq and promote "peace and security in the region."
Members of both parties objected to that language as possibly opening
the door to military action beyond Iraq. The administration last week
agreed to drop that language to focus the measure more narrowly on
Iraq, and agreed to periodically report to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   But even those concessions were not enough for many Democrats--and
even some Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and
Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-Ind.) have circulated an alternative
resolution that would increase congressional reporting requirements
and the role of the U.N. in the faceoff with Iraq. It also would make
clear that the principal rationale for an attack would be to
dismantle Iraq's weapons of mass destruction--not regime change, as
the administration has advocated.</TE>
<TE>   That alternative has won the support of Daschle as well as others
cautious about war. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she could
support the Biden-Lugar proposal, with minor modifications.</TE>
<TE>   "That is going to get us to where we need to go, which is to see
Iraq disarmed," said Feinstein.</TE>
<TE>   But White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said that the
Biden-Lugar proposal would be a retreat from an earlier 1998
congressional resolution that would allow the use of force against
Iraq for supporting terrorism, suppressing its own people and
threatening its neighbors. Moving to bring Lugar--a respected
Republican--back into the fold, top administration officials met with
him twice Tuesday in hopes of accommodating his concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Biden has scheduled a meeting of the Foreign Relations Committee
today to consider the alternative proposal--an effort to highlight
it. But Biden acknowledged that Gephardt may be willing to embrace
something much closer to Bush's resolution, which is not limited to
using force for disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   The behind-the-scenes jockeying has created a mood of uncertainty
as senators prepare to cast what many say could be the most important
vote of their careers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very somber time," said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.).
"This is totally new territory. It's the first time in 213 years that
we would have a policy of striking first."</TE>
<TE>   "It's a vote that all the members will remember," said former Rep.
Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), who was a foreign policy leader during his
years in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers acknowledge that key questions--such as how many allies
the United States would have if it decides to attack--will be
unanswered before they have to cast a vote. "It's going to be a
difficult position," said Sen. Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine).</TE>
<TE>   And many lawmakers say they are hearing mostly from constituents
opposed to going to war. Said Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont, an
independent: "My phone calls are 200 to 2 against doing anything."</TE>

imprisonment if convicted.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects, both 34, are already serving prison sentences for
earlier convictions related to the attacks, but this is their first
trial for the bombings.</LD>
<TE>   Bensaid is accused of placing a bomb on a train at the St. Michel
subway stop on July 25, 1995, killing eight people and injuring about
150. He is charged with murder, attempted murder and destruction with
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   He is also charged with attempted murder for an Oct. 6, 1995,
attack at the Maison Blanche stop that injured 18 people and with
complicity in an attack two weeks later at the Musee d'Orsay station.</TE>
<TE>   Belkacem, the network's alleged bomb expert, is accused of
attempted murder in the Musee d'Orsay attack, which injured 27.</TE>
<TE>   Bensaid and Belkacem were convicted and sentenced to 10 years in
1999.</TE>

<LD>Croatia's president, testifying at Slobodan Milosevic's genocide
trial, said the former Yugoslav leader was a warmonger responsible
for Yugoslavia's demise.</LD>
<LD>   Milosevic "could have desisted from the option of war, but he
never took any action to stop it," Stipe Mesic said.</LD>
<LD>   Legal experts said Mesic's testimony gave the clearest look yet at
how Milosevic, while leader of Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic,
took control of the nation's army, budget and presidency and turned
them into tools for promoting a "greater Serbia."</LD>

<HD>Bush Aide Urges 'Bullet' for Hussein</HD>
<DH>Policy: Spokesman says U.S. hasn't changed its ban on
assassination. But if Iraqis oust their leader, he suggests, that
would be cheaper than a war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House's chief spokesman broached the prospect Tuesday of
assassinating Saddam Hussein as a way to avoid war with Iraq, saying
that "the cost of one bullet" would be cheaper than military action.</LD>
<LD>   Ari Fleischer said he had heard no discussion about rescinding a
1976 executive order banning direct U.S. efforts to assassinate
foreign leaders. But in responding to a question about new estimates
of the cost of going to war against Iraq, the White House spokesman
encouraged the Iraqi people to oust Hussein, either by throwing him
out of the country or by killing him.</LD>
<LD>   Asked about a Congressional Budget Office estimate that war could
cost as much as $9 billion a month, the president's spokesman said:
"The cost of a one-way ticket is substantially less than that. The
cost of one bullet, if the Iraqi people take it on themselves, is
substantially less than that."</LD>
<TE>   Fleischer said there was no policy permitting assassination.
Rather, referring to the Bush administration's belief that Hussein is
despised by at least a segment of the Iraqi people, he said, "I was
stating the obvious."</TE>
<TE>   "If Iraqis took this into their own hands, the world would not
shed a tear," Fleischer added.</TE>
<TE>   The statement came closer than any made by a White House official
in a public setting to advocating the assassination of the Iraqi
president.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Tuesday, President Bush asserted anew that the
administration had set no course for dealing with Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether he thought the U.S. economy was strong enough to
withstand a war with Iraq, Bush said to reporters during a photo
session after a meeting with members of Congress: "I haven't made up
my mind we're going to war with Iraq. I've made up my mind we need to
disarm the man."</TE>
<TE>   With successive administrations building much of their policy in
the region around the question of how to leash Hussein, if not remove
him from power, the question of assassinating him has been an
undercurrent since the Persian Gulf War nearly 12 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In unrestrained language, Bush said five days after the Sept. 11
attacks that Osama bin Laden, the leader of the Al Qaeda terrorist
network, was wanted "dead or alive." Still, with the United States
pressuring the United Nations Security Council to hold firm against
Hussein while Washington applies diplomatic pressure backed by the
threat that it is prepared to use overwhelming force, Bush has not
spoken quite as bluntly about the Iraqi leader.</TE>
<TE>   Pressed later about whether he was advocating Hussein's
assassination, Fleischer said, "Saddam Hussein has survived as a
result of the repression and suppression of his own people, and
that's a reality about what life is like inside Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   "Regime change," he said, using the government's euphemism for
removing Hussein from office, "is welcome in whatever form it takes."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the campaign against Al Qaeda and the period of
mounting pressure against the Iraqi leader, administration officials
have been careful to pledge their adherence to the 26-year-old
prohibition against assassinating foreign leaders that was put into
place by President Ford after it was revealed that the CIA had
attempted to kill Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</TE>
<TE>   However, attorneys specializing in diplomatic and military law say
that a foreign government's command-and-control headquarters is a
legitimate military target, regardless of whether a head of state
happens to be there at the time.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, U.S. warplanes bombed Tripoli, the capital of Libya, and
suspected terrorist camps where officials believed leader Moammar
Kadafi might be staying. He was not struck.</TE>
<TE>   During the Persian Gulf War, the United States used a special bomb
to try to hit a Hussein bunker, and again went after him when he was
crossing the desert in a convoy.</TE>

<HD>Rwandans Pulling Out of Congo</HD>
<DH>Africa: Withdrawal is part of peace pact and could be
completed this week, commander says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUKAVU, Congo</DL>
<LD>Rwanda began pulling 6,000 troops from a border province in Congo on
Tuesday, in the latest stage of a withdrawal from the war-ravaged
country that it hopes to complete by week's end, a top commander
said.</LD>
<LD>   U.N. military observers in white jeeps patrolled the streets of
this eastern town in South Kivu province to verify the withdrawal,
while Rwandan helicopter gunships hovered to provide security.</LD>
<LD>   Army Chief of Staff Maj. Gen. James Kabarebe said Rwanda intends
to finish its withdrawal by the end of the week. Rwanda has never
said how many soldiers it has in Congo; estimates have put the number
around 23,400.</LD>
<TE>   The withdrawal was approved under a July 30 peace deal signed by
Rwandan President Paul Kagame and Congolese President Joseph Kabila
in South Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The four-year war in Congo broke out in August 1998 when Rwanda
and Uganda sent thousands of troops and military hardware to back
Congolese rebels seeking to oust Kabila's late father, then-President
Laurent Kabila.</TE>
<TE>   "During the four years we spent in Congo, we did a lot of work. We
weakened our enemy who is no longer a big threat to us," Kabarebe
told the troops. "We are pulling out of Congo, and we will defend our
borders."</TE>

<HD>Officials Quit After Ferry Disaster</HD>
<DH>Africa: Two ministers resign from Senegal's Cabinet in
aftermath of sinking that killed 1,000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DAKAR, Senegal</DL>
<LD>This country's defense and transport ministers resigned Tuesday in
the wake of a ferry disaster in which nearly 1,000 people were
killed.</LD>
<LD>   Rescuers recovered only 64 survivors from among the 1,034 people
on board the Joola, which overturned late Thursday after being caught
in a fierce Atlantic storm off the coast of Gambia.</LD>
<LD>   President Abdoulaye Wade said Armed Forces Minister Youba Sambo
and Transport Minister Youssouf Sakho had resigned. The ferry, built
to carry 550 people, was operated by the armed forces.</LD>
<TE>   Anger against the government has been growing since the extent of
overloading was revealed.</TE>
<TE>   "The many failings revealed will be punished without haste and on
the basis of careful investigation," Wade said in his first national
address since the disaster.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 400 bodies were recovered from the ferry off the fishing
village of Sanyang in Gambia, a sliver of a country that almost cuts
Senegal in two. The Joola had sailed for Dakar, the capital, from the
southern city of Ziguinchor.</TE>
<TE>   The search for bodies trapped in the hull 75 feet beneath the
Atlantic was called off Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Mamadou Niang said Tuesday that there were
proposals to raise the ship or possibly turn it into a memorial to
the dead.</TE>
<TE>   A Senegalese crisis unit said foreign passengers included 10
French nationals, five Spaniards, two Dutch, two Belgians and two
Swiss, along with 20 people from Guinea Bissau. One Frenchman was
among the rescued.</TE>
<TE>   Amateur television footage showed the Joola listing heavily to
starboard before it left Ziguinchor, in the southern Casamance
region. Canoes could be seen continuing to bring more unofficial
passengers to scramble aboard.</TE>

<HD>Israel's Parliament Awaits Its First Openly Gay Lawmaker</HD>
<DH>Politics: Uzi Even's upcoming entry into Knesset buoys
activists, dismays ultra-Orthodox.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MITCHELL LANDSBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>Few incoming members of Israel's parliament could match Uzi Even's
credentials: combat veteran of two wars, professor of physical
chemistry at Tel Aviv University, one of the nation's leading experts
on nuclear weapons technology.</LD>
<LD>   None of that, however, explains the stir that greeted his recent
appointment to replace a departing member.</LD>
<LD>   Even is about to become the first openly gay member of the
parliament, or Knesset, whose substantial Orthodox Jewish minority
views homosexuality as an abomination. His ascension is viewed with
dismay from that quarter, even as it is hailed as a breakthrough by
Israel's young gay rights movement.</LD>
<TE>   "A great accomplishment," declared Michal Eden, a lesbian member
of the Tel Aviv City Council.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think this brings too much honor to the Knesset," rued
Rabbi Avraham Ravitz, a member of the ultra-Orthodox United Torah
Judaism party. Ravitz said he hoped Even wouldn't have the chutzpah
to talk about his sexual orientation on the Knesset floor.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, he already has.</TE>
<TE>   Even has been at the forefront of the gay rights movement in
Israel since 1993, when he gave a speech before parliament that
stunned the establishment and helped prompt the military to ban
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   A respected researcher who had worked at the most sensitive levels
of the defense establishment, Even proclaimed his homosexuality and
said it had been used to ruin his military career. He had been
demoted 10 years earlier when the army discovered he was living with
a man.</TE>
<TE>   The United States was struggling with the same issue then, and
wound up with the compromise "don't ask, don't tell" doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, Even's efforts helped lead to a blanket declaration
that there would be no discrimination against gay soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "It was achieved with no fuss at all," Even recalled, sitting in
his modern Tel Aviv apartment, smiling in satisfaction. He is 62,
balding, professorial, with a distinctively soft, low voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if you tell the military you're gay, the answer is, 'So
what?' " he added.</TE>
<TE>   Even has been a pioneer in opening other aspects of Israeli
society to gays. He successfully sued his university to get spousal
benefits extended to his partner, fellow academic Amit Kama. He and
Kama became among the first gay foster parents in Israel, taking in a
15-year-old boy who had been kicked out of his parents' house for
declaring that he was gay.</TE>
<TE>   Even considers this last undertaking his greatest, and most
satisfying, accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   The professor has been increasingly involved in politics since the
1993 speech, which he made at the urging of Yael Dayan, a left-wing
Knesset member who is the daughter of the late Gen. Moshe Dayan, a
legendary Israeli military leader.</TE>
<TE>   Even was 13th on the leftist Meretz Party's list of candidates for
12 Knesset seats. When a party member recently announced his
retirement, Even was automatically selected to fill the vacancy. He
will take office this month.</TE>
<TE>   It is not yet clear how he will be received. When he spoke to the
Knesset in 1993, the Orthodox parties walked out. Now that he is a
member, they may have no choice but to pay attention.</TE>
<TE>   Members of Shas, the largest religious party in Israel, declined
to talk about Even.</TE>
<TE>   Ravitz, whose party is often aligned with Shas, said he will
tolerate the professor, even respect his opinion on military and
scientific matters.</TE>
<TE>   Just not gay rights.</TE>
<TE>   If Even pushes legislation "to make it even more legitimate [to be
gay], of course he'll have to fight me over that," Ravitz said. "He
can't force me in the name of liberalism to change my outlook of
mankind, of the world."</TE>
<TE>   Ravitz said he is convinced that homosexuality, beyond violating
religious law, is a psychological disorder, treatable through
therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Even said he welcomes this argument. Formerly, he said, Orthodox
opponents assailed him solely on the basis of biblical injunctions.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot argue with the commands of God," he said. "But I can
argue with modern concepts of what is normal, what is psychologically
healthy."</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, he said, he's heard it all before.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man in his 20s, he said, he told his parents about his
homosexuality after a breakup with a boyfriend left him depressed.
His mother sent him to a therapist.</TE>
<TE>   After therapy, he said, "I told my mother, 'He cured my
depression--but I'm still gay!' And she said, 'I knew he was a bad
doctor.' "</TE>
<TE>   He laughed. "Typical Jewish mother," he said.</TE>

<HD>Kidnapped German Boy Found Dead</HD>
<DH>Crime: Son of a wealthy Frankfurt banker is slain even
though family paid nearly $1 million in ransom. Authorities charge
27-year-old tutor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY FLEISHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>The body of the 11-year-old son of a prominent Frankfurt banking
family was found near a lakeside dock Tuesday, despite the payment of
nearly $1 million in ransom to the boy's kidnapper, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Jakob von Metzler is believed to have been kidnapped by a
27-year-old law student and tutor who had befriended the family and
is now in custody, according to police. Jakob's parents, Friedrich
and Silvia von Metzler, paid a $990,000 ransom after receiving a note
Friday shortly after Jakob didn't return to the family's gated
mansion in Frankfurt after school.</LD>
<LD>   The abduction riveted a country that remembers a string of
high-profile kidnappings in the 1980s and '90s. Newspapers and TV ran
photos of Jakob. Neighbors left flowers outside the Von Metzler home.</LD>
<TE>   The prominence and wealth of the Von Metzlers made them targets,
police said. The family bank--with offices in Los Angeles, Seattle,
New York and elsewhere--was founded in 1674. Friedrich von Metzler is
an 11th-generation scion and philanthropist who donates millions of
dollars annually to museums, theaters and colleges, including the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the suspect knew Von Metzler's teenage children and
used this relationship to lure Jakob from his journey home from
public school. A family friend told German TV on Tuesday that the
suspect--whose name was not released--tutored the Von Metzler
children in English and German.</TE>
<TE>   A servant found the ransom note on the gate of the family's home.
Police set up surveillance and on Sunday evening watched as the
suspect collected the money at an arranged drop-off point.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they didn't immediately arrest the man in hopes that
he would lead investigators to the boy. But he didn't, and he was
arrested Monday after police allegedly found some of the ransom money
in his apartment. He has been charged with kidnapping and murder.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,000 police officers and 20 dogs scoured the woods near
the family home and a lake south of Frankfurt. The search was
fruitless. Police later shifted locations and discovered Jakob's body
bundled and lying near a dock about 40 miles north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   The ransom note promised that "the boy would be returned safely
after the money was paid," Frankfurt Police Chief Harald
Weiss-Bollandt said. "Our main hope was to protect the life of the
child.... I can tell you of the dismay of the other children that the
27-year-old had tried to befriend them."</TE>
<TE>   The kidnapping and slaying were reminiscent of the 1988 abduction
of 15-month-old Patrick Padberg from his millionaire parents. The
kidnapper killed the boy, then tried to collect a $600,000 ransom and
was arrested. In 1991, 6-year-old Peter Fiszman was released in
Cologne after his family paid a ransom. Five years later, the boy's
uncle, Jakub Fiszman, owner of an electronics business, was abducted
and found dead after the family paid a $2.6-million ransom.</TE>
<TE>   There were 90 abductions in Germany last year, including 20 cases
in which the family paid a ransom without contacting police, said
Claus-Walter Herbertz, a lawyer and criminal psychologist who
consults with wealthy families and corporations on kidnappings and
blackmail.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have the opportunity, you will always pay a ransom," he
said. "The parents feel they have a chance to get the child back."</TE>

<HD>Hurricane Pounds Cuba, Heads to U.S. Gulf Coast</HD>
<DH>Weather: Lili rips up trees and destroys houses on island.
The storm is expected to hit near the Louisiana- Texas border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CORTES, Cuba</DL>
<LD>Hurricane Lili uprooted trees and destroyed homes in western Cuba
with 100-mph winds Tuesday before entering the Gulf of Mexico on a
path that threatens the U.S. Gulf Coast.</LD>
<LD>   Cuba evacuated 360,000 people from threatened areas, but no
casualties were reported. Earlier, the storm killed eight people in
Jamaica and St. Vincent.</LD>
<LD>   NASA postponed today's scheduled launch of the space shuttle
Atlantis. The space agency said it did not want to take a chance of
launching Atlantis in Florida, only to have the hurricane bear down
on Houston, home to Mission Control.</LD>
<TE>   In southern Louisiana, residents faced their second evacuation in
a week. "We're probably going to be evacuating" this morning, said
Ray Santiny, city councilman on the barrier island of Grand Isle,
south of New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Lili followed a track similar to that of Hurricane Isidore, which
caused extensive flooding in Cuba's western tip only 11 days ago,
before battering Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said a hurricane watch was
in effect along the Gulf Coast from San Luis Pass, Texas, to the
mouth of the Mississippi River. Lili was projected to hit a point on
the U.S. coast near the Texas-Louisiana border Thursday, U.S.
forecasters said.</TE>
<TE>   Lili is a Category 2 storm, capable of damaging homes and trees
and causing considerable damage to mobile homes and poorly built
signs and piers.</TE>
<TE>   A day after pounding Jamaica, Lili plowed through Cuba's
tobacco-growing province of Pinar del Rio, picking up speed and
moving into the gulf. Little damage to the crop was expected.</TE>
<TE>   Reporters who witnessed Lili's passage said fallen trees and
telephone lines blocked streets. Power supplies were down, and roads
to some small towns were cut off.</TE>
<TE>   "My God, my house was small, but it was my house. Now I have no
house!" wept a woman on the outskirts of Pinar del Rio city, who gave
her name only as Zenaida.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban meteorologists said Lili could gather more force as it moves
over the warm gulf.</TE>

<HD>Lucky Soldier Keeps Defying Death, On and Off Battlefield</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Sgt. Roderick Morgan is back in the war zone
after several wounds. One of his battered helmets is on display.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ZUCCHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DABGAY, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>The pride of the military collection at the 82nd Airborne museum at
Ft. Bragg, N.C., is the battered helmet of Sgt. Roderick Morgan. It
bears a nasty dent from when Morgan was shot in the helmet by a
Serbian militiaman in July 1999 and somehow survived.</LD>
<LD>   Now the museum is begging Morgan for a second helmet. While
serving in Afghanistan in July, Morgan was once again shot in the
helmet, this time by an Afghan gunman. Once again, he survived. But
this time, he held on to his damaged helmet.</LD>
<LD>   Morgan was wearing the repaired helmet last week, manning a
grenade launcher atop an armored Humvee in the high desert of eastern
Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. He's back on duty in the war
zone, and he's pretty certain his bad luck is all used up.</LD>
<TE>   "I figure I'm good to go. I mean, what are the odds of getting
shot in the Kevlar [helmet] three times?" Morgan said, gumming a
pinch of snuff while providing cover for an 82nd Airborne Division
unit.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan's three-man crew inside the Humvee, young and eager to see
action, is sticking close by the sergeant in hopes of drawing enemy
fire.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the magnet," said the gunner, Sgt. Neil Burt.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said the medic, Pfc. Kyle Nemas. "You know you'll see
action with this guy."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, 35, a cheerful, tattooed country boy from Georgia, has an
impressive track record of survival, both in and out of combat.</TE>
<TE>   In the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, he was shot first through the
hand and shoulder. Then a shot to the helmet spun him backward, away
from a follow-up shot that just missed his chest. He was knocked
unconscious for several hours, which is how his helmet got away from
him and ended up at the museum. He later underwent shoulder and hand
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   In the southern Afghan city of Kandahar in July, Morgan was shot
in the ankle and then the helmet by a gunman firing from a ditch,
using children for cover. He underwent surgery to reconnect his
Achilles tendon. The impact of the shot to the helmet fractured a
bone in his neck, he said, and he still suffers from neck pain and
numbness in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan says his wife, Staff Sgt. Stephanie Morgan, who is based in
the U.S., is learning to accept his proclivity for mayhem. When she
was informed of the shot to his helmet in Kandahar, he said, her
first response was: "Not again."</TE>
<TE>   The dent in Morgan's helmet is still there, a narrow gully beneath
the cloth covering he sewed back up. His body is a road map of scars
and fractures, each with a story.</TE>
<TE>   In July 1995, while training at Ft. Bragg, Morgan and the rest of
his platoon were struck by lightning. "Flat-lined me," Morgan said.
"Took a defibrillator to bring me back." A medic worked so furiously
to save him, he said, that he fractured three of Morgan's ribs
performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</TE>
<TE>   In July 2001, at Ft. Benning, Ga., Morgan said, a tractor-trailer
ran a red light and plowed into his Ford Ranger, pinning him under
the vehicle and leaving him with a compound dislocation of his elbow
and a wicked scar on his forearm.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess trouble just seems to follow me," Morgan said. "All you
can do is laugh about it. Everybody else does."</TE>
<TE>   Some fellow members of the 82nd steer clear of Morgan, he said;
others warn soldiers not to stand too close to him. The rest are
placing bets on whether he'll draw enemy fire again before his tour
in Afghanistan is over. With his reputation and his two Purple
Hearts, he's a combination of jinx, good luck charm and guardian
angel.</TE>
<TE>   "My commander says he loves me to death, but he won't fly in the
same aircraft with me," Morgan said.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, he said, "These guys willing to ride in the
Humvee with me will never have to prove their bravery."</TE>
<TE>   His fellow soldiers honored Morgan by naming the drop zone at
their local base after him: DZ Morgan. Naturally, a strap carrying
the very first load of artillery shells to arrive broke, sending the
rounds tumbling to earth. They didn't explode, and no one was hurt,
but Morgan's reputation for skirting disaster was further
embellished.</TE>
<TE>   For all his wounds, Morgan says, the military is less dangerous
than his previous job. He spent nine years as a professional rodeo
bull rider.</TE>
<TE>   One bull broke Morgan's jaw, he said, and his mouth was wired shut
for weeks. Another bull punctured Morgan's lung by stomping on his
ribs.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers looking up from his hospital bed after his last
bull-ring injury and seeing his wife, who was pregnant with their
first child. "I started thinking: What kind of life is this going to
be, me always getting hurt, with a baby on his way?"</TE>
<TE>   So he decided right then to find a less perilous profession. He
joined the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Between the bull-riding and 12 years in the military, Morgan says,
he has undergone surgery 11 times. He says he's lost track of the
number of times he has been knocked unconscious in the arena or on
the battlefield, but he figures that it's about 15 and counting.</TE>
<TE>   "You know how they use cadavers to test bullets and wounds?" he
said. "Well, now they have a walking cadaver."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan is a fast healer. After he was wounded in Kandahar on July
9, he said, he cut the cast off his foot and was back in the Afghan
war zone Aug. 22. He said his military doctors didn't want him back
in combat at all and told him not to go back to active duty for eight
more weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those wounds where I could've sat home and watched
TV, or sucked it up and got back over here with my boys," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why he returned to battle after two near-fatal injuries,
Morgan pointed to his men and then pulled out a laminated copy of the
Ranger Creed. Morgan is a Ranger, one of the U.S. Army's elite
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I volunteered as a Ranger, fully knowing the hazards of my chosen
profession," the creed reads. It adds: "Never shall I fail my
comrades."</TE>
<TE>   At the mention of Morgan's name, his battalion commander, Lt. Col.
Martin Schweitzer, paused and said: "That man is an American hero."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan and his Humvee crew say they're disappointed that they
haven't seen more action in eastern Afghanistan. Now that summer is
over--Morgan's two battlefield wounds, his lightning strike and auto
accident all occurred in July--he says he's ready for a good
firefight.</TE>
<TE>   "I say bring it on," he said. "I'm good at least until next July."</TE>
<TE>   As Morgan and his crew sat parked on a dusty knoll, securing a
village that was being searched by fellow soldiers, they heard a
rattling noise in the brush. They thought it was a snake. Morgan
considered stepping out and investigating.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," he said, "I haven't been snake-bit yet."</TE>

<PH>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY / CHAPTER THREE</PH>
<KH>ALONG THE TRACKS</KH>
<HD>How Carlos Lost His Leg to the Wheels of a Train</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>
<AU>Sonia Nazario</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He lies in bed No. 1 of the trauma unit at Hospital Civil in the town
of Arriaga in southern Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Four days before he was brought in, Carlos Roberto Diaz Osorto,
17, of Honduras had seen a man get both legs cut off by a freight
train. But he pushed fear out of his mind. He was going to the United
States to find work.</LD>
<LD>   At a curve near Arriaga, where the trains brake, Carlos races
alongside, asking himself, "Should I get on or not?" His cousins have
grabbed on to the sixth car from the end. Carlos panics. Will he be
left behind?</LD>
<TE>   The train comes to a bridge. Carlos will not give up. He crosses
the span, jumping from one railroad tie to another. His shoelaces are
loose. His left shoe flies off. Then his right shoe.</TE>
<TE>   He reaches for a ladder on a fuel tanker, but the car is moving
too fast, and he lets go. He grabs a railing.</TE>
<TE>   The tanker jerks hard. Carlos holds on, but he can feel air
rushing beneath the car, sucking his legs in, close to the wheels.</TE>
<TE>   His fingers uncurl. He tries to bounce his feet off the wheels and
push away.</TE>
<TE>   But as he lets go, the air pulls him in.</TE>
<TE>   The wheels flatten his right foot, then slice through his left leg
above the knee. He feels on fire.</TE>
<TE>   "Help me! Help me! It hurts!" he screams.</TE>
<TE>   He begins to pant, to sweat, to ask for water, not sure anyone can
hear him. Unlike some who try to stand, Carlos can see that his limbs
are a raw jumble of crimson sinew, bone and muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Paramedics from the Mexican Red Cross find him lying by the
tracks. He has lost nearly a third of his blood, but the hot rails
have cauterized many of his arteries. The medics apply two
tourniquets.</TE>
<TE>   "Take away the pain," he moans.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor cuts his bones, then seals each artery and vein. He
stretches skin over the openings and sutures them shut. Sometimes
there are no drugs available to stave off infection, but Carlos is
lucky. The Red Cross locates some penicillin.</TE>
<TE>   Twelve days later, his parents arrive at his bedside and look at
what is left of his legs. "I thank God he's still alive," says Maria
Mercedes Diaz, 33, crying quietly and stroking her son's hair.</TE>
<TE>   At the rate of nearly one every other day, the Red Cross
estimates, U.S.-bound Central American immigrants who ride freight
trains lose arms, legs, hands or feet. The estimate, offered by
Martin Edwin Rabanales Luttman, chief of training for the Red Cross
ambulance corps in Tapachula, is for the Mexican state of Chiapas
alone. It does not count those who die instantly when they are cut in
half or decapitated.</TE>
<TE>   They fall from the trains for a variety of reasons. Some
fall asleep and roll off; others are thrown by the street gangs who
control the train tops.</TE>
<TE>   Because the migrants try to fool authorities and pass themselves
off as Mexican, they carry no identification. If they die, their
bodies are lowered, nameless, into common graves. In Tapachula, they
end up down a hole in the cemetery with stillborn babies.</TE>
<TE>   At Arriaga, in northern Chiapas, snapshots of the dead are placed
in a black book on Police Chief Reyder Cruz Toledo's desk. Some
pictures are so new that he hasn't pasted them in yet. One is of a
woman with her head torn off. Another is of a 20-year-old man cut in
half.</TE>
<TE>   In most photos, the eyes are open.</TE>
<TE>   The chief keeps the book handy, hoping someone will identify the
bodies. No one, he says, ever comes to look.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermina Galvez Lopez, 30, whose wooden hut fronts the rails in
Chiapas near an immigrant checkpoint called La Arrocera, hears the
train riders cry out. Once a month, on average, she says, a man or a
boy will fall near her house and lose his arms or legs.</TE>
<TE>   "Help me! Help me!" they beg.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband applies tourniquets and races for help.</TE>
<TE>   In the train yard at the Lecheria station in Mexico City, workers
tell of a 7-year-old boy from Central America traveling alone.</TE>
<TE>   He sprinted hard to catch a northbound freight. He grabbed on to
the ladder of a hopper car, but he could not run fast enough. The
train pulled him forward. He stumbled, hands first, under a car. One
wheel sliced off his left arm above the elbow.</TE>
<TE>   He writhed beside the tracks, his arm being tossed about under the
cars.</TE>
<TE>   The boy cried out: "eforeMama! eforeMama!"</TE>

<HD>Rapists Watched and Waited for Wendy and Karen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A bandit with a cobra tattoo marches Wendy into a cornfield.</LD>
<LD>   She is 17 and the only woman among 11 Central Americans trying to
sneak around a Mexican immigration checkpoint at Huehuetan in
Mexico's Chiapas state. The man with the cobra tattoo and four other
bandits have been lying in wait.</LD>
<LD>   A Central American man tries to bolt. One of the bandits
broadsides him three times with the flat blade of a machete. The
bandits tell the nine other men, including Wendy's husband, to strip
to their underwear, then lie face down on the ground. A bandit
searches their clothing for cash.</LD>
<TE>   Then, say Wendy's husband and the other Central Americans, the man
with the cobra tattoo on his arm orders Wendy to remove her pants.
She refuses. He throws her to the ground and places the tip of his
machete against her stomach.</TE>
<TE>   She begins to cry.</TE>
<TE>   He puts the edge of the blade to her throat.</TE>
<TE>   She takes off her pants, and he checks them for money. "If you
scream," he says, "we cut you to bits." Then he rapes her.</TE>
<TE>   The other bandits curse the men on the ground, then curse their
mothers and threaten to castrate them. "What the hell are you doing
outside your country?" they say. One by one, during an hour and a
half, each of the five bandits goes into the cornfield and rapes
Wendy.</TE>
<TE>   Her husband fills with rage.</TE>
<TE>   The bandits bring her back, crying. She cannot speak. She vomits,
then faints.</TE>
<TE>   As they flee, her husband and the others carry Wendy to the
checkpoint. She says, trembling, "I want to die."</TE>
<TE>   None of the bandits is arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Wendy, from Honduras, is one of a large number of immigrant girls
who say they are raped as they travel north through Mexico to get to
the United States. A 1997 University of Houston study of U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service detainees in Texas shows that
nearly one in six says she was sexually assaulted.</TE>
<TE>   The rapes are part of the general denigration and humiliation of
Central Americans in Mexico, where the migrants are seen as inferior
because they come from less developed countries, says Olivia Ruiz, a
cultural anthropologist at El Colegio de la Frontera Norte in
Tijuana.</TE>
<TE>   The targets, she says, can be men or women.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 22, 2000, three weeks after Wendy's rape, a 15-year-old
girl named Karen, also from Honduras, was raped at Ixtepec in Oaxaca
state. In that case, police arrested Jhony Martinez Castro, 17, of
Honduras and Salvador Armando Garcia Ramirez, also 17, of El
Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Karen, authorities and court documents give this account:</TE>
<TE>   In her third month of riding trains to reach the United States,
Karen wades into a river in Ixtepec to wash her clothes and her face,
which was cut open by a tree branch that struck her as she rode on
top of a freight car.</TE>
<TE>   "eforeEh, tu, bicha, ven aqui! Hey, you, bitch, come over here!"
Martinez yells from the riverbank.</TE>
<TE>   He wears tattoos on his forehead, face, chest and arms.</TE>
<TE>   Karen is wary, but he insists.</TE>
<TE>   As she leaves the water, he throws an arm around her neck and jabs
her ribs with a knife. "Now you are going to make love to us." Garcia
appears with a machete and a knife. "Walk," Martinez demands.</TE>
<TE>   Two shoeshine boys, ages 9 and 12, who are wading nearby, slip
away to get help.</TE>
<TE>   Karen resists, then begins to cry. She begs the men not to harm
her.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez places the point of his knife at the middle of her
throat. "Drop your shorts," he demands.</TE>
<TE>   She pulls her shorts to her knees.</TE>
<TE>   He steps between her legs, stomps her shorts the rest of the way
down, then shoves her to the ground. He rapes her.</TE>
<TE>   Karen is a virgin, and it feels as if he is cutting her open. She
thinks of her mother, who has always told her to take care of
herself. She prays that the police will come. Tears stream down her
cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   In half an hour, Martinez is finished.</TE>
<TE>   "Your turn," he tells Garcia. Martinez laughs and smokes a
marijuana joint as his friend rapes her.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you will bathe. I don't want any evidence," Martinez says. He
grabs her hand and leads her into the river.</TE>
<TE>   Karen cries quietly. Surely he will kill her.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't try to call the police. My gang is waiting for me--you
won't last one day,'' he warns her. "eforeAndate! Get out!"</TE>
<TE>   At that moment, officers arrive and apprehend both men, still in
their underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Ixtepec Police Chief Juan Ruiz Toledo says Martinez heads a set of
the Mara Salvatrucha gang. He says that Martinez yelled at Karen from
his cell, "You'll be sorry!" He said he will order his 50 followers
in El Carmen, Guatemala, to deal with her.</TE>
<TE>   Karen, waiting in another cell for deportation to El Carmen, is
terrified. "That," she says, "would seal my fate."</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 26, 2001, Garcia and Martinez were sentenced to 15 years
each for the rapes, says Tito Ramirez Gonzalez, a prosecutor with the
attorney general's office for Oaxaca state.</TE>

<KH>WALTER H. ANNENBERG: 1908-2002</KH>
<HD>Collector Reveled in Showing Art</HD>
<DH>Paintings: Annenberg took great joy in leading visitors to
his desert estate on a tour of works by such artists as Matisse,
Monet, Gauguin and Van Gogh.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walter Annenberg liked nothing better than welcoming visitors to his
estate in Rancho Mirage and showing off his collection of French
Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Like a proud but
rather reticent father, he would stand back and encourage his guests
to simply look at the pictures and absorb their beauty.</LD>
<LD>   Most visitors were thrilled to comply. The Monet landscapes,
Gauguin Tahitian scenes, Bonnard interiors and a host of other
glowing canvases painted by Matisse, Degas, Renoir, Cezanne and Van
Gogh reflected the atmosphere of the estate, with the verdant grounds
seen through the living room windows. More melancholy works, such as
"Au Lapin Agile," an early (1905) bar scene by Pablo Picasso,
tempered the sunny mix with a touch of darkness and angst.</LD>
<LD>   When the time seemed right and he could contain himself no longer,
Annenberg would offer his own interpretations of the art. Gauguin's
"Portrait of Women" was actually a penetrating view of a daughter's
innocence and her mother's hard-won wisdom, he said. Comparing a
landscape and a still life by Cezanne, he noted the artist's skill at
adapting his formal vocabulary to different subject matter.</LD>
<TE>   Annenberg collected more than 50 paintings and watercolors over
about 30 years, often paying record prices for fine examples of the
work of internationally renowned artists. Though his choices speak of
a highly refined taste, he confessed to a weakness for artworks that
appealed on sight and demanded that they radiate an emotional
resonance. "They have to move me," he said of the paintings that
found a place on his walls.</TE>
<TE>   Much as he loved owning the artworks and displaying them in what
amounted to a private museum, he came to the conclusion that "great
works of art should ultimately belong to the people." With that credo
in mind, he bequeathed the entire cache, valued at $1 billion, to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York--ending a quiet but intense
competition among directors and curators of other museums, which had
heated up during a traveling exhibition of the collection in 1990-91.</TE>
<TE>   "I love these works with a passion, and I want them to stay
together after I'm gone," Annenberg said when he announced his gift
in 1991. "Much as I respect the other institutions that have lately
shown our collection--the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art and the National Gallery of Art in Washington--I
happen to believe in strength going to strength, and I think that the
Met is the proper repository for them."</TE>
<TE>   His gift greatly enhanced the Met's collection of Impressionist
and Post-Impressionist art, which was established in 1929 by a
bequest from H.O. Havemayer and reinforced by major gifts and
bequests from other collectors. Although the museum did not become
the owner of Annenberg's collection until he died, it was installed
in three large galleries, which have become one of the most popular
areas of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   The Annenberg bequest "was a quantum jump, qualitatively and
quantitatively, to our collection of Impressionists and
Post-Impressionists," Philippe de Montebello, director of the Met,
said. "Our collection was already strong. It's now clearly preeminent
in the Western Hemisphere and right next to the Musee d'Orsay in
Paris. It puts us in that league. Even for us, it made an enormous
difference."</TE>

<HD>Outrage, but No Surprise, at Attack</HD>
<DH>Crime: 'We fight here all the time,' resident says of
Milwaukee area where a young mob fatally attacked a man. Ten suspects
are in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Shamon Johnson ran his tongue over his gold-capped front teeth and
shook his head so hard that his dreadlocks lashed his face as he
watched half a dozen police officers hoisting a gangly, handcuffed
boy into a paddy wagon Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   "When they catch them all, I bet I'll know every one," the
24-year-old said. "Every single one. And I hope they get what they
deserve.</LD>
<LD>   "But man, they didn't want to kill him. If they wanted to kill
him, they would have just gone and got a pistol. Everybody here has a
pistol."</LD>
<TE>   Police moved in waves through this city's crime-crippled Johnson's
Park neighborhood on Tuesday, rounding up suspects in the Sunday
night mob beating of Charlie Young Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Ten were in custody by evening. An additional six were being
sought. Almost all were children, the youngest 10, the oldest 18.
Each could face murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   Young, 36, died Tuesday of his injuries after a day and a half on
life support.</TE>
<TE>   Before word of Young's death, residents mingled in the street and
on the stoops of two liquor stores--each just 50 yards from the porch
where Young went down--unanimously lamenting the orgiastic violence
that police say erupted around 10:30 p.m. Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Like Johnson, they shook their heads or covered their mouths,
knowing that the names of the suspects would be very familiar in the
small neighborhood of tenements. Perhaps they would even be kin.</TE>
<TE>   After expressing their outrage and disgust, however, many said
they were hardly surprised. And they sometimes mocked those who would
question how children and teenagers, ones who grew up here, might
have beaten a man with bats, shovels, a rake.</TE>
<TE>   "We fight here all the time," said Keith Martin, 37, a lifelong
resident of the neighborhood who says he is near the top of the
city's waiting list to become a police officer.</TE>
<TE>   "We usually don't kill each other, but the only people out here
who don't have guns are you," he said to a television reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids have nothing to do," Martin said later. "The
membership at the YMCA is 200-something dollars. We don't have that
kind of money. This is going to continue to happen until you give
these kids something to do."</TE>
<TE>   The neighborhood, just east of downtown, for years has been a
center of drug dealing, carjackings, violence of every sort,
including the beating of a minister a week ago and the shooting of a
police officer a few years back.</TE>
<TE>   Since that shooting, police have patrolled even more heavily than
before, hauling young, jobless black men downtown and handing them
$679 "drug loitering" tickets, residents complain. But crime, they
say, has remained about the same: bad.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, the homicide rate in the United States' 25 largest
cities declined by an average of 25% between 1996 and 2000, according
to federal statistics. It fell by just 6.7% in Milwaukee, the
19th-largest city in the country.</TE>
<TE>   The number of juvenile murderers rose dramatically between the
early 1980s and mid-1990s, nearly doubling for 16- and 17-year-olds,
according to the FBI. Although those figures have declined slightly
in the last few years, they are still well above what they were two
decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   A place that is seldom peaceful, what with the shouting and public
drinking and drug sales, the residential intersection of Brown Street
and 21st Lane took on an unusually nervous feel Sunday, residents
say.</TE>
<TE>   A group of boys, at least a few carrying baseball bats and metal
poles, had gathered in the afternoon near Pride Foods, one of the
liquor stores. By evening, one resident said, they were still
there--laughing, yelling, shoving each other and laughing some more.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a matter of seconds, boisterous play degenerated into
violence following an "egging," police say, a nasty adolescent
pastime. One boy in the group, a 10-year-old who was coaxed by
others, according to police, hurled an egg at a man passing nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The man was Young, and the egg hit him.</TE>
<TE>   Known to some as ".380," perhaps after the caliber of a handgun,
Young chased after the boy. A 14-year-old cut him off, police say,
and Young punched the older boy in the mouth, knocking out a tooth.</TE>
<TE>   The mob turned violent, according to authorities. Those with
weapons took after Young while others stormed onto a nearby porch and
armed themselves with gardening tools and lumber.</TE>
<TE>   The youths allegedly battered Young as he fled down an alley, past
green municipal garbage cans, past shattered garage doors and a
rotting blue Pontiac Grand Am.</TE>
<TE>   Young made his way onto the crumbling porch of an occupied
tenement and forced his way inside, only to be dragged back out by
the mob, police say.</TE>
<TE>   Blood was pooled on the porch and splattered on the tan walls and
across the brick-red awning, 9 feet above, neighbors say, before
residents washed it off Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Police say Young lived more than 40 blocks from the neighborhood,
but Johnson's Park residents say he was frequently in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the suspects--three 13-year-olds and a
15-year-old--appeared in court Tuesday evening, and they were ordered
held in a detention facility until they are charged. It was not known
whether they would be charged as adults.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday afternoon, several adults sat on the porch of an
apartment building half a block away, some smoking cigarettes, others
sipping cans of Colt .45 Malt Liquor. A school bus pulled up and
children headed up the stairs, past the adults.</TE>
<TE>   "That was messed up," Alonda Erving, 29, said of the beating.
"That don't make no sense. But this is the ghetto. There's crime all
the time."</TE>

<HD>Migrant Deaths Increase in Illegal Crossings Via Desert</HD>
<DH>Immigration: The overall toll has declined, but a U.S.
crackdown has driven many to take risky routes, critics say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bodies kept turning up on Arizona's Tohono O'odham reservation
this summer. Some days it was skeletal remains and tattered
identification cards, baking in the hot desert sun. Other days were
even harder: mothers sitting by the lifeless bodies of dehydrated
children; wild-eyed wives wandering in the scrub for help that would
come too late for their fallen husbands.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like a war zone out there," said Henry Ramon, 68, vice
chairman of the Tohono O'odham tribe. "This should not be happening."</LD>
<LD>   Although deaths have declined 7% in the last year along the entire
U.S.-Mexican border, the toll in the remote deserts and mountains of
eastern Arizona has nearly doubled from 79 last year to 134,
according to the U.S. Border Patrol. The agency keeps yearly
statistics from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30.</LD>
<TE>   Border Patrol officials said this week that an 8-year-old
crackdown on illegal migration in urban areas such as San Diego and
El Paso has been a success.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrant apprehensions--estimated this year at 950,000--are down
about 20% from a year earlier. That's lower than any year since 1989,
proof that fewer people are crossing, said Border Patrol spokesman
Mario Villarreal.</TE>
<TE>   But migrant advocates say the policy amounts to a death
sentence--funneling thousands of migrants away from the relative
safety of cities and into the harsh deserts of Arizona. And they warn
that things are only going to get worse as the urban crossings
constrict while little is done to stem the flow of poor Mexicans and
Central Americans seeking work in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   On the Tohono O'odham reservation, tribal executive Ramon said
that between 1,500 and 2,000 people cross each day, many of them
staggering from dehydration. Drug smugglers also have increased their
trips through the reservation.</TE>
<TE>   In their wake, the migrants leave piles of trash, clothes and
feces. And sometimes their dead. Caring for the sick and picking up
dozens of corpses are draining the tribe's budget and overwhelming
its coroner, Police Department and hospital, costing the Police
Department an estimated $2.5 million to $3 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   "Among our people, it has really changed our way of life," said
Ramon, who advocates allowing some workers to cross legally.</TE>
<TE>   A study released in July by the Public Policy Institute of
California said the buildup of agents along the border has done
little to deter people from crossing. What it has done, migrant
rights advocates say, is make crossing more dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "What this tells you is this is getting deadlier," said Claudia
Smith, border project director for the California Rural Legal
Assistance Foundation in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, to commemorate the end of the fiscal year for
reporting statistics, Smith stood outside the Border Patrol's San
Diego office holding a giant sign listing the names of all who have
died since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   She said the statistics speak for themselves: Although
apprehensions are down 20% this year, deaths are only down 7%.</TE>
<TE>   "Operation Gatekeeper isn't keeping people out," said Olivia Ruiz,
a visiting researcher at UC San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican
Studies. "It's just moving people east."</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents blame human smugglers, called coyotes, for
the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   The agents portray the coyotes as vicious opportunists, out only
to make money from their human cargo, abandoning even children at the
first sign of trouble and lying to immigrants about the dangers of
the trek across the desert.</TE>
<TE>   "The Border Patrol did not move the migration patterns to these
corridors," said Villarreal, the Border Patrol spokesman. "The
smugglers did."</TE>
<TE>   Border Patrol agents in Arizona say they have noticed a puzzling
spike in deaths of women and children. In the Tucson sector, for
example, 31 of the 134 dead migrants were women, up from 18 in 2001
and four in 1999. Six children have died this year, up from zero last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Villarreal said his agency is doing everything it can to save
people. There are public service announcements in Mexico warning
people not to cross, and there is an entire unit--armed with cold
packs and electrolyte liquids--whose members are certified in
emergency medical and search-and-rescue techniques. This year, the
Border Patrol rescued 1,764 people who were near death, up from 1,234
last year, Villarreal said.</TE>
<TE>   But the risks and the horror stories seem to do little to deter
migrants who desperately need jobs in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   As dusk gathered Monday night, Ariel Martinez, a slight woman with
wide eyes and a ready smile, became one of the last migrants
apprehended in the last fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in jeans and a blue T-shirt, the 20-year-old from Oaxaca
paid her smuggler $1,200 to get her to Denver to join her brother.</TE>
<TE>   After being hoisted over the 15-foot fence separating Mexicali
from Calexico, on the U.S. side of the border, Martinez was free only
about 10 seconds before being caught by the Border Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, Martinez sat in a holding cell, awaiting
deportation along with five other women, all younger than 30,
apprehended separately. One had bloody scratches up and down her legs
where desert plants had raked her skin. Another had a cut on her arm
from a nick while jumping a fence.</TE>
<TE>   The women said they planned to try to cross again.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said she had never seen pictures of Denver, but she plans
to seek work providing cleaning services or taking care of children.</TE>
<TE>   Her younger brothers are relying on her, she said, for the money
she will be sending home.</TE>

<LD>A Bulgarian student who tried to board an airplane carrying two box
cutters and a pair of scissors was released after a diplomat vouched
for him.</LD>
<LD>   Nikolay V. Dzhonev, 21, was freed after signing a $100,000
personal recognizance bond. He was released to the custody of a
representative of the Bulgarian consulate in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Dzhonev was charged with attempting to board an aircraft with a
concealed weapon, a felony. Until the case is disposed of, he must
live at the consulate and travel no more than 30 miles away from it,
according to Greg Reinert, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREAT FALLS, Mont.</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors said Tuesday that they will drop murder and kidnapping
charges against a man accused of butchering a child and feeding him
to neighbors because the alleged victim's mother believes the boy is
alive.</LD>
<LD>   The stunning announcement came after Zachary Ramsay's mother,
Rachel Howard, said she was prepared to testify that she did not
believe Nathaniel Bar-Jonah had killed her son in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   "In light of Rachel Howard's testimony, I don't think there's any
way we could win this," prosecutor Brant Light said. He asked a judge
to throw out the charges ahead of a trial scheduled to begin next
week.</LD>
<TE>   Bar-Jonah, 45, already serving a 130-year sentence in Montana for
kidnapping and sexual assault in a separate case, was accused of
abducting 10-year-old Zachary as he walked to school. The boy's body
has never been found, and officials have said evidence suggests that
Bar-Jonah killed the boy and disposed of his body in meals served to
neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Searches of Bar-Jonah's house nearly three years ago turned up
lists of children's names, including Zachary's, and encrypted letters
in which Bar-Jonah wrote about such dishes as "little boy stew" and
"lunch is served on the patio with roasted child."</TE>
<TE>   But Howard said Tuesday that she believes her son is alive. In an
interview at her attorney's office, she said her belief is based on
several things, including a video she says shows her son at age 12.
She said police did not believe the boy in the video was her son.</TE>
<TE>   "I did not want Bar-Jonah to be convicted of a crime that I did
not believe he did," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Don Vernay said he was pleased with the
prosecutor's decision, adding that he was confident Bar-Jonah would
have been acquitted at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Bar-Jonah was convicted earlier this year of sexually assaulting a
14-year-old Great Falls boy and hanging the boy's 8-year-old cousin
from a kitchen ceiling. Those assaults occurred in 1998 and 1999.
Bar-Jonah has appealed the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Bar-Jonah spent 11 years in a Massachusetts mental hospital after
one attack in which officials said he tried to kill two boys. Before
that, he had forced an 8-year-old boy into his car and choked him
with his belt. Soon after his release, he assaulted another boy.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1991 plea deal with Massachusetts prosecutors, Bar-Jonah
was allowed to move to Montana with his mother. Montana officials
were outraged to learn of the deal after his arrest.</TE>

<HD>House Likely to Approve Speedy Elections in Event of
Calamity</HD>
<DH>Security: The plan urges states to revise laws to fill
seats in case of a massive attack on Capitol Hill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Doomsday scenarios in the nation's capital usually focus on
preservation of the presidential line of succession, but last year's
terrorist strikes forced lawmakers to come to grips with the real
possibility of an attack that could shut down or wipe out Congress.</LD>
<LD>   Many lawmakers believe that they dodged two bullets in 2001. On
Sept. 11, the hijacked airplane that crashed in rural Pennsylvania
was apparently bound for Washington and may well have been heading
for the Capitol--a highly exposed hilltop target.</LD>
<LD>   In October, an anthrax-by-mail attack shut down several
congressional office buildings, slowing much of the government's
legislative business as afflicted areas were quarantined and
lawmakers and their aides were tested for exposure to the deadly
biological agent.</LD>
<TE>   The events spurred Congress to tighten security on Capitol Hill
and draw up contingency plans for evacuations and secret emergency
meeting places.</TE>
<TE>   But lawmakers remain keenly aware of their own vulnerability and
that of the entire legislative branch of government. For example, a
nuclear, biological or chemical attack could kill or sicken hundreds
of elected officials, making a quorum in the 435-member House or
100-member Senate difficult or impossible to obtain.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is especially acute in the House. Under the
Constitution, no one may serve as a representative without winning a
popular election. Senate vacancies, by contrast, may be filled
temporarily by appointment.</TE>
<TE>   Today the House is expected to take a small but significant step
toward self-preservation in the event of catastrophe on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   A resolution sponsored by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach)
and Martin Frost (D-Texas), expected to win overwhelming approval,
urges states to revise their election laws to ensure speedy special
elections to fill House vacancies.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution, Cox said, "addresses a critical challenge the
nation would face if large numbers of representatives were killed in
a terrorist attack."</TE>
<TE>   The challenge, experts say, is that the House could be shuttered
indefinitely by a large-scale attack. If the House had only a few
surviving members, it is not clear whether the chamber could
officially convene. Special elections, the only remedy to fill
vacancies, can last several months.</TE>
<TE>   So for an extended time, Congress would be crippled, leaving no
legislative check on the president. Among other problems, Congress
could be unable to approve a successor to the vice president if that
office becomes vacant. It also could be unable to approve emergency
appropriations or declare war.</TE>
<TE>   Such crises are without precedent in the United States. But after
the Sept. 11 attacks, even darker days seem more conceivable. "It is
at just those moments that you require the full strength of our
checks and balances," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Laws on special elections vary widely. A Congressional Research
Service survey found that more than half of the 50 states lack
specific statutes concerning the timing of special elections. In
other states, laws do not call for rapid popular votes.</TE>
<TE>   California, for instance, requires its governor to call for a
special election within two weeks of a vacancy, but the election
typically takes place several months later.</TE>
<TE>   It took nearly six months after the death of Rep. Julian Dixon
(D-Los Angeles) in December 2000 before Diane Watson could be elected
and sworn in as his successor.</TE>
<TE>   Experts and lawmakers say much more work remains to shore up the
continuity of government. There is talk of amending the presidential
succession law to safeguard against power battles at a moment of
crisis and, possibly, to provide for a longer line of succession that
includes officials outside Washington. (Currently, the House speaker
is third in line, followed by the Senate president pro tempore, the
secretary of State and other Cabinet officers.)</TE>
<TE>   There is also talk of a constitutional amendment that would enable
a future House, devastated by calamity, to seat appointed members for
the first time in its history. That proposal, though, is
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brian Baird (D-Wash.), an early advocate of a constitutional
amendment to address House vacancies, said: "We still have a
responsibility as a Congress to explore ways to put the House back
together as a legislative body."</TE>
<TE>   Norman J. Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a Washington think
tank, said expediting special elections would fail to solve the
larger problem of how to keep government running when it is needed
most.</TE>
<TE>   Even if all states could be persuaded to hold special elections
within two months of vacancies, Ornstein said, "you'd still have a
60-day gap at the worst possible time, where you wouldn't have a
Congress functioning after a terrorist attack."</TE>

<HD>Chemical Warfare Gear Lost, Audit Finds</HD>
<DH>Military: Poor tracking raises fears that Pentagon is
putting troops' lives in peril.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon has lost track of up to 250,000 defective chemical
warfare suits, a congressional audit found Tuesday, prompting
concerns among lawmakers that the military was playing "Russian
roulette" with the lives of American soldiers who face the prospect
of chemical or biological warfare in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   A report by the General Accounting Office found that the Defense
Department has shown improvements since a spate of problems during
the Persian Gulf War in preparing for chemical and biological
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But the report said the military has persistent problems in
training and equipping soldiers and keeping track of equipment such
as the protective chemical suits.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the report concluded, the "risk for
protective-clothing shortages may increase dramatically from now
through at least 2007."</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials countered that many of the suits might have been
used and discarded. Even if the suits still exist, front-line
soldiers would be unlikely to wear them because most have been given
more modern suits.</TE>
<TE>   The report drew criticism from members of the House Government
Reform subcommittee at a hearing on national security, where it was
released. If the U.S. wages war on Iraq, said Rep. Christopher Shays
(R-Conn.), panel chairman, "it must be assumed those men and women
will face chemical and biological weapons," a situation that could
leave them playing "Russian roulette" with faulty suits.</TE>
<TE>   Some House members who have voiced opposition to attacking Iraq
questioned whether they should approve a resolution giving the Bush
administration authority to wage war against Iraq while such problems
persist. "I'm not going to support going blindly into warfare that
could result in great bodily harm to our fighting men and women,"
said Rep. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   The defective suits were among 800,000 recalled in 2000 after
investigators found that Istratex, a bankrupt New York company, had
delivered them with holes, poor stitching and other problems that
would allow chemical or biological agents to permeate them.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials have tracked down 550,000, but they haven't
found the rest. George Allen, head of the Defense Logistics Agency,
said he believed the defective suits had been used and discarded, but
their fate is unknown because of poor controls at military bases.</TE>
<TE>   When Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman (R-N.Y.) asked if that means some
military units have flawed suits, Allen said, "Sir, I cannot say for
certain if there is or is not."</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has an estimated 4.5 million protective suits on
hand. Of those, 1.5 million are new Joint Service Lightweight
Integrated Suit Technology models, which are given to soldiers most
likely to be among the front-line troops in Iraq or elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But the tracking system for them remains inadequate, the GAO
report found. At 293 sites visited by GAO investigators in the last
three years, local commanders' tracking systems for the new suits
ranged from computer spreadsheets to chalkboard listings to, in some
cases, no system at all. This follows a previous GAO report that
found tracking so ineffective that some units were buying $200
protective suits while others were selling them on eBay for $3
apiece.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 audit found that troops deployed early in the Gulf War
lacked required equipment such as protective clothing and
decontamination kits. Soldiers and Marines were inadequately trained
for chemical and biological warfare, and vaccine and immunization
stocks were inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Major improvements have been made in preparing soldiers since
then, Anna Johnson-Winegar, assistant Defense secretary for chemical
and biological defense, told the House panel.</TE>
<TE>   The report said that despite improvements, defense officials
lacked a coherent strategy to address low-level exposure to chemical
warfare agents.</TE>
<TE>   The new audit found ongoing shortages of some protective
equipment. One Air Force wing had only 25% of the masks deemed
necessary to treat contaminated patients and half the kits required
to decontaminate patients exposed to chemical or biological agents.
Many Army and Marine units were lacking in the required number of
chemical specialists.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. immigration and transportation officials testified Tuesday that
they could have helped apprehend two of the Sept. 11 hijackers if
intelligence agencies had shared key information collected before the
attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest hearing to highlight Sept. 11 failures, witnesses
from a range of federal and local government agencies said that they
were repeatedly left out of the intelligence loop before the attacks
and that such problems persist.</LD>
<LD>   At least two of the hijackers "should have been picked up in the
[airline] reservation process," but they were never entered into the
system because the CIA hadn't notified authorities that the two Al
Qaeda suspects had entered the U.S., said Claudio Manno, an assistant
undersecretary at the Transportation Security Administration.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, State Department and immigration officials said they
could have helped locate the two men, Nawaf Alhazmi and Khalid
Almihdhar, but weren't asked until shortly before the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, the FBI made a "routine" request for visa records that
implied no urgency to the matter, said Francis Taylor,
counterterrorism coordinator at the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   Had the FBI mentioned that the two men were wanted because of ties
to the terrorist network, he said, State Department and immigration
officials probably could have located them swiftly. "We have the
capacity to do that, we know how to do that, but we were not asked to
do that," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite stepped-up efforts at sharing information since Sept. 11,
the problems are far from being fixed, several witnesses said. When
the United States was put on alert last month for possible attacks
around the Sept. 11 anniversary, for example, top officials in
Baltimore received no independent notice from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned about the 'orange' alert the way everybody else in
America did, on television," said Edward Norris, police commissioner
in Baltimore. He also said that his department has asked repeatedly
for an FBI briefing on terrorism inquiries in Baltimore but that the
bureau has yet to respond.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's hearing was part of an ongoing investigation of Sept. 11
by the House and Senate Intelligence committees. Information sharing
has been identified as a chronic problem.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor Hill, staff director for the congressional inquiry, noted
Tuesday that more than 1,500 CIA reports containing terrorist names
were not provided to the State Department's watch-listing program
until after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the failures are technological, she said. The U.S. spends
about $50 billion a year on computer systems, but many are so
incompatible that information can't travel from one system to
another.</TE>
<TE>   There also are security issues: State and local officials often
lack clearances necessary to view sensitive intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   But often, Hill said, the more serious obstacles to information
sharing are "cultural, organizational [and] human."</TE>
<TE>   She singled out the FBI's handling of the so-called Phoenix memo,
in which an Arizona agent sounded unheeded alarms in the summer of
2001 about Middle Eastern men in U.S. flight schools.</TE>
<TE>   Had aviation officials learned of the memo before the attacks, "we
would have started to ask a lot more probing questions of the FBI,"
Manno said.</TE>
<TE>   Manno said the Federal Aviation Administration had sought during
the 1990s to call airlines' attention to growing terrorist threats,
even distributing a CD to industry officials mentioning "the
possibility of suicide attacks."</TE>
<TE>   But Manno had no explanation for why the FAA didn't push the
airline industry in the late 1990s to strengthen cockpit doors or
take other security measures even after the agency had become aware
of foiled plots to hijack planes and crash them into targets.</TE>
<TE>   In the rush to correct their information sharing practices,
intelligence agencies have released a flood of data in certain cases.</TE>
<TE>   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has added 14,000 names
to its terrorism watch list over the last year, many of them supplied
by the CIA after the agency changed its notification policy, said
Joseph R. Greene, assistant INS commissioner for investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Greene said the INS has conducted 6,500 joint interviews with the
FBI since the attacks, making 526 immigration violation arrests.</TE>

<HD>FBI Falls Short in Assessing Threats to U.S., Report Finds</HD>
<DH>Security: Bureau failed to follow through on its promise to
gauge terrorist risks, putting the nation in greater jeopardy, an
audit says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The FBI has never done a comprehensive written assessment of the
terrorist threats facing the United States, even though it promised
to do so in 1999 and suffered significant criticism for intelligence
failures before the Sept. 11 attacks, a Justice Department audit
released Tuesday said.</LD>
<LD>   The department's Office of the Inspector General, an independent
watchdog agency, was sharply critical of the FBI's counter-terrorism
program for what it described as a broad array of shortcomings.</LD>
<LD>   It found, for instance, that even though the FBI has undergone
wholesale restructuring since the attacks, including a massive
management shake-up, the bureau has not followed through on promises
made three years ago to create an overall assessment of terrorist
risks--including possible attacks with chemical and biological
materials or with other weapons of mass destruction.</LD>
<TE>   That failure, the report suggested, has put the U.S. at increased
risk of future terrorist attacks because the FBI--the lead U.S.
counter-terrorism agency--hasn't done enough to determine where
future attacks might originate and in what form. That is particularly
the case when it comes to the kinds of nonconventional terrorist
attacks that could cause mass casualties on a scale far greater than
the suicide hijackings a year ago, the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Although the FBI drafted a terrorist threat report after the Sept.
11 attacks that described terrorist organizations and state sponsors,
the document did not assess the likelihood of future attacks,
potential targets or possible methods that terrorists might use,
Inspector General Glenn A. Fine wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the FBI has not completed a systematic written assessment
of the most likely terrorism scenarios--taking into account terrorist
methods, capabilities and intent--it may not have fully identified
the specific nature of the threat so that it could focus its
attention and resources to prepare adequately and respond
effectively," the audit said.</TE>
<TE>   An FBI spokesman did not dispute the overall findings, and he
referred to the response of FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III and
other top officials, which was included in the audit.</TE>
<TE>   "The director welcomes the comments as being constructive," said
FBI spokesman Steven Berry.</TE>
<TE>   In the response, Mueller said the bureau has drafted a
comprehensive assessment that is under review by senior officials
within the FBI's counter-terrorism division.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller noted that he moved quickly after Sept. 11 to devote
significantly more resources to the counter-terrorism effort,
including appointing a senior deputy to oversee both intelligence and
counter-terrorism matters--just one of the bureau's recent
improvements as it moves from a reactive law-enforcement stance into
an intelligence-gathering agency that tracks terrorists and disrupts
them before they strike.</TE>
<TE>   But the inspector general's office said key problems remain.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, it questioned why a comprehensive audit hadn't been
completed when the FBI promised to do one in 1999 after a highly
critical audit of the bureau by the General Accounting Office.</TE>
<TE>   Bipartisan members of Congress reacted swiftly, calling for
increased oversight of the FBI, which has suffered a series of
embarrassments during recent congressional hearings into intelligence
failures before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "This glaring omission demonstrates clearly that better oversight
of the FBI is needed," said House Judiciary Committee Chairman F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.).</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) agreed. FBI headquarters
"handled the issues of foreign terrorism by the seat of their pants,
always looking backwards instead of seriously thinking about attacks
on our soil," he said. "At the same time, Congress kept pouring more
money into the FBI to use against terrorism and did little, if
anything, to make sure it was used in an effective way."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the audit remained classified and available only to
certain members of Congress and the Justice Department. A redacted
summary was made available to the public. Even the summary, however,
contained a litany of failures on the part of the FBI in assessing
the terrorist threat.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2001, the FBI said it was developing an assessment that
would address "emerging trends, the current threat, the projected
threat, FBI initiatives and future focus," based on ongoing bureau
investigations and information from other intelligence agencies. But
by September 2001, Justice Department auditors concluded that a draft
of the report failed to address the risk of an attack on the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, the terrorist threat project had such a low profile
within the FBI that it took the FBI nearly a month to identify to us
anyone who was familiar with the project and the draft report," the
inspector general said. Auditors ultimately concluded that no single
individual was accountable for managing the assessment.</TE>
<TE>   That draft copy, the inspector general said, had many omissions,
including an assessment of the training, skill level, resources,
sophistication, specific capabilities, intent, likelihood of attack
and potential targets of terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Further, the draft report does not discuss the methods that
terrorists might use," the report said. "For example, there is no
analysis of terrorists' progress toward developing or acquiring
chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons or any
discussion of what the FBI has learned from its past terrorist
investigations."</TE>
<TE>   Auditors suggested that little progress has been made on those
fronts since September 2001 and that the FBI has not established a
core training curriculum and proficiency standards for the hundreds
of agents it has deployed in the war on terrorism. But Dale Watson,
whom Mueller promoted to head all counter-terrorism and intelligence
operations, disputed some of those findings.</TE>
<TE>   Watson--who retired last month--told auditors that despite the
lack of a comprehensive report, he believed that he was "fully aware
of the threats, both before and after Sept. 11, 2001, based on the
breadth of the FBI's counter-terrorism cases and his frequent
discussions with FBI employees."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Blitzer, who headed the FBI's counter-terrorism unit until
1998, said in an interview Tuesday that the bureau spent significant
time and resources developing a strategy, even if it wasn't detailed
in one comprehensive report.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Pick Lautenberg to Replace Torricelli</HD>
<DH>Politics: N.J. party officials choose an ex-senator for
Senate race. State's top court will decide whether the action is
legal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>New Jersey Democrats chose former Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg as their
Senate candidate Tuesday, replacing Sen. Robert Torricelli, as the
prospect arose of an extended court battle that could leave control
of the U.S. Senate entangled in a legal morass reminiscent of the
2000 presidential race.</LD>
<LD>   The New Jersey Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments today on
whether Democrats can replace Torricelli, who abruptly withdrew from
the race Monday, on the Nov. 5 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Republicans quickly indicated that if the New Jersey court accepts
Democratic arguments that a replacement would not violate state law,
they would challenge the decision in federal court.</LD>
<TE>   "If they are somehow able to win in the New Jersey Supreme Court,
there will be federal avenues open to the New Jersey state Republican
Party," said Alex Vogel, general counsel for the National Republican
Senatorial Committee.</TE>
<TE>   That signal from the GOP raised the prospect that the New Jersey
Senate race could become enmeshed in the same sort of extended
litigation that delayed for weeks the declaration of a winner in
Florida in the 2000 presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   "We could well see a protracted endgame like we had in 2000 in
Florida, with control of the Senate at stake," said Ross Baker, a
political scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli withdrew from the race after his support, as measured
in polls, plummeted following the disclosure of new details about his
relationship with David Chang, a local businessman who says he
provided about $150,000 in gifts and cash to the senator. The
Republican nominee, businessman Doug Forrester, has made Torricelli's
ethics the centerpiece of his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   State Democratic leaders huddled Tuesday to find a new candidate,
even without knowing whether they could place his or her name on the
ballot, and Lautenberg emerged as the choice after a day filled with
mixed signals and confusion. "This was the best possible decision
arrived at in the most awkward possible way," said one top Democratic
operative.</TE>
<TE>   As the party was considering candidates, two of the top prospects
withdrew their names almost immediately. Former Sen. Bill Bradley,
who, in open disillusionment with the political process, declined to
run for reelection in 1996, told Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) that he wasn't interested, according to Democratic sources.
Rep. Robert Menendez, a Cuban American who represents a district in
Newark and Jersey City, also took himself out of the running, saying
he wanted to remain in the House.</TE>
<TE>   That left two prominent names: Lautenberg and Rep. Frank Pallone
Jr., who was first elected to Congress from central New Jersey in
1988. Neither appeared a perfect choice.</TE>
<TE>   Lautenberg, who did not seek reelection in 2000, was by far better
known than Pallone. But several factors seemed to initially steer
Democrats away from him.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Democrats said Lautenberg, though personally wealthy, had
told the party that he would be unable to commit significant amounts
of his own money to the race.</TE>
<TE>   Another complicating factor was the longtime feud between
Lautenberg and Torricelli. Some party insiders said they feared that
Torricelli would not transfer his remaining campaign funds--which
Democrats consider key to any competitive race--to the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee if Lautenberg was chosen. Torricelli is
believed to have more than $5 million in his campaign war chest.</TE>
<TE>   Lautenberg's age--78--also raised concerns. That pointed toward a
decision to select Pallone, despite some ambivalence among party
insiders. Pallone has a moderate-to-liberal voting record, in the
mainstream of the Democratic Party, but some party insiders believe
that he lacks the presence and charisma of a top-tier candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one senior Democrat said that Gov. James E. McGreevey
decided to offer Pallone the spot, and senior Democrats in Washington
signed off on the decision--until Pallone's wife objected. "He was
it; the governor wanted it; it was vetted and approved [in
Washington]. At the last minute, for family reasons, he pulled out,"
said the senior Democratic operative.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, the Democrats moved back toward Lautenberg. The
operative said negotiations would continue in the next few days, both
about how much money Lautenberg would contribute and whether
Torricelli would make his campaign funds available to the party to
help fund the race.</TE>
<TE>   These political maneuvers went on amid enormous uncertainty about
whether Democrats could place any new candidate's name on the
November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans say that New Jersey state law flatly prohibits the
replacement of any candidate's name on a ballot within 51 days of the
election. "We don't think there is the authority for putting anyone
on the ballot outside of this 51-day window," said Vogel. There are
34 days from today until election day.</TE>
<TE>   That question is now in the hands of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
Although former Republican Gov. Christie Whitman appointed six of the
court's seven members, it is generally considered a left-of-center
bench, in part because Whitman followed the state tradition of
balancing her appointments between Democrats and Republicans.
McGreevey recently named his first judge, which means that four of
the six justices are now Democrats, two are Republicans and one is an
independent, according to local observers.</TE>
<TE>   "Its historical reputation is as a progressive court," said Ron
Chen, associate dean for academic affairs at Rutgers Law School in
Newark. "They really have not been accused of being shy at all."</TE>
<TE>   That reputation leads some local observers, like Baker, to predict
that the court was likely to side with Democratic efforts to replace
Torricelli, arguing that would "provide the maximum amount of real
choice."</TE>
<TE>   But Vogel, the lawyer for the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, said that if the court allows the Democrats to name a new
candidate, Republicans would take the case to federal court. Among
the issues, he said, would be the fact that absentee ballots for
military personnel from the state have already been mailed. "Those
can't be changed; that's a federal issue," Vogel said.</TE>
<TE>   Alternately, a state court decision denying the Democratic request
to replace Torricelli could lead to new pressures on the senator to
resign his seat, many party insiders believe.</TE>
<TE>   Resignation would allow McGreevey to name a replacement and
announce a special election. Though one source said no one had yet
raised the possibility directly with Torricelli, Washington Democrats
were increasingly discussing that scenario Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   But that option raises other legal questions--particularly if
McGreevey sets the special election after Nov. 5 or even after
Torricelli's six-year term expires in early January, as some New
Jersey Democrats are suggesting.</TE>
<TE>   Vogel said Republicans would challenge in state and federal courts
any attempt to delay the election past Nov. 5, or use a resignation
as a means to remove Torricelli from the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Another longshot Democratic strategy might be what some call the
Carnahan option. In 2000, after Mel Carnahan, the Democratic Senate
nominee in Missouri, was killed in a plane crash, the Democratic
governor announced that he would appoint Carnahan's widow, Jean, to
fill the seat if Carnahan won the most votes in the November election
against Sen. John Ashcroft. The dead man did indeed receive more
votes and Jean Carnahan was named in his place; she is running for
the seat this fall against former Republican Rep. Jim Talent.</TE>
<TE>   The analogy would be that if courts rule that Torricelli must
remain on the ballot, the senator could declare that he would resign
if reelected and allow McGreevey to appoint a successor.</TE>
<TE>   But many say that approach would be much more difficult in New
Jersey than Missouri because voters would still have to cast a ballot
for Torricelli--whose crumbling support precipitated the entire
crisis.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Muslim Suspected of Al Qaeda Ties Denied Bail</HD>
<DH>Courts: Magistrate says James Ujaama, accused of supporting
terrorism, is seen as a flight risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A federal magistrate Tuesday ordered an American Muslim held without
bail on charges of trying to establish a terrorist training camp in
Oregon, saying it was the only way to ensure his appearance at trial.</LD>
<LD>   Magistrate John Weinberg added that the U.S. had presented
persuasive evidence that James Ujaama, who grew up in Seattle, had
been an advocate of terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Ujaama was arrested July 22 in Denver. He was held as a material
witness until Aug. 29, when a grand jury indicted him on one count of
conspiracy to provide material support and resources for the Al Qaeda
terrorist network, and another count of using, carrying, possessing
and discharging firearms during a crime.</LD>
<TE>   Although Ujaama's mother and aunt had offered to put up their
houses as collateral, that would not ensure that Ujaama would stay in
this country to face trial, Weinberg said. The trial is set for
November.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Ujaama, 36, tried to set up a terrorist training
camp in Bly, Ore., in 1999. He denies the charges.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Hamilton argued that Ujaama has become
a close associate of Abu Hamza al-Masri.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. froze Al-Masri's funds for his alleged membership in the
Islamic Army of Aden, the group that claimed responsibility for the
October 2000 bombing of the destroyer Cole in Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Masri provided Ujaama with a letter of introduction that
enabled him to attend a terrorist camp in Afghanistan, Hamilton said.</TE>

<HD>Race Riot Murder Trial Begins</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutors say the ex-mayor of York, Pa., as a
policeman urged gang members to carry guns, leading to the '69 death
of a black woman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Dredging up caustic memories of an unsolved killing and urban riots
that eroded race relations in this historic town, the city's former
mayor went on trial Tuesday for murder, accused of inciting "a
frenzy" that led to the 1969 ambush of a black woman by white street
gang members.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said former York mayor and police officer Charlie
Robertson provided ammunition and encouragement to gang members
accused of firing on Lillie Belle Allen, a South Carolina woman whose
slaying has stymied law enforcement officials for 33 years.</LD>
<LD>   "These defendants let slip the dogs of war," said York County
prosecutor Thomas H. Kelley, pointing at Robertson, 67, and his
fellow defendants, Robert Messer- smith and Gregory Neff.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors acknowledged that Robertson did not participate
directly in the slaying, but all three men are charged with first-
and second-degree murder and acting as accessories. Robertson is
accused of handing out bullets to gang members and inciting them to
kill by shouting racist slogans during an angry public rally.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys countered that dozens of young toughs known as
the "Newberry Street boys" mistakenly shot at a car driven by Allen's
aunt because York had been ravaged by five days of riots and
overwhelmed police had urged them to arm themselves. Robertson's
lawyer added that previous investigations of Allen's murder had never
cited his involvement and no evidence of it exists now.</TE>
<TE>   "Charlie Robertson isn't going to come out of this as a murderer,"
said attorney William C. Costopolous.</TE>
<TE>   In York, a central Pennsylvania town of 41,000 that once housed
the Continental Congress, the Allen trial has balkanized older white
and black residents unable to let go of old animosities and baffled
newcomers who are slowly altering the area's demographics.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, York's City Council approved a nonbinding
resolution urging the Justice Department to open a civil rights
investigation into the Police Department's handling of Allen's
slaying. The federal agency has repeatedly rejected a role in the
case, but York officials hoped the trial will finally prod its
involvement. The court proceedings are expected to last up to six
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still too much mistrust on both sides that can only be
dealt with by confronting this issue head-on," said Joseph R. Musso,
the council's vice president and a supporter of federal intervention.</TE>
<TE>   During opening arguments and the first day's testimony, lawyers
and witnesses portrayed a city simmering with racial hatred that
exploded on July 17, 1969, after a black youth burned in an accident
falsely accused white gang members of setting him afire.</TE>
<TE>   Residents who lived near the scene of Allen's slaying at a
railroad crossing on Newberry Street recalled defiant, gun-wielding
white youths standing on porches and hiding in railroad cars to
confront black intruders.</TE>
<TE>   Their attitude, said one witness, Steve Noonan, was " 'This is our
neighborhood and we're gonna protect it. We don't want blacks in
here.' It was kind of ugly."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's aunt, Hattie Dixon, who survived the shooting, choked back
tears as she was overwhelmed by vivid memories of panic and
confusion. Frozen in fear in the driver's seat, Dixon recalled seeing
Allen gunned down outside the car as the younger woman tried to take
the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so afraid. I felt like I was looking death in the face,"
Dixon said. She and other prosecution witnesses testified that the
shooting started even before Allen emerged from the car.</TE>
<TE>   But defense lawyers insisted that other witnesses saw gunfire
erupt only after Allen left the vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon and neighborhood residents also testified that a police
roadblock did nothing to stop her from driving through the white
enclave in a car with Allen and Dixon's husband and parents.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Allen, the others escaped unharmed by slumping down in
their seats. The car, a white Cadillac, was riddled with bullet holes
and dents, Dixon testified.</TE>
<TE>   Allen's killing was a tragic mistake, defense lawyers argued--set
off by the appearance of a similar white Cadillac hours earlier in
the area. A black man who drove the other Cadillac had threatened
Messersmith with violence if his parents were harmed--a vow that
spurred Messersmith, Neff and dozens of other youths to arm
themselves, lawyers said.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers signaled they would argue their clients had no
choice but to protect themselves with guns--a choice they said was
sanctioned under state law justifying the use of force by private
citizens in extreme situations.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of Newberry Street hoarded rifles, shotguns and pistols
the day after hundreds of whites gathered at a rally in a nearby
park. They came worried about worsening riots and angry about the
fatal shooting of a York police officer during the disturbance.</TE>
<TE>   During the outdoor meeting, Robertson and other York police
officers told the youths they were "outmanned and outgunned. 'You
have to protect yourselves. Go out and draw a line on Newberry
Street, that's the best you can do,' " said Peter Solymos, a lawyer
for Messersmith.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors charge that Robertson stepped over the line that
day in his capacity as a law enforcement official, shouting "white
power" and providing ammunition to at least one of the assailants.
According to Kelley, the killers "were present at [Newberry] Street,
whipped up in a frenzy by a number of police officers, including"
Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson has denied any culpability in Allen's death, but
conceded in earlier public statements that he had yelled "white
power" during the rally.</TE>
<TE>   After serving 29 years as a police officer, Robertson was elected
mayor in 1994, serving two terms and preparing to run a third time
this year when he was indicted after a three-year grand jury
investigation launched by the district attorney's office.</TE>

<HD>Risk of Breast and Uterine Cancers Deemed Higher for Calif.
Teachers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California teachers appear to have a 51% higher rate of breast cancer
and a 72% higher rate of uterine cancer than women in the general
population, according to a study by California scientists. The
teachers have lower rates of lung and cervical cancers.</LD>
<LD>   But the profession of teaching is very unlikely to be the cause,
said Dr. Ronald K. Ross, chair of preventive medicine at USC and one
of the study's researchers. Instead, the study--which has been
tracking the health of more than 133,000 female active or retired
public school teachers since 1995--revealed lifestyle factors that
could explain the bulk of the difference.</LD>
<LD>   Teachers were more likely to take hormones at menopause, less
likely to have children and started their families, on average,
several years later in life, according to the study, published in the
journal Cancer Causes &amp; Control. These factors are known to increase
the risk of breast and endometrial cancers because they increase
lifetime exposure to the hormone estrogen.</LD>
<TE>   Female teachers are also less likely to smoke, lowering their risk
of lung cancer, and more likely to have regular checkups, reducing
their risk of cervical cancer. The women had a 34% lower risk of lung
cancer and a 47% lower risk of cervical cancer, the study found.</TE>

<HD>More Freeway Lanes, Transit Spending Urged</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Auto Club calls for action to combat increasing
gridlock, and says transportation must become a priority with
policymakers in Southern California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Auto Club of Southern California has added its voice to the
public debate over the region's worsening traffic congestion by
issuing a plan that calls for increased spending on transportation,
the construction of more freeway lanes and routine evaluations of
existing transportation programs, among other ideas.</LD>
<LD>   The plan, which will be released today, is the first comprehensive
traffic blueprint issued by the 102-year-old organization and signals
a growing frustration among its 5 million members over the region's
increasing gridlock.</LD>
<LD>   "We are not prepared to tell our members that we are just going to
wait until traffic stops dead," said Auto Club President Thomas V.
McKernan Jr.</LD>
<TE>   Dating back to the 1930s, the Auto Club has endorsed
transportation initiatives, such as bond measures and ballot
proposals.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, the organization has limited its public
policy initiatives to promoting safe driving programs, such as
reducing teen drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last three years, McKernan said, Auto Club members have
urged the organization--through surveys and polls--to play a bigger
role in solving Southern California's worsening traffic problems.</TE>
<TE>   In response, a committee of the club's board of trustees drafted
the 48-page plan with the consultation of various academics and
transportation planners.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the recommendations are short on specifics and echo ideas
proposed by local public transportation agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Auto Club leaders say they hope the plan will spur Southern
California policymakers to put traffic on the top of their agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "California transportation needs champions--leaders who will
consistently and effectively seek and implement solutions," the plan
states.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation experts who have read advance copies of the plan
give it positive reviews, saying it proposes--for the most
part--common-sense ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are proposing is nothing radical," said Brian Taylor,
director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at UCLA. "Its
tone is moderate and promotes consensus-building."</TE>
<TE>   Taylor agreed that Southern California's worsening traffic
congestion should receive more attention from state lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Until a crisis occurs, there tends to be not much action," he
said. "Unfortunately that is the nature of politics."</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of the worsening conditions on Southern California
freeways is without dispute.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists in Los Angeles County spent an average of 136 hours on
gridlocked freeways in 2000, making it the most congested county in
the nation for the 15th year in a row, according to an annual study
by the Texas Transportation Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Based on current trends, average freeway speeds in Los Angeles
County are expected to drop to about 20 mph by 2025.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club's recommendations include:</TE>
<TE>   * Build more freeway lanes. The study notes that from 1967 to
1997, California's population increased 70%, the number of licensed
drivers jumped 91% and annual vehicle miles traveled shot up by 184%.
At the same time, roadway capacity--or miles of new lanes--increased
by only 29%, according to the report.</TE>
<TE>   The Auto Club study does not specify how many miles of roadway
should be built each year, but McKernan said additional lanes could
be built by widening or double-decking existing freeways.</TE>
<TE>   * Devote more money to transportation. The Auto Club supported
Proposition 42, an initiative adopted by voters in March that
permanently designates gasoline sales tax for transportation
projects.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to that funding, the plan suggests that the state
increase the use of bond money and general fund dollars to pay for
transportation improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The plan also recommends eliminating the two-thirds majority
needed to adopt or reenact a local transportation sales tax.</TE>
<TE>   "Putting more money into transportation is absolutely necessary,"
said Mark Pisano, executive director of the Southern California Assn.
of Governments, who has seen an advance copy of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   * Approve and fund public transit projects that give the greatest
benefits. Although the plan describes automobiles as the "backbone"
of Southern California's transportation system, it calls for
continued funding of cost-effective transit programs such as buses
and rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   McKernan said the Auto Club believes the traffic problem can be
fixed only with a combination of strategies, including cars, buses,
trains and bicycles.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe there is a magic bullet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Streamline the funding and construction process. The federal
environmental review required to build a major freeway project takes
an average of 5 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Prioritize potential transportation projects. The plan
recommends that transportation spending give priority to those
projects that move the most people efficiently. The plan also calls
for regular evaluations and audits to weed out those projects that
are not meeting their goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to support what is the best cost-efficient way to move
the most people," McKernan said.</TE>
<TE>   He complained about what he sees as a lack of leadership on the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   McKernan also noted that traffic is not the sole responsibility of
one elected official or one public agency.</TE>
<TE>   SCAG, the California Department of Transportation, Metropolitan
Transportation Authority and dozens of local agencies all take a
supporting role in managing and building Southern California's
transportation system.</TE>
<TE>   But Pisano said all of those agencies cooperate well together.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategies are integrated," he said. "We have a game plan."</TE>

<HD>Rain Forest Complex Is School for Preservation</HD>

<LD>Question: How do you avoid tripping if you have 200 legs?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The millipede has evolved a special gait, scuttling and
undulating to keep its legs in order.</LD>
<LD>   That was one fact children and adult visitors could learn Tuesday
at the grand opening of BioTrek--Cal Poly Pomona's new rain forest
simulation and learning center.</LD>
<TE>   But the purpose of the 3,500-square-foot facility, four years in
the making, is more ambitious than simply dispensing science trivia,
according to officials. The facility aims to present a comprehensive
picture of the world's rain forests and spread the message of
environmental preservation, locally and globally.</TE>
<TE>   "Universities should be [leaders in] addressing this very
important issue," said Bob Suzuki, president of Cal Poly Pomona,
during the unveiling ceremonies.</TE>
<TE>   The Rainbird BioTrek Project--which officials say is unique among
California State University campuses--has three components: the
Rainforest Learning Center, the Aquatic Biology Learning Center and
the Ethnobotany Learning Center, where people can learn about
California native vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a unique set of things," said Michael Brown, the facility's
curator. "We are looking at local stuff, tropic stuff, concerned
about both places."</TE>
<TE>   BioTrek is intended to educate not just collegians but also
elementary and high school students, politicians and community
members, and is expected to attract 10,000 visitors a year.</TE>
<TE>   For Rain Bird Corp.--the key funder of the nearly $1-million
project--the focus on the conservation of water was appealing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great example of how man and nature are supposed to
interface," said Arthur Ludwick, Rain Bird's senior vice president.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, as students from Kellogg Polytechnic Elementary School
in Pomona toured the humid rain forest simulator, graduate student
Jessica Schreiber explained that, for indigenous people in the South
American rain forest, the green iguana on display is a primary source
of food.</TE>
<TE>   And in the outdoor Ethnobotany Learning Center, visitors knelt to
look at plants such as the Mojave prickly poppy--a short and fuzzy
plant with beautiful white flowers with bright yellow centers.</TE>
<TE>   BioTrek aims to teach, among the deeper lessons, how humans can be
good stewards of rain forests, which hold 30% of the world's species,
Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, officials hope the facilities can educate
policymakers about how development can be harmful to the local
environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had mayors of cities, vice presidents of major
corporations," Brown said. "They're looking for knowledge as a
corporate, responsible person, or as a mayor of a city that has an
impact on the environment."</TE>

<LD>A U.S. District Court judge has set bail at $150,000 for a man
arrested at Los Angeles International Airport after the man allegedly
tried to pass through a security checkpoint with an 18-inch knife
hidden in a cane.</LD>
<LD>   Screeners who spotted the knife Monday on an X-ray screen at Tom
Bradley International Terminal contacted police, who opened the cane,
according to an affidavit by FBI Agent Laughn Rowe.</LD>
<LD>   Amir Farhang Motamedi, 71, of West Los Angeles claimed that he
bought the cane at a store in Chinatown and didn't know there was a
knife inside, the affidavit states. Motamedi had reservations on a
flight to Zurich, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   A preliminary hearing was set for Oct. 21.</TE>

<LD>Four San Fernando Valley telemarketers were sentenced to federal
prison terms ranging up to six years for bilking stock investors out
of more than $1 million, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Audrey C. Collins sentenced Anthony Durant,
43, of Canoga Park, to 70 months; Kirk Kuykendoll, 53, of Thousand
Oaks to 61 months; Henry Perrin, 60, of Van Nuys to 46 months; and
Sharman Walker, 49, of Canoga Park to 41 months in prison.</LD>
<LD>   The telemarketers worked for Assured International Inc. of
Woodland Hills, which held itself out as a manufacturer and
distributor of high-quality latex gloves and condoms that was about
to become a publicly traded company. The company's claims were bogus,
prosecutors said.</LD>

<HD>Pickers in Ventura Hope New Law Resolves Dispute</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: At the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm, held up as a
symbol of union battle, workers look to mandatory mediation for a
contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First the hard work, now the payoff.</LD>
<LD>   After months of lobbying lawmakers and marching in the streets,
workers at Southern California's largest mushroom farm said Tuesday
that they believe they may be among the first to benefit from a new
law aimed at resolving deadlocked labor disputes.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, signed Monday by Gov. Gray Davis, permits state
agricultural officials to impose mandatory mediation in cases in
which farm labor negotiations reach an impasse.</LD>
<TE>   That appears to be the case at the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in
Ventura, where workers have been without a contract since 1987 and
talks in recent years between the company and the United Farm Workers
have failed to progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been the symbol for the need for this kind of
legislation," said 43-year-old picker Jesus Torres, who has worked
more than half his life at the mushroom farm and has helped lead the
push for a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several months, Torres has joined other Pictsweet
workers on a mission to reshape the state's landmark farm labor law,
taking time off from his job in the plant's dank, dark growing houses
to testify before the Legislature and march on the Capitol in support
of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Now, armed with a powerful new negotiating tool, Torres said he
believes Pictsweet workers may finally have the leverage they need to
back up their demands for a pension plan, less costly medical
insurance and better wages and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked very hard to pass this law," Torres said. "We would
expect to be one of the first beneficiaries."</TE>
<TE>   A Pictsweet manager in Ventura refused to comment on the issue.
Other company representatives, in Tennessee and Los Angeles, could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Some farm industry leaders, who worked to defeat the measure and
believe the fight will continue in court, agree that Pictsweet could
be among the first targets of the new law, assuming it survives legal
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural
Assn., noted that union officials have long held up Pictsweet as a
symbol of the need for reform. "Without a doubt, I think Pictsweet is
going to be high on the UFW hit list," Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Roy and other farm industry attorneys say the fight is
not over. Growers are considering a court challenge, arguing that the
measure favors farm labor unions, destroys the collective bargaining
process and unfairly burdens farm owners with a remedy unavailable in
any other private industry.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, growers say the new law allows representatives of a
government agency--the state's Agricultural Labor Relations Board--to
impose terms of a labor contract, a constitutional violation. And, in
the case of Pictsweet, growers say the new law could result in a UFW
contract at a company at which a number of workers have sought to
decertify the union, saying it does not represent their interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the law, you could have a large segment of the work force
very dissatisfied with the contract and yet have the contract forced
on them," Roy said. "Once again, [the farm industry] gets something
stuffed down its throat."</TE>
<TE>   The UFW first won a contract at the Ventura mushroom farm in 1975,
in one of the first elections held under the Agricultural Labor
Relations Act, union officials said. The agreement paved the way for
the union to negotiate contracts with half a dozen other mushroom
growers in California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The union maintained contracts with a series of owners at the
Ventura plant over the years, but that ended when Tennessee-based
United Foods Inc. bought it in 1987. Since then, UFW officials say
they have tried a number of times to hammer out a new contract,
kicking the effort into high gear two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gathered outside the plant Tuesday, UFW supporters said they hoped
the new law would put an end to the stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very good what has happened because it has given us the
means to get a contract so we don't have to fight any longer," said
mushroom picker Manuel Solomon, 59, who spent his day off Monday in
Los Angeles with UFW co-founder and Vice President Dolores Huerta for
a vigil outside the governor's downtown office. "This is very
important to the advancement of all farm workers."</TE>

<LD>Need another reason to hate broccoli? Commuters in the Monterey Park
area found one Tuesday morning. A truck spill of the dreaded green
stuff on the Pomona Freeway severely hardened traffic arteries, even
though it didn't have any butter on it.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks for the warnings: Neil McCarthy of San Clemente contributed
a couple of scary-sounding items, a mat that may sweep you off your
feet and a shop that has a forceful way of dealing with fingernails
(see accompanying).</LD>
<LD>   Another sign of the economic downturn? Margaret Law of Alhambra
found an employment agency with a meaty claim (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   What's in a name: Any time I see a product or system with the word
"smart" in the title, I am skeptical--a view underscored by a
sighting by Jerry Gediman of Cambria (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   I see Reese Witherspoon in the movie version: The police log of
USC's Daily Trojan said that security officers "responded to a report
of two students involved in a verbal dispute" and "determined that
one of them accused the other of taking her sunglasses when they were
roommates the previous semester." The second student denied the
scandalous charge and both claimed to have a receipt for the shades.</TE>
<TE>   "The officers told the students that the matter would be referred
to Student Judicial Affairs and Community Standards and released
them," the Daily Trojan said.</TE>
<TE>   Surely some sort of joint custody arrangement can be worked out so
peace can be restored to the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Genius available: I didn't mention my recent exclusion from the
list of winners of the MacArthur Foundation's so-called genius grants
because I figured there had been a mix-up. But I've since reconciled
myself to the fact that I was snubbed--again.</TE>
<TE>   It's society that will suffer, though. I was going to unselfishly
use the grant money to explore such mysteries as:</TE>
<TE>   * Why are Bluebird school buses orange?</TE>
<TE>   * Why is there a Waterfront Cafe in Garden Grove?</TE>
<TE>   * Why does the Long Beach neighborhood of Naples have canals while
the original Naples does not?</TE>
<TE>   * Why does the average paint job at One Day Paint and Body take
three days?</TE>
<TE>   * Why is it you only need to be 50 years old, not retired, to join
the American Assn. of Retired Persons?</TE>
<TE>   * And why do airlines advertise nonstop flights from L.A. to
Honolulu?</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Norm Sklarewitz of West Hollywood saw, taped to a
light pole in Beverly Hills, a notice by someone trying to sell a
triplex house in West Hollywood, property on Mulholland Drive "ready
to build," a 65-foot yacht and a 1967 Rolls-Royce.</TE>
<TE>   Throw in a few paperback novels, an old computer and a used
baseball glove and you might have a pretty decent garage sale.</TE>

<DH>Sure, voting is good. But voting wisely is eminently
better.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 150 years ago, the writer James Fenimore Cooper put it this
way: "The man who can right himself by a vote will seldom resort to a
musket."</LD>
<LD>   Cooper found agreement on the point even with his old nemesis,
Mark Twain, who set aside humor to observe: "Where every man in a
state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible."</LD>
<LD>   Ah, voting. When you read through American civics, you find that
almost everybody who presumed to comment on our nation had something
celebratory to say about the franchise.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S., no one should forget, pioneered the idea of
self-governance on a grand scale by way of popular elections.</TE>
<TE>   Only elections aren't so popular anymore. In the 2002 primaries,
83% of eligible Americans exercised their rights as free citizens and
chose not to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Ennui in California rose to heights unseen in seven decades: 75%
of eligible voters decided not to bother.</TE>
<TE>   Or put it this way: Far more people stake their hopes on playing
the Lotto than on participating in democracy.</TE>
<TE>   We now bemoan the results: With the onset of autumn, the public
begins to lay eyes on the matchups of candidates chosen by tiny
fractions of their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Yikes.</TE>
<TE>   Our normal suspicions about those who seek political office turn
into outright alarm.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, fewer people muster the enthusiasm to drive down the
block and cast a vote in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   Two truths: I've never met anyone who would forfeit their right to
vote. Likewise, everyone knows that the U.S. would be a much
different country if everyone availed themselves of the opportunity
and actually cast an informed vote.</TE>
<TE>   So, do we have a crisis on our hands?</TE>
<TE>   Instinctively, we are conditioned to say yes. But I don't think
it's quite as simple as that.</TE>
<TE>   The hand-wringers have been telling us for decades now that
something must be way wrong in the land for participation to be so
low. Yet many nonvoters I know are not distraught, but content.</TE>
<TE>   We live in an age of decidedly centrist politics, driven in large
measure by personality. Most candidates are foursquare in favor of a
full-employment economy, equal opportunity, a healthy environment,
good schools and health care. Thus, political differences boil down
to the tactics and philosophy of governance--and for a good number of
people, it's enough to leave that choice to others.</TE>
<TE>   I keep telling myself, in the absence of a shred of supporting
evidence, that if Americans were half as disillusioned as the
worrywarts believe, candidates would materialize to offer sharper
choices, with the result that many more of us would be voting.</TE>
<TE>   There's another matter, usually too delicate to be discussed
directly. That's the distinction between voting and voting wisely.</TE>
<TE>   For as long as I've covered politics, I've listened to experts say
that we need to make registration and voting simpler, easier--as if
turnout is depressed by the difficulty of navigating bureaucratic
hurdles. In truth, registration has never been simpler in most
places, and it's getting more so all the time. Californians will
decide in November a ballot proposition to allow adults to register
and vote at the same time, joining six other states in trying to
appease those who put off everything to the last moment.</TE>
<TE>   The real difficulty in voting, however, isn't in the paltry
investment of energy it takes to mark a ballot or to register. It's
in the preparation. To cast an intelligent ballot requires more than
casual exposure to TV commercials.</TE>
<TE>   In recent decades, many Americans have lost faith in those who
offer considered election guidance, whether political parties,
newspaper editorials or interest groups. Thus the rise of the vaunted
"independent voter."</TE>
<TE>   Sounds lofty. But in truth, the homework necessary to inform
oneself about the issues and candidates in most elections is no less
than that faced in an upper-division college class.</TE>
<TE>   From what I can tell, many Americans aren't up to the task.
Reading through opinion surveys is always as amusing as it is
sobering. Almost half the nation believes that the communist creed
"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his
needs" is spelled out in U.S. Constitution. And though 66% of adults
can identify Regis Philbin as host of a TV game show, only 6% can
name Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) as speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   So, would our democracy be better served if more people voted?</TE>
<TE>   As I said, it's not as simple as answering yes.</TE>

<HD>Shards of a Shattered Mideast Cut Both Ways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAM E. FULLER</AU>
<BD>Graham E. Fuller is a former vice chairman of the
National Intelligence Council at the CIA.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>History will probably record that it was George W. Bush's
neoconservative, harshly unilateral style and blunt military means
that blasted open the logjam of the Middle Eastern status quo--a
status quo that is hard to defend by any measure.</LD>
<LD>   He may wield a far blunter instrument than is desirable for
engineering complex processes of political and social change, but
that's the way it's going to be. Bush's policies will be the most
catalytic force for change to hit the Middle East in many decades.</LD>
<LD>   There are numerous reasons for opposing his war against Iraq--the
U.S. economy, imperial overreach, damage to the international system
via his unilateralism with an attitude--but one of the least
compelling reasons is the fear that this military operation will
provoke instability across the region.</LD>
<TE>   Indeed, it will do just that. But instability may also be just
what the Middle East needs. "Stability" through despotism is
inherently unstable.</TE>
<TE>   And it is especially hard to argue that Saddam Hussein, the
greatest thug in modern Middle East history, should be spared in the
name of preserving this regional stability-by-force, even if his
threat is not imminent.</TE>
<TE>   The audacious neoconservatives in the Bush administration see the
fall of Hussein as the gateway to broad change, which they believe
will quickly favor American interests. They are right about the broad
regional change but wrong about what will serve their interests. This
military operation will unleash forces antipathetic to most American
interests, at least over the short term--just the contrary of what
Bush wants.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the irony is that this is just what the Middle East requires
to launch a process of attaining political maturity.</TE>
<TE>   Development of democratic forces in the Middle East has been
slighted by every single U.S. administration. We're not just talking
about some lovely liberal ideal here, because absence of democracy
has real consequences.</TE>
<TE>   It means bad governance, which spawns bad economies, bitter
frustration, hatred for the U.S. for its routine support of nearly
all dictatorships in the region in the name of "American
interests"--unless the ruler is audacious enough to buck the American
will. It means that most political parties are banned so that
Islamists, operating out of mosques, become the sole spokesmen for
change and the primary vehicle of opposition to these regimes. It
creates a sense of powerlessness on the part of the population that
leads to political fatalism and the tendency to blame all ills on
external forces. The people end up cheering for any strongman who
will stand up to the U.S. and oppose the status quo, men like Osama
bin Laden and Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself is poised to threaten that status quo. That is why
regional despots friendly and unfriendly to the U.S. are running
scared; they sense that what might be coming could be revolutionary
in its implications.</TE>
<TE>   They are right.</TE>
<TE>   Breaking political logjams is always dangerous, but so is
preserving them. We have coddled an unacceptable status quo in the
region for too long in the vain hope that it best serves U.S.
interests.</TE>
<TE>   Regrettably, it is political shock--wars, revolutions,
convulsions--that invariably precedes all reform and positive
political change in the world, including the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   New political orders will emerge, slowly or rapidly, that will
remove many kings, emirs and presidents-for-life, whether friend or
foe. If the moderate political forces of the region are skillful and
lucky, there will be a move in many states toward greater
democratization and public participation.</TE>
<TE>   Though democratization is vitally necessary to reforming the mess
of Middle East politics, the reality is that angry publics across the
Middle East will initially support anti-American leaders and policies
in the first few elections as they release pent-up hostility.
Islamists of all stripes, liberal or radical, are likely to be the
short-term beneficiaries.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't have to mean having the Taliban or Bin Ladens in
power, but few new leaders will have any great fondness for
Washington and its policies of the past decades. Even any gratitude
in a new Iraqi order will wear off quickly.</TE>
<TE>   And expressions of anger and acting-out by populations entering
into an adolescence of political experience will be the norm. We may
not get democracy everywhere as the next step, but change usually
does bring some kind of crude political progress and adjustment to
reality.</TE>
<TE>   It is ironic that the Bush administration, for whom international
stability and tough-minded rulers are the highest value, is now to be
the inadvertent instrument of the greatest change in the region in
decades. Change is good, but it is not what Bush is bargaining for.</TE>

<HD>White House Economic Policies Are Bankrupt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ</AU>
<BD>Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia
University, is a recipient of the 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in
economics. He was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under
President Clinton.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although the economy was slowing even before President Bush took
office, he has made the situation much worse than it had to be. What
could have been a mild and brief recession has instead turned into a
prolonged downturn likely to last more than two years.</LD>
<LD>   In terms of increases in unemployment and the gap between the
economy's actual and potential performance, the downturn is already
substantial.</LD>
<LD>   The president appears to believe that every economic problem is
spelled T-A-X.</LD>
<TE>   That misguided thinking has precluded him from adopting a sound
policy program.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of his economic agenda, the tax cut that he pushed
through Congress, was fiscally irresponsible.</TE>
<TE>   The administration also disingenuously disguised the true cost of
the tax cut, both by having it magically disappear in 2010 and by
using the little-known alternative minimum tax to reduce the recorded
revenue loss.</TE>
<TE>   The administration belatedly tried to sell the tax cut as a
short-term stimulus measure, but that is like arguing that a few new
Ferraris are the solution to a city's public transportation problems.
The cost-effectiveness is abysmally low.</TE>
<TE>   A much better alternative to the sports car approach to economic
stimulus would have provided assistance to states and localities to
meet the fiscal shortfall that inevitably develops as the economy
goes into a downturn.</TE>
<TE>   This assistance would have provided more generous unemployment
benefits to displaced workers, who will almost immediately spend the
money on goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, on the corporate scandals, the Bush administration
should have acted faster and more resolutely.</TE>
<TE>   The administration still has not advocated legislation forcing
companies to properly report stock options as expenses. The
indiscriminate awarding of such options has been shown to be an
important underlying source of the problems facing corporate America;
they provided strong incentives to report large profits, and top
executives did better for themselves by increasing these reported
profits than by improving the fundamentals of the corporation.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, I believed that the Clinton administration should have
supported such a reform in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, my argument was based on the theory that bad
information leads to bad decisions, with adverse consequences for the
economy. Now we have the evidence.</TE>
<TE>   And yet the Bush administration still refuses to take the action.</TE>
<TE>   Some of my other qualms about economic policy during the 1990s
apply with much more force now.</TE>
<TE>   For example, partly in an attempt to break the legislative
deadlock with the conservative Republicans who took over Congress in
1995, the Clinton administration allowed the deregulation agenda to
be pushed too far. But that does not mean Republican conservatives
should be allowed to push it still further.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, the administration has not owned up to the excesses of
the past--the mistakes, for instance, evidenced by electricity
deregulation in California and elsewhere--nor has it set forth a
program for dealing with the myriad scandals facing the financial
industry, from allocations of initial public offerings of stock to
distorted advice given by brokerage houses with clear conflicts of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   As we should have learned long ago, market-friendly government
regulation is necessary if markets are to work well.</TE>
<TE>   I wish that we had done more to address corporate welfare in the
1990s, but we didn't. Now Bush has made this situation much worse.
Indeed, corporate coddling has reached new heights with soaring
agriculture subsidies, most of which go to rich farmers and corporate
farms, and new steel tariffs, which have rightly exposed us around
the world to charges of hypocrisy.</TE>
<TE>   It's no secret that I am a tough grader on economic policy. The
Bush administration may want to pretend that its F is really an A.
But that won't change the reality.</TE>
<TE>   We'd all be better off if the administration would spend more time
rethinking its policies and less time muddling the debate with
doublespeak.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The industry titans and golf superstars at the Augusta National Golf
Club have lobbed a big one into the sand trap, all right.</LD>
<LD>   For 70 years, the Augusta National has been a world where men are
men and women are, well, guests. Since the 1930s, Augusta's famous
green jackets have rested only on broad, manly shoulders--every one
of them white until 1975 when Lee Elder became the first black person
to play the prestigious Masters Tournament the club hosts every
April. And not until 1990 did the club accept its first African
American member. But women, no matter what color, can still play the
Augusta course only if a member accompanies them, making the
celebrated Big Bertha club a more regular presence on the driving
range than any real live Berthas or Lindas or Susans.</LD>
<LD>   Now some women want in as equals, and this exclusive club that
likes to keep its business private, thank you, has been forced into a
nasty public battle.</LD>
<TE>   This dust-up started last spring after Lloyd Ward, one of the
club's few black members and an official with the United States
Olympic Committee, announced that it's high time the club admitted a
woman. Martha Burk, chairwoman of the National Council of Women's
Organizations, picked up Ward's suggestion, urging Augusta's
chairman, William "Hootie" Johnson, in a letter to add a woman to the
rolls before next year's Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson blasted back with a three-page declaration that Augusta
would not be bullied "at the point of a bayonet." When he learned
Burk then planned to pressure the three big corporate sponsors of the
Masters, Johnson announced that he would drop the sponsors and foot
the tournament without their $5 million in fees. Burk then turned to
CBS, but officials with the network, which has broadcast the Masters
since 1956, ducked the issue of discrimination altogether and
insisted they would still televise the tournament next spring. "To
not do so would be a disservice to the fans of this major
championship," wrote CBS Sports President Sean McManus.</TE>
<TE>   Burk is now making her case directly to some of the corporate
leaders among Augusta's members, trying to shame them. And club
members are beginning to talk quietly about opening Augusta to women,
if only to end the bad press.</TE>
<TE>   Legally, the Augusta National is entitled to reserve its acres of
manicured lawns and blooming azaleas just for men. And whether
wealthy, well-connected women are allowed to share tee times with
wealthy, well-connected men is not an issue that can rally the
defenders of the oppressed. But as Johnson and his pals are
discovering, what you resist persists, and Burk and the women behind
her are not going away. The more the men of Augusta National cling to
the rules of the past, the more they seem entrapped by them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has loathed Yasser Arafat for
decades, yet when the Palestinians finally seemed ready to
acknowledge the flaws of their discredited leader, Sharon managed to
transform him once more into a hero to his people.</LD>
<LD>   Israel, under intense U.S. pressure, ended its 10-day siege of
Arafat's Ramallah headquarters Sunday and out came the Palestinian
Authority chairman again, smiling and waving his V-for-victory sign.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush, who seldom directly criticizes Israel, said the
siege was paralyzing Palestinian moves toward reform, a goal of
Washington. It also was complicating efforts to get United Nations
support for an invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers had surrounded Arafat's compound after a suicide
bomber blew up another Israeli bus, killing seven people. The
soldiers bulldozed buildings they had spared in a siege months
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The bus attack was the first suicide bombing in six weeks, a
hiatus that let Israelis experience the security that should be
theirs and gave Palestinian opponents of Arafat a chance to move
toward a new political future in presidential and parliamentary
elections scheduled for January.</TE>
<TE>   Here's a taste of what Sharon's bullish tactics may have
squelched. After a tough speech by Bush in June that demanded
Arafat's replacement, the Palestinian leader set the election and
announced a new Cabinet with a few respected members but too many
others who were longtime cronies in his inept and corrupt government.
The Palestinian Legislative Council, the 86-member parliament,
denounced the Cabinet, which resigned.</TE>
<TE>   That was an encouraging development, rare in the Arab world. It
could have set the stage for new leaders to emerge, a younger
generation that would not miss every chance for peace with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Some influential Palestinians recently denounced suicide bombings
and said the attacks on Israel that began two years ago have been a
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   After Sharon's latest Ramallah siege, however, the moderates have
fallen silent and Arafat is the Palestinians' hero. He should be
paying Sharon for campaign advice.</TE>
<TE>   There may still be time to revive Palestinian moderates. Easing
Israel's strict curfews and removing some checkpoints in the West
Bank that stop Palestinians from easily traveling from one village to
another could be a start toward a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Such Israeli actions also would encourage political activity
before the elections and let Palestinians debate Arafat's flaws more
clearly.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat-the-hero is increasingly a creation of Sharon's
overreaction, which forces Palestinians to support the enemy of their
enemy.</TE>

<LD>More good news from the Middle East: Germany's public television
network ZDF reports there's not just one evil Saddam Hussein. There
may be at least three evil look-alikes, plus, of course, the evil
original. The look-alikes appear for security reasons or perhaps
because Saddam hates missing Angels games. ZDF experts studied 450
recent photos of Saddam, identifying doubles or triples only by tiny
details.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, ZDF said, the real Saddam hasn't been filmed since 1998.
The other guys are genuine phonies--the Saddam shooting his gun
straight up, the Saddam waving a bent arm at unseen crowds, the
Saddam standing stiffly in windowless rooms giving pathetic
handshakes to lackeys. No wonder he looks insincere; it's the 12th
take and he isn't paid that much. Some Saddams were surgically
adjusted, ZDF suggested, to more closely resemble the bad guy with
the bushy Hitler-like mustache and several mistresses but no gray
hair at age 65.</LD>
<LD>   Duplicate Saddams could complicate Bush's Iraq plans. Will we need
four regime changes with matching assassination teams? If one Saddam
gets nailed, will the others quickly shave and retire? Wouldn't it be
easier if the CIA hired its own Saddam? He could tell Larry King he's
joined Greenpeace and regrets almost everything--the wars, invasions,
oilfield fires, gassings, executions, missiles, everything except the
mistresses.</LD>
<TE>   This is priceless material for lovers of conspiracy novels by
Robert Ludlum, who reportedly died last year. And imagine doing
scheduling for four identical dictators--the days off, the big hats
and medals, the different salary withholdings, always having a Saddam
handy for rally-waving without another appearing simultaneously
across town at the tank races.</TE>
<TE>   Do several Saddams augur other human replicas? Only one Gray Davis
and Tony Blair, of course, but might there be two Gerhard
Schroeders--one pro- and one anti-U.S.? We've seen several Al Gores
speak, a couple of Tom Daschles and, judging by his pre-injury play
this fall, at least two Kurt Warners. Are rumors true that Mayor
James Hahn's disappearances involve training as a Jackie Mason
look-alike? Is the original 99-year-old Sen. Strom Thurmond retiring
this year or is that Strom Thurmond Version 9.9? Will Osama bin
Ladens pop up everywhere now, waving to crowds like all those circus
clowns emerging one after the other from the tiny car?</TE>
<TE>   Few recall that the mother of all celebrity look-alike businesses
is Elvis Presley. He tired of fame, trained countless clones in Las
Vegas and returned to Mississippi to drive trucks and sing in karaoke
bars. We all knew there were two President George Bushes. But there's
only one likely explanation for how George W. Bush could appear at so
many fall fund-raisers in two states on the very same day.</TE>

<LD>Oh my. Six days of sob stories, and all about Enrique, beginning with
"The Boy Left Behind" (Sept. 29). I hope somewhere there is an
objective assessment of the misdeeds and moral failures of a number
of parties: The mother who commences her relationship with our
country by breaking its laws but still finds time to shack up with
her new boyfriend and produce yet another child; the family members
in Central America who are so lacking in will that they can't stop a
child from walking out the door; the government in Honduras that
can't keep a child from walking across its borders; the government of
Mexico that is too busy talking us out of securing our own borders to
bother with its own ethical responsibilities; and the reporter
herself.</LD>
<LD>   This series belongs with some do-good section yet to be created.
It is not hard news, any more than a story about aliens waiting their
turn to emigrate, following the rules while standing in the rain in
Bucharest, would be hard news.</LD>
<LD>   L.A. Times, get a grip.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you, Sonia Nazario and The Times, for this deeply moving and
vividly told story. It comes at a time when I'm evaluating my
priorities and asking how I can give more of my life away, since I
have so very much when compared with so many others.</TE>

<TE>   After having read the first installment of this voluminous account
of a young Central American boy, Enrique, and his journey to reunite
with his mother, I have come to the conclusion that The Times is not
interested in fair and balanced reporting with regard to the
extremely complex issue of immigration. There is no doubt that
Enrique's journey is a heartbreaking example of broken families in
search of reunification. One cannot read the story without
appreciating the immense difficulty experienced by all of the players
in this drama. However, the story of immigrants in search of a better
life is played out daily by the media.</TE>
<TE>   My objection to this article is that it completely ignores the
other dimensions to vast amounts of illegal immigration. To what
extent should American taxpayers subsidize millions of foreign-born
people? Should we pay to feed, educate and provide health care for
anybody who wants to come to this country? With 8 million
foreign-born residents in California, does it make sense to add
another 10 million to 20 million over the next 20 years? What about
the effects of pollution, congestion and other quality-of-life
factors? Should we ask tough questions about crime? To spotlight this
issue in this manner, without addressing its public policy
consequences, is journalistically irresponsible. Why doesn't The
Times devote the same space and placement to the other side of the
argument?</TE>

<HD>What Is Bush Doing With His Talk of War?</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Neil Gabler's Sept. 29 Opinion piece, "Plotting a Story, Plotting a
War," successfully points out the difficulties the Bush
administration has had in defining our war on terrorism. By failing
to focus on the issues that are most immediate, President Bush has
lost much of the focus, cohesiveness and resolve this nation enjoyed
immediately after 9/11.</LD>
<LD>   It is sad to think that our politicians are transforming
themselves into those unimaginative entertainment executives we
constantly lament when they foist another cliched movie upon us. The
end result will be like a typical Hollywood production: a sequel no
one really asked for, often tarnishing our memories of the original.
I only hope that when dealing with the lives of our citizens, the
administration knows how to leave the audience satisfied.</LD>

<TE>   Even though America is steeped in uncertainty about terrorism and
the economy, and the majority of our people favor action against
Iraq, we are bound in limbo by powerful minority forces, to wit:
meddling news media opposing an attack on Iraq yet scrambling for war
scenarios they might cover; an indecisive, cowardly Congress with
rogue members playing footsie with Saddam Hussein; posturing
politicians throwing national security to the wind for political
gain; unconscionable countries such as France, Germany and Russia
posing as allies while turning their backs on us in favor of their
selfish interests with Iraq; and, of course, that impotent fraud
called the U.N. Meanwhile, we seem to be stalemated, waiting for that
infamous other shoe--loaded with who knows what--to drop.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel B. Jeffs</TE>
<TE>   Apple Valley</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Times and other newspapers have repeatedly stated that the
majority of Americans support a war with Iraq. My own informal polls
can't find one person who supports a war with Iraq. I am adamantly
opposed to a unilateral war with Iraq. Without the full backing of
the U.N. and the international community, we should not go to war.
That backing will only come if war is justified, which it is not.</TE>
<TE>   Even this talk of war is extremely damaging. You have to realize
the message this sends to other powerful nations: that unprovoked war
is OK.</TE>
<TE>   War with Iraq could irrevocably damage the status of the U.S. in
the international community and could give rise to terrorism that
would make the current climate seem like a cakewalk. We should try to
bring to light the real reasons that this has suddenly become such a
large issue. The cynic in me suspects that it is a purely political
ploy by Bush and his administration to get a few more Republican
senators elected this November.</TE>

<TE>   Those who are quick to condemn Bush for his threat of war with
Iraq, and who plead instead for inspections, should recognize that
there would be no offer of inspections but for his threat.</TE>

<TE>   Is it the Iraqi oil, revenge, diversion from our troubled economy
or the scandals surrounding corporate America that motivate Bush to
beat his war drums?</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnam War was a sham. The American people were deceived then
and, in my opinion, are being deceived now. My wife and I have four
sons, the youngest of whom is in the U.S. Air Force. Our children
must not be sacrificed by a government incapable of telling its
citizens the truth. The sad reality is, Hussein does not have a
monopoly on manipulation and deceit.</TE>

U.S.-imposed democratic Arab government to exist in its midst? Will
Saudi Arabia, Iran, Syria, Kuwait or Lebanon accept a free,

see it as an infection on the order of smallpox or any other weapon
of mass destruction?</TE>

<LD>As I read "Agents Seize Pot Harvest Near Ojai" (Sept. 26) I could not
help wondering how much it cost in tax dollars for the police to find
and destroy 7,000 cannabis plants. They referenced "months of
surveillance" and use of helicopters. I guess county and federal
agents have so much money and free time that they don't have to worry
that their officers are hiking in the woods and flying around in
helicopters instead of investigating murders, rapes and robberies.</LD>

<HD>Extend Wilshire Red Line</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kudos to the MTA board for keeping the hope of building a subway down
Wilshire Boulevard alive ("MTA Revives Subway Proposal," Sept. 27).
This Red Line extension will be necessary to provide fast access to
jobs, schools and points of interest, as the popular yet overcrowded
Metro Rapid buses on Wilshire Boulevard show.</LD>
<LD>   Wilshire Boulevard has the density, destinations, traffic and
large bus patronage to warrant a hefty investment. Granted, there's
still no local money for a subway, and there might not be any for
years to come, yet the study in question will determine if new
technology can help build this important subway in the future.</LD>
<LD>   Numan B. Parada</LD>
<TE>   Tujunga</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Your article discussed the on-again, off-again extension of the
Wilshire subway. Immediately, all of the old arguments will be
brought forth on why it shouldn't be done. Citizens should consider
the following points: The subway in London was built around 1864 and
it is still going strong. When you amortize the costs of the L.A.
subway over 200 years, the cost per mile takes on a better
perspective. Subways are not built for today's users but for the
users 20-plus years from now, when traffic will make today's gridlock
look like the good old days. Wilshire Boulevard has the heaviest
density of residences and jobs in the city, and the subway should go
right to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco, with fewer people, has the most amazing BART
system, and it continues to grow. Los Angeles needs a mixed bag of
transportation modes; buses are critical, but so are subways.</TE>
<TE>   Harold L. Katz</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The MTA's 7-4 vote to support subway construction has opened a
Pandora's box. This reckless about-face of the MTA's "no more
subways" policy ignores the vote of the people and the catastrophic
problems with the gold-plated, $5-billion, 17-mile subway. Washington
needs to know that Los Angeles County supports cost-effective,
above-ground rail projects to meet the transit needs of our 88 cities
and 134 incorporated communities. It is time for the MTA to learn
from history and not repeat the costly failures of the past.</TE>

<LD>Re "Fox Targets Graft in Mexico Oil Monopoly" and "Officers Charged
in Mexico's 'Dirty War,' " Sept. 28: Much praise should be given to
Mexican President Vicente Fox for the human rights investigations of
earlier presidencies--and also watch to see if those indicted serve
any prison time. Much praise for taking on the oil workers union and
the Pemex conglomerate: The oil is a national treasure, not the
private bank of Pemex and union officials.</LD>
<LD>   Also, much praise to Fox for his move from the national socialist
state, begun after the last revolution in the 1920s, to a democratic
capitalist system. Still open is the Mexican federal government's
ability to enforce free elections in all of its states, where the
Institutional Revolutionary Party is still destroying ballots that
reflect the people's desire for change.</LD>

our treating the homeless as children needing our protection by
prosecuting the filmmakers ("Fight Videos Spark Outcry, Charges,"
Sept. 29). Why is it permissible for persons to do disgusting things
on reality TV shows, but homeless persons are not being permitted to
earn extra money? We don't prevent non-homeless persons from
participating in martial arts, boxing, wrestling and kick-boxing. If
we are really concerned about the homeless, allow bum fighting but
require the filmmakers to pay a decent wage and cover medical costs.</LD>

<HD>Schillo Wants Builders to Pay for 101 Traffic</HD>
<DH>Transit: Supervisor calls on Ahmanson Ranch developer,
along with others, to fund freeway improvements to ease congestion.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County supervisor Tuesday called on Ahmanson Ranch
developer Washington Mutual to pay an additional $30.5 million to fix
congestion that the 3,050-home project would bring to the Ventura
Freeway--but only if other developers are required to do the same.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Frank Schillo said a new traffic study demanded by
opponents would likely confirm that the housing project near
Calabasas would cause new commuting headaches on the freeway. But a
traffic study done in 1992 already shows a significant effect,
Schillo said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an effort to say, 'Let's do something about the traffic
rather than calling for more studies,' " the Thousand Oaks supervisor
said.</LD>
<TE>   Schillo's proposal calls for the creation of a regional authority
made up of representatives from cities along the Ventura Freeway
corridor, including Los Angeles, Calabasas, Westlake, Thousand Oaks,
Camarillo, Oxnard and Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles and Ventura county governments would also have a say
on the political body. The authority would collect sizable fees from
developers with projects along the freeway and use the money to
address traffic congestion, the supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Though Washington Mutual's project has already been approved, and
thus the company would be exempt from any new fees, the developer has
indicated interest in voluntarily contributing money to the proposed
joint powers fund, Schillo said.</TE>
<TE>   The fee would be about $10,000 per home, or about $30.5 million in
the case of Ahmanson Ranch, the supervisor said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual would likely participate, but only if an
agreement that is "fair and equitable" can be struck, said spokesman
Tim McGarry.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry noted that several regional studies of traffic on the
Ventura Freeway are underway and that cost could be apportioned based
on their findings.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction to Schillo's proposal was mixed among the many public
officials, cities and environmental groups that have lined up to
oppose the project, which was approved in 1992 by Ventura County
supervisors. Tsilah Burman, executive director of Rally to Save
Ahmanson Ranch, called the plan a "smokescreen" by Schillo to deflect
criticism from residents of his Thousand Oaks district that he has
not pushed hard enough for an updated traffic study.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you know what needs to be done unless you do the traffic
study first?" Burman asked.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn, a project critic,
said traffic on the Ventura Freeway is only part of the equation.</TE>
<TE>   "Traffic on surface streets in the western San Fernando Valley is
just as important," said Matt Middlebrook. Calabasas Mayor Lesley
Devine called Schillo's proposal a "wonderful concept" that she is
interested in pursuing.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, however, she questioned both the timing of the
proposal and its practicality. Schillo's announcement comes a week
after Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer stated concerns about the project and
suggested that the state might bring a lawsuit to stop it, Devine
noted.</TE>
<TE>   The costs of freeway improvements are "staggering," she said,
posing the question of whether a regional authority would be able to
raise enough money to make a dent in easing traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the project has intensified as Ventura County
supervisors prepare to vote on the adequacy of a follow-up
environmental study. It was ordered by supervisors after biologists
found an endangered frog and flower species on the ranchlands.</TE>
<TE>   The county Environmental Report Review Committee will vote to
approve or reject the study on Oct. 9. It then goes to the Planning
Commission, then the Board of Supervisors for a final vote.</TE>

<HD>Whitney Blake, 76; Star of 1960s' 'Hazel' Helped Create
'One Day at a Time'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whitney Blake, the versatile actress who portrayed comedian Shirley
Booth's housewife-employer in the long-running television series
"Hazel" and co-created the edgier sitcom "One Day at a Time," has
died. She was 76.</LD>
<LD>   Blake died Saturday at her home in Edgartown, Mass., after a long
illness, attended by her family and the Hospice of Martha's Vineyard,
said her husband, writer-producer Allan Manings.</LD>
<LD>   The actress, who also maintained a home in Malibu, portrayed
Dorothy Baxter, wife to Don DeFore's George Baxter, from 1961 to 1965
on "Hazel," a series modeled on the maid of Ted Key's Saturday
Evening Post cartoons.</LD>
<TE>   The show, in which Booth actually ran the household rather than
Blake, was so popular, Blake told The Times in 1963, because "we make
people happy."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't deal with deep problems," she said. "We have happy
problems. People tell me it's refreshing to see our show, that they
never miss it because they feel good afterward."</TE>
<TE>   But the sitcom carrying Blake's credit as co-creator a decade
later did deal with deeper problems and broke new ground by making a
divorced single mother, played by Bonnie Franklin, the head of the
household. "One Day at a Time," set in an Indianapolis apartment
house with Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli as the teenage
daughters, aired from 1975 to 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, who co-created the show with her husband for his boss,
Norman Lear, was determined to depict a single-mother household
because of her own family experiences. She had been raised by her
divorced mother, and she was a divorced mother before marrying
Manings, bringing up three children: sons Richard and Brian, and her
daughter, actress Meredith Baxter. Her daughter had also been a
single mother. All the involved children, Blake told The Times in
1975, "turned out fine, but there were terrible things that happened
along the way."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Eagle Rock and educated at Pasadena City College, Blake
began acting at the Pasadena Playhouse and returned there as
frequently as possible, playing everything from Shakespeare to
musicals.</TE>
<TE>   The stage may have been her preferred medium, but she became far
better known during the Golden Age of television on dramatic
anthology series such as "Playhouse 90" and the "Zane Grey Theater"
and in early episodes of "Maverick" and "Bonanza." She was in the
first episode of "Perry Mason" in 1957, as Evelyn Bagby in "The Case
of the Restless Redhead."</TE>
<TE>   On the large screen, Blake appeared in the movie adaptation of the
Mickey Spillane novel "My Gun Is Quick" in 1957; was Jack Webb's wife
in the 1959 newspaper film "-30-"; and two decades later appeared
with Laurence Olivier, Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones in Harold
Robbins' "The Betsy."</TE>
<TE>   Blake, who was also an activist for civil rights, co-hosted her
own local KCBS-TV Channel 2 daytime show "Boutique" in the late
1960s, interviewing guests and offering opinions about fashion, books
and home decor.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Blake tried another venue, producing and directing
her own low-budget documentary: "Reno's Kids: 87 Days Plus 11." She
said she was inspired to make the film after she read a Los Angeles
Times article about Daly City teacher Reno Taini and his Wilderness
Class for troubled teenagers, including drug addicts and delinquents.</TE>
<TE>   It was the teacher, who was selected as California Teacher of the
Year for 1982, not the teenagers, who intrigued her, Blake said.</TE>
<TE>   "He creates in people the will and the tools to survive," she told
The Times in 1988 after following Taini scaling desert rocks and
walking a tightrope between trees. "My experience was, 'I can do
anything after this.' "</TE>
<TE>   The movie opened to good reviews and honors from the International
CINE Council and the Chicago International Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about her cinema verite style, she said, "I was trying to
edit real life into a form of theater."</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband, three children, nine grandchildren
and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be made to Planned
Parenthood.</TE>

<HD>Attack at 75 MPH Was a Driver's Worst Nightmare</HD>
<DH>Violence: U.S. vows to increase security after bus crash
that killed two passengers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX and RICARDO ALONSO- ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SAN JOAQUIN, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It was a bus driver's impossible choice.</LD>
<LD>   His backside was facing scores of passengers--none of whom passed
through security screening--and his eyes were fixed on the long, dark
road ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, traveling 75 mph, he felt a sharp blade at his throat.
If his impulse was to let go of the steering wheel and fight, bus
driver Abel Hernandez almost certainly knew it would mean crashing
the bus and killing passengers.</LD>
<TE>   That was the predicament Monday night on a stretch of Interstate 5
that cleaves the cotton fields of the San Joaquin Valley--moments
before an accident that killed two people, injured more than two
dozen others and left three hospitalized Tuesday in fair condition.</TE>
<TE>   The carnage and the obvious vulnerability of thousands of drivers
to such attacks were enough to prompt federal Transportation Security
Administration officials to pledge Tuesday to speed up plans for
improved safeguards on buses and trains nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   A Greyhound spokesman said the Monday night accident might have
been prevented if the government had done more to help improve bus
security.</TE>
<TE>   Until moments before the attack, all appeared normal on Greyhound
Bus No. 7418, tooling along the flat agricultural expanse of Fresno
County, halfway on its trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco.
Forty-five passengers from as far as Brazil and Israel were aboard,
half of them dozing and half finishing fast food from a pit stop 35
miles down the road.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after 8:30 p.m., a passenger described by authorities as a
deranged drifter from Los Angeles who had made repeated visits to the
bathroom bounded to the front of the bus.</TE>
<TE>   No one apparently saw that 27-year-old Arturo Tapia Martinez was
clutching a pair of scissors. The next thing passengers heard was bus
driver Hernandez, 50, of Pomona, shouting "Hey! Hey! Hey!" as he
tried to fight off Martinez and still maneuver the 36,000-pound
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The struggle didn't last long, authorities said, just long enough
for Hernandez to have his throat slit and his bus roar off the
freeway and flip over on its side into a cotton field.</TE>
<TE>   Two unidentified adult female passengers died at the side of the
road near Coalinga. Helicopters transported the more seriously
injured to hospitals. Two dozen passengers were treated for minor
injuries and released. Three others, including Hernandez, remain
hospitalized Tuesday in fair condition.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez, a Mexican national who carried no identification, tried
to escape, but passengers pointed him out to authorities and he was
caught a short distance away. Late Tuesday, he remained in Fresno
County Jail under a suicide watch.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say he told them numerous stories about why he did it,
but none of them makes much sense. They are looking into the possible
role of drugs, alcohol or mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   "There doesn't seem to be a motive," Sgt. Jay Stuart said. "It's
likely he was just a goofball."</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Saravia, who was heading to Oakland to visit his sister,
told reporters that he was falling asleep when the attack broke out.
"The people in front ... tried to stop the guy but he already had the
driver. Everything happened in seconds. The bus started tumbling and
went off the road and started flipping."</TE>
<TE>   One female passenger, who spoke on condition of anonymity because
she was cutting university classes, said it was her post-Sept. 11
fears that caused her to take the bus instead of fly.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple went through the windshield. Somehow I ended up on my
feet, standing one foot on the window and one on an overhead rack,"
she said. "People were falling onto people. You had to walk over
people to get out."</TE>
<TE>   The west side of Fresno County, a swath of cotton and vegetable
land that extends mile upon mile with scarcely a tree, is one of the
loneliest stretches of California. The last time authorities can
recall anything noteworthy happening there was a few years back when
actress Anne Heche was found wandering nearly naked in a cotton
field, muttering that she was catching a spaceship to heaven.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 passengers who walked away without injuries were taken to
a community center in the tiny farm town of San Joaquin and
interviewed by sheriff's investigators until 3 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   One young woman with purple hair and nose rings hugged and kissed
her boyfriend, who had driven 200 miles from Santa Rosa to pick her
up. The others, dog tired, boarded two Greyhound buses in the chilly
early morning air. They were headed to the Bay Area, to the places
where they were supposed to arrive five hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The replacement Greyhound driver, who did not give his name, said
the attack was a bus driver's worst dream come true.</TE>
<TE>   "You think about it all the time," he said. "There's nothing
protecting your back."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Greyhound has hired more security guards and
added cameras to its 111 terminals. The guards use hand-held metal
detectors to scan about one in five randomly chosen buses at 30
locations nationwide, including Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco-bound bus was not selected for security
screening, said Lynn Brown, a spokeswoman for Greyhound.</TE>
<TE>   Among the security improvements the industry is lobbying for are
increased weapons screening of passengers, improved emergency
communications systems for buses and better protection for drivers.
"No decisions have been made," said David Steigman of the
Transportation Security Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Federal funding for surface transportation security is $15
million--a tiny proportion of the more than $6 billion being spent
mainly on aviation.</TE>
<TE>   "Had we the funding to improve our security ... perhaps this
incident could have been prevented," said Brown, the Greyhound
spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Despite increased security spending by the company--including the
distribution of cellular phones programmed for 911 calls--the
driver's seats still have no shield, and drivers are as vulnerable as
ever as they ferry 25 million passengers a year.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a bus manufactured in the U.S. with an enclosed area
for the driver," said Jamille Bradfield, another representative for
Greyhound. "Incidents like this are extremely rare. Bus travels
remains the safest mode of transportation from city to city."</TE>

<LD>The Irvine school board ended a ban on student use of cell phones and
pagers with a unanimous 5-0 vote Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last month allowing districts
to permit the use of "electronic signaling devices," banned since
1988 after fears that students would use them to make drug deals.</LD>
<LD>   Cell phones are now seen as essential during emergencies--such as
the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and Santee, Calif.--because
they enable students to contact parents and officials.</LD>
<TE>   Irvine Unified's policy allows students to use cell phones, pagers
and two-way radios during lunch and extracurricular activities, and
in an emergency or in any circumstance under which a doctor
determines the device is essential to the student's health. The
devices would be turned off at other times.</TE>

<HD>Woman Found Guilty in Beating Death of Niece, 4</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three hours of deliberations, a Van Nuys jury convicted a North
Hollywood woman Tuesday of fatally beating her 4-year-old niece.</LD>
<LD>   The jury found Arcelia Chavez, 48, guilty of the second-degree
murder of Maria Isabel Cervantes and of assaulting a child younger
than 8, resulting in death.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Leland B. Harris is to
sentence Chavez on Oct. 10. The first-time offender faces 25 years to
life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez, the single mother of five children, gained custody of
Maria Isabel after the girl's mother was killed in a gang shooting in
November 2000. The child's father abandoned the family before she was
born.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Maureen Green said Chavez began hitting Maria
Isabel on Sept. 27, 2001, after the child spit out food. The beating
continued in the bathtub, where Chavez delivered what Green described
as "karate-like chops" to Maria Isabel.</TE>
<TE>   After the beating, Chavez built an altar in her bedroom, lighted
candles, dressed the girl in a white dress and stockings and prayed,
Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities testified that Maria Isabel died sometime before
midnight.</TE>

<HD>Aunt Is Guilty in Girl's Killing</HD>
<DH>Verdict: A jury convicts a North Hollywood woman of
second-degree murder for beating to death her niece after the
4-year-old spit out food.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three hours of deliberations, a Van Nuys jury convicted a North
Hollywood woman Tuesday of fatally beating her 4-year-old niece.</LD>
<LD>   The jury found Arcelia Chavez, 48, guilty of the second-degree
murder of Maria Isabel Cervantes and of assaulting a child younger
than 8, resulting in death.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Leland B. Harris is to
sentence Chavez on Oct. 10. The first-time offender faces 25 years to
life in prison.</LD>
<TE>   Chavez, the single mother of five children, gained custody of
Maria Isabel after the girl's mother was killed in a gang shooting in
November 2000. The child's father abandoned the family before she was
born.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Maureen Green said Chavez began hitting Maria
Isabel on Sept. 27, 2001, after the child spit out food. The beating
continued in the bathtub, where Chavez delivered what Green described
as "karate-like chops" to Maria Isabel's small body, causing the
child to repeatedly hit her head on the bathtub.</TE>
<TE>   After the beating, Chavez built an altar in her bedroom, lighted
candles, dressed the girl in a white dress and stockings and prayed,
Green said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities testified that Maria Isabel died sometime before
midnight.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Chavez's daughter discovered her mother with the
dead child in a bedroom and urged her to call authorities.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez later carried Maria Isabel's body, still in the white dress
and wrapped in a pink blanket, into the North Hollywood police
station.</TE>
<TE>   According to testimony, she told deputies that the girl had
drowned in the bathtub. An autopsy, however, showed that Maria Isabel
died of blunt-force trauma.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't have to die," Green said in her closing argument. The
girl could have survived the injuries if she had received immediate
medical attention.</TE>
<TE>   According to Chavez's early statements to police, she said she
never wanted the child.</TE>
<TE>   "I would prefer that the little girl be with her grandmother
because she had two little brothers in Mexico," Chavez told
authorities. "I don't know why she was left with me."</TE>
<TE>   In Chavez's defense, attorney Dennis G. Cohen said he tried to
show jurors "a woman who just totally lost it that day."</TE>
<TE>   Describing his client as a peaceful woman who just snapped, he
asked the jury to sentence Chavez to the lesser crime of
manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is the ultimate tragedy," Cohen said. "It's one
family."</TE>

<HD>Lopez Bid for Chief Gets Boost</HD>
<DH>Police: Some on council cite his years of LAPD experience
in urging Hahn to appoint him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Searching for a role in the selection of the next Los Angeles Police
Department chief, members of the City Council have begun lobbying
Mayor James K. Hahn behind the scenes in favor of Oxnard Police Chief
Art Lopez, the only one of three finalists for the job who has worked
in the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Council members said in interviews that--led by Councilman Nick
Pacheco, a longtime supporter of Lopez from his days with the
LAPD--they are seeking appointment of the San Fernando Valley
resident because he is familiar with Los Angeles and the department.
They also argue that it is time the city had a Latino police chief.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn is consulting with council members and other city leaders
regarding the appointment, which he terms the most important he has
faced since becoming mayor. Also under consideration are former New
York City Police Commissioner William Bratton and former Philadelphia
Police Commissioner John Timoney.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor is expected to announce his decision in the coming days,
and though his nominee needs council confirmation, aides to the mayor
say his choice will not be principally influenced by trying to please
the council.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Pacheco, those voicing support for Lopez are other
members of the council's so-called Latino Coalition: Council
President Alex Padilla and Councilmen Ed Reyes and Eric Garcetti.</TE>
<TE>   Other city lawmakers who favor Lopez include Councilmen Dennis
Zine and Nate Holden. Pacheco said that he hopes at least eight
council members, a majority, will come out in support of Lopez, but
that ultimately he expects the council to ratify Hahn's
selection--Lopez or not.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone agrees that the three candidates are qualified," Pacheco
said. "Personally, I think Art Lopez is someone who can unite the
city."</TE>
<TE>   Lopez, 52, spent 27 years in the LAPD before being named head of
the Oxnard Police Department in 1998. Unlike Bratton and Timoney,
Lopez has met most of the council members. He was also a strong
supporter of Antonio Villaraigosa during the most recent mayoral
race.</TE>
<TE>   "When you work with someone--and I did, about eight or 10 years
ago--you understand the notion of experience and capabilities," Reyes
said of Lopez. That interaction occurred when Reyes was chief of
staff to former Councilman Mike Hernandez. Lopez "has experience of
being in the trenches with us."</TE>
<TE>   Zine, a veteran of the LAPD who represents parts of the west San
Fernando Valley, said he spoke to Hahn soon after the Police
Commission named its three finalists for the chief's job. In that
conversation, Zine said, he did not push for a specific candidate but
urged Hahn to choose a chief who could reduce crime and raise police
morale.</TE>
<TE>   Zine added that he considered Lopez's knowledge of the Police
Department superior to that of the other contenders and believes that
Lopez is "very professional. He's a listener. He's not afraid to
change his mind. He's not inflexible."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton has worked with the LAPD as a consultant in implementing
the conditions of a federal consent decree, but Zine said that would
give him "limited knowledge" of the local department. Timoney--whom
the councilman first called "Tomey" in an interview Monday--struck
Zine as the least conversant with LAPD issues.</TE>
<TE>   The chief wields "a big hammer" in disciplining officers, and Zine
criticized the discipline system under former Chief Bernard C. Parks
as "arbitrary and capricious." Officers became paranoid that they
would be disciplined, so they were less aggressive in combating
crime, the councilman said.</TE>
<TE>   Zine said he hopes that, whoever the next chief is, that person
will take a less severe attitude toward discipline and will find ways
to better navigate the city's politics. "Clearly, we cannot have
another five years of turmoil," he said. "We can't have a [different]
chief of police every five years. We need consistency."</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti said he is supporting Lopez because Lopez would "hit the
ground running."</TE>
<TE>   But Garcetti said he is being careful not to pressure Hahn.
"People realize if they put too much pressure on this mayor, he might
go the opposite way," Garcetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Council members Cindy Miscikowski, Hal Bernson and Wendy Greuel,
meanwhile, have declined to pick a favorite.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the council's 15 members, Janice Hahn has the easiest
access to the mayor, who is her brother and with whom she speaks
nearly every day.</TE>
<TE>   "He hasn't tipped his hand yet--even to me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Hahn, who represents San Pedro and the rest of the harbor
area, said she has not ventured an opinion about which candidate is
best suited for the job, though she downplayed the need for a chief
with experience in the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's less important that this next chief of police knows
all of the streets in Los Angeles than whether or not he knows how to
turn a department around and make Los Angeles the safest big city in
America," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Tom LaBonge said he'll leave it to the mayor to pick
the next chief but hopes that in addition to combating violent crime,
the LAPD's leader will have "a passion" for traffic safety.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll support Chief Bratton, Chief Timoney and Chief
Lopez--whoever the mayor wants," said LaBonge, who represents North
Hollywood, parts of Hollywood, Los Feliz and Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   He joined with Janice Hahn in contending that a candidate from
outside the LAPD could still do the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I love people from Los Angeles, but I'm not afraid of people"
from other cities, he said. "It's not just about being able to
pronounce 'Pico' and 'Sepulveda,' but also to be able to serve
everybody who is on Pico Boulevard or on Sepulveda, and all people
thereafter, on all streets."</TE>

<HD>Making Quite a Production of Campus News</HD>
<DH>Chatsworth High School has a weekly broadcast and three
years of video classes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE MATHEWS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Quiet on the set!" bellows floor manager Christopher Sledge.</LD>
<LD>   "Roll tape!" says the director, Will Pate.</LD>
<LD>   The well-groomed morning news anchors, My Nguyen and Erika
Armenta, shuffle papers and look into their cameras. They are
interrupted only by their producer in a corner of the studio.</LD>
<TE>   "Homeroom students! Homeroom students! Settle down," says David
Massey. "Let's take roll--quickly!"</TE>
<TE>   Why, two minutes before a live broadcast, is the producer taking
attendance? Because he is a full- time teacher in the Los Angeles
Unified School District. The studio is a classroom with the desks
cleared away. The anchors are teenage students, and the viewing
audience is limited to Chatsworth High School.</TE>
<TE>   "CHS News" is a weekly broadcast of campus announcements, launched
last winter by students in Massey's advanced video class to take
advantage of a closed-circuit television system being installed at
the high school. The class chose Wednesday mornings during homeroom,
when there is no competition. Traditional public announcements over
the loudspeakers are left to Tuesdays and Thursdays.</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast begins after the 8:45 a.m. bell and lasts no more
than 10 minutes. It is a mix of club announcements, appeals from the
yearbook staff--"get your baby pictures in!"--and brief news items on
coming games and events. But the look of the student-run show is
professional. There is a musical lead-in, snazzy graphics show the
announcers' names and a three-camera set-up allows for the tight
close-ups and switching familiar to local news devotees. Students run
it all--they are the on-air talent, the camera operators and the
technicians in the booth. Massey, as the school's video instructor,
supervises.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of the campus' 3,271 students can see the broadcast. The
students who put it on say the entire closed-circuit system will be
hooked up to all classrooms by the end of this school year.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to provide a service for the school, while giving
students an opportunity to learn production by doing it," Massey
says. "It's their show. They make decisions."</TE>
<TE>   The broadcast is the pride of one of Southern California's most
solidly established high school programs in video and filmmaking.
Chatsworth first offered video classes more than a decade ago at the
urging of a teacher, since retired. Massey, who first taught
photography, took over in 1998. Students now can take three years of
video; classroom work ranges from heavily academic theory to projects
that require students to handle the production themselves. Such
intensive instruction is rare in the district.</TE>
<TE>   Massey, 45, is a graduate of the American Film Institute. He
worked as an independent filmmaker for years before signing on at
Chatsworth. In 1992, he was an Academy Award nominee for the live
action short film "Last Breeze of Summer," his film institute thesis
project. During summers, he works on documentaries. A film on the
women's movement in Ghana and a project on Cuban health care are in
the works.</TE>
<TE>   That does not translate into celebrity treatment at Chatsworth
High.</TE>
<TE>   Like other teachers, Massey handles a full load of six classes,
five of them introductory video courses and one advanced. His video
students make do with outdated analog equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "There's enough here for us to be professional," says Pate, a
senior who has directed three of the news broadcasts and plans to
attend Pierce College next year. "I've learned that I like anything
that has to do with directing or editing."</TE>
<TE>   For their first broadcast of the new school year, students begin
by turning the video classroom into a set. A blue wall divides the
class in half, providing a background for the anchors. Desks are
cleared away, and cameras set up in spots already marked on the
floor. In the soundproofed control room in the back, a crew of
six--including the director--runs through a series of checks.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Davis, a teacher's aide and alumnus of the Chatsworth
program, works with senior Chris Duguay, who is in charge of
graphics, on how to change the screen, or "transition," from the
static "CHS" lead-in graphic to a shot of the anchors.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't many high schools where you can get this kind of
experience," Davis says. "This program is a big reason I have my own
video production company now."</TE>
<TE>   Massey jumps between the studio and control room, dwelling on
details. He reminds the students that the call to "Roll tape" must be
confirmed in the studio with the reply, "Tape rolling." He detects
that camera No. 2 is not balanced. He insists on four rehearsals in
the half hour.Much of Massey's concern is focused on the anchors. The
drama department typically supplies camera-ready talent, but with 10
minutes left to broadcast, they haven't arrived. Two telegenic
members of the student crew, Armenta and Nguyen, are drafted as
substitutes, but both are visibly nervous.</TE>
<TE>   Rehearsals are rough.</TE>
<TE>   Armenta reads an announcement for a hip-hop dance team meeting
that has already happened. Nguyen can't bring himself to smile.
Massey resorts to putting his thumbs in his ears, waving his fingers
and sticking out his tongue at Nguyen to crack him up.</TE>
<TE>   "What I need from you anchors is a little more life," urges
Massey. "Pretend like you're happy to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes before air, DJ Cosgrove, a polished drama student,
shows up. He has been held up in government class. But after some
coaxing from Massey, Nguyen remains as anchor.</TE>
<TE>   With the school watching, the substitute anchors brighten. After
the Pledge of Allegiance, voiced by the anchors over a picture of an
American flag, an announcement from the Key Club tops the news. There
is also a Drama Club event and news about ticket sales for Friday's
football game.</TE>
<TE>   In the first year, much of the focus has been on technical
mastery. But Massey says the students will make journalistic
improvements. Full news reports on school issues will be added.</TE>
<TE>   Students are filming highlight reels of sporting events and other
school activities.</TE>
<TE>   For a first broadcast, the morning news goes well. The graphics
and lighting are spot-on. The anchors don't stumble. "That's a wrap,"
says Massey, to applause from the crew, who will do a thorough
breakdown of the tape at the end of class Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Until next week, the news is off the air.</TE>
<TE>   And homeroom is over.</TE>

<HD>Many Are Ill-Prepared for College, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Schools: State offers low-cost education, but does a so-so
job of getting pupils ready, report says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California remains the nation's leader in providing low-cost public
college education to its residents, but otherwise does a mediocre job
of helping students prepare for college and earn degrees, according
to a report released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   California has delivered "a middling performance, and it hasn't
improved much over the past couple of years," said Patrick M. Callan,
president of the San Jose-based nonprofit National Center for Public
Policy and Higher Education, which prepared the study.</LD>
<LD>   The state's efforts to get students into college and to help them
graduate, Callan said, "probably aren't good enough to sustain the
economy of the state, much less provide the kind of individual
opportunity that young people and older people in California want."</LD>
<TE>   The report, called "Measuring Up 2002," found that California
provides the most affordable college educations among the 50 states
mainly because of its low fees for community college. The state's
public two-year schools usually charge full-time students from $264
to $330 a year in attendance fees.</TE>
<TE>   California also scored well overall in measures of the portion of
its residents who attend college, finishing 12th-highest among the 50
states.</TE>
<TE>   But Callan warned that the state's budget problems, and the rising
numbers of young people reaching college age, raise the prospect of
student fee increases.</TE>
<TE>   He said those trends also threaten to force colleges to turn away
increasing numbers of applicants.</TE>
<TE>   To deal with the pending shortage of space for new students, he
said, "The state doesn't have a bad plan. It has no plan at all."</TE>
<TE>   The study, a follow-up to a report issued two years ago, ranked
the states according to five criteria, based on federal statistics
and its own formulas for gauging support for higher education.</TE>
<TE>   California was found to be first in affordability, eighth in
deriving economic benefits from the higher education received by its
residents, 35th in college completion and 37th in preparing students
for college.</TE>
<TE>   But one of the most surprising parts of the report was a finding
that the percentage of California students who completed high school
in four years and went directly to college fell abruptly from 43.4%
in 1998 to 34.5% in 2000, the last year for which comprehensive
statistics are available.</TE>
<TE>   However, ZoAnn V. Laurente, senior policy analyst for the
California Postsecondary Education Commission, questioned the
reliability of those college attendance figures. She said the drop
might be largely the result of a change in software systems for
reporting such statistics that many of the state's community colleges
made during those years.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be concerned if there were a serious drop-off in
college-going in our state, but our data doesn't give us that
indication," Laurente said.</TE>
<TE>   Callan countered, however, that data-reporting problems could not
account for all of the decline. He speculated that the strong economy
in the late 1990s, by providing more jobs for people who lacked
college educations, may have played a role in keeping people out of
school. Callan also noted the high dropout rates and low college
attendance among Latinos in their teens and early 20s.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, the apparent decline in high school students
heading to college reflected in the figures for 1998-2000 might
already have ended, as evidenced by the climbing enrollment over the
last two years in the state's two-year and four-year colleges. The
weaker economy, he said, may be spurring more people to attend
college to improve their prospects in the job market.</TE>

<HD>O.C. District Attorney Eases Rules on Use of Office Funds</HD>
<DH>Law enforcement: Rackauckas, ignoring critics, will allow
staffers to buy food and alcohol for politicians with money once
intended for prosecution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART PFEIFER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas has changed office policy
to allow his staff to entertain politicians and lobbyists with funds
earmarked for law enforcement work even though the grand jury
recommended he ban the practice.</LD>
<LD>   The Orange County Grand Jury in June criticized Rackauckas for
allowing a top official to use money from a special fund to buy
alcohol and food at political functions. The panel said the fund was
established to pay for prosecution and investigation expenses and
recommended that Rackauckas restrict the money to those uses.</LD>
<LD>   Rackauckas responded by changing the rules to allow the fund to be
used for any "matter of interest" to the office, including
legislation related to law enforcement, according to a revised office
policy.</LD>
<TE>   The new guidelines would permit district attorney staffers to use
the fund to buy alcohol and food while discussing legislation or
other matters.</TE>
<TE>   Under a 1994 office policy, the fund was to be used to pay for
witness protection, meetings with informants and expenses related to
undercover investigations. County supervisors allocated $90,000 for
the fund in last year's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in California, district attorneys have similar funds but
do not allow the money to be used for lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they use county lobbyists or other funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We do send prosecutors to testify before the Legislature and to
meet with legislators, but that money comes out of the travel
budget," said Liz Pursell, a spokeswoman for the San Diego County
district attorney's office. "As for alcohol, that's certainly not in
the county policy."</TE>
<TE>   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, said her office has a fund that is used
infrequently and only to pay the expenses of witnesses or crime
informants.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't use it for lobbying. Why would we do that?" she said,
noting that her office would use a lobbyist if it needed such
services.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Rackauckas said he would not comment for this
story.</TE>
<TE>   The fund became an issue for Rackauckas in June when the grand
jury assailed chief investigator Don Blankenship's "casual and
unwarranted" use of the fund. The report noted that Blankenship used
the fund to pay for meals and alcohol at meetings with law
enforcement officials, politicians, lobbyists, government employees,
campaign consultants, clergy and journalists.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1999 and 2001, Blankenship billed the fund more than
$4,600, primarily for alcohol at the Santa Ana Elks Club, where he is
a member, according to the grand jury report.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury also accused Blankenship, who oversees a staff of
more than 100 investigators, of billing both the fund and travel
budget for the same expenses. After the grand jury report was
published, Blankenship agreed to refund $209.65 to the county.
Rackauckas said he implemented new accounting policies to ensure
employees are not reimbursed twice for the same expense.</TE>
<TE>   The report also accused Rackauckas of misusing public resources,
showing favoritism in cases involving political supporters and hiring
friends and relatives of political contributors.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas filed a lengthy response to the report, defending his
actions in office and blaming the criticism on political enemies who
influenced the grand jury.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said last week that his office looked into
allegations against Rackauckas and determined no criminal charges
should be filed.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors decided not to take action against the
district attorney. But Supervisor Todd Spitzer last week questioned
whether using public funds to purchase alcohol was a violation of
county policy.</TE>

<HD>Ventura Farm Workers Hope New Labor Law Resolves Old
Dispute</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: At the Pictsweet Mushroom plant, held up as a
symbol of union battle, pickers believe mediation will lead to a
contract.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First the hard work, now the payoff.</LD>
<LD>   After months of lobbying lawmakers and marching in the streets,
workers at Southern California's largest mushroom farm said Tuesday
that they believe they may be among the first to benefit from a new
law aimed at resolving deadlocked labor disputes.</LD>
<LD>   The legislation, signed Monday by Gov. Gray Davis, permits state
agricultural officials to impose mandatory mediation in cases in
which farm labor negotiations reach an impasse.</LD>
<TE>   That appears to be the case at the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in
Ventura, where workers have been without a contract since 1987 and
talks in recent years between the company and the United Farm Workers
have failed to progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been the symbol for the need for this kind of
legislation," said 43-year-old picker Jesus Torres, who has worked
more than half his life at the mushroom farm and has helped lead the
push for a new contract.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last several months, Torres has joined other Pictsweet
workers on a mission to reshape the state's landmark farm labor law,
taking time off from his job in the plant's dank, dark growing houses
to testify before the Legislature and march on the Capitol in support
of the legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Now, armed with a powerful new negotiating tool, Torres said he
believes Pictsweet workers may finally have the leverage they need to
back up their demands for a pension plan, less costly medical
insurance and better wages and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked very hard to pass this law," Torres said. "We would
expect to be one of the first beneficiaries."</TE>
<TE>   A Pictsweet manager in Ventura refused to comment on the issue.
Other company representatives, in Tennessee and Los Angeles, could
not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Some farm industry leaders, who worked to defeat the measure and
believe the fight will continue in court, agree that Pictsweet could
be among the first targets of the new law, assuming it survives legal
challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Roy, general counsel for the Ventura County Agricultural
Assn., noted that union officials have long held up Pictsweet as a
symbol of the need for reform. "Without a doubt, I think Pictsweet is
going to be high on the UFW hit list," Roy said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Roy and other farm industry attorneys say the fight is
not over.</TE>
<TE>   Growers are considering a court challenge, arguing that the new
state measure favors farm labor unions, destroys the collective
bargaining process and unfairly burdens farm owners with a remedy
unavailable in any other private industry.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, growers say the new law allows representatives of a
government agency--the state's Agricultural Labor Relations Board--to
impose terms of a labor contract, a constitutional violation. And, in
the case of Pictsweet, growers say the new law could result in a UFW
contract at a company at which a number of workers have sought to
decertify the union, saying it does not represent their interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Under the law, you could have a large segment of the work force
very dissatisfied with the contract and yet have the contract forced
on them," Roy said. "Once again, [the farm industry] gets something
stuffed down its throat."</TE>
<TE>   The UFW first won a contract at the Ventura mushroom farm in 1975,
in one of the first elections held under the Agricultural Labor
Relations Act, union officials said. The agreement paved the way for
the union to negotiate contracts with half a dozen other mushroom
growers in California and Florida.</TE>
<TE>   The union maintained contracts with a series of owners at the
Ventura plant over the years, but that ended when Tennessee-based
United Foods Inc. bought it in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, UFW officials say they have tried a number of times to
hammer out a new contract, kicking the effort into high gear two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Gathered outside the plant Tuesday, UFW supporters said they hoped
the new law would put an end to the stalemate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very good what has happened because it has given us the
means to get a contract, so we don't have to fight any longer," said
mushroom picker Manuel Solomon, 59, who spent his day off Monday in
Los Angeles with UFW co-founder and Vice President Dolores Huerta for
a vigil outside the governor's downtown office. "This is very
important to the advancement of all farm workers."</TE>

<HD>Williams Fire Contained After 38,094 Acres Burn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Williams fire, Southern California's largest this year, was
declared 100% contained Tuesday, having burned 38,094 acres of the
San Gabriel Mountains, 62 homes and 14 outbuildings.</LD>
<LD>   By evening, the number of firefighters on the lines had dwindled
to 600 from a peak of 3,000, said Angeles National Forest spokeswoman
Kathy Peterson, and backfires had negated any chance the blaze would
reach Mount Baldy Village on its eastern edge.</LD>
<LD>   Eight hundred residents of the village who had obeyed evacuation
orders last week were allowed to return home Monday night, rejoining
the approximately 100 who had refused to leave.</LD>
<TE>   Lower temperatures, higher humidity and a smattering of rain
helped firefighters subdue the fire before it could come within a
mile of the town.</TE>
<TE>   "It did not burn into the big horn sheep protection area, and only
a little north of Glendora Ridge Road, and it did not reach the Cow
Canyon Saddle," Peterson said. At one time, it appeared it would
reach those areas.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said the cost of fighting the fire was $15 million, an
amount shared by the federal government, the state and Los Angeles
and San Bernardino counties.</TE>
<TE>   Although firefighters pinpointed the fire's origin to well north
of San Dimas along East Fork Road, its cause has not been determined.
Most of the homes destroyed were in San Dimas Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County assessor's office said Tuesday that owners
of homes with damage of $10,000 or more might be eligible for some
property tax relief. But the assessor, Rick Auerbach, said his
reports indicate that most of the damaged homes are on land leased
from the federal government, so such relief would not apply.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about tax relief may be directed to the assessor's
misfortune and calamity division at (213) 974-8658.</TE>

<CX>   Fire damage--A story in Wednesday's California section on the
containment of the Williams fire incorrectly stated that damaged
dwellings on leased land would not qualify for property tax relief.
In fact, the dwelling itself does qualify for such relief, even if

<HD>Three Men Arrested in Hate-Crime Attack on Gays in West
Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Violence: They are being investigated for other assaults
that terrorized the city.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Three men were arrested Tuesday night in connection with one of a
series of hate crime attacks on gay men in West Hollywood, and
authorities were trying to determine if they are linked to the
others.</LD>
<LD>   All three had been arrested the night of the first attack on Sept.
1 on suspicion of robbery and car theft, Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department Capt. Lynda Castro said. Although deputies then suspected
that they might be linked to the attack, there wasn't enough evidence
to hold them for that crime, she said. A tip, however, led to their
rearrests Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, four men in West Hollywood were attacked in three
separate assaults, all involving a baseball bat, a section of pipe or
both. The attacks inspired fear in the community, where nearly a
third of residents are gay.</LD>
<TE>   "This is what we've been waiting for the entire month of
September," Castro said at a news conference outside the West
Hollywood sheriff's station. "This has been a month from hell. This
is a great night for West Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies did not release the suspects' names nor say where they
were arrested. All were booked at the West Hollywood station on
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Two assaults occurred on Sept. 1 on Cynthia Street, a few blocks
off Santa Monica Boulevard. The victims were 34-year-old actor Treve
Broudy, who was nearly killed, and a friend, Edward Lett. That attack
took place just after Broudy and his friend had embraced.</TE>
<TE>   The suspects were booked Tuesday on suspicion of that attack.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours after the attack on Broudy, a 35-year-old West
Hollywood resident whose name has not been released was attacked near
Cynthia Street and Hilldale Avenue by two men armed with clubs.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 23, a 55-year-old gay man was rushed to Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center after being beaten about 3:15 a.m. by two people who
used similar weapons--a baseball bat or section of pipe--fit similar
physical descriptions to the earlier attackers, and drove a late
1980s, four-door Nissan Sentra.</TE>
<TE>   The two assailants yelled anti-gay epithets at the victim as they
hit him repeatedly in the face, head and body, sheriff's deputies
said.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a passing cabdriver intervened, chasing the
assailants until they ran out of sight, authorities said. The taxi
driver took the victim home.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to capture the attackers, the West Hollywood sheriff's
station increased late-night patrols from 12 to 30 deputies around
the Sunset Strip.</TE>
<TE>   As anger and fear crept through the community once known as a
comfortable place to be gay, residents took to the street in rallies
and candlelight vigils. Sketches of the assailants were distributed
in bars and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests Tuesday night "are very important to us, not only in
the police world, but especially in the community," Castro said.
"This community was living in fear since Sept. 1."</TE>
<TE>   One of the suspects has been in custody since Sept. 1 on the
auto-theft charge. Tuesday's tip led to the other two. Further
investigation then led deputies to the man already in jail.</TE>
<TE>   All three were first arrested after Deputy Robert Gillis pulled
over a red Toyota driving without its lights on a cul-de-sac. Gillis
had not heard at that point about the attack on Broudy, he said
Tuesday. He found narcotics in the car, he said.</TE>
<TE>   $91,000 Reward</TE>
<TE>   Although he later discovered similarities between the Toyota's
license plate and the partial license plate number reported in the
attack, there still was not enough evidence to link them, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, the reward total for the hate crimes had been
raised to $91,000, Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood) said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Det. John Kniest said Tuesday that he didn't think the
reward prompted the tip.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was so much the reward, but it was a citizen who
wanted to do the right thing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Pro Tem Steve Martin said, "We're pretty ecstatic. We think
that ultimately, the tip was given by somebody who put themselves in
the place of Treve Broudy's parents."</TE>
<TE>   A friend of Broudy's, Dave Walsh of West Hollywood, said he was in
the middle of dinner when he heard that an announcement of arrest was
imminent, "and I just dropped everything" to go to the sheriff's
station. There, he and other friends cheered and hugged city
officials and investigators.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be pushed into a corner because of hate," he
said. "We love Treve. It's all about Treve, [but] it is also about
how it affects all of us. It affects everybody in terms of 'that
could be me.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another friend of seven years, Craig DeSilva, said Broudy "had a
real kaleidoscope of emotions going on" Tuesday night. "I think that
he was grateful."</TE>
<TE>   Broudy, he said, is "doing much better, talking again, but still
has memory problems."</TE>

<HD>Official Calls Bailout for County Dead</HD>
<DH>Health: U.S. won't give $350 million to keep hospitals
open, Bush aide says. Expected next is a battle over funds in
Sacramento.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI and CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A key Bush administration official says the government will not give
Los Angeles County the $350-million bailout it seeks to keep
hospitals and clinics open, a stance that could trigger a four-front
battle among the county supervisors, Gov. Gray Davis, the federal
government and private hospitals for increasingly scarce health
funds.</LD>
<LD>   A week before county and state officials are slated to fly to
Washington to discuss the county's request for a third bailout for
its health system, Tom Scully, the director of the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the deal is dead on arrival.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want to create a meltdown of the L.A. County hospitals,
but I have to explain to Houston and New York and St. Louis and
Nashville why L.A. County is getting a special deal," Scully said in
an interview with The Times. "I don't think it's our responsibility
to just write them a check and bail them out."</LD>
<TE>   Scully said the administration is willing to help with some money
and is eager to help the local government retool its health system to
grapple with a looming $750-million deficit. But the offers of
assistance that Scully described would come with a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   The money Scully proposes giving Los Angeles--apparently too
little to keep all county hospitals open--would come from pots of
cash that are claimed by Sacramento and private hospitals that treat
large numbers of uninsured patients. Scully has identified a
long-delayed, $175-million lawsuit settlement with private hospitals
over reimbursement rates and a 20-year-long federal program that
gives extra money to California hospitals that care for the poor as
possible sources of new county money.</TE>
<TE>   The hospitals and the Davis administration are digging in their
heels. The Davis administration delayed forwarding Los Angeles
County's bailout request to Washington for more than a month. State
officials said they sat on the proposal partly because they feared
that the Bush administration response would jeopardize California's
health by shifting around money in an already underfunded system.</TE>
<TE>   Scully's stance, said Grantland Johnson, Davis' secretary of
health and human services, will "basically jeopardize the viability
of the California health-care system."</TE>
<TE>   Jan Emerson of the California Hospital Assn. said it is improper
for Scully to link the matters. "Mr. Scully is trying to tie monies
that have nothing to do with L.A. County's problems," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One effect of the Bush administration position has been to ratchet
up the tension between local officials, who would be at least
somewhat helped by it, and state officials, whose programs it would
cut.</TE>
<TE>   County officials face a self-imposed Oct. 29 deadline to decide
whether to close dozens of clinics and Harbor-UCLA and Olive
View-UCLA Medical Centers to balance their budget. For months, they
have complained of being unable to secure meetings with Davis or his
health and human resources secretary, Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Scully's suggestion to find money in the private
hospital system or elsewhere could offer some relief, though at the
cost of further political debate.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors on Tuesday formally asked Davis to call a special
session of the Legislature to deal with health issues, and to declare
Los Angeles County "medically underserved"--a designation that some
supervisors hope could free up more funding for the county's about 2
million uninsured residents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate the governor has yet to be attentive to this,"
Supervisor Gloria Molina, a Democrat, said of fellow Democrat Davis,
who is battling Republican Bill Simon Jr. for reelection next month.
"He is turning his head away ... from dealing with this."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Scully's repeated statements over the last several weeks
that he would not give the county a third bailout--it received two
under the Clinton administration--county health officials continued
to hope for some aid from Washington. They said that Scully and
others in the Bush administration had given encouraging signs during
meetings in May and that they are confused by his recent statements.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point," said county health spokesman John Wallace, "the
politics are going to have to take a back seat to the fact that we're
going to lose our health system."</TE>
<TE>   Scully said that he does want to help Los Angeles and be fair to
California, but that the county is the only one in the nation that
has a direct agreement for additional funds from his agency. All
other waivers of Medicaid rules go through states. More appropriate,
he said, would be onetime money to help Los Angeles reform its health
system without a rocky landing.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they want us to come and write them a check for a
couple of hundred million bucks. That's not the way it works," Scully
said. "Only Congress can write a check to L.A. County for a couple
hundred million dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Scully said he has ideas about other existing programs that could
help Los Angeles but declined to identify them. He added that
California has flexibility to help Los Angeles because it spends $24
billion on Medi-Cal. Indeed, Scully has yet to approve the state's
own waiver for the long-standing Select Provider Contracting Program,
which provides money to hospitals to care for the poor. The waiver
was submitted in September 2001, and Scully said California should
use some of that money--which the state estimates at $800 million--to
help Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   But California anticipates a deficit of at least $10 billion next
year and is not eager to bail out its most populous county. The state
kicked in $300 million as part of the last federal bailout, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, Davis' health and human resources secretary, dismissed
accusations of inattentiveness.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that some people are very frustrated and have high
anxiety, I can understand it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's simply without a basis for suggesting that this
administration has not been exercising leadership and working on L.A.
County's behalf," he said. "One has to attribute those comments to
being uninformed and certainly inaccurate, to say the least."</TE>

<HD>Coastal Panel, Developer Fail to Reach Accord on Burial
Ground</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Stop-work order will remain in effect until
builder of gated community in Seal Beach files plan for handling
remains of Native Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California Coastal Commission officials and a developer failed
Tuesday to agree on how to handle the remains of at least 18 Native
Americans, meaning the company still can't resume work on a gated
community in Seal Beach.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is how to handle human bones and artifacts that have been
unearthed at the 18-acre Heron Pointe site and whether digging can
continue if more remains are found on the land.</LD>
<LD>   The property, which is considered sacred by the Tongva people and
may have been an ancient burial ground, is part of the 196-acre
Hellman Ranch between the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station and the
San Gabriel River. The Tongva flourished in what is now Los Angeles
and Orange counties for 7,000 years before the late 18th century
arrival of the Spaniards, who established the San Gabriel Mission and
renamed the indigenous population the Gabrielinos.</LD>
<TE>   Peter Douglas, the commission's executive director, issued a
cease-and-desist order against John Laing Homes last month after the
developer refused to stop grading house pads after the Native
American remains were discovered. Last year, the commission approved
a permit allowing construction of 70 homes at Heron Pointe, provided
there was oversight by Native American monitors and archeologists,
and that any remains found were properly handled.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas said Tuesday that there is a clear conflict between how
the developer and the commission read the permit language.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not reach a resolution," Douglas said. "The developer
disputes the meaning and effect of the permit conditions. We made it
very clear that we think the permit clearly requires they stop work
[when remains are found] and [requires] a plan for treatment of the
site. Until we get a plan like that, the cease-and-desist will remain
in effect."</TE>
<TE>   Laing Homes project manager Joanie Madrid said the meeting was
congenial and productive. She said writing a treatment plan will
merely formalize Laing's existing policies. The company is drafting
such a plan, and could resume work within a month, she added.</TE>
<TE>   Madrid also disputed the commission's version of events, saying
the company voluntarily halted grading two days before the stop-work
order was issued.</TE>

<HD>Most Give HMOs Conditional OK</HD>
<DH>Survey: Californians want better access and shorter office
waits but are more or less content, Davis officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Californians are generally satisfied with the performance of their
managed-care physicians and health insurance plans but want better
access to medical specialists and less time spent in doctor waiting
rooms, the Davis administration said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The conclusions were contained in a second annual state government
"report card" that rated the 10 biggest HMOs, covering 95% of
Californians enrolled in managed-care health plans. For the first
time, the evaluation also rated medical groups of doctors.</LD>
<LD>   The report card, compiled by Martin Gallegos, the state patient
advocate on issues dealing with managed health care, said the
evaluation was intended as a shopper's guide for consumers and
employers in selecting health insurance plans and physician groups.</LD>
<TE>   "It also serves as an incentive for the health plans to focus on
their own quality improvement efforts," said Gallegos, a former
member of the Assembly who specialized in overhauling the unpopular
managed-care industry in California.</TE>
<TE>   The health maintenance organization report card, written in
English, Spanish and Chinese, can be viewed online at www.opa.ca.gov,
and obtained without cost by calling toll-free (866) HMO-8900, or at
pharmacies and various heath advocacy organizations.</TE>
<TE>   The report card did not give any HMO or medical group an A or F,
but it did find that the 18 million people covered by managed care
are generally satisfied, although they say there is room for
improvement. The data were provided by surveys of managed-care
patients, HMOs and medical groups.</TE>
<TE>   For HMOs, the ratings were based on a variety of categories,
including preventive care and care for a chronic illness, whether
doctors listen to patients and explain matters carefully, and whether
medical groups pay claims quickly and help resolve complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the study narrowly scored Kaiser Permanente-South highest
among the 10 biggest HMOs, receiving 10 movie review-style stars out
of a possible perfect 15. It received the only "excellent" rating in
the HMO review--for helping patients stay healthy.</TE>
<TE>   Universal Care and Western Health Advantage tied for last place
with seven stars each. Universal scored poorly in the staying healthy
and care for chronic illness categories. Western finished poorly in
the care for "getting better" and chronic illness classifications.</TE>
<TE>   In the ratings of doctor groups for West Los Angeles and the San
Fernando Valley, Healthcare Partners Medical Group got the top score
with eight stars out of a possible 12. The lowest finisher, at four
stars, was Pacific IPA.</TE>
<TE>   For the East Los Angeles, Torrance and South Bay region, two
groups tied for first place with eight stars each: Healthcare
Partners Medical Group and Torrance Hospital IPA. Four groups tied
for last with five stars each, including Alamitos IPA, Kaiser-Greater
L.A., Professional Care Medical Group and Talbert Medical Group.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Zingale, director of the Department of Managed Care, told a
news conference that the star rating system "is not a movie review. A
missing star can mean a missing surgeon, a missing specialist or a
missing life-saving medication. This is serious business."</TE>
<TE>   Zingale said that every HMO rated well in financial stability, but
that scores fell in quality-of-service categories. "We want to close
the gap," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gallegos noted that in virtually every region of the state,
managed-care doctors received low marks from patients for poor
scheduling and failing to keep appointments on time. They also got
low ratings for failure to provide timely access to specialists and
for problems in ordering tests.</TE>
<TE>   He told reporters that HMOs showed some improvement from last
year's report card, which he said was the first of its kind in the
nation.</TE>
<TE>   The document also drew praise from the HMO industry, which had
fought several managed-care reforms enacted by the Legislature two
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Zelman, president and chief executive officer of the
California Assn. of Health Plans, which represents more than 30 HMOs,
applauded the report card, saying his trade group generally supports
the disclosure of "fair and comparative information about health
plans."</TE>

<HD>Secessionists Fear Gap in Leadership</HD>
<DH>Breakup: Richard Katz's work up to four days a week in
Sacramento has some in Valley doubting his ability to guide the
campaign. He says he is in touch electronically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The co-chair of the San Fernando Valley secession drive has been
spending up to four days a week in Sacramento on state business,
causing some breakup advocates to worry that their campaign lacks
full-time leadership.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Katz, in addition to his volunteer post on the Valley
Independence Committee, serves on the State Water Resources Control
Board and advises Gov. Gray Davis on energy issues.</LD>
<LD>   Expense reports filed by Katz, with the board for June through
August indicate he has been regularly flying to Sacramento on Monday
mornings and returning on Thursday evenings.</LD>
<TE>   Katz, who is paid $114,000 annually as a state water commissioner,
said the weekly trips have not cost him essential time away from the
secession campaign and he has no plans to curtail his Sacramento
schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "The nice thing about computers and cell phones is that you can
work 24 hours a day wherever you are," Katz said. "I get done what I
need to get done."</TE>
<TE>   Katz, a former assemblyman, has the backup of campaign co-chairs
Carlos Ferreyra and Laurette Healey, but is by far the most
recognized and politically experienced of the three, secession
supporters say.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was running the campaign, I'd tell him to either spend more
time here or replace him," said Bruce Boyer, a candidate for mayor of
the proposed Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a good sign," said another mayoral candidate, Marc
Strassman, who added that he has had trouble getting in touch with
Katz by phone.</TE>
<TE>   A candidate for Valley city council, who asked not to be named,
said: "I'm very worried. It hurts when he is out of town that we
don't have the central guidance. He is the only one who can stand up
to the mayor articulately."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the secession effort lost its political consulting firm
after the money-strapped campaign failed to pay its bills. It has
also been without the guidance of Richard Close, chairman of Valley
VOTE, who is expected to return next Wednesday from a three-week
European vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Katz's August expense report indicates he spent 15 days in
Sacramento that month, including Monday through Thursday the last
three weeks of the month. In July, Katz spent 17 days in Sacramento.
He has not yet filed his September report.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is in constant communication with the campaign while he
is away and noted there is a handful of paid staff members working on
publicity and field operations.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Sheftel, a Valley council candidate who recently formed a
separate committee to promote the secession measure on the Nov. 5
ballot, said he understands that Katz has to earn a living.</TE>
<TE>   "We certainly could use him here more. He is an excellent
speaker," Sheftel said, "but he is guiding us from afar."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a majority of the executive board of the NAACP's Valley
chapter opposes secession, board members said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter president, Zedar Broadous, has endorsed secession.
Broadous said the chapter itself has not taken an official position.</TE>
<TE>   Also Tuesday, the Los Angeles Police Protective League released a
new anti-secession television commercial that shows a group of police
officers gradually fading from view as a narrator says, "Today Valley
residents receive the protection of specially trained LAPD officers.
And tomorrow? In times like these, secession may not be worth the
risk. Let's stay united."</TE>
<TE>   The ad replaced a commercial showing officers at the North
Hollywood bank robbery shootout in 1997. The police union said it had
rejected that ad when its media consultant presented it to them,
although the spot aired on two stations.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have accused the Protective League of fear-mongering
in its campaign against a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that the state commission that approved the
secession measure for the ballot determined that a Valley city would
be able to provide the same level of police service that the area
receives today.</TE>
<TE>   Mayoral candidate Mel Wilson, also on Tuesday, unveiled a Valley
transportation plan that includes a light-rail system, more carpool
lanes and incentives for ridesharing and telecommuting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real simple solution to something people think is
complex," said Wilson, a former member of the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority board.</TE>

<HD>Davis Vetoes Hypodermic Needle Bill</HD>
<DH>Politics: Measure would have made it easier to buy
syringes. Governor also takes action on open meetings, public
records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL and DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In the final hours of a legislative year in which he signed 1,173
bills and vetoed 264, Gov. Gray Davis on Monday killed a measure that
would have made it easier to buy hypodermic needles.</LD>
<LD>   He also took action on bills dealing with government
whistle-blowers, open meetings and public records.</LD>
<LD>   Adults could have purchased as many as 30 syringes without a
prescription under a bill that Davis said he vetoed because it didn't
do enough to get drug addicts into treatment.</LD>
<TE>   AIDS activists decried the veto, saying that thousands of people
will become afflicted with HIV or infectious hepatitis by sharing
dirty needles. California is one of only six states that require,
with some exceptions, a prescription to buy syringes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a victory of politics over sound public health," said
Fred Dillon, policy director for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation.
"There is no justifiable reason for the governor to have vetoed
this."</TE>
<TE>   In his veto message, Davis criticized Senate Bill 1785 by Sen.
John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) for undermining authorized
needle-exchange programs, which require a one-for-one exchange of
used and sterile needles.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also vetoed SB 1734 by Vasconcellos, which would have
made it easier to establish such needle exchanges. Under a law Davis
signed in 1999, a city or county must declare a local health crisis
every two to three weeks in order to maintain a needle-exchange
program. The Vasconcellos bill would have required just a once-a-year
declaration by a city council or county board of supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very troubling to us that he would choose to do this,"
Dillon said. "It feels like he decided this was a disposable
population."</TE>
<TE>   For the third year running, Davis rejected legislation to open
more government records to public inspection.</TE>
<TE>   The latest bill to fall to his veto pen is Assembly Bill 822 by
Assemblyman Kevin Shelley (D-San Francisco), who is running for
secretary of state against Republican Keith Olberg.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would have empowered the state attorney general to review
denials of requests for government records. It also would have
allowed people whose requests were denied to collect $100 for each
day a record was improperly withheld.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the bill would create a conflict for the attorney
general, whose deputies must defend agencies that violate the state
Public Records Act. Davis also said his administration is "responding
timely, and there is very little litigation challenging" denials of
records.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Francke of the First Amendment Coalition, a group funded
largely by news companies, said the survey to which Davis referred
was superficial and did not address compliance by local governments.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Assembly Republicans blocked a proposal to
place before voters a constitutional amendment to provide greater
access to government records. The author of that measure, Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), has said he plans to
reintroduce it in January.</TE>
<TE>   Francke lauded that step, saying the issue needs to be put to a
statewide vote. Governors, he said, will veto bills that reduce their
power to withhold documents. "Simple legislation that can be vetoed
is not the answer," Francke said.</TE>
<TE>   The California Newspaper Publishers Assn. took a neutral stance on
another bill signed by the governor. AB 2645 by Assemblyman Sam
Aanestad (R-Grass Valley) allows utility districts and local
governments to meet in secret session with private security
consultants to discuss threats to water and electrical systems.</TE>
<TE>   The new law widens an exception to the 49-year-old Ralph M. Brown
Act, which requires legislative bodies to meet openly, publicly and
with adequate notice.</TE>
<TE>   "In the wake of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001," Davis
wrote in signing the bill, "greater confidentiality for local and
state public meetings is warranted when issues of public safety are
being discussed."</TE>
<TE>   Davis vetoed a bill encouraging government attorneys to report
crimes and fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Other public employees who expose misdeeds are already shielded
from workplace retaliation. AB 363 by Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg
(D-Sacramento) would have protected government attorneys from
professional discipline or the loss of a license for disclosing
client confidences.</TE>
<TE>   The measure stems from the case of Department of Insurance
attorney Cindy Ossias, who leaked documents to a legislative
committee investigating alleged wrongdoing by Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Quackenbush tried to fire Ossias, and the State Bar investigated
her for violating client confidentiality rules. She was ultimately
exonerated by the bar and reinstated by Quackenbush's successor.</TE>
<TE>   In his veto message, Davis wrote: "The effective operation of our
legal system depends on the fundamental duty of confidentiality owed
by lawyers to their clients."</TE>

<KH>Steve Lopez POINTS WEST</KH>
<HD>Longshoremen Are Not Your Father's Dockworkers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On my way down to the Port of Los Angeles on Tuesday, I couldn't help
but consider the irony.</LD>
<LD>   After decades of technological advancement, post-industrial
reinvention and the miracle of globalization, the U.S. economy can
apparently still be brought to its knees by one of organized labor's
museum pieces--the longshoreman.</LD>
<LD>   Container ships are lined up off the western United States with
nowhere to go, just sitting out there with our new sneakers and
sports cars. Railroad and trucking company employees who normally
haul that stuff across the country are twiddling their thumbs. And
retailers are beginning to fear the unimaginable--the cancellation of
Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   All this because a mere 10,500 members of the International
Longshore and Warehouse Union were locked out of the West Coast's 29
ports Friday in a contract dispute with their boss--the Pacific
Maritime Assn. PMA locked the doors after claiming the dockworkers
were in a slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   These things can be quite contentious, as you know, and in fact a
federal mediation session broke down Tuesday in Oakland when one side
showed up packing heat.</TE>
<TE>   You're thinking union, right?</TE>
<TE>   Guess again. Management brought armed guards.</TE>
<TE>   It used to be much easier to figure out who the thugs were.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about you, but I kind of like the idea that a global
economy designed by people who make millions of dollars in bonuses
can be torpedoed by a bunch of throwbacks who work the waterfront.</TE>
<TE>   These are not, however, the longshoremen you saw in
black-and-white movies. If you've been following the news, you know
they can make between $80,000 and $150,000 a year with overtime.</TE>
<TE>   So who are they? And how could they possibly have any complaints
about a deal that pays them so handsomely for loading and unloading
ships?</TE>
<TE>   Those are the questions that brought me down to the ILWU Local 13
office in Wilmington, where I met two guys who do not fit the image I
had in mind.</TE>
<TE>   They're both college graduates, and they were both smart enough to
know they couldn't beat the deal down on the docks.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Ponce, 40, got an engineering degree from USC. He owned a
construction business, but worked the docks with four of his five
brothers when business was slow, and made a full-time switch seven
years ago. He's now a lasher, which means he goes up on the ships and
releases the ties that bind the containers.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Espino, 49, got a history degree from UCLA. He owned a
liquor store for a while, but wanted a change 18 years ago and
followed his father to the waterfront. Espino operates a crane that
loads cargo onto railroad cars.</TE>
<TE>   Ponce said that he's never made $100,000 a year, and that anyone
other than a foreman who makes between $60,000 and $80,000 is putting
in a ton of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "The amount of money we earn certainly makes us among the highest
paid blue-collar workers in the United States," Espino adds, but he
says the work is more technical than it used to be. "About 75% of the
jobs require a skill, and it can be a dangerous job, too."</TE>
<TE>   "Second only to mining," says Ponce.</TE>
<TE>   But money isn't the issue. Their main concern is one that's as old
as the hills in organized labor disputes: that mechanization will
eventually knock them off the gravy train.</TE>
<TE>   "This is all a precursor to their elimination of us," Ponce said
of the lockout by PMA.</TE>
<TE>   He's probably right, but American businesses are not charities. If
they can dump employees and jump profits at the same time, nothing
will stand in their way.</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't you guys have done the same when you ran your businesses?
I asked.</TE>
<TE>   They both said no, which may be why they're now dockworkers.</TE>
<TE>   All they're asking, they said, is that they be considered for new
jobs created by new technology, and that those jobs be represented by
the union.</TE>
<TE>   "It's corporate greed in my opinion," Ponce said of his employer
in particular and American business in general. "They make a ton of
money and they want more, and they know they can get it if they get
rid of us and use more casual laborers who get no benefits and less
pay."</TE>
<TE>   Working the docks and looking at the endless tide of products that
come and go in the new economy, Espino, the history major, often
finds himself wondering if it makes any sense.</TE>
<TE>   He sees scrap metal passing through the docks on its way to Japan,
where factory workers turn it into steel, and he sees it come back as
the girding we use to erect buildings.</TE>
<TE>   What jobs did we give away in that exchange, he wonders, and what
jobs did we get in return?</TE>
<TE>   With the sneakers and stereo equipment he loads onto railroad
cars, what's the better job for an American: making those products,
or ringing them up at the Target checkout counter?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm almost getting to be an isolationist at this point," Espino
said.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of dockworkers walked picket lines as I drove past the
gates of the port, and two thoughts occurred as I got onto the Harbor
Freeway and took in a broad view of the harbor.</TE>
<TE>   It certainly is a society of haves and have-nots, with some people
getting paid millions to look pretty. But even among commoners,
there's a wide disparity as well, and it's hard to work up much
sympathy for those grossing nearly six figures to unload boxes.</TE>
<TE>   What about teachers, gardeners and housekeepers who have to work
two jobs to get by? Where's their piece of the new economy?</TE>
<TE>   As soon as this lockout is settled, I suggest they all race down
to the waterfront.</TE>

<HD>Man Says He Did Not Kill His Girlfriend</HD>
<DH>Court: Harold Marshall enters a plea of not guilty on
charges he shot the woman as they sat in car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oxnard man accused of fatally shooting his girlfriend pleaded not
guilty Tuesday to murder and weapons charges.</LD>
<LD>   Harold Marshall, 31, was arraigned in Ventura County Superior
Court. He denied charges that he fired a single gunshot into the head
of Imelda Mata, 22, of Port Hueneme.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall is charged with murder and two counts of possession of a
firearm by a felon.</LD>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon said the relationship
between Marshall and Mata at the time of the shooting and the motive
for the shooting remain unclear.</TE>
<TE>   "There is still a lot of investigation being done," Simon said.
"We're just trying to piece everything together."</TE>
<TE>   Mata was shot in July while sitting with Marshall in a 1991 Chevy
Camaro in the 3000 block of Bunsen Avenue, near the Buenaventura Golf
Course, Ventura police said.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses told police a man ran from the car after it hit an
abandoned van. When police arrived, they found Mata, the mother of a
3-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter, dead in the passenger seat.
A gun was found near the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested Marshall in September after receiving a tip that
he was at friend's house in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Court records show that Marshall had pleaded guilty to domestic
violence in 1993 and served a year in Ventura County Jail.</TE>
<TE>   He was later convicted of battery and served six months in jail.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary hearing is set for Dec. 5. Marshall remains jailed
in lieu of $750,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Ruling Clears Way for UC Merced's First Phase</HD>
<DH>Courts: Environmental groups vow to seek an emergency stay
to block immediate excavation at site on sensitive land.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The long-stalled plan for a University of California campus near
Merced took a step forward Tuesday with a court ruling against the
latest legal challenge brought by environmental groups.</LD>
<LD>   University officials applauded the decision by Judge William Ivey
in Merced County Superior Court and said they hope it will allow them
to begin the first phase of construction at the proposed campus site
northeast of Merced.</LD>
<LD>   "We're looking forward to breaking ground as quickly as possible,"
UC Merced spokesman James Grant said.</LD>
<TE>   Three San Joaquin Valley environmental groups had sued in February
seeking to stop or slow campus construction and accusing the
university of failing to adequately address the project's potential
effects on the environment.</TE>
<TE>   Patience Milrod, an attorney for the organizations--the San
Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center, Protect Our Water and Central
Valley Safe Environment Network--said Tuesday that they will appeal
the decision and ask for an emergency stay to prevent any immediate
excavation.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was the latest twist in a long-running struggle over UC
Merced, which would be the university's 10th campus and the first new
one since the mid-1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have said that UC officials, under pressure from the
governor's office and state legislators to complete the campus as
quickly as possible, have engaged in piecemeal planning and failed to
address its potential impact on endangered species and the
surrounding area.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed site for the campus is in an area of sensitive
wetlands and prime grazing and agricultural land. Among endangered
species in the area are fairy shrimp and the San Joaquin kit fox.</TE>
<TE>   At the hearing, Ivey ruled that the final environmental impact
report on the campus project meets requirements under California law.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's ruling involved only the initial phase of planned
construction on a 200-acre parcel of land on a former golf course. In
August, the university received permission to remove existing
buildings from the area but had been prohibited from actually
breaking ground.</TE>
<TE>   But the main section of the campus faces further environmental
reviews, expected to take about three more years.</TE>

<HD>Angel Fans Few but Fearless in N.Y.</HD>
<DH>Sports: The Anaheim faithful brave the boos to support
their team in its first playoff since '86.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In the sea of blue at Yankee Stadium, Anaheim Angel fans passed one
another in the stands Tuesday night, tipped their red caps and
exchanged knowing smiles.</LD>
<LD>   They ignored the boos and the shouts: "Go back to Disneyland!" and
"You guys are going down!" They didn't care. This moment has been too
long in the making to let Yankee ego spoil their fun at the Angels'
first playoff game since 1986.</LD>
<LD>   "All these people have no idea how good we are," said Jeff
Peterson, 45, a transplanted Orange County resident who lives in
Pleasantville, N.Y. "We're going to be taken lightly, and I think
they're going to be surprised."</LD>
<TE>   Without question, the Angels were in Game One until the end, when
Bernie Williams hit a home run that sent Yankee Stadium into a
roaring frenzy and lifted New York past Anaheim 8 to 5.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be back to fight another day," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly
said from his seat behind home plate. "The Angels are never out of
it."</TE>
<TE>   The Angel fans--what few there were Tuesday night--joked that
there were only eight of them at the stadium in the heart of the
Bronx. Well, maybe 18.</TE>
<TE>   But the loyal plunked down their credit cards, left their jobs
behind and caught last-minute flights to New York City, some arriving
mere hours before the American League playoff series' opening pitch
at 8:15 EDT.</TE>
<TE>   "We just decided this weekend, we're going to Yankee Stadium,"
said Doug Steele, 37, of Trabuco Canyon from his seat, also behind
home plate. "We got here about 2:30 p.m., took the bus to the subway.
And here we are."</TE>
<TE>   Steele had come with his cousin Mike Faulkner, 43, of Anaheim.
Decked out in Angel hats and T-shirts, they braved the subway, with
Faulkner waving his father's old California license plate that says,
simply, "ANAHEIM."</TE>
<TE>   They made it to the stadium despite the heckling of Yankee fans
who had urged them to get off at the wrong stop.</TE>
<TE>   Daly, who became a fan even before the team moved to Anaheim in
1966, has a lot on the line after finalizing a friendly wager with
New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: a crate of Anaheim chiles and
oranges if the Angels lose. If the Yankees lose, Bloomberg will ship
Nathan's hot dogs and H &amp; H bagels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just about the most fun I've had as mayor," Daly said. "It
feels like a dream. For me, this is the most exciting Angels season
since the team began playing in Anaheim."</TE>
<TE>   The youngest Angel supporter in the audience may have been
7-year-old Karcher Smith of Santa Ana, whose dad is one of the team's
trainers. He's a huge fan, and despite his youth, he spoke with the
authority of a veteran.</TE>
<TE>   "They're gonna win," Karcher declared. "Twenty to zip!"</TE>
<TE>   Although most Yankee fans couldn't help a good-natured jab at the
Angels, at least one New Yorker, Harlan Berman, stopped to pay his
respects.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my god, Angels fans?" Berman said, a bit incredulously. "My
friend lives in Los Angeles and he claims he's never met an Angels
fan--that everybody roots for the Dodgers. I'm going to call him and
say, 'I've met two.' "</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels scored more runs, Anaheim real estate agent Paul
Kott, 48, said he'd decided just to ignore the cheering, jeering
Yankee fans.</TE>
<TE>   "We just keep telling them to watch the scoreboard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kott, who started planning his trip to New York the day before the
Angels clinched their wild-card berth in the playoffs, flew to New
York late Monday night with Daly. He has tickets to today's game too.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather is perfect," the die-hard Angel fan said.</TE>
<TE>   "New York is a dynamic city, and the Angels are going to win the
series. What more could I want?"</TE>

<DH>Baseball: The Angel backers alter schedules to gather in
front of TV sets for the playoff opener in New York.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT MARTELLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Christy Brink had every intention of going to work Tuesday, though
she had warned her boss she'd be a little late because she had some
"personal business" to attend to on the way in.</LD>
<LD>   But with second-round Anaheim Angels playoff tickets going on sale
at 9 a.m. and the playoff opener on television at 5 p.m., Brink
decided to call in from the Edison International Field ticket line to
say that her personal business was taking a little longer than she'd
expected.</LD>
<LD>   "My boss said, 'I know exactly where you are and I know what your
personal business is. We'll put you down for a flex day,' " Brink
said Tuesday, laughing over the hubbub of 10 people jammed in front
of three television sets in her family's home in Stanton.</LD>
<TE>   A lot of bosses will be making a lot of concessions over the next
few days as Angels fans struggle with the downside of rooting for a
West Coast team and being at the mercy of East Coast television
programmers, coupled with what for some has become an unstoppable
force: the need to track their team's first run at the playoffs in 16
years.</TE>
<TE>   In many cases that meant trying to find a way to work and watch at
the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Darlene Northcutt, 37, a cashier at a Santa Ana grocery store,
planned to perch a small television near her register so she could
keep one eye on the price scanner and the other on the game. Rob
Holman, president of the Anaheim Angels Boosters Club, stashed a
small TV in his desk drawer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's killing me," said Holman, 45, of Chino, who works until 8
p.m. as an office manager in La Puente. "It's tough. But it's a huge
thing for us fans and we'll do what we have to. These guys get under
your skin. It's the team you love to be disappointed by."</TE>
<TE>   The die-hards had a lot of company this year as the Angels defied
a broad erosion in Major League Baseball attendance, which dropped by
6.1%--the biggest fall since the 1994-95 strike. Average attendance
was 28,168 per game, down from 30,012 last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels drew 28,463 per game, for a total attendance of about
300,000 more than last season's 2 million, despite a potential strike
that imperiled the Angels greatest season.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the attendance grew, its makeup remained relatively
stable. Two out of three ticket buyers are male, their average age is
32 to 34. About half of all the fans are from Orange County. Most
come from households with annual incomes of $75,000 per year,
compared with a national median of about $42,000.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the fans are from Los Angeles County and the
remainder mostly from the Inland Empire, usually transplanted fans
from New York, Cleveland and Boston who come to see their Yankees,
Indians and Red Sox--not the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, for Friday and Saturday's games [in Anaheim] we expect a
strong contingent of Yankees fans," Angels Marketing Director Robert
Alvarado said.</TE>
<TE>   He took the high road when asked if seeing Yankee blue mixed in
the stands with Angel red would raise the blood of an Anaheim
loyalist: "It's good for baseball. It helps build the sport when you
see the stands filled."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, fan interest in the Angels swelled as the summer
progressed. On Opening Day on March 31--a 6-0 loss to
Cleveland--there were dabs of red in the stands, like drops of blood,
reflecting the Angels' new vibrant team uniform.</TE>
<TE>   In June, attendance was off last year's pace. Then the Angels
began winning, and the fans came. On Sunday, the last regular-season
game, the stands looked like a rose garden.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think you were at a Nebraska Cornhuskers game, or a St.
Louis Cardinals game," Alvarado said. "It was unbelievable how that
conversion went, and the metamorphosis that took over."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the red is being worn by fair-weather fans drawn to a
winner. But some is also worn by longtime fans overcoming diminished
expectations for a team that hadn't been to the playoffs in 16 years,
and even then was bounced in the league championship series.</TE>
<TE>   "Fans have always been leery of the Angels, with the stories of
the meltdowns and their past history in the home-stretch," Alvarado
said. "People were just waiting to see if this time they were going
to move forward or fold."</TE>
<TE>   Missy Bustamente, 17, of La Palma, witnessed nearly every home
game of the Angels' miraculous rise. She bought some tickets with
help from her parents. "I don't get many birthday presents," she
joked. Season-ticket holders she knows slipped unused tickets to her,
as did some of the players' families she has befriended.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamente has tickets for the two games scheduled for Edison
Field on Friday and Saturday, but will miss the Friday game because
she has tickets to see "The Lion King."</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, Bustamente's seat for the opening game was in front of
the television set at her family's house, where they hosted about 10
of Bustamente's friends at an impromptu pizza playoff party.</TE>
<TE>   The scene was repeated across Orange County. At Chapman
University, student Alex Brewsaugh reserved a dorm rec room with a
big-screen TV for him and fellow Angels fans. And sports bars around
Edison Field had busy Tuesday Happy Hours as red-dressed fans piled
onto barstools to cheer and jeer.</TE>
<TE>   Brink and her husband had considered joining them, but decided
instead to convert their living room into an ersatz sports bar for a
few hours. Besides, after shelling out $420 for the next round of
playoff tickets, there wasn't much cash left for bar tabs.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be nice to have a good family night at home,"
Brink said over the din of Angels inflatable "thunder bats" being
pounded together.</TE>
<TE>   And the party was on.</TE>

<HD>Indigents' Health Care Gets a Boost</HD>
<DH>Medicine: County to increase the program's annual budget to
$47 million. Advocates say the system is still badly underfunded.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a plan to
reorganize medical care for the uninsured poor and agreed to provide
an additional $2 million for increased pharmacy costs.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisors voted 4 to 0 to revise the Medical Services for
Indigent program. Supervisor Jim Silva was absent.</LD>
<LD>   Plans to revise the county's indigent care program got a major
push in August, when UCI Medical Center officials announced they no
longer would take new patients who lived more than five miles from
the hospital in Orange or two miles from its satellite clinics in
Anaheim and Santa Ana.</LD>
<TE>   UC Irvine officials said they could not continue to treat the
largest share of the county's uninsured and that 24 other hospitals
contracting with the county needed to take more of the patients.</TE>
<TE>   The county reimburses only a portion of the costs for treating
indigent patients.</TE>
<TE>   The plan approved Tuesday increases to $47 million the amount the
county spends annually on the indigent care program. It also adds
many elements of managed care, including a case management system to
refer patients for appropriate care, whether to specialists or
skilled nursing facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The county also is negotiating with several hospitals to take
transfers from UCI and help equalize the patient load.</TE>
<TE>   But health-care advocates told supervisors the changes still don't
address the most important problem with the system: that it is badly
underfunded. Orange County is one of three counties in the state
without a county-run hospital.</TE>
<TE>   John Gilwee, vice president of the Hospital Assn. of Southern
California, which represents Orange County's acute care hospitals,
told supervisors that the county reimburses a hospital $167.10 for a
$1,000 stent that is commonly used in heart surgery. That doesn't
include the costs for the doctor, other skilled staff and equipment,
he told them.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also voted to transfer $7.2 million from the county's
share of national tobacco settlement funds to the Coalition of Orange
County Community Clinics. The organization will distribute the money
to its members to increase patient access to its clinics.</TE>
<TE>   Some clinics are expected to build exam rooms or buy mobile
health-care units, coalition executive officer Marty
Earlabaugh-Gordon said.</TE>

<LD>Len Casanova, 97, who won 82 games during his 16-year tenure as
football coach at the University of Oregon, died late Monday in
Eugene after a long illness.</LD>
<LD>   Casanova coached the Ducks from 1951 to 1966 and guided the team
to three bowl appearances, including a 10-7 loss to the top-ranked
Ohio State Buckeyes in the 1958 Rose Bowl. Casanova had an overall
82-73-8 record at Oregon, recording the second most wins in the
school's history, then spent four years as the school's athletic
director from 1967 to 1970. The athletic center at Autzen Stadium is
named after Casanova.</LD>
<LD>   "Everything that Oregon athletics is today, it owes to Len
Casanova," said Bill Moos, the current athletic director. "He has
been the pillar, the strength and the inspiration for our program for
over 50 years."</LD>
<TE>   Casanova, who had an overall record of 104-97-10, began his
college head coaching career in 1946 at his alma mater, Santa Clara
University. He led the school to a 21-13 win over Kentucky in the
1950 Orange Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   He spent one year at Pittsburgh before taking over at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   At Oregon, Casanova coached two future Hall of Famers--Mel Renfro
and Dave Wilcox--and helped assistants George Seifert, John McKay and
John Robinson start their own illustrious coaching careers.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Erna Furman, 76, an authority on the grief of parents and children
and the mother-child relationship, died of lung cancer Aug. 9 in
Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Furman was a child psychoanalyst with the Cleveland Center for
Child Research and Development and the Hanna Perkins Therapeutic
Nursery School for 50 years. She wrote nine books, including "A
Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement," written in
collaboration with Anna Freud.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Vienna, she fled with her family to Czechoslovakia to
escape the Nazis in 1938 when she was 12. She eluded the Nazis until
1942, when she was sent to the Terezin concentration camp near
Prague. She maintained a journal and drew portraits of other
prisoners, including many children. The artwork won critical praise
years later when it was exhibited in museums from Tokyo to Los
Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   After World War II she was educated at the Academy of Commerce in
Prague. She also studied in London with Freud, who later recommended
her for a position as a child analyst at the Cleveland Center and the
Hanna Perkins school.</TE>
<TE>   Her work on children and bereavement won the American Medical
Writers Assn. book award in 1975. She also was an honorary member of
the American Psychoanalytic Assn.</TE>

<LD>Sir John Rennie, 85, who kept a U.N. aid program for Palestinian
refugees going during conflict in the Middle East in the 1960s and
'70s, died Aug. 12 of a heart condition at his London home.</LD>
<LD>   Rennie joined the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine
Refugees in 1968 as deputy commissioner and later became commissioner
general. The agency was established in 1950 to care for Palestinians
made homeless by the creation of the state of Israel in 1948.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Glasgow, Scotland, and educated at Glasgow and Oxford
Universities, Rennie entered the British Colonial Administrative
Service, earning a knighthood when he was made governor of the Indian
Ocean island of Mauritius in 1962. He oversaw Mauritius' transition
from a British colony to an independent nation during his six-year
term. He remained for another six months as governor general and
personal representative of Queen Elizabeth II.</LD>
<TE>   He joined the refugee agency in Beirut at a time when it was
financially troubled and struggling to deal with the large numbers of
refugees created by the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and Lebanon's slide
toward civil war. He steered the agency through the 1973 Middle East
war and the outbreak of civil war in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Crippled by its location between warring factions in Beirut, the
agency moved to Vienna in 1975. Rennie retired two years later.</TE>

<LD>The Orange County district attorney's office has filed 17 felony
dumping charges against a Buena Park chrome-wheel manufacturing
company, its owner and three employees. The four men are accused of
discharging heavy metals, corrosive acid and other hazardous waste
into sewer and storm-drain systems.</LD>
<LD>   The defendants are the Ultra Wheel Corp. and its owner, James
Smith, 55, managers Michael Schott, 31, Paul Mayasich, 33, and
Gerardo Welti, 49.</LD>
<LD>   They are charged with 12 counts of dumping hazardous waste into
the sewer system and five counts of water and penal code violations
for dumping hazardous waste into the Coyote Creek flood control
channel.</LD>
<TE>   The four surrendered in court Tuesday and were released on their
own recognizance. The men face up to 11 years and six months in state
prison and $1 million in fines if convicted of all charges.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-year investigation by local, state and federal
agencies, the men were accused of dumping dangerous levels of heavy
metals and acids--residue from the wheel-plating operation--into the
sewer system in October 2000. The complaint also alleges that the
four men dumped similar waste into a storm drain that flows into
Coyote Creek, as well as directly putting machine coolants and other
hydrocarbons into the creek between November 1999 and September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   J. Craig Williams, an attorney representing the company and Smith,
said no illegal dumping occurred. Company officials "are cooperating
with the district attorney and they believe they're in full
compliance," he said.</TE>

<HD>Home Health-Care Workers Get a Raise</HD>
<DH>Labor: County approves $18 million in pay hikes while
implementing cost-cutting measures to reduce budget deficit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAREN BRISCOE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Minutes after deferring requests to increase spending on fighting
terrorism and organized crime, the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors on Tuesday approved raises worth $18 million for members
of a powerful health-care workers union.</LD>
<LD>   On a 3-2 party-line vote, the board's three Democratic supervisors
voted to give a 75-cents-an-hour pay increase to contract workers who
care for the county's homebound elderly, infirm and disabled.
Supporters welcomed the increase, which has been the subject of long
and contentious debates among the supervisors and between the board
and the union representing the workers.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Don Knabe sharply criticized the raises. He noted that
the supervisors granted the pay hikes even as they are implementing
cost-cutting measures intended to trim the $800-million budget
deficit that threatens to capsize the county health system. Knabe
called the raises "an $18-million miracle."</LD>
<TE>   But after a seven-year campaign for better pay and health
benefits, members of the Service International Employees Union, Local
434B, said the hourly pay hike--from $6.75 to $7.50--was long
overdue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a good first step," said union spokesman Timothy Jamal.</TE>
<TE>   The union's 85,000 workers earned the minimum wage until 1999,
when they unionized and were lauded by labor leaders as a model for
organizing low-wage minority and immigrant workers.</TE>
<TE>   Building on that early momentum, the union in 2000 demanded, and
got, Gov. Gray Davis to approve a pay raise to $7.50 an hour plus
health insurance. Davis also called for a $1-an-hour increase for
four years.</TE>
<TE>   The raises, though, proved easier to achieve in principle than in
fact, partly because of a complex formula by which the workers' wages
are paid.</TE>
<TE>   The program that pays the workers, the Personal Assistance
Services Council, receives about 80% of its money from state and
federal funds, leaving Los Angeles County responsible for the other
20%.</TE>
<TE>   Arguing that the state should shoulder the costs of pay increases,
county officials initially refused to provide matching funds, and
earlier this year the union tried to secure the raises through a
ballot initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors sought to kill the ballot measure in December,
voting in a closed-door meeting to order their lawyer to prevent it
from appearing on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   A judge ruled that the vote was illegal, then later found that the
initiative itself was unconstitutional and should not appear on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "It pains me that a year's worth of raises were held up for
political reasons," said Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who moved
Tuesday to have the county release $18 million set aside in the
budget earlier this year to pay for the raises. "We ought to get on
with it, put our divisions behind us and work with [the union]
together."</TE>
<TE>   Calling the raises "another unfunded mandate," Supervisor Mike
Antonovich voted against them. "What the governor has adroitly done
is pass [the cost of the raises] to local governments," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Home health aides who work fewer than 112 hours a month will still
be without health benefits, union officials said, and even with the
raises, they will earn less than the minimum hourly wage the county
requires contractors to pay their workers. County contractors are
generally required to pay at least $8.32 an hour.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 35-year-old substitute teacher already charged with more than a
dozen counts of having sex with his students was arrested Monday on
four new charges.</LD>
<LD>   Todd J. Haluch of Huntington Beach had been free after posting
$250,000 bond on the original charges, but a Superior Court judge
increased his bail by $250,000 and returned him to jail. He was
ordered to return to court Oct. 16 to enter a plea.</LD>
<LD>   Haluch was originally charged with 13 counts of sexual abuse
involving four girls ranging in age from 13 to 17. Newport Beach
Police Sgt. Steve Shulman said the four new charges resulted after
authorities learned of a fifth alleged victim.</LD>
<TE>   Shulman said Haluch taught at Pacifica High School in Garden Grove
from 1996 to 1998, Huntington Beach and Ocean View high schools from
1997 to 1999, TeWinkle Middle School in Costa Mesa from 1999 to 2000
and Corona del Mar High from 1999 to 2000.</TE>

<HD>$25,000 in Sports Jerseys Stolen at Camarillo Mall</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to hit a home run on the black market, robbers struck a
Camarillo sports shop and stole several shopping bags stuffed with
high-end collector's jerseys worth $25,000, police and store
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "These were the authentic ones, the real ones like the players
wear on the field," said Daryl Brown, director of loss prevention for
Just Sports, a nationwide chain of 60 stores specializing in sports
items.</LD>
<LD>   Brown said the robbers, reported to be males though the number is
uncertain, took more than 100 basketball, baseball and football
jerseys, which retail for about $250 each. The store, which is
licensed by several pro sports leagues to carry the shirts, also
offers mini-football helmets, team flags for mounting on vehicle
windows and snapshots of popular players.</LD>
<TE>   According to Sheriff's Sgt. Bill Ayub, the robbers struck shortly
before closing time, entering the shop in the outlet mall on Ventura
Boulevard about 8:45 p.m. Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said one of the robbers sneaked up on the lone clerk
and knocked him down. They said one or two other robbers then stuffed
the bags with the shirts and fled.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said detectives plan to investigate whether the
robbery was an inside job. The clerk on duty was fired Tuesday after
giving his bosses varying versions of the holdup, Brown said.</TE>

<HD>State to Revamp Online Tax Filing</HD>
<DH>Computers: Software companies that charge for the service
are upset by the free competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The software industry lost a round Tuesday when the state tax agency
reversed itself and voted to upgrade California's free electronic
tax-filing system.</LD>
<LD>   To the dismay of a small band of high-tech industry lobbyists, the
board voted to revamp the state's file-by-computer system so that it
does simple arithmetic for taxpayers and automatically calculates
taxes owed.</LD>
<LD>   The vote escalates a dispute between public service providers and
private firms. State tax agencies including California's Franchise
Tax Board say they are trying to help taxpayers by letting them file
free by computer. Private companies that make tax preparation
software, and typically charge $5 to $30 to file, call it an
unnecessary intrusion on their turf.</LD>
<TE>   One businessman complained that Tuesday's vote would eventually
kill his electronic tax-filing company. "We can't compete with the
enormous resources of the Franchise Tax Board," said C.C. Chen,
president of C&amp;S Technologies Inc. in San Jose. His firm planned to
charge $5 to $10 to file a tax return next year.</TE>
<TE>   In March, protests from the computer industry and concerns by some
lawmakers about privacy stalled the tax board's effort to create a
Web site that would calculate income taxes for residents using the
540 "2EZ" form, the state's simplest tax form. Roughly 4.3 million
people who earn less than $50,000 as individuals or $100,000 as
married couples are eligible to use it.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) and Assemblyman Robert Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks) said they feared that tax auditors would be able to
track keystrokes and use that information to target taxpayers for
audits.</TE>
<TE>   State Controller Kathleen Connell, who heads the Franchise Tax
Board, began meeting with representatives of Intuit Inc., H&amp;R Block,
IBM, FileYourTaxes.com and the Computer &amp; Communications Industry
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   They agreed that the state would not provide math calculations or
a tax-table search on its Web form for the 2001 tax season. Instead,
taxpayers would have to download a form, print it, fill it out using
a pen and calculator, then log back in, enter the data and hit
"send."</TE>
<TE>   The tax board launched such a system two weeks ago. Nine taxpayers
who had received extensions have so far used it to file their 2001
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The board surprised the software industry Tuesday by suddenly
abandoning the March agreement and voting unanimously to enhance the
form 540 "2EZ" online filing system, available online at
www.ftb.ca.gov.</TE>
<TE>   The board members said they wanted to make the system more
practical for taxpayers so as not to lag behind the 23 states that
already offer electronic tax filing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is about customer service," Connell said. She dismissed
fears that the tax agency would violate taxpayer privacy as
"camouflage" intended to slow progress, and Peace said Tuesday that
the tax board staff had allayed his concerns in a demonstration of
how the system would work.</TE>

<LD>A piece of land at the former Tustin Marine base that triggered a
bitter showdown between Tustin and Santa Ana officials this year
could be too contaminated for use as a school, according to
environmental tests.</LD>
<LD>   The news comes as a blow to plans by the Santa Ana Unified School
District to build a combined elementary and middle school on the
22-acre site.</LD>
<LD>   District officials said Tuesday that they hadn't completely
reviewed an analysis of soil and gas samples taken in August. The
findings will be discussed at the district's Oct. 8 meeting. The
board must formally decide whether to reject the land.</LD>
<TE>   However, the property definitely is contaminated, district Supt.
Al Mijares said. The state allows schools to be built only on
pristine land.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said we didn't have the money or the time to
ameliorate contamination," Mijares said.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin City Manager William A. Huston said the Navy cleaned the
property to federal standards before it was released. He said the
district can reject the property no matter how much contamination
under state standards is found.</TE>
<TE>   "If it costs one dollar to clean up and they don't want to do it,
that's fine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of the property would return Santa Ana Unified to square
one in its search for a school site.</TE>
<TE>   The district is among the most crowded in the state and faces a
shortage of usable land. School officials hope to build six
elementary schools and three high schools in the next seven years.
Those plans, however, have encountered opposition from some
neighborhood groups worried about traffic and noise.</TE>
<TE>   The latest news comes amid other district worries over its
agreement with Tustin. In addition to the land deal, the plan calls
for the city to pay the district $38 million. The city would pay
another $22 million if the land is rejected. The money would be paid
over time.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin also pledged to give the Santa Ana district a letter of
credit that could be used for an immediate loan to fund construction.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin officials, however, have said they cannot provide a letter
of credit. Instead, they propose giving the district a deed of trust
for about 100 acres of base land.</TE>

obtaining a loan more complicated and costly.</TE>
<TE>   Sorting out the details could place the district and city at
odds--again.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been one of these long and endless journeys for us,"
Mijares said.</TE>
<TE>   Huston said the city tried to obtain a letter of credit with a
bank but couldn't, given current economic jitters. "We concluded
after weeks and weeks that deal was contrary to the city's interest,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin and Santa Ana Unified spent eight years tussling over
building a school at the 1,600-acre base. The city argued that it
could not give up land within the district's boundaries without
jeopardizing its redevelopment plan. The land was needed for sale to
commercial developers to help pay for improvements such as streets,
sewers and utilities, city officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The quarrel threatened Tustin's redevelopment plans. A state law
passed last year prohibited the city from approving other base
development projects until the matter was resolved. The fight
triggered a flurry of lawsuits.</TE>

<HD>Counting on Airport Ire for Votes</HD>
<DH>Election: Proponents of Valley and Hollywood independence
are hoping the city's coastal residents, angry over management of
LAX, will support breakup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every few minutes, another airplane slices through the Westchester
sky. Twenty miles away, secessionists in the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood are counting on those jets, buzzing into Los Angeles
International Airport like angry bumblebees, to help carry them to
victory in November.</LD>
<LD>   Some Westchester residents are so upset about the city's
management of LAX, the theory goes, that they will turn out in droves
to vote for a municipal breakup.</LD>
<LD>   Separatists say the airport's noise, pollution and potential
expansion aren't the only aggravations they can tap in Los Angeles'
coastal communities. There's also the controversial Playa Vista
development near the Ballona wetlands, not to mention the City
Council's recent decision to move the 6th District, which included
parts of Westchester and Venice, to the East Valley. That deprived
residents of their longtime councilwoman, Ruth Galanter.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a great deal of support for letting the Valley and
Hollywood secede," said Rex Frankel, a Westchester environmentalist
who has fought Playa Vista and the city's airport expansion plans.
"In a smaller city, the people who live here would have a greater
ability to protect their community from overdevelopment and
pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Frankel predicted that many coastal residents--linked through
environmental and homeowner groups--will vote to break up Los Angeles
in the Nov. 5 election, in part out of self-interest. He said
secession advocates in the area plan to form a political action
committee to raise money for a campaign of block parties and coffee
klatches.</TE>
<TE>   Other activists along the city's shoreline, however, worry that
rent control and protections for low-wage workers could wilt if the
city splits. Lacking guarantees that such laws would be preserved,
some have resolved to oppose secession.</TE>
<TE>   On the streets of Westchester and Venice, the breakup question
elicited a wide range of responses, at least among those who were
aware that secession is on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Some--particularly in the artsy enclaves of Venice--had a
live-and-let-live attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd vote for it, I guess," said Robert Karron, 33, a stay-at-home
dad walking his shaggy dog along a side street off Abbot Kinney
Boulevard. "I mean, if they really want to leave, why shouldn't they
be able to? That seems fair."</TE>
<TE>   Inside Abbot's Habit coffee shop, a corner hangout decorated with
plaid tablecloths and psychedelic art, Jason Dzubak took the opposite
view. A fund-raiser for nonprofit groups who grew up in Venice,
Dzubak, 31, said Valley secession would be anything but fair.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would be great for the Valley, but it would hurt the
rest of the city," he said. "There's a lot of dough from the Valley
that goes to our social service programs. That's a big chunk of money
that's going to be gone."</TE>
<TE>   Though still touched by poverty and gang violence, Venice has been
swept by a wave of gentrification that has transformed dirt lots into
artists' lofts and driven rents and home prices through the roof.</TE>
<TE>   The median home price here is now $625,000, making Venice's cozy
beach bungalows the most expensive properties per square foot in Los
Angeles County, after a slice of Santa Monica. Trendy boutiques
catering to wealthy hipsters have sprouted along Abbot Kinney,
offering jars of bath salts for $23 and faded corduroy jeans for $118
a pair.</TE>
<TE>   Concerned about the evaporation of affordable housing, some
progressive activists are opposed to secession for fear that a new
Valley or Hollywood city might erode renters' rights. Secessionists
have asked candidates for office in the proposed cities to sign
pledges to adopt rent control, which most have done.</TE>
<TE>   But after much soul-searching, Venice housing advocate Sheila
Bernard decided the pledges aren't enough. Once a firm supporter of
secession, Bernard recently changed her mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I have very mixed feelings on this issue, because I support
smaller cities," she said with a deep sigh. "But I believe renters'
rights should take precedence over separating the city. Even though
people signed that pledge ... there aren't any candidates who have
strong track records on this. They have nothing that anyone can
trust."</TE>
<TE>   A few miles away in Westchester, where beachgoers in sunglasses
give way to cars chugging along boulevards lined with big-box stores,
several residents expressed surprise that secessionists are counting
on them--and their supposed anger at the city--to fuel a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Airport noise? "You get accustomed to it," said Pat Banas, 76,
with a dismissive wave of the hand. For 30 years, the white-haired
woman has owned a flower shop in Westchester and lived in Playa del
Rey near an LAX runway.</TE>
<TE>   She blames airport pollution for particulate matter found in her
lungs, but she said secession will not solve her community's
problems. She is voting against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally feel that most of the people in the Valley don't get
the representation that they should have. But then, we don't either,"
she said. "All these little areas need a stronger voice."</TE>
<TE>   Banas believes that splitting Los Angeles into boroughs is the
best solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be difficult for the Valley to carry on" as an
independent city, she said. "It's going to cost them so much money,
they'll go right into debt."</TE>
<TE>   To pass, the secession measures must win a majority of votes
citywide, as well as within the regions seeking independence.
Breakaway backers have so far focused their get-out-the-vote efforts
on the Valley and Hollywood, hoping that other
communities--especially those thought to be disenchanted with city
government--will organize themselves to campaign for the cause.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no one has approached Leon Peterson, a 53-year-old
inventory specialist at a Westchester office supply company, to ask
for his vote. But he said he can see why the Valley wants to leave
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Peterson spent a few pleasant years living in Chatsworth in the
1990s and recalls there was much less crime there than in urbanized
parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll vote for it," he said of Valley cityhood. "You've got all
these other different little cities like Commerce, so why not the
Valley? I don't think we'll lose anything, because people will still
commute into Los Angeles to work."</TE>
<TE>   Peterson said he had yet to form an opinion about Hollywood
secession. The Hollywood proposal is much more recent than the
6-year-old Valley plan, and not as well known.</TE>
<TE>   Across Sepulveda Boulevard, Elizabeth Arkin rushed to her job at a
weight-loss clinic. She said she didn't understand the secessionists'
reasoning--or care much about the Valley or Hollywood--but she
thought that maybe Westchester would benefit if the city were
smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if they break off, there's so much more that could be
done for the city itself. Maybe the money will come toward fixing the
sidewalks here," said Arkin, 42.</TE>
<TE>   "Let the Valley take care of the Valley, and the rest of Los
Angeles take care of us."</TE>

<LD>A Ventura woman convicted 13 years ago of driving drunk and killing
three people has been accused of violating her probation by allegedly
consuming alcohol again, authorities said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Mannes, 48, is scheduled to appear in court today to either
admit or deny that she had been drinking on Sept. 5 at a friend's
house in the 1200 block of Anchor's Way in Ventura, according to
authorities.</LD>
<LD>   Mannes could face up to 180 days in jail, authorities said. If she
denies the accusation, a hearing will be scheduled.</LD>
<TE>   She remained in jail Tuesday night on $10,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Mannes was convicted two years ago of driving drunk and public
intoxication.</TE>
<TE>   As a term of her probation, she was ordered not to consume any
alcohol for three years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, Mannes was convicted of driving drunk on the Ventura
Freeway and causing a crash that killed Darin Mullins, 20, Joshua
Oxenreider, 19, and Jacob Boyd, 14. She served about four years in
prison.</TE>

<LD>A Fillmore man was shot in the arm late Monday and detectives were
investigating whether it was retaliation for a weekend stabbing that
involved rival gang members, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Emanuel Reyes, 21, was walking from his house to his car in the
700 block of 2nd Street when four men in hooded sweatshirts walked up
to him about 10:45 p.m. and asked him about his gang ties,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   After Reyes told the group he was not a gang member, one of the
men shot at him several times before the group fled in a car,
according to Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Ernie Montagna.</LD>
<TE>   Reyes was treated at a Ventura hospital and later released.
Authorities said the assailants remained at-large.</TE>
<TE>   Early Saturday, an Oxnard man was stabbed in the chest and his
friend stabbed in the leg during a gang brawl on Old Telephone Road
in Fillmore.</TE>
<TE>   Both men survived and the case also remains under investigation.</TE>

<HD>Workers Picket at Port of Hueneme</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seeking public support, dozens of dockworkers staged informational
pickets Tuesday at the Port of Hueneme as part of a West Coast labor
dispute that has halted cargo activity from San Diego to Seattle.</LD>
<LD>   For a second day, two vessels were idled at the port--one carrying
a load of Del Monte bananas from Ecuador, another containing liquid
fertilizer--as shippers and terminal operators continued their
lockout of members of the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union. Two more ships have sat anchored offshore since Monday and
another is scheduled to arrive along the coastline today.</LD>
<LD>   About 40 to 50 union members plan to continue around-the-clock
picketing at the port's main entrance and exits and at the Oxnard
Harbor District offices as long as needed, said Janet Ritza,
secretary-treasurer of the union's Local 46, which represents the
area's dockworkers.</LD>
<TE>   Union representatives, angered by the presence of armed security
guards, walked out of a meeting with the Pacific Maritime Assn. on
Tuesday in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations have stalled over the Pacific Maritime Assn.'s desire
to introduce technology to speed up cargo handling, a move that would
eliminate hundreds of union jobs. The union wants minimum staffing
levels, jurisdiction over all technology-related jobs and control
over information once it enters the ports.</TE>
<TE>   Saying union members, especially at ports in Long Beach and Los
Angeles, staged a work slowdown and other disruptions, employers
contend workers would be shut out until they agree to sign a new
contract or extend one that expired June 1.</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime, the food is spoiling in the ships and everything
is waiting to be delivered," Ritza said. Locally, union members earn
an average of $59,000 a year, although some, such as foremen, make
more than $100,000, according to union officials.</TE>
<TE>   While a prolonged cargo stoppage could have devastating effects,
Ventura County Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail said exports of
local oranges and lemons are at a seasonal lull.</TE>
<TE>   The picking of lemons and Valencia oranges is winding down, and it
will be another few weeks before navel oranges are harvested.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it couldn't have happened at a better time, but it's
definitely going to impact us," McPhail said. "There's probably fruit
in cold storage [at the port] that's ready to go....We're probably
going to have to reinspect to make sure it's OK to be sent out."</TE>
<TE>   With shipping times of six or seven days to Pacific Rim locales,
including Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore, McPhail said citrus may be
converted to juice or thrown away, depending on how long it is stuck
at the port.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Wootton, vice president of corporate relations for Sunkist
Growers, said that if the shutdown continues, the growers'
cooperative probably will retrieve its fruit from refrigerated
warehouses at the port and divert it to other U.S. markets until it
can resume exports.</TE>
<TE>   "We're hopeful this is not going to be a long, protracted
shutdown," Wootton said. Sunkist exports an average of 5.5 million
cartons of oranges, lemons and grapefruit, valued at $84.5 million,
out of the port annually.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to accurately assess what idling the port will mean
to the Ventura County economy, said Mark Schniepp, director of the
California Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara. The port handles about
$1 billion in cargo annually, but how much of that business will be
postponed or lost forever is unknown.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd say that the impact is relatively negligible for now,"
Schniepp said. "Sure, it'll be a few hundred thousand dollars, but
that's such a small amount in the big picture. But if this goes on
for two or three weeks, things get to be a lot more dicey. You might
have certain contracts canceled, and there are perishable cargoes
that will be ruined."</TE>
<TE>   Will Berg, marketing director for the port, said the Tricolor, a
car carrier, has been stuck offshore since Monday with 1,459 vehicles
destined for U.S. dealerships. An additional 1,500 cars are expected
to be held offshore today when the Barcelona drops anchor.</TE>
<TE>   As the port landlord, the Oxnard Harbor District is not a direct
party to the negotiations, but its leases are based, in part, on
collecting fees as ships come to port and when cargo moves across the
wharves. Berg said the harbor district estimates it will lose about
$20,000 in such fees daily during the lockout.</TE>

<HD>MTA Subway Plan Faces Many Hurdles</HD>
<DH>Transit: Effort to extend spur down Wilshire would face
funding and approval problems.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles does have the nation's worst traffic, so perhaps it
should come as no surprise that whenever the city considers a
showpiece transit project, up pops a serious roadblock.</LD>
<LD>   Want to build a rail network down the middle of freeways? Too
expensive. Want to create dedicated bus lanes? Too political. Want a
monorail? Too many NIMBYs--not in my backyards.</LD>
<LD>   How about, as county transit officials began discussing again last
Thursday, trying to extend the subway down Wilshire Boulevard to the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art?</LD>
<TE>   Will it happen any time soon? Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would
have to leapfrog several difficult roadblocks to extend the line
beyond its end point at Western Avenue--from a shrinking capital
budget to legal and political wrangling to the immense power of a
longtime congressman whose moves have derailed subway plans for 16
years.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the MTA is bringing this back up is amazing," said
professor Brian Taylor, director of UCLA's Institute of
Transportation Studies. "The conditions on Wilshire, the mix of dense
housing, businesses and foot traffic, are perfect for a subway. The
ridership, just with this small extension, would be very high....
[But] the agency faces a real dilemma. It's going to be very
difficult" to get built.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that, the MTA hopes to take on the project in
incremental steps. First the agency would seek a small amount of
money from Washington, probably about $150 million for engineering,
when Congress adopts a six-year financial package next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Second, sometime around 2009, when Congress considers another
federal transit funding package, the MTA would ask for construction
money. If the MTA's history is any guide, a three-mile stretch could
cost close to $1 billion, at least half of which would come from
federal coffers.</TE>
<TE>   None of this will be possible without clearing the first
roadblock: "Henry Waxman," said Taylor, referring to the Democratic
congressman from Los Angeles. "He's the key. Without him, this goes
nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the MTA board directed the agency to seek repeal of a
16-year-old congressional ban on subway tunneling in the Fairfax
district. The ban, created at Waxman's behest in 1986, was the
product of concerns about tunneling in an area soaked with
underground oil and gas pockets.</TE>
<TE>   Since then the MTA has repeatedly said technology exists to vent
gas, prevent fires and make the subways safe. But in an interview
after last week's MTA vote, Waxman said the agency faces an uphill
climb.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't seen anything to prove the safety issue can be
relieved," Waxman said. "My paramount concern is safety. If it can be
shown that there are technologies that exist now to make things
safer, I would be open to listen. But right now, I'm not backing
off."</TE>
<TE>   Waxman added that he remains very skeptical of the MTA, which
botched numerous aspects of its 17-mile subway network during
construction in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses suffered and closed along the construction path,
buildings were damaged, a sinkhole nearly devoured a Hollywood
intersection, and cost overruns meant some sections of the railway
cost $300 million per mile.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there has been no groundswell of public support that might
lead Waxman to change his mind. "It's been silent. I've heard nothing
from my constituency," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Waxman had a change of heart, the MTA would need to
persuade Congress to loosen its purse strings for three miles of
underground railway.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just not likely to happen," said Kenneth Orski, a transit
expert based in Washington. Orski said the climate has changed since
the 1980s and early '90s, days of the "big money subways like they
had in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Congress and the Federal Transit Administration operate
under a "build more for less money" philosophy, he said. Instead of
subways, light rail and expansive dedicated bus lanes, projects that
are usually at least half the cost of subways, are the rage in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Still another political hurdle comes in the form of a 1998
referendum, sponsored by MTA board member and county Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, that prevents local sales tax money from being used to
match federal dollars on subways.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky wrote the referendum because of the MTA's poor track
record in subway building; it stopped both a planned rail tunnel to
East Los Angeles and a subway spur that would have swooped from
Wilshire into the Mid-City area.</TE>
<TE>   In an unexpected twist, Yaroslavsky backed the MTA's Wilshire
extension plans last week. Still, he made it clear after voting that
he would not stand for a repeal of his legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Without a steady source of local funding, the MTA would probably
have to turn to Sacramento, as it did to help pay for a small stretch
of tunnel that's part of an East Los Angeles light-rail line slated
for construction next year. Getting money from Sacramento could prove
more difficult than ever, considering that the state just wrestled
with a difficult budget crunch and projects another one next year.</TE>
<TE>   Another way around the local ban would be for the MTA to use bond
funds, drawn against money from the bus system.</TE>
<TE>   That method is unlikely to sit well with Donald T. Bliss, a
Washington mediator overseeing a federal court order that mandates
more bus service to reduce crowding.</TE>
<TE>   For at least the next four years, Bliss has the power to make the
MTA purchase buses, hundreds of them if he thinks they're needed to
reduce overcrowding. Subway planning could be seriously compromised
if Bliss were to order enough buses--say 300 more, each costing more
than $200,000 a year to operate--to drain the MTA's coffers.</TE>
<TE>   If the Wilshire plan passes its Washington roadblocks and makes
its way around the local funding issue, there's the matter of public
support, a key factor in any transit construction project in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Residents and businesses all along Wilshire have for decades been
divided on whether a subway makes sense. Little has changed.
Proponents think the subway could boost a bustling neighborhood that
has some of the city's best architecture and greatest housing
density. The sprawling Park La Brea apartment complex, with 4,200
units, is an easy walk to Fairfax and Wilshire, for instance.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait for something like this to happen," said Yeong
Cheong, who runs an acupuncture business across the street from the
county art museum. "A subway would bring more people, make my
business better and make places like the museum more popular."</TE>
<TE>   The proprietor of a business just a few feet from Cheong's
reflected the other side of the equation. "It would be a disaster,"
said Calvin Williams, a furniture store owner.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that construction on the Wilshire link to Western killed
many businesses, Williams said he worried that he would suffer the
same fate. "Construction is going to close down streets and make it
so I can't survive. Even if the subway went in, my customers don't
take the subway, they come in cars."</TE>
<TE>   Also worried is a group of transit advocates who have fought hard
for the MTA's planned light-rail line connecting downtown to Santa
Monica via Exposition Boulevard. Right now, the MTA is seeking
federal money for the first half of the Expo Line, meaning the
railway would stretch only from downtown to near Culver City. With at
least $200 million more needed to finish the second phase of the
line, the advocates are concerned that a Wilshire extension could
compete for those dollars.</TE>

<LD>   Nothing personal, against Salmon in particular or the Angels in
general. Four outs away from victory in Tuesday's playoff opener, the
Angels were stung by the New York Yankees' latest October magic
trick.</LD>
<TE>   With two out in the eighth inning, and none on, the Yankees got
two walks, a score-tying single from Jason Giambi and the
game-winning home run from Bernie Williams, as a 5-4 Angel lead
turned into a stunning 8-5 defeat, in a fashion dramatically quick
and utterly painful.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels lost the first game of this best-of-five American
League division series, with ace Jarrod Washburn on the mound, and
they must somehow fend off Andy Pettitte and Mike Mussina to have the
chance to use Washburn again.</TE>
<TE>   In their previous two postseason games at Yankee Stadium, the
Yankees tied both on home runs with two out in the ninth inning, one
by Tino Martinez and one by Scott Brosius. Those men don't play here
any more, but the mystique carries on for the men wearing pinstripes.
This time, Williams was the hero, winning the game in the Yankees'
final at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   "I've seen too many Yankee games in the postseason where they hit
those kinds of home runs," said Salmon, playing in the first
postseason game of his 11-year career. "I've been watching them for
years on TV, and now it was happening to us."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, resilient so often this season, bravely vowed to shake
this one off too.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not devastated," closer Troy Percival said. "It's a game we
could have won and probably should have won, but we've had games like
that this year. We'll come back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "It's not the end of the world."</TE>
<TE>   No, but the Angels can see the end of the season from here. It's
two losses away, and the Angels already have played their ace.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels played so well, for so long, and still lost. They came
from behind three times. They exhausted Roger Clemens, forcing the
venerable Yankee starter from the game in the sixth inning, after 113
pitches. They turned four double plays. Third baseman Troy Glaus hit
two home runs, one off Clemens that tied the score, 4-4, in the sixth
and one off Ramiro Mendoza that gave the Angels a 5-4 lead in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   In franchise history, the Angels have played 17 postseason games;
Glaus is the first Angel to hit two homers in one of them. And, in a
play reminiscent of his days as the UCLA shortstop, Glaus was the
middleman on a rarely seen 3-5-3 double play. With Giambi up in the
sixth, Glaus was in the shortstop spot, with the other three
infielders shifted to the right side.</TE>
<TE>   If not for the Yankees' magic show, Glaus would have been the
hero, with an assist to Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn closed the regular season by giving up three home runs in
his last 45 innings. He gave up three in five innings Tuesday--to
Giambi, Derek Jeter and Rondell White--but he breezed through seven
innings, in an economical 81 pitches. That allows the Angels to start
him in Game 4 of the series, if they get there.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia insisted he did not remove Washburn after
seven innings so he would be better prepared to start Game 4, on
three days' rest. Scioscia said he was playing to win this game, that
Washburn had started to appear tired on a hot and humid night, that
he had confidence in the bullpen with the best earned-run average in
the league.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn said he "felt great" and "lobbied a little bit" to remain
in the game but also said he backed his manager. The Angels never got
the three outs they needed to get to Percival.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Weber got two outs, then walked Alfonso Soriano, then walked
Jeter. Scott Schoeneweis, whose sole role in this series is to get
Giambi out, replaced Weber and gave up a game-tying single to Giambi,
a hard-hit ground ball that deflected off the glove of first baseman
Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   In his last four at-bats against Schoeneweis, Giambi has reached
base every time, on three singles and a hit-by-pitch. In five career
at-bats against Percival, Giambi has struck out every time.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan Donnelly replaced Schoeneweis, and Williams homered.</TE>
<TE>   As three relievers failed to protect the lead, Percival watched
from the bullpen. He had warmed up, but he never got into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been doing this too long to get frustrated over something
like that," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels needed Percival to get the last out of the eighth
inning, a situation in which Scioscia has employed Percival four
times this season. But he passed on Percival against Jeter, opting to
preserve the Schoeneweis-Giambi matchup.</TE>
<TE>   And after Giambi's single tied the score, Scioscia chose not to
use his closer in a tie game.</TE>
<TE>   While their playoff-tested manager was second-guessed from here to
California, the Angel players--none of whom had ever played in a
postseason game--acquitted themselves nicely under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   They enjoyed the festivities, the incessant noise, the military
fly-by, the pregame introductions by legendary Yankee public address
announcer Bob Sheppard--"the voice of God, basically," Angel coach
Joe Maddon said.</TE>
<TE>   Rudy Giuliani was here, and Donald Trump, and Regis Philbin too.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels got the final-inning answer wrong Tuesday. They get
another chance tonight, with no margin for error.</TE>

<TE>   PLAY BY PLAY</TE>
<TE>   FIRST INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Yankees 0--David Eckstein hit a line drive off
third baseman Robin Ventura's glove and beat the throw to first.
Darin Erstad sacrificed, though replays showed he beat the throw to
first. Tim Salmon struck out looking. Garret Anderson hit a fly ball
to left. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 1, Angels 0--Alfonso Soriano popped out to
second. Derek Jeter homered above the 399 sign in left-center. Jason
Giambi singled to right. Bernie Williams hit a hard smash to Troy

<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 1, Angels 0--Brad Fullmer grounded back to the

<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Yankees 1--Eckstein tried to beat out a bunt,
but was thrown out by Ventura. Erstad hit a line drive down the
right-field line and Mondesi played the carom perfectly to hold
Erstad to a single. Erstad stole second and took third when Posada's
throw went into center. Salmon singled to left, Erstad scoring.
Despite the fact Salmon was going on the pitch, Anderson grounded
into a 4-6-3 double play. One run, two hits, none left.</TE>

Giambi homered to deep right-center. While Yankee Stadium was still
roaring from the two-run homer, Williams grounded a single to left.
Angel pitching coach Bud Black visited the mound to calm down Jarrod
Washburn. It must have worked, because Posada grounded into a 6-4-3
double play. Mondesi popped to short. Two runs, two hits, none left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 3, Yankees 3--Molina flied to center. Kennedy

hit, none left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Yankees 4--Erstad singled to center. Salmon

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In 1989, the baseball team at South Hills High in West Covina
included four players who would make the major leagues--Yankee first
baseman Jason Giambi, Angel designated hitter Shawn Wooten, Oakland
pitcher Cory Lidle and a pitcher named Aaron Small, who spent parts
of five seasons in the majors, with four teams.</LD>
<LD>   "The thing that's amazing," Wooten said, "is the one guy that was
drafted out of high school was Aaron Small."</LD>
<LD>   Giambi walked on at Long Beach State, became a freshman
All-American, "and the rest is history," Wooten said.</LD>
<TE>   Wooten, who will be in the Angel lineup today, said he enjoys
catching up with Giambi but seldom calls. The last two times he
called, Wooten said, were in December, to congratulate Giambi for
signing his $120-million contract, and two years ago, to salute him
for his MVP award.</TE>
<TE>   "I have his cell phone number," Wooten said, "but he's a busy
guy."</TE>

<TE>   The Walt Disney Co. has formally asked major league officials for
approval to share the Angels' confidential financial information with
the Nederlander family, sources said Tuesday. That is the first step
in the sale process, allowing a potential buyer to review the team's
books before considering a formal bid. Approval is expected shortly,
as two Nederlander brothers are minority partners in the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has not yet asked permission on behalf of Carlos Peralta,
the Mexican billionaire interested in buying the team. The background
check that precedes approval will not be routine in the case of
Peralta, whom Mexican authorities charged with tax evasion in 1997.
The charge was dropped after Peralta paid up.</TE>
<TE>   Peralta attended Sunday's game at Edison Field. The Angels
provided him with a luxury suite for the day, spokesman Tim Mead
said, but he did not meet with any Disney officials at the game.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman who has pursued the
purchase of the team for months, has all but been eliminated from
consideration. Disney has declined comment about Watkins, but several
major league executives said Disney is no more convinced of Watkins'
financial capacity than were the Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   In May, after Watkins pursued the purchase of the Twins, team
President Jerry Bell wrote to state legislators that Watkins had not
demonstrated the ability "to secure $150 million in funds that are
fully committed and readily accessible." *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' emphasis on hit-and-run plays, more so than stolen
bases, will be tested tonight. Andy Pettitte, the Yankees' starter,
has one of the best pickoff moves in the major leagues. Since he made
his debut in 1995, he has picked off 67 runners, most in the majors
during that time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Yankee fans didn't just heckle Angel center fielder Darin
Erstad about the Angels. During batting practice, one fan heckled
Erstad, a former Nebraska punter, about a Cornhusker football team
that has lost its past two games by a combined score of 76-21.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad turned to the fan and said, "One year out of 40, they're
bad."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>

<TE>   With the news that Met Manager Bobby Valentine had been fired
Tuesday and the media mob patrolling Yankee Stadium before the game
in search of stories, Yankee coaches became the source of hot
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   First base coach Lee Mazzilli, himself a former Met and a former
roommate of Valentine, was surrounded by reporters, but he said he
had not been contacted.</TE>
<TE>   Third base coach Willie Randolph, who will interview for the
opening in Detroit, also was labeled a Met candidate.</TE>
<TE>   And Manager Joe Torre did nothing to discourage the speculation,
saying he thought Randolph would make a good manager. "Again I think
just about everybody on my coaching staff would make a good manager,"
Torre said. "I certainly hope some of my coaches do get that
opportunity when the time comes."</TE>
<TE>   Torre said managing in New York was highly emotional.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, the highs are very high as we both experienced a couple
of years ago in the World Series," the Yankee manager said. "when
things don't go well, you get fired. We've both been fired by the
Mets."</TE>

<HD>Yankee Staying Power Is Name of This Game</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Williams' three-run homer in eighth inning keeps
inconspicuous Angels on losing end again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>In Southern California, the return of the Angels to postseason play
is big news. But here in New York, they are only another nameless,
faceless opponent, their division series only another preliminary
match on what the Yankees hope will be yet another run to a
championship.</LD>
<LD>   Cruel, but true.</LD>
<LD>   Bernie Williams proved it Tuesday night in the interview room
where he was discussing his game-winning eighth-inning home run
against Angel reliever Brendan Donnelly that gave the Yankees an 8-5
victory.</LD>
<TE>   Williams was asked if he was surprised Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
had not brought in closer Troy Percival to face him.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess Mike was just taking a chance on the fact that I haven't
faced Donaldson," Williams said.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson?</TE>
<TE>   Williams, having glanced around the room and seeing all the
puzzled faces, leaned over to a Yankee official and asked for the
name of the man he had just added to the long list of Angel victims
of a 40-year curse.</TE>
<TE>   "Donnelly," he was told.</TE>
<TE>   Big name or no name, Donnelly wasn't someone Williams stepped in
against with any degree of confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what to expect," Williams acknowledged. "Once I saw
two pitches, I had a better idea of his velocity and that stuff he
had."</TE>
<TE>   Even though those two pitches were strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "At that point," Williams said, "I was thinking that I had to cut
down on my swing and try to put the ball in play. The one thing you
don't want to do in that situation is strike out."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Williams hit a towering fly ball on a 2-2 pitch that
soared into the New York sky and landed in the right-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   The rest, he said, was a blur.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything happened so quick," he said. "I don't remember running
the bases. I remember shaking Derek [Jeter's] and [Jason] Giambi's
hands. I remember the curtain call. But it hasn't sunk in yet. When I
go to bed tonight, I'll probably have a great moment."</TE>
<TE>   While the homer was huge for his team, it was also big for
Williams on an individual level, although he wasn't about to pat
himself on the back. Now finishing his 12th season with the Yankees,
Williams, playing in his 84th postseason game, hit his 17th
postseason home run. That puts him in elite company, tying him with
Jim Thome and putting him one behind two former Yankees, Mickey
Mantle and Reggie Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the spectrum is Giambi, who was playing his
first postseason game as a Yankee, having signed as a free agent in
the off-season after seven years with the Oakland Athletics.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't take long for him to fit in. He got a single his first
time up, a two-homer on his second at-bat and then, after grounding
out, Giambi hit a vicious one-hopper off the glove of Angel first
baseman Scott Spiezio to knock in the tying run in the eighth inning,
setting up Williams' blast.</TE>
<TE>   So what was it like finally being in New York after having been
eliminated by the Yankees his last two seasons in Oakland?</TE>
<TE>   "They never panic," Giambi said. "You don't ever feel the wind
getting taken out of your sails on this ballclub."</TE>
<TE>   After getting his big single in the eighth, Giambi turned to first
base coach Lee Mazzilli and said, "Thank God I'm in this dugout, not
the other one this time."</TE>
<TE>   Now he's in the dugout where everybody knows his name.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Bobby Valentine was fired Tuesday as manager of the New York Mets,
two days after the team finished last in the National League East and
two seasons after it reached the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   The Mets put together a $95-million payroll last winter, bringing
in Roberto Alomar, Mo Vaughn, Roger Cedeno and others, but they
struggled all season and were embarrassed by accusations last month
that at least seven players were smoking marijuana this season.</LD>
<LD>   "We put very good players in place who didn't play very well. It's
best to jump-start and get a manager to motivate these players and
get the best out of the veterans and the young players," owner Fred
Wilpon said at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Valentine just finished the second year of a three-year contract,
and the Mets will be responsible for his 2003 salary of about $2.7
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets finished 75-86, in last place in the NL East for the
first time since 1993. In six-plus seasons with the Mets, Valentine
was 536-467, reaching the playoffs in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Narron was fired as manager of the Texas Rangers, who
finished last in the AL West for the third consecutive season.</TE>
<TE>   Narron went 134-162 after taking over in May 2001, including a
72-90 mark this season. He replaced Johnny Oates after the team
started 11-17 last season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan underwent surgery to repair the
patella tendon in his left knee Tuesday, the same day he was selected
National League player of the month for September.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Frank Jobe and Dr. Ralph Gambardella performed the one-hour
procedure, and Jordan was expected to be released from the hospital
Tuesday night. He is expected to make a full recovery for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan hit .347 with five home runs, seven doubles, 10 runs and a
league-leading 30 runs batted in during September, helping the
Dodgers remain in playoff contention until the final weekend of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two former college basketball players pleaded guilty to the armed
robbery of $44,102 in cash and jewelry from Cleveland Indian pitcher
C.C. Sabathia in May at a Cleveland hotel. Damon Stringer, 24, and
Jamaal Harris, 23, former teammates at Cleveland State, face four to
11 years in prison.... Detroit received permission from the San Diego
Padres to interview first base coach Alan Trammell, a former star
shortstop with the Tigers, for the team's vacant managerial job....
Bill Virdon, 71, who has more than 40 years of major league
experience as a player, manager and coach, has retired. He was
Pittsburgh's bench coach the last two seasons.</TE>

<LD>THE BIG PLAY</LD>
<LD>   Bottom of the eighth, runners on first and second, two out: Jason
Giambi lines a hard single off the glove of Scott Spiezio (a play
Spiezio usually makes). The ball deflects behind second baseman Adam
Kennedy, who was racing to back up Spiezio, allowing Alfonso Soriano
to score the tying run.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   Angel fans around the Southland let out a collective groan when
Mike Scioscia went to Schoeneweis instead of Troy Percival with
Giambi batting in the eighth. Giambi was five for 20 in his career
off Schoeneweis, with two doubles. Against Percival, Giambi was 0 for
5, with five strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOT IN THE BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn pitched out of trouble all night, thanks to some
timely double plays. The Angels turned only eight double plays in the
206 innings Washburn pitched this season, the worst ratio in the
majors, but they turned four in seven innings Tuesday, bailing
Washburn out of some jams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens did not look like himself. Usually a pitcher who
challenges hitters, Clemens backed off the mound several times, threw
to first often, and shook off his catcher a lot. His aggressive
attitude was nowhere to be found, one of the reasons he didn't make
it out of the sixth inning.</TE>

<HD>Giants Not Smarting From Loss to Cardinals</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mal Florence</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaun Powell of Newsday was obviously irritated about the New York
Giants' loss to the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday:</LD>
<LD>   "Following a thorough checking of the team record book, it's
official: This was the stupidest game the Giants ever played.</LD>
<LD>   "From the coach to the quarterback to the punter, the Giants
bungled one play after another and finally flunked themselves right
out of the contest. But a 21-7 loss to a fleabag franchise went
beyond the Giants' IQ....</LD>
<TE>   "For many teams, Sun Devil Stadium is the ninth home game on the
schedule. The whole purpose, especially if you call yourself a
contender, is to come to Arizona, whip the Cardinals and leave before
sundown or sunburn, whichever comes first."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which NFL team holds the record for consecutive games
lost?</TE>
<TE>   Wandering aimlessly: Rick Morrissey of the Chicago Tribune is
equally annoyed as Powell over the Bears' 33-27 overtime loss to the
Buffalo Bills:</TE>
<TE>   "Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, here are your 2002 Chicago
Bears in a nutshell, a team not quite sure of where it's going, a
team not quite sure of anything anymore.... Kato Kaelin's TV career
looks more promising than the Bears right now."</TE>
<TE>   Bengal bashing: Gary Shelton of the St. Petersburg Times on the
0-4 Cincinnati Bengals: "The Bengals are such a sad sack of a
franchise. They are government-subsidy, CARE-package, Sally
Struthers-commercial pitiful. You don't know whether to pat them on
the head or point and laugh."</TE>
<TE>   O-for-awful: The Minnesota Vikings are another NFL team loitering
at 0-4 and Bob Sansevere of the St. Paul Pioneer Press takes his shot
at them: "The Vikings need Randy Moss to do something stupid again.
Either that or they need a whopper of a scandal. They have to come up
with something to deflect from just how miserable a team they truly
are."</TE>
<TE>   All in the family: Ron Rapoport in the Chicago Sun-Times: "Welcome
to the playoffs Barry Bonds. Try not to think about the fact that in
97 postseason at-bats you have one home run, six RBIs and have never
won a game.</TE>
<TE>   "Bonds' father, Bobby, held onto his single-season strikeout
record, 189, which was preserved when the Brewers rested Jose
Hernandez on Sunday. Hernandez finished with 188."</TE>
<TE>   FYI: The St. Louis Rams' 0-4 start is the worst since 1963, when
the franchise was in L.A.. That Ram team lost its first five games
and finished 5-9.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1916, Grover Cleveland Alexander
pitched the Philadelphia Phillies to a 2-0 victory over the Boston
Braves--his modern-record 16th shutout of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1938, Cleveland's Bob Feller
struck out a then-major league-record 18 batters in a 4-1 loss to the
Detroit Tigers.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tampa Bay, 26, 1976-77.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times: "We're not saying
he's the second coming of Rhodes scholar jocks Bill Bradley and Pat
Haden, but the quarterback at Olmsted Falls (Ohio) High School
certainly has the ultimate name for a scholar-athlete: Mickey
Mental."</TE>

<HD>Clippers Make a Play for Mavericks' Wang</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Chinese center signed to a three-year,
$6-million offer sheet, which Dallas has 15 days to match.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>On the opening day of training camp, the Clippers signed restricted
free-agent center Wang Zhizhi to a three-year offer sheet believed to
be worth $6 million. The Dallas Mavericks have 15 days to match the
offer or let Wang go to the injury-depleted Clippers, who suddenly
need depth up front.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas owner Mark Cuban wasn't immediately certain what his team
would do. Donnie Nelson, the team's vice president, told the Fort
Worth Star Telegram, "We're not going to lose him outright. We are
trying to come to some win-win situation."</LD>
<LD>   Nelson indicated the Mavericks would be interested in working out
a sign-and-trade deal with the Clippers.</LD>
<TE>   But that's not possible under the NBA's collective bargaining
agreement. Wang cannot be part of any trade between the Clippers and
Mavericks for the next 12 months. Even if Dallas matches the
Clippers' offer sheet, the Mavericks cannot trade Wang until Dec. 15.
What's more, Wang has the right to veto any trade for the next year.</TE>
<TE>   Wang, 25, figured to be the odd-man out in Dallas, what with the
7-foot-1 native of China competing for playing time with Dirk
Nowitzki, Raef LaFrentz, Popeye Jones and Shawn Bradley.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Wang averaged 5.6 points and 2.0 rebounds in 55 games
with the Mavericks. He did not join China's team at the World
Championship but spent most of the off-season in Los Angeles. He
played for the Golden State Warriors' summer league team at Long
Beach State, which is where Clipper General Manager Elgin Baylor got
an eyeful of him.</TE>
<TE>   "I like his size, his ability to shoot outside," Baylor said.
"Watching him this summer, I liked his whole game. There are a lot of
things we like about him. We'll wait and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   If Wang becomes a Clipper, he could be a valuable addition. Power
forward Elton Brand is expected to be sidelined for at least three
weeks after undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee last
week. Small forward Lamar Odom continues to rehabilitate a badly
sprained right ankle and is not expected to play until at least
December.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always trying to get good players," Baylor said when asked if
Wang could be the short-term replacement the Clippers need during
training camp and the early part of the season. "You're always
looking for size."</TE>
<TE>   Baylor envisioned Wang playing closer to the basket with the
Clippers than he did with the free-flowing Mavericks. "With his size,
there's no reason he couldn't play in the low post," Baylor said.
"He's good on the boards."</TE>
<TE>   Clipper Coach Alvin Gentry also admires Wang's game.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't have signed him if I wasn't a fan," Gentry said.
"He's a good shooter. We can run the screen and roll with him. But
make no mistake, we've got to have Lamar and Elton out on the floor
if we're going to be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mavericks signed Milwaukee restricted free-agent
guard Michael Redd to a three-year offer sheet, which the Bucks are
expected to match.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to guess whether the Mavericks would retain Wang, Gentry
said, "I can't answer that. Ask Mark Cuban. They have to decide
what's important to them. But if we can add him to our team it will
be a big addition."</TE>

<LD>Florida State has called off classes for Thursday and Friday,
anticipating campus traffic problems because of Thursday night's home
game against Clemson.</LD>
<LD>   Fans will be coming into the stadium just as state workers leave
their jobs a few blocks away in Tallahassee, the state capital.</LD>
<LD>   School officials say the early "fall break" has been in the works
for several years and this was a good opportunity to get it started.</LD>
<TE>   "The game will involve more than 80,000 fans coming to campus
during the day," President Talbot D'Alemberte said. "A fall break
seemed to be the answer for both the long-term and short-term
challenges."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Clarence Farmer, the leading rusher in the Pacific 10
Conference last season, is sidelined for at least three weeks after
having surgery to repair cartilage damage in his left knee. Mike Bell
will replace Farmer, who is among 14 Wildcats either ruled out or
questionable for the conference opener against Oregon.... Notre Dame
quarterback Carlyle Holiday remains questionable for Saturday's game
against Stanford. Holiday injured a shoulder on Sept. 21 against
Michigan State.... Nebraska running back Thunder Collins had his
eligibility restored by an NCAA committee and could play against
McNeese State. Collins was suspended for the four games for failing
to comply with NCAA regulations.... Vanderbilt quarterback Jay
Cutler, suspended from the team Monday, was issued four misdemeanor
citations by campus police after he allegedly vandalized a campus
emergency telephone and tried to evade officers.... The body of
Michael Bochette Jr., a fullback at Cumberland University in Lebanon,
Tenn., was found inside his truck submerged in a lake. Authorities
said he was shot to death.</TE>

<HD>Hartman Trying to Keep His Focus</HD>
<DH>Galaxy: Despite giving up six goals in two games,
goalkeeper is not concerned and neither is his coach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kevin Hartman closed out the regular season as arguably the hottest
goalkeeper in Major League Soccer, having given up one goal in the
Galaxy's last four league games.</LD>
<LD>   Things have been painfully different for him in the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   Hartman has given up six goals in the first two games of the
Galaxy's first-round MLS playoff series against the Kansas City
Wizards.</LD>
<TE>   Still, there are no measurable worries in the Galaxy camp, not
even with the No. 1-seeded Galaxy facing elimination with a loss
tonight in Game 3 against the No. 8-seeded Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about being a goalkeeper is you have to keep things in
perspective," said Hartman, who finished the regular season with a
1.09 goals-against average, which tied him with the Columbus Crew's
Jon Busch for the league low.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing about the [season-ending] San Jose series and ... the
Chicago [game] is we weren't giving up unbelievable opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   The Wizards, though, have been masterful in creating chances in
this series, which began with the Galaxy winning the opener, 3-2, in
overtime and continued with the Wizards' 4-1 thumping of the Galaxy
in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   But Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid, who is not indecisive when it comes
to replacing goalkeepers, shied away from putting the blame on
Hartman.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot you can do on some of those goals that he was
confronted with," Schmid said of Hartman's performance in the
Galaxy's 4-1 loss, which equaled a franchise high for most goals
given up in a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't play well [as a team] and ... I don't think you can
point the finger at one player."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Hartman said of the four Wizard goals, he felt he only
had a realistic chance of saving one.</TE>
<TE>   And even with the Galaxy defense being broken down, the team would
seem to have history on its side tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy is 12-1-2 at the Rose Bowl this season, has outscored
opponents, 30-12, at home and is riding an 11-game home unbeaten
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, the Wizards are 0-2-1 in Pasadena this season and the Galaxy
is 4-1-0 all-time in playoff-deciding Game 3s. And since the
beginning of 2001, the Galaxy is 12-1-0 in elimination games,
including MLS playoff, U.S. Open Cup and Champions Cup games.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if Hartman gets rattled, the Galaxy's quest to win the
elusive MLS Cup title will be delayed at least another year.</TE>
<TE>   "The position of goalkeeper is about consistency and if you look
at it as, 'Six goals, oh my gosh, panic,' psychologically you're
done," Hartman said. "You can't play goalkeeper that way.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, you look at the goals that you gave up, you make amends
and you work on whatever it is you can work on to get better at those
situations.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire position of goalkeeping is how you react to mistakes."</TE>

<KH>NATIONAL LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES/ San Francisco vs. Atlanta</KH>
<HD>Bonds Is Looking to Alter History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds enjoys waxing nostalgic about baseball history, reveling
in the accomplishments of his godfather, Willie Mays, and fellow Hall
of Famers Hank Aaron and Jackie Robinson.</LD>
<LD>   Only don't steer the discussion to Bonds' playoff history.</LD>
<LD>   That's a recurring nightmare for Bonds, who hopes to create better
memories today as the San Francisco Giants play the Atlanta Braves in
Game 1 of the best-of-five National League division series at Turner
Field.</LD>
<TE>   The future Hall of Famer is determined to have his first
productive postseason as he leads the Giants, who held off the
Dodgers for the NL wild-card berth, to their third playoff appearance
since 1997, and second in three seasons. But the East-champion
Braves, trying to overcome their own October baggage, are equally
intent on ending the Giants' season and compounding Bonds'
frustration.</TE>
<TE>   "My legacy will be what it is regardless--whatever you guys say
it's going to be," Bonds told reporters. "Great player ... didn't win
a World Series ... whatever, it's your opinions.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the World Series. I said I'd be back [in the playoffs],
and I'm back, but I want a World Series ring."</TE>
<TE>   Then he had better start producing at this time of the year.</TE>
<TE>   In 27 playoff games with the Giants and Pittsburgh Pirates, Bonds
has batted only .196 (19 for 97) with a home run and six runs batted
in. The New York Mets limited Bonds to three hits in 17 at-bats
(.176) with one RBI while beating the Giants in four games in the
2000 division series.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was before Bonds began his stunning assault on the
record book, debunking conventional baseball wisdom with each
historic swing.</TE>
<TE>   After establishing a single-season mark with 73 homers last
season, Bonds led the major leagues with a .370 batting average, hit
46 homers, drove in 110 runs and scored 117. He set records with 198
walks and a .582 on-base percentage as managers avoided pitching to
him in almost every situation and is expected to win a record fifth
NL most-valuable-player award.</TE>
<TE>   "Barry is a different type of hitter right now, so you can't bank
what he's going to do this postseason on postseasons of the past,"
said Atlanta right fielder Gary Sheffield, one of Bonds' closest
friends. "And the thing is, we're not even going to find out. When
you already know, why would you want to find out if he's up for the
task?</TE>
<TE>   "Just one mistake to Barry can change everything around. We have
the type of pitchers who will pitch to Barry if he can't beat us; if
he can we won't. We don't have guys over here with big enough egos to
want to say, 'We pitched to Barry Bonds when the game was on the
line.' That's a stupid pitcher, and we don't have any of those types
of guys here."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the cerebral Atlanta pitching staff was the majors'
best across the board, leading the club to its 11th consecutive
division title. But the Braves have won only one World Series title
(1995) during their historic run, and how they handle Bonds could
help determine whether they get another this season.</TE>
<TE>   Game 1 starter Tom Glavine said he wouldn't take unnecessary
chances.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't assume that the struggles that Barry has had in the
past in the postseason are going to be true this time around, because
he's a much different player than he was when we last saw him in the
postseason," the 18-game winner said. "The law of averages are
probably on his side, but we're hoping to delay that by at least one
more year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOXES)</TE>
<TE>   GIANT ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   STRENGTHS: Two words: Barry Bonds. Bonds had a remarkable encore
to his stunning 2001 season, leading the major leagues in batting at
.370 and setting single-season records with 198 walks and a .582
on-base percentage. Jeff Kent forms the other half of the Giants'
formidable 1-2 punch, having hit at least 22 homers with 100 RBIs the
last six seasons. One of the majors' strongest pitching staffs could
help Bonds and Kent create some positive postseason memories for a
change.</TE>
<TE>   WEAKNESSES: There isn't much there, once you get past Bonds and
Kent. Benito Santiago had a nice season--but who couldn't, hitting
behind Bonds? Rich Aurilia had a huge drop-off offensively from his
big 2001 season.</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES: INF Ramon Martinez (.271, 4 HR, 25 RBIs), OF Tom
Goodwin (.260, 1 HR, 17 RBIs), C Yorvit Torrealba (.279, 2 HR, 14
RBIs).</TE>
<TE>   TEAM BATTING: .267 (Fourth in NL).</TE>
<TE>   TEAM PITCHING: 3.54 ERA (Second in NL).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BRAVE ANALYSIS</TE>
<TE>   STRENGTHS: Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux, who together have won six
Cy Young awards, are still the foundation of Atlanta's success, but
18-game winner Kevin Millwood was the Braves' most consistent starter
this season. Closer John Smoltz, the majors' all-time leader in
postseason victories, established an NL record with 55 saves. Gary
Sheffield, Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones are one of the game's most
productive outfields.</TE>
<TE>   WEAKNESSES: Javy Lopez and Vinny Castilla were awful at the plate,
minimizing Sheffield's impact in to the batting order. Flashy leadoff
batter Rafael Furcal was caught stealing 15 times in 42 attempts, and
what was up with that .259 on-base percentage in September?</TE>
<TE>   KEY RESERVES: INF Julio Franco (.284, 6 HR, 30 RBI), C Henry
Blanco (.204, 6 HR, 22 RBI), INF Keith Lockhart (.216, 5 HR, 32 RBI),
OF Darren Bragg (.269, 3 HR, 15 RBI).</TE>
<TE>   TEAM BATTING: .260 (Ninth in NL).</TE>
<TE>   TEAM PITCHING: 3.13 ERA (First in NL).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE SERIES</TE>
<TE>   Bonds will soon add a record fifth NL MVP to his remarkable
resume, but postseason success has eluded him. In 27 playoff games,
Bonds has batted .196 (19 for 97) with a home run and six runs batted
in. However, he has played at an unparalleled level since the Giants'
last playoff appearance in 2000, so history may not apply. But will
the Braves pitch to Bonds?</TE>
<TE>   RECORDS: Giants 95-66, Braves 101-59.</TE>
<TE>   HEAD TO HEAD: Tied, 3-3.</TE>

<HD>De Seroux Improves Breeders' Cup Lineup</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: On eve of Oak Tree opening, trainer gets
Ballingarry, winner of Canadian International.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It didn't take long for reinforcements to arrive at trainer Laura de
Seroux's barn.</LD>
<LD>   De Seroux, who will saddle leading Breeders' Cup Distaff contender
Azeri today in the Lady's Secret Handicap as the Oak Tree Racing
Assn. begins its 26-day meet at Santa Anita, picked up another top
horse Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Ballingarry, a 3-year-old Irish-bred colt who won Sunday's
$1.5-million Canadian International at Woodbine, was purchased by a
group that includes De Seroux's husband.</LD>
<TE>   Ballingarry, Azeri and Dublino, the Del Mar Oaks winner, make for
a strong Breeders' Cup contingent for De Seroux, who was forced to
retire the multiple stakes winner Astra last month when the
6-year-old grass mare came out of her last race with a respiratory
infection.</TE>
<TE>   The Lady's Secret launches Oak Tree's head-long dive into a
concentrated round of preps for the Breeders' Cup at Arlington Park
on Oct. 26. There will be four more important stakes Saturday,
including the $500,000 Yellow Ribbon, and three stakes--one of them
the $500,000 Goodwood Handicap-- highlight Sunday's card. Total
graded-stakes money for Oak Tree's opening week comes to $2.35
million.</TE>
<TE>   The deal to buy Ballingarry, who had been owned by Susan Magnier
of Ireland-based Coolmore Stud and trained by Aidan O'Brien, had been
agreed to in principle before the Woodbine race, but the colt still
ran in Magnier's name because there wasn't time   for a veterinarian
checkup.</TE>
<TE>   The new owners include Sidney Port, Marsha Naify, and the
trainer's husband, Emmanuel de Seroux--an international bloodstock
agent who sniffed out Ballingarry and engineered the sale.</TE>
<TE>   Laura de Seroux said that the sale price was in the seven-figure
range. Port, who is the principal owner, is a Chicagoan who was a
long-time partner of the late trainer Charlie Whittingham, for whom
De Seroux worked as an exercise rider in the late 1970s. One of the
horses that De Seroux has trained for Port is Until Sundown, who won
last year's Affirmed Handicap at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Although De Seroux referred to Ballingarry as a member of the
"second tier" of Coolmore horses, the Daily Racing Form immediately
moved the colt into second spot behind Beat Hollow in its ranking of
North American male grass horses. Ballingarry, a son of Sadler's
Wells, Europe's preeminent sire, has won four of 10 starts and earned
$1.3 million, $900,000 of the total coming last Sunday. He was second
in the Italian Derby and third in the Irish Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Ballingarry will run in the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf, which
at 1 1/2 miles is the same distance as the Canadian International. De
Seroux expects to run Azeri in the $2-million Distaff and Dublino in
the $1-million Filly &amp; Mare Turf. These will be the first Breeders'
Cup starters for the 50-year-old conditioner, who trains her horses
at San Luis Rey Downs, the training center in Bonsall, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   At 127 pounds, Azeri could become the highest-weighted distaffer
to win the Lady's Secret, first run in 1993. The 4-year-old filly's
seven rivals will carry between 111 and 116 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see the 127 pounds as being a problem," De Seroux said.
"She just won carrying 126, and I don't think she's going to hurt
herself. With maturity, she's gotten stronger."</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, who has been ridden by Mike Smith while winning eight of
nine starts, last ran in the Clement L. Hirsch Handicap at Del Mar,
where she won by two lengths. That was the filly's fifth consecutive
win since her only loss, by one length to the East Coast shipper
Summer Colony in the La Canada at Santa Anita on Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Hennig, who trains Summer Colony, will take another shot at
Azeri today with Mystic Lady, the Belmont Park-based filly who has
earned $1 million but has won only one of six starts this year.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't Summer Colony I'm sending out there this time," Hennig
said. "But this filly's coming around. A mile and a sixteenth is what
she likes, and there aren't that many opportunities at that
distance."</TE>
<TE>   Mystic Lady, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens, has had eight
wins and four seconds in 14 tries at 1 1/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alex Solis, two-time Oak Tree riding champion, will start the meet
serving a five-day suspension that was issued at Del Mar. Under the
designated-race rule, which applies to many stakes races, Solis will
be riding this week, starting with the mount on Elaine's Angel in the
Lady's Secret.</TE>

<LD>Fifteen Nogales players and five Pomona players were suspended by
their schools for games this week after a second-quarter fight that
ended the game between the teams Friday. Nogales plays host to
Montclair on Friday, and Pomona plays host to Torrance on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Pomona led Nogales, 15-0, and was awarded a forfeit victory after
a brawl ensued following a Pomona touchdown.</LD>
<LD>   The trouble began as Pomona kicked off after the score, then
kicked off again because of off-setting penalties. Nogales fullback
Matthew Matavao was penalized on the consecutive plays for roughing
kicker Noe Casillas.</LD>
<TE>   Matavao was ejected, but the teams brawled in front of the Nogales
sideline on the next play, a third kickoff. When the fight was broken
up, referees called the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a couple kids, who as soon as they saw the fight, they
took off from the sidelines before we could grab them," Nogales Coach
Tim Silvett said. The suspensions left Nogales with 18 varsity
players eligible for this week.</TE>

<TE>   Henry Liaw, the Hacienda Heights Los Altos golfer who shot 58 at
Alhambra Golf Course as a 12-year old in 1999, has committed to
Arizona.</TE>

four-time Junior World Champion, three-time junior All-American and
two-time Southern California junior player of the year.</TE>

<TE>   Junior Katie Gose of Thousand Oaks La Reina is expected to run in
the first Tri-Valley League cross-country meet of the season Thursday
after missing the Bell-Jeff Invitational on Saturday with an injured

<TE>   Gose, who finished eighth in 3,200 meters in the state track and
field championships in June, turned an ankle while running in the Mt.
Carmel Invitational in San Diego on Sept. 21.</TE>

<HD>Lombardo's Decision Is Birmingham's Gain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ryan Lombardo called it one of the toughest decisions he has ever had
to make. It was all the more difficult because he saw his older
brother, Chris, have a bad experience after making a similar choice
three years ago.</LD>
<LD>   It's the decision to transfer to another school.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of students change schools each year for myriad reasons,
including athletics. The Times reported in June that the California
Interscholastic Federation's Southern Section received 7,331 athletic
transfer requests for this fall, more than double the number who
transferred between the beginning of the 1999 school year and Jan. 1,
2002.</LD>
<TE>   Ryan Lombardo left Newbury Park in February to spend his senior
year at Lake Balboa Birmingham. As quarterback, he has completed 60%
of his passes for 825 yards in leading the Patriots to a 2-1 record
entering Friday night's intersectional home game against Newhall
Hart.</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo didn't make the move because he wasn't getting playing
time. On the contrary, he was Newbury Park's starting quarterback for
two years and threw for 1,937 yards and 16 touchdowns last season. He
transferred because his family moved from Camarillo to Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   But that didn't make his decision any easier.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really want to leave," Lombardo said. "It's hard to go
to a new school. You have to get used to being around new people,
people who are different than you."</TE>
<TE>   Newbury Park Coach George Hurley figured that with an experienced
quarterback returning, his team could improve on its 2-8 record.
While Hurley said he has no hard feelings about Lombardo's transfer,
he only wishes there had been more communication.</TE>
<TE>   "He just kind of disappeared," Hurley said. "I hadn't seen him in
a week and I went to go look for him. There wasn't any indication
that he was going to transfer. It was like he left in the middle of
the night."</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo said he had reason to stay quiet. When his brother, who
had been a two-year starting quarterback at Ventura St. Bonaventure,
transferred to Newbury Park in 1999, there were such hard feelings
that the Oxnard Unified School District, in which the family once
resided, initially refused to approve the transfer, then relented.</TE>
<TE>   "People found out about that and it was a bad situation," Ryan
said. "Some people [vandalized] his locker at school. I thought it
was better to keep it to myself."</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham Coach Ed Croson said no action should be taken against
a student who wants to change schools, even if it's only for
athletics.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we'd love to get all the kids in as ninth-graders,"
Croson said. "But you know, freedom of choice is the American way.
Kids deserve the right to choose where they want to go to school and
parents deserve the right to choose where they want their kids to go,
whether they're a math student or a football player.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had plenty of kids leave our program. I always say to them,
'If you think it's better for you over there, then God bless you.' "</TE>
<TE>   Croson said Lombardo has been a model player and is improving each
week.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not done a great job of protecting him and he's had a lot
of hurried throws," Croson said. "But he still has been comfortable
back there.... He's been a quarterback since he was a little kid.
Ryan has adapted well. He's very bright and experienced."</TE>
<TE>   Lombardo has been looking forward to Friday's game for months. He
considers Hart one of the preeminent programs in Southern California,
and said a victory would be a major boost to Birmingham's City title
aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can beat Hart, I think we can beat anybody," he said. "This
game has a lot to do with the rest of our season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior running back Jody Adewale has been the focal point of
Roosevelt's prolific wing-T offense since last season, but Rough
Rider opponents must prepare for another threat.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Owens, a senior transfer from Manual Arts, is coming off a
23-carry, 303-yard performance in a 50-23 victory over Belmont. Owens
has gained 625 yards in three games and is averaging 12.3 yards per
carry.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely was a breakout game for him," Roosevelt Coach Jose
Casagran said. "He's good and he's learning to follow his blocks more
and more."</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt gained 556 yards on the ground last week, and Casagran
said his team has not rushed for fewer than 400 in any game. Adewale,
who had flu and played only 1 1/2 quarters last week, has 467 yards
after rushing for 1,636 last season.</TE>
<TE>   The Rough Riders will get a stiff test Friday, when they play host
to Dorsey, the defending City Section champion. The last two meetings
have been close, with the Dons winning, 38-32, in 1999 and 12-7 the
next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we're healthy, we can play with them just like we have
in the past," Casagran said. "But we got nicked up a lot last week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was reported here a week ago that South Gate received portable
bleachers through the help of the city's former mayor, Henry
Gonzalez. But according to South Gate Principal Tony Sandoval, the
person who really should receive the credit is Len Page, a director
of maintenance and operations for the L.A. Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Playing their first home game of the season on Friday night, South
Gate defeated Locke, 23-7.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   City top 10: 1. Taft (3-0); 2. Fremont (3-0); 3. Dorsey (1-2); 4.
Birmingham (2-1); 5. Banning (2-1); 6. Carson (2-1); 7. Crenshaw
(2-1); 8. Roosevelt (3-0); 9. Venice (2-1); 10. Gardena (2-1).</TE>

<HD>Siphonic Returns Today</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Siphonic, once the future book favorite for the Kentucky Derby, will
make his first start since March 17 as the 34th Oak Tree meet at
Santa Anita starts today.</LD>
<LD>   Siphonic will run in the third race, a $54,000 optional claimer at
seven furlongs.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by the Amerman Racing Stables and trained by Dave Hofmans,
the 3-year-old son of Siphon has not raced since finishing third as
the 2-5 favorite in the San Felipe Stakes, the final prep for the
Santa Anita Derby. That race came two months after he had been beaten
at 1-10 in the Santa Catalina.</LD>
<TE>   An injury sidelined Siphonic after the San Felipe, but he has
trained well for his return. A winner of three of six lifetime,
Siphonic will break from the rail in the field of seven and have a
new rider in Mike Smith. The now-retired Chris McCarron rode Siphonic
in his first two starts, then Jerry Bailey took over for the next
four, including a victory in the 2001 Hollywood Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   Siphonic's opponents include two double winners at Santa
Anita--Slewston, trained by Jack Van Berg, and Waingarth, a gray
gelding trained by John Sadler for Oakcrest Stable.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Promising 3-year-olds Golden Arrow and Rushin' To
Altar head the field in the seventh, a $53,000 optional claimer at
one mile on turf. The race is the second leg of the pick four.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Martin Pedroza. The jockey had 27 winners at Fairplex
Park to lead that meet for the fourth consecutive year.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Joey Castro. The jockey is only two for 44 at Bay
Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Red Apache in the
first, using Cozy Man and Pool Music in the second and Siphonic,
Waingarth, Slewston and Lebontempsroulet in the third.</TE>

<KH>KING-DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Cammalleri's Demotion Angers His College Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe; Chris Foster</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Cammalleri, reassigned Monday to the minors, was misled by
the Kings into leaving school early, his college coach charged
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Red Berenson, in his 19th season at the University of Michigan,
said that Cammalleri told him that King Coach Andy Murray had
promised the All-American center that he would play on the top line
if he joined the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Cammalleri, who led Michigan with 23 goals in 29 games last
season, was considered a leading candidate for the Hobey Baker Award,
college hockey's equivalent of the Heisman Trophy, before signing
with the Kings on July 25 and giving up his senior season of
eligibility.</LD>
<TE>   He was one of four rookie forward signings widely ballyhooed by
the Kings, but only Russian right wing Alexander Frolov remains on
the roster. Along with Jared Aulin and Yanick Lehoux, Cammalleri will
open the season with the Kings' American Hockey League team at
Manchester, N.H.</TE>
<TE>   "I absolutely think he made a mistake and I told him that,"
Berenson said Tuesday. "And it wasn't just his fault. L.A. put him in
a tough situation. They wanted him to leave school and they told him
he would play on their first line.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you do that? How can the coach of an NHL team call a kid
in the summertime and tell him he's going to play on their first line
when the kid hasn't played a game of pro hockey and he's 20 years
old?"</TE>
<TE>   Murray said that all he promised Cammalleri was that he would play
with top-line forwards Jason Allison and Adam Deadmarsh at the start
of training camp, which Cammalleri did before minor injuries
sidelined the veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri, considered a strong candidate to move onto one of the
Kings' top two lines, later played on a line with Allison and Ziggy
Palffy.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything I committed to, I lived up to," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, after getting the news from Murray and General Manager
Dave Taylor that he was headed to Manchester, Cammalleri expressed
disappointment but no bitterness. He said nothing about broken
promises.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had second thoughts about leaving school, he paused.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings believe that Cammalleri, bruised feelings aside, is
better off playing in the minor leagues than at Michigan. They say
he'll play a more demanding schedule against older, stronger, more
talented players, and he could be promoted to the NHL at any time.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, he'll make about $600,000, including signing bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri, they say, indicated to them that he was considering
joining a junior team in Canada if the Kings didn't sign him, an
obvious negotiating ploy and an option that could have earned him
unrestricted free agency next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Cammalleri, they stress, made up his own mind to leave Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Berenson, who spent 17 years as a player in the NHL,
doesn't like it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business and they all think they know their business,"
said the coach, whose last five All-Americans have all left school
early, "but I'm sure the kid's not very happy right now and I feel
bad for him.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team's going to be fine.... You know who I worry about? I
worry about Mike Cammalleri. He'll do fine too, but he's missing out
on one of the best years of his life and he's going to kick himself
down the road.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't buy it back. You can't wish it back. You can't regret
it back."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left wing Denny Lambert was hardly surprised upon receiving the
news he was out with the Mighty Ducks. He saw it coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my fate was dealt before [training] camp opened," Lambert
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lambert, defenseman Jason York and left wing German Titov were all
purged from the Duck roster Monday and will be available for Friday's
NHL waiver draft. They all had been put with the minor league
practice group after the first week.</TE>
<TE>   "I never got to play with an NHL player through the whole camp,"
said Lambert, one of two enforcers in camp. "There was no opportunity
for me to show anything. I don't understand it."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike York and Titov--both busts as multimillion-dollar free
agents--Lambert was coming off a solid season in 2001-2002. He was to
have made $550,000 this season and $600,000 in 2003-04.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was ready," Lambert said. "But after the conversation
I had with [Coach Mike Babcock], this comes as no surprise. With him
telling me that I didn't show him anything. That was after two days.</TE>
<TE>   "I know I could have added something to the team. This is not a
physical team. I'm not talking about fighting, I'm just talking about
hard-nosed hockey."</TE>
<TE>   Lambert appeared in 73 games and was part of an effective fourth
line. He had two goals, seven points, 213 penalty minutes and
finished a plus-one.</TE>
<TE>   But the Ducks finished 13th in the Western Conference, 26 points
out of a playoff spot. First-year General Manager Bryan Murray, the
team's coach last season, was intent on upgrading the team's talent
level and giving the organization's prospects an opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough decision," Murray said. "Who is a better character
guy than Denny? He does everything you ask him to do. But we're at
the point where our younger players are stepping up a little bit. We
have to give them a chance."</TE>

<HD>Now, Olympic Rings Look Good to Lakers</HD>
<DH>Basketball: O'Neal and Jackson join Bryant in notion of
helping the U.S. cause at Athens.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If USA Basketball is looking to remake itself after its collapse at
the World Championship last month--and why wouldn't it?--the Lakers
have a solution: More Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   Shaquille O'Neal and Phil Jackson said Tuesday they would be
inclined to participate in the 2004 Olympics, a sentiment voiced the
day before by Kobe Bryant, and so the Athens Games could have a
distinct Laker color.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who has won Olympic and World Championship gold medals but
in recent years has had no interest in international competition,
said he watched in disbelief as a team of NBA players finished sixth
in Indianapolis.</LD>
<TE>   Like Bryant, O'Neal was moved to consider playing in the Olympics.
Unlike Bryant, O'Neal said he would play only if Jackson were the
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "Is that right?" Jackson said through a painfully swollen right
jaw, the result of an emergency tooth extraction on Monday. "That
puts me in a ticklish spot, [doesn't] it?"</TE>
<TE>   He added then that he would not rule out coaching the next Olympic
team, were he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The NBA has put in coaches in the past, guys that have had track
records in this league that have had success," he said. "A lot of it
has to do with the players and their willingness to come and play
together."</TE>
<TE>   It is assumed that Jackson, who has won nine NBA titles and is
tied with Red Auerbach as the most decorated coach ever, would
command unusual respect from an Olympic team of millionaire
superstars, particularly if O'Neal and Bryant set a reverential tone.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's that so much as, you know, the amount of
time they get to play together, the dedication that the group's going
to show to play together," Jackson said. "The success of any team is
that they really wanted to play together, and well."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the blame for the failure at the World Championship from
the NBA rank and file has fallen on George Karl, the coach of the
Milwaukee Bucks who coached the U.S. to the sixth-place finish.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, O'Neal had said Monday that he would not play for Karl,
but that if Jackson chose--and was chosen--to lead the U.S.
Olympians, then he would play in Greece, out of duty to Jackson and
country.</TE>
<TE>   "With Phil, I'd do it," O'Neal said after Tuesday's practice in El
Segundo, where he watched drills and shot a few flat-footed jumpers
and free throws. "If Phil would do it, so would I.</TE>
<TE>   "If [President] Bush goes to Greece, then Colin Powell has to go
to Greece."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it might not be as simple as showing up in some Athens
gym, cranking up the national anthem and restoring the reputation of
American basketball. The dreadful showing in Indianapolis means the
U.S. team will be required to play through a qualifying tournament
next summer, though Jackson, O'Neal and Bryant wouldn't necessarily
have to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson has two years remaining on his Laker contract. He has said
he would coach longer if it would serve to keep O'Neal in the game,
but Jackson might also choose to coach the two NBA seasons, then end
his career--at nearly 60--with a victory lap through an overmatched
international field and a return to the wilds of Montana a hero.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, fresh from toe surgery and optimistic that his true game
is waiting at the end of recovery in three to six weeks, seems to
like the idea of saving the game.</TE>
<TE>   "George [Karl] kind of messed up our streak there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Senior National Team Committee, headed by NBA executive Stu
Jackson, chooses the players and coaching staff. No decision will be
made before the end of this year.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Miller, assistant executive director of media and public
relations for USA Basketball, said the committee's choice to coach
the team in qualifying play is usually the Olympic coach too. The
exception was the qualifying tournament for the 2000 Sydney Games,
after Rudy Tomjanovich became ill and Larry Brown replaced him on
short notice. Tomjanovich returned to coach the Olympic team to gold
at Sydney.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the nine NBA players who participated in the 1999
qualifying tournament were promised Olympic spots, but there's no
provision for that to be repeated.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq has been involved in the past, and there have been
discussions with Kobe, but for various reasons and personal
commitments, it never worked out," Miller said. "I'm sure
opportunities will be there down the road. Obviously, we'd love to
have Shaq involved."</TE>
<TE>   Although the three greatest Lakers have now discussed an Olympic
notion still two years away, the focus Tuesday, as 17 Lakers worked
out and O'Neal watched, was in getting O'Neal to the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said he was good enough, right now, without having run a
step since surgery, "to put up 24 [points] and 10 [rebounds]." He
laughed, of course. But meant it, of course.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are going to work out perfectly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are only too willing to believe it, though no one has
bothered to guess at O'Neal's return date.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just going to wait for him to get back," Jackson said. "We
think he'll be back in good speed. He feels quite comfortable with
where he's at. We're optimistic about it."</TE>
<TE>   Samaki Walker, sound again after finishing last season with a sore
elbow and knee, as the opening-night center, Jackson said, "is a good
assumption."</TE>
<TE>   "He looks very comfortable with everything we're doing," Jackson
said. "Last year, Samaki ended the year with two injuries that really
derailed him the last 15 games. We both agreed at the end of the
season it wasn't the kind of upbeat championship run he'd like to
have, looking back at it. But, all in all, we were very pleased with
the performance he gave us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will honor Chick Hearn with a black strip on the left
shoulders of their uniforms. The legendary broadcaster died Aug. 5
after a fall.... Assistant coach Tex Winter, 80, remains a regular at
the team's practice facility, and it appears he'll continue to teach
his triangle offense and advise Jackson for at least another season,
his 56th consecutive as a coach.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Shaw, at 36 beginning his 13th NBA season, lost 16 pounds
over the summer. Jackson suggested Tuesday that Shaw would battle
rookie Kareem Rush for playing time early in the season.... Bryant's
shoe watch: He wore purple Nikes on Tuesday. The count after two
days: Converse 1, Nike 1.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Is Ordered to Stay Clear of Wife</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New York Knick center Kurt Thomas was ordered to stay away from his
wife and home at his arraignment Tuesday on charges he assaulted her
during an argument over a laptop computer.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas did not enter a plea to charges of third-degree assault, a
misdemeanor, and risk of injury to a minor, a felony.</LD>
<LD>   Police say Thomas, 6 feet 9 and 235 pounds, assaulted his wife,
Amber, while she was holding the couple's child. Kurt Thomas' lawyer
denied the accusation.</LD>
<TE>   "During the argument he grabbed her around the neck and pulled on
her arm while she held their 2-year-old daughter," police in
Greenwich, Conn., said in a statement. "She refused medical
treatment."</TE>
<TE>   The girl was not injured, police said. Two other children Amber
Thomas has from a previous marriage were not home at the time, said
her lawyer, Gary Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   The protective order prevents Thomas from entering the couple's
home in Greenwich, where the alleged assault took place Monday, or
having any contact with his wife. He will be allowed to go home one
more time with a police escort to get his belongings.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers said the couple is getting a divorce after about two years
of marriage. Thomas declined to comment after the arraignment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Knick forward Latrell Sprewell had surgery to repair a displaced
fracture below his right pinkie. He will be sidelined for at least
six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Team President Scott Layden refused to discuss details of how
Sprewell was injured.</TE>
<TE>   "He told us he banged his hand two weeks ago. The focus now is to
get him healthy and back with the team," Layden said.</TE>
<TE>   Sprewell arrived at the Knicks' practice facility Monday with a
swollen right hand and complained that it hurt. X-rays revealed a
broken bone.</TE>
<TE>   The team refused to make Sprewell available to the media Monday,
the team's media day, and neither Layden nor Coach Don Chaney offered
any details.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It took a while, but Gary Payton finally made an appearance as the
Seattle SuperSonics opened training camp.</TE>
<TE>   Payton didn't attend a morning workout, but he arrived about 30
minutes after the start of the evening practice. He did not
immediately speak with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Payton had skipped Monday's media day, and Coach Nate McMillan
said Payton would be fined for missing that and Tuesday morning's
practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an unexcused absence," said McMillan, who wouldn't disclose
the amount of the fine.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston Celtic forward Vin Baker sprained his left pinkie on the
first day of practice, but he was not expected to miss any
workouts.... Rodney White was traded by the Detroit Pistons to the
Denver Nuggets for a conditional first-round draft choice, forward
Don Reid and center Mengke Bateer.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The debate centered on whether Troy Percival should have been left
standing in that decisive eighth inning Tuesday night, watching from
the bullpen, just one more spectator in a Yankee Stadium crowd of
56,710.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe, however, the real debate should have centered on whether
Jarrod Washburn should have been left sitting, watching from the
dugout as the New York Yankees overcame a 5-4 Angel lead with four
runs in an 8-5 victory that is sure to test the heart and resiliency
that Manager Mike Scioscia and his players like to brag about.</LD>
<LD>   On a night when the Angels played aggressively, otherwise
dismissing the Yankee Stadium mystique and the issue of their
postseason inexperience, the Yankees won the opener of the
best-of-five division series primarily because Percival wasn't used
and Washburn may not have been used enough.</LD>
<TE>   In between the starter and closer, Ben Weber, Scott Schoeneweis
and Brendan Donnelly, three of the unsung arms in a bullpen that
evolved into the American League's best on a statistical basis,
learned the truth about October baseball, especially in a ballpark
where Yogi Berra throws out the ceremonial first pitch and each of
those 26 years when the Yankees won the World Series come blazing out
of the matrix board in center field as the Angels are standing along
the third base foul line during the pregame festivities, their view
of the championship drumroll inescapable.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the intimidating environment, his adrenalin pumping, his
fastball rising and sinking, the left-handed Washburn delivered only
81 pitches in seven innings and wanted to go out for more.</TE>
<TE>   "I lobbied for it, but they had their minds made up," Washburn
said at his locker later. "I mean, it wasn't a situation where I got
to do a lot of arguing. It wasn't where they asked me, 'How are you
doing, how do you feel?' It was more like a pat on the back, and
'Nice job.' "</TE>
<TE>   So, the 18-6 ace took a seat on the bench and watched Weber,
Schoeneweis and Donnelly cough up the lead six outs from a victory
that would have given the Yankees something to think about, and there
was Washburn later playing the diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bullpen has done a great job all year," he said, "and we were
all confident they would do it again. It's the way Mike has gone
about it all year, and I'm not going to stand here and say he made a
mistake this time. I kept us in the game, and I'm proud of that, but
I don't think I had my best stuff. I didn't have normal life on my
fastball, although I did make a lot of good pitches when I had to."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was the way the Angels have gone about it in a season in
which Washburn completed only one of 32 starts and pitched into the
eighth inning only five times, but then isn't this the start of a new
season, as managers and players like to say, isn't this when you stay
with your best and go with your best?</TE>
<TE>   The answer to that seems obvious, but the flip side is that the
Angels may have to bring Washburn back on three days' rest in Game 4
on Saturday, and that definitely entered into the thinking, pitching
coach Bud Black said, adding, as Washburn had said, that the bullpen
had done the job all year and that the Angels aren't going to beat
the Yankees by avoiding the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "And frankly," Black said, "Wash's stuff wasn't real crisp.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a rare game when he gives up three home runs, gets four
double plays and throws only 80 pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn described it in various terms. Among them:</TE>
<TE>   "Crazy."</TE>
<TE>   "Uncharacteristic."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Among major league pitchers this year he was the worst in
ground-ball-to-fly-ball ratio. In 206 innings, he had elicited only
eight double plays. He got half that total in the seven innings
against the Yankees, making the pitches, as he said, when needed.</TE>
<TE>   Although all those fly balls--the ratio translated to 100 for
every 60 ground outs--made it a year of living dangerously, he had
given up only the equivalent of one home run every 10 2/3 innings for
a total of 19 during the regular season. And until Tuesday night,
when he gave up solo homers to Derek Jeter and Rondell White and a
two-run shot to Jason Giambi, he hadn't given up three in a game this
year and had been tagged for that many only twice in his career.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three, he said, the only pitch he'd take back was a hanging
slider to Giambi.</TE>
<TE>   "Jeter hit a fastball in and White a sinker away," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were both good pitches, but I guess you would have to call
them mistakes since they ended up in the seats, and you're not going
to beat the Yankees by hoping you can get away with mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   In April, when he was awarded the honor of pitching the season
opener, Washburn hadn't been able to control his adrenalin and was
beat up early by the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Jeter homered as the second batter he faced Tuesday night, but
Washburn insisted he had got his emotions out of the way when he
popped up leadoff man Alfonso Soriano.</TE>
<TE>   How was it for him in the middle of the Bronx madhouse?</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it," Washburn said. "It was awesome. Yankee Stadium is
the coolest place this time of the year. I wouldn't have wanted to be
anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Well, he loved it until he didn't love it, until none of the
Angels did, until they were all forced to replay a familiar theme.</TE>
<TE>   As Washburn put it:</TE>
<TE>   "No question, it was a tough loss, but this team has found a way
to bounce back from tough losses all year. We won 99 games. We came
back all season, and there's no reason we can't do it again."</TE>
<TE>   These are the playoff-tested Yankees, however, and the Angels will
prevail only if they don't leave their best starter and their
dominant closer serving as mere spectators in crunch time.</TE>

<LD>The Nevada State Athletic Commission will file a formal complaint
against Fernando Vargas, either today or Thursday, for using a banned
substance, according to Executive Director Marc Ratner.</LD>
<LD>   A urine test taken after Vargas' loss to Oscar De La Hoya on Sept.
14 in a 154-pound championship fight at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay
Events Center revealed the presence of stanozolol, an anabolic
steroid.</LD>
<LD>   The tests were run on only half of Vargas' urine sample. The
result of tests on the other half of the sample are expected back
later this week.</LD>
<TE>   Ratner said he is confident enough of the results in hand to
proceed with the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Once it is received, Vargas, who is expected to be suspended for
six months to a year, will be granted a hearing within 30 to 45 days.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas, in a written statement issued last week, blamed his
handlers for giving him the steroid without his knowledge.</TE>

<TE>   Despite the Ryder Cup victory at the Belfry on Sunday, European
Tour Executive Director Ken Schofield is expected later this year to
propose amending the system before the 2004 event at Oakland Hills,
Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Leading European players support him, arguing that the present
system is illogical.</TE>
<TE>   For several years, the team has been made up of the top 10 players
from the Order of Merit--the European money list--and two captain's
picks. Schofield wants the team made up of the leading five Europeans
on the world ranking and the top five from the Order of Merit, along
with the captain's picks.</TE>
<TE>   The move, reflecting the trend of more top Europeans playing
mainly on the U.S. tour, would mean that Sergio Garcia, ranked fifth
in the world, would not have to be a captain's pick, as he was this
time. He did not play enough in Europe to qualify from the Order of
Merit.</TE>

<LD>The NFL, threatened with a lawsuit over the lack of black head
coaches, defended its hiring practices Tuesday and said the league
has taken steps to improve in that area.</LD>
<LD>   "We take the issue very seriously and have initiated several
programs in recent years under Commissioner [Paul] Tagliabue to
ensure that our hiring practices are fair, and that all coaches have
opportunities to advance," league spokesman Greg Aiello said.</LD>
<LD>   But Cyrus Mehri, a prominent civil rights attorney, said the NFL
has done far too little in providing black coaches and executives the
opportunities they deserve--especially considering 67% of the
league's players are black.</LD>
<TE>   "The issue has been festering for years," said Mehri, who served
as counsel in major race discrimination cases involving Texaco and
Coca-Cola. "The NFL is actually losing ground, not gaining ground.
Commissioner Tagliabue's good intentions are not getting the job
done."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Mehri and attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. released a study
to reporters that details the league's hiring practices over the last
15 years. The report notes that on average black coaches have been
more successful than white coaches, yet have not been hired at a rate
that reflects that.</TE>
<TE>   There are two NFL head coaches who are black--Tony Dungy of the
Indianapolis Colts and Herman Edwards of the New York Jets--and Ozzie
Newsome of the Baltimore Ravens is the league's only general manager
who is black.</TE>
<TE>   Aiello pointed out that in the last five years, 23 blacks have
been interviewed for coaching positions and three were hired: Dungy,
Edwards and Ray Rhodes, by Green Bay in 1999. But, according to
Mehri, several of those interviews were conducted over the phone, not
in person.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics indicate far more progress has been made in the hiring
of assistant coaches. In 1980, there were 14 black assistants in the
NFL, none of them coordinators. By 1997, there were 103 black
assistants, and this season 157 of the 547 assistants are black,
including 12 coordinators who are black.</TE>

<HD>Moss Faces New Charge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Receiver Randy Moss of the Minnesota Vikings was charged Tuesday with
possession of a small amount of marijuana, adding to charges last
week that he pushed a traffic officer with his car.</LD>
<LD>   The new petty misdemeanor count carries a fine of up to $200, but
it could also lead to a suspension or fine from the NFL.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they found a marijuana cigarette in Moss' car after he
was arrested Sept. 24. Moss was driving in downtown Minneapolis when
the traffic officer stepped in front of his car to stop him from
making an illegal turn. She was slightly injured when she fell off
the car.</LD>
<TE>   Moss spent the night in jail and was charged the next day with
careless driving and with failure to obey a traffic officer, both
misdemeanors.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint said the marijuana amounted to just under a gram.
Moss has said the marijuana did not belong to him and that he had
allowed other people to use his car recently.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN reported Sunday that Moss was already in the league's
substance-abuse program for testing positive for marijuana last year,
and underwent another test by the NFL after his arrest last week.</TE>
<TE>   NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the league would review the case.</TE>

<TE>   Miami Dolphin linebacker Derrick Rodgers can avert jail time under
a plea agreement released Tuesday on charges he kicked and punched
his wife and hit a man with a chair at a restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Rodgers would serve five years of probation if he accepts the deal
offered to his attorney Sept. 5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Jets, who spent lavishly in the last six weeks to
re-sign three key players, have the NFL's highest payroll at
$87,343,231, according to figures compiled by the NFL Players Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Bay Packers' payroll of $39,720,069 is the lowest.</TE>

<HD>Drury, Yelle Traded to Flames</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Colorado Avalanche General Manager Pierre Lacroix has a history of
acquiring top defensemen through trades. Normally he waits until the
trade deadline, but he considered this one too good to pass up.</LD>
<LD>   The Avalanche traded forwards Chris Drury and Stephane Yelle to
the Calgary Flames for defenseman Derek Morris in a five-player deal
Tuesday. Colorado also got forwards Dean McAmmond and Jeff Shantz.</LD>
<LD>   "I think history speaks for itself," Lacroix said. "Every time
there's been a situation with our team that needed to be addressed in
the eight years that we've been here, we've never been afraid of
addressing it and fixing it."</LD>
<TE>   Lacroix brought in Ray Bourque, Rob Blake and Darius Kasparaitis
at the trade deadline the last three seasons, but Colorado's need for
a top-line defenseman led to the deal this year.</TE>
<TE>   Morris, 24, played only 61 games last season because of a wrist
injury, but still led Calgary defensemen with 30 assists and 34
points.</TE>
<TE>   The deal didn't come without a price for Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Drury, 26, was one of Colorado's best young players and has a
knack for coming through in the clutch.</TE>
<TE>   It started at an early age, when he led Trumbull, Conn., over
Taiwan in the 1989 Little League World Series and continued at Boston
University, where he won the Hobey Baker Award in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Drury won the Calder Trophy as the league's best rookie in 1999
and has been at his best in the playoffs, where he has 26 goals in 80
games. He had three game-winning goals in the playoffs last season
and has 11 in the last four postseasons--most in the NHL.</TE>
<TE>   "It is difficult to lose a player like Chris Drury," Lacroix said.
"Chris Drury is an exceptional player and in order to acquire an
exceptional player, I think that it's totally normal that they
request a top player."</TE>

<TE>   Hartland de Montarville Molson, former head of the family brewing
dynasty and longtime owner of the Montreal Canadiens, has died at 95.
A statement issued Monday by Molson Inc. announced the death but did
not give a date. Molson was president of the Canadiens from 1957 to
1968.... Veteran winger Dixon Ward, who played in Switzerland last
season, was signed by the New York Rangers. Ward, 34, has played 529
games in the NHL. He has 95 goals and 129 assists with 429 penalty
minutes.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia Loses This Closing Argument</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Where was Troy Percival?</LD>
<LD>   The question cracked louder than Bernie Williams' bat against
Brendan Donnelly's fastball.</LD>
<LD>   The question rang longer than Tim Salmon's smashed fist against
the right-field wall.</LD>
<TE>   For several endless, numbing moments Tuesday night, the question
roared even above those ghost-summoning Yankee Stadium cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Where was Troy Percival?</TE>
<TE>   It is a question that could echo through Angel Manager Mike
Scioscia's ears for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a second guess. This is a first guess, uttered in the
press box as it was surely screamed throughout the Southland in the
eighth inning of what should have been an Angel victory in the opener
of the division series against the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The final score should have been Angels 5, Yankees 4.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was, instead, Yankees 8, Angels 5.</TE>
<TE>   The final analysis flowed as easy as what should have been Troy
Glaus' game-winning swing.</TE>
<TE>   Where was Troy Percival?</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had them. The Angels had just chased Yankees around the
Bronx for more than three hours, and they had them.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had frustrated them with long at-bats and timely bloops
and basepath sprints. They had come back three times against Roger
Clemens. They had made Joe Torre look silly and pinstripes look
human.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees were finished. They trailed, 5-4, with two out in the
eighth inning and nobody on base and an 0-and-2 count on
free-swinging Alfonso Soriano.</TE>
<TE>   Then reliever Ben Weber threw four consecutive balls to a guy who
walked only 23 times this season, and Soriano trotted to first base.</TE>
<TE>   "Incredible," said Jason Giambi.</TE>
<TE>   No, what happened next was incredible.</TE>
<TE>   With Derek Jeter batting and closer Percival ready in the bullpen,
Weber stayed in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think with where we were, how Web was throwing the ball, we
didn't mind that matchup," said Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   On a full-count, Weber also walked Jeter.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels still led, with Giambi coming to the plate, a guy
who was 0 for 5 with five strikeouts against Percival in his career,
so here came ...</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis?</TE>
<TE>   A guy against whom Giambi had reached base in their last three
encounters, with two singles and a hit-by-pitch?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind Schoeny against Giambi, he's done a good job," said
Scioscia, referring to Giambi's .250 career average against
Schoeneweis, with no homers in 20 at-bats. "He made a good pitch.
Jason's strong. He didn't get all of it, but he got enough of it to
hit it."</TE>
<TE>   Enough of it to knock it off Scott Spiezio's glove at first base
and score the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   Enough to make many Angel fans, all together now, shout it again.</TE>
<TE>   Where was Troy Percival?</TE>
<TE>   With Williams coming up and the score tied and the Angels
desperately needing to salvage what could still have been a sparkling
victory, it was yet another good chance for the veteran.</TE>
<TE>   But, instead, Scioscia brought in rookie Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   "In a tie game ... if we bring in Percy, we're going to start to,
you know, extend him ... running into trouble later in the series,"
Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   It will be surely no greater trouble, however, than Williams'
three-run, game-winning home run. It was a shot that gave the Yankees
not only the victory, but a renewal of that feeling that the Angels
had so adeptly stole from them.</TE>
<TE>   It is not something that opponents want the Yankees feeling.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to say, 'Well, it can't be magic, it's not this,
not that, not the mystique,' " Giambi said. "But the pinstripes ...
they somehow find a way to get the rally going."</TE>
<TE>   Just as Percival, with 40 saves in 44 chances this year,
traditionally stops those rallies.</TE>
<TE>   For eight years as an Angel, the long-suffering star and symbol of
this resilient team has stopped those rallies.</TE>
<TE>   We're not the only ones who know it.</TE>
<TE>   Williams said he was "surprised" that Percival was not pitching to
him.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi said simply, "That's a tough one. That's gonna be one for
Mr. Scioscia."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this week, I submitted my American League Manager of the
Year ballot.</TE>
<TE>   I voted for Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   I would do it again.</TE>
<TE>   He's a splendid communicator, a great baseball man who has turned
the Angels into the sort of smart National League team that will have
great American League success.</TE>
<TE>   But on this night, failing to bring in Percival to face either
Jeter, Giambi or Williams, he struck out.</TE>
<TE>   What has always been his greatest asset became his biggest
problem.</TE>
<TE>   He was trying to remain consistent when the situation called for
creative.</TE>
<TE>   You see, if this were the regular season, he would not have
brought in Percival on any of those three occasions, and nobody would
have said a word.</TE>
<TE>   He has only used Percival as early as the eighth inning four
times. He has arguably the league's best set-up men. He trusts them,
and that trust has been rewarded.</TE>
<TE>   "Should Mike change his managing style just for the playoffs?"
Spiezio said. "Other managers don't do that, do they?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, yes, they do. And Scioscia, having just completed his first
playoff game as a manager, will learn this.</TE>
<TE>   The playoffs are completely different than the regular season.
They are more desperate, more daring, more about last gasp than
future plans.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had their cleats on the Yankees' neck late Tuesday
night. They needed Troy Percival to finish the job.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter if he came in and required 30 pitches to do it.
It didn't matter if he would get so tired, he wouldn't be available
until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, because there was no Percival, there may not be a
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a coach, I'm not a manager, I come in when I am told,"
Percival said afterward, shrugging. "Mike knows my capabilities.
Whenever he needs me, I'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   It's official now, OK? They need him.</TE>

<LD>Filippo Inzaghi underlined his claim to being the world's top striker
by scoring two goals as AC Milan defeated Bayern Munich, 2-1, in
front of 60,000 at the Olympic Stadium in Munich Tuesday, a result
that left the German club staring at possible first-round elimination
from the Champions League.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere, Manchester United remained unbeaten and untied after
routing Olympiakos, 4-0, in Manchester, where Ryan Giggs scored twice
and Juan Sebastian Veron and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer each got one goal.</LD>
<LD>   Barcelona is the only other Champions League team with a 3-0
record after it defeated Lokomotiv Moscow, 3-1, in Russia on two
goals by Javier Saviola and one by Patrick Kluivert.</LD>
<TE>   FIFA Referee Test</TE>
<TE>   In an experiment designed to see if six game officials are any
better than four, FIFA announced that it will employ additional
assistant referees behind each goal line during some of its
international tournaments next year.</TE>
<TE>   The statement from world soccer's governing body did not specify
which tournaments would be selected, but among those scheduled for
2003 are the Women's World Cup in China, the FIFA Confederations Cup
in France and the FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab
Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   Iran Wins Again</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Iran, which demolished Afghanistan, 10-0, in
its opening game at the Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, moved
closer to qualification for the quarterfinals by defeating Lebanon,
2-0, on goals by Ali Daei and Abdou Tafei.</TE>
<TE>   Quirarte Named Coach</TE>
<TE>   Atlas of Guadalajara, which on Monday fired Enrique Meza as coach,
named former Mexico World Cup player Fernando Quirarte as his
successor.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Montano, the president of Atlas, also said that defender
Alberto Macias and midfielder Sigifredo Mercado "have been playing
badly," no longer will train with the rest of the team and will be
traded as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   A Klose Call</TE>
<TE>   Mired in last place in the German Bundesliga and strapped for cash
after losing close to $10 million in the last financial year,
Kaiserslautern announced that it was selling the transfer rights to
Germany World Cup striker Miroslav Klose, 24, to an unnamed group of
investors for approximately $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Klose's five World Cup goals have made him the target of several
European clubs.</TE>

<HD>Johnson's One Ace Who's in the Hole</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Arizona starter gives up 10 hits and six runs in
six innings as St. Louis runs away with opener, 12-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE GERGEN</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>To the rest of the National League, Randy Johnson may be the
reincarnation of Cy Young. Against the St. Louis Cardinals, he
continues to look like Cy Old.</LD>
<LD>   For the second time in two postseason encounters, the most
intimidating pitcher in baseball was routed by St. Louis and charged
with a resounding defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh from a three-game sweep of the defending champion Arizona
Diamondbacks at Busch Stadium in the last week of the regular season,
the Cardinals turned Johnson into a six-inning pitcher with a barrage
of extra-base hits and rolled to a 12-2 triumph in the first game of
the National League division series Tuesday at Bank One Ballpark.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel very, very bad that I put us in such a deep hole from the
get-go," Johnson said. "My slider was flat. My fastball fell on the
middle of the plate. Going up against probably the best lineup in the
National League, the two don't mix."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis needs two more victories to reverse the outcome of the
teams' meeting in the 2001 NLDS, which Arizona used as a springboard
to its first World Series championship.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson thoroughly dominated the league in what was the best
regular season in a likely Hall of Fame career. He led pitchers in
wins (24), earned-run average (2.32) and strikeouts (334). Johnson
also closed out the campaign with a 5-0 record and minuscule 0.66 ERA
during September, a spurt that could earn him a fourth consecutive Cy
Young Award in four seasons with the Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   But all of those glittering credentials were wasted on the
Cardinals, one of two NL teams to post a winning mark against the
6-foot-10 left-hander.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that he suffered some bad luck against St. Louis in the
past and did win his only decision of 2002 versus the Cardinals, a
5-3 victory in April at Bank One. But that didn't address the problem
he had in Game 2 of last year's series when Albert Pujols connected
for a two-run homer in the first inning en route to a 4-1 St. Louis
victory.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals started fast again Tuesday. This time it was Jim
Edmonds who provided the two-run homer, driving in Fernando Vina who
had reached base on Tony Womack's throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   But Arizona battled back to tie the score with single runs in the
first and third innings. An error by St. Louis shortstop Edgar
Renteria also provided the opportunity for the Diamondbacks and
Womack scored the first run for the home team on Junior Spivey's
bloop single and a sacrifice fly by Steve Finley.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of walks by Cardinal starter Matt Morris preceded Quinton
McCracken's RBI single in the third, evening the game at 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   No sooner had Johnson been given a second life, however, he was
victimized by Pujols' leadoff triple to deep center and a long home
run by Scott Rolen in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals added one more run in that inning on Renteria's
single and stolen base, a groundout and Mike Matheny's single.</TE>
<TE>   Two innings later, Matheny led off with a double, advanced to
third on Vina's single and scored a sixth run on a sacrifice fly by
Eli Marrero.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson departed at the end of the sixth, charged with 10 hits and
five earned runs, after which the Arizona's bullpen then imploded
during a six-run seventh inning.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, the 12 runs matched the Cardinals' total for all five
games in the 2001 division series, which they lost on Womack's single
in the ninth inning of Game 5.</TE>
<TE>   In earning his first postseason victory, Morris yielded seven hits
in seven innings. Jeff Fassero and Mike Crudale finish up for the
Cardinals, who won seven of their last eight games and 21 of their
last 25 during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The only other NL team with a winning record against Johnson is
the Atlanta Braves (4-3) but he took care of them in the 2001 league
championship series, defeating them twice while surrendering only two
runs.</TE>

<KH>NL PLAYOFF NOTES/ NATIONAL LEAGUE DIVISION SERIES/ St. Louis
vs. Arizona</KH>
<HD>Staff Infection: Williams Out, Benes Hurting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>In the National League division series that has been reduced to a
battle of attrition between the defending champion Arizona
Diamondbacks and the resurgent St. Louis Cardinals, count Woody
Williams out and put a question mark alongside the name of Andy
Benes.</LD>
<LD>   The advantage in starting pitching that Arizona enjoyed on paper
widened before the first batter stepped into the box at Bank One
Ballpark on Tuesday night. Williams, nominated to start Game 3 for
St. Louis, was left off the roster when a muscle pull failed to
respond to treatment and the availability of his understudy, Benes,
is jeopardized by back problems.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm kind of the fill-in guy," said Benes, who contemplated
retirement from baseball early in the season during a 60-day stint on
the disabled list an arthritic right knee. "I don't look at it any
differently than that. I'm filling in for one of our top three
starters."</LD>
<TE>   Williams, whose 2.53 earned-run average was the best among
Cardinal starters, experienced a strained abdominal muscle on three
occasions this season. He made his last appearance Sept. 20, the
night his team clinched the Central Division title, when he was
pulled in the fifth inning with tightness in his left side.</TE>
<TE>   "We got him out right away," Manager Tony La Russa said before
Game 1. "We thought he would catch a break, he would heal."</TE>
<TE>   Under ordinary circumstances, Benes would appear to be a qualified
substitute. Since regaining a spot in the rotation in July, he won
five of seven decisions and his 1.86 ERA after the All-Star break was
the best in the major leagues. He also boasts considerable postseason
experience, culminating in an 8-2 victory over the New York Mets in
the 2000 NL championship series.</TE>
<TE>   But Benes had to leave his last start--a 4-0 victory over
Milwaukee on Sunday--after five innings because of tightness in his
knee and back. Although the veteran right-hander said he felt a lot
better Tuesday than he did two days earlier, the manager wasn't
brimming with confidence.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big man," La Russa said. "And backs are notorious. He's
going to get treatment, do everything he can. If he can't go, Jason
will get the ball."</TE>
<TE>   That would be Jason Simontacchi, a 28-year-old rookie whose 11
wins ranked second on the depleted St. Louis staff. In a season that
reached its nadir when ace Darryl Kile died in his Chicago hotel room
June 22, the Cardinals needed 26 pitchers to gain their place in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Benes, who was on a rehabilitation assignment with Memphis, wasn't
even with the team at the time of the tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   He had felt out of the picture a month earlier. "I was at home,"
he recalled, "on the couch. The only pitching I was doing was to my
6-year-old. A lot of crazy things happened to get me into this but
here I am."</TE>
<TE>   The back pain he has felt, he said, was the result of favoring his
knee. A session with a chiropractor has convinced him he will be able
to pitch this weekend when the series resumes in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thankful for the opportunity," Benes said. "Pitching at home
is always fun."</TE>
<TE>   Williams' place on the roster was filled by Garrett Stephenson, a
veteran right-hander who made 10 starts for the Cardinals and lost
five of seven decisions.</TE>

<HD>Twins Get on the Right Track</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Despite three errors in the first two innings and
falling behind by four runs, they beat A's, 7-5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins withstood baseball's attempt to kill them off
last winter, they overcame the loss of three of their top starting
pitchers to injury for more than two months each, and they defied the
limitations of their $40-million payroll to run away with the
American League Central division title.</LD>
<LD>   What could be so daunting, then, about a horrific playoff start in
which they committed three errors and allowed an infield fly to drop
in the first two innings, suffering a case of playoff jitters their
own manager called "comical," and spotted Oakland Athletics' ace Tim
Hudson a four-run lead?</LD>
<LD>   Showing a refuse-to-lose resilience that would have made the 1995
Seattle Mariners proud, the Twins roared back to beat the A's, 7-5,
in the AL division series opener before 34,853 in Network Associates
Coliseum on Tuesday, breathing life into their upset hopes and
backing the favored A's into a must-win corner today.</LD>
<TE>   Catcher A.J. Pierzynski had four hits, including an RBI triple in
the seventh, third baseman Corey Koskie sparked the comeback with a
two-run homer in the third and knocked in the go-ahead run in the
sixth, and first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz homered in the sixth, as
Minnesota won the first game of the best-of-five series.</TE>
<TE>   The wrong-way Twins--four players and General Manager Terry Ryan
took the BART train heading for Richmond, Calif., instead of Oakland
on Tuesday morning--also got superb relief from left-handers Johan
Santana, J.C. Romero and closer Eddie Guardado, who combined for four
scoreless innings behind starter Brad Radke.</TE>
<TE>   "We embarrassed ourselves for the first two innings, not catching
the ball, and it looked a little bit like folly," Twin Manager Ron
Gardenhire said. "We came out a little tighter than I thought we
would.... Then Koskie hit the home run, and everything fell back into
place."</TE>
<TE>   Koskie's two-run shot off Hudson in the third made it 5-3, and
Mientkiewicz's leadoff homer in the sixth made it 5-4. With one out,
Oakland Manager Art Howe pulled Hudson, even though the right-hander
had thrown only 77 pitches, in favor of left-hander Ted Lilly, who
had limited left-handers to two hits in 24 at-bats since being
acquired in a trade with the New York Yankees in July.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly proceeded to give up three consecutive hits--a single to the
left-handed Pierzynski, a single to Luis Rivas and an RBI double to
the left-handed Jacque Jones, and the score was tied, 5-5. Koskie's
RBI groundout made it 6-5, and Pierzynski's RBI triple in the seventh
made it 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   "This team won't quit," Mientkiewicz said. "I know a lot of teams
say the same thing, but it's true. To play as bad as we did the first
two innings and to be down by only two runs, it motivated us."</TE>
<TE>   So did center fielder Torii Hunter, who blasted his teammates
after the second inning for making a shambles of their first playoff
game since 1991, committing two throwing errors, a fielding error and
letting Scott Hatteberg's second inning popup between the mound and
first drop for an RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   The mistakes, an aberration for a team that led the AL in defense
and committed three errors in only three games this season, led to
four unearned runs and a 5-1 deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in screaming, 'We waited our whole lives for this, let's
go!' " Mientkiewicz said. "I ran to the bathroom, because when he
gets mad, I run the other way. But he had every right to do it.
Something had to be said."</TE>
<TE>   No one felt worst than Mientkiewicz, who took the blame for not
catching Hatteberg's infield fly. Mientkiewicz wore a microphone for
the television broadcast, but there probably weren't enough bleeps to
cover his reaction.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, they have a good editing crew because I said some
things you can't say on TV," Mientkiewicz said. "If I could have dug
a hole in the dirt and jumped in, I would have. I couldn't believe
what was happening to us.... You want to win, but you don't want to
embarrass yourselves doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, who doubled and scored on Michael Cuddyer's RBI double in
the second, apologized for his rant, but he had no regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to pump them up," Hunter said. "I saw a lot of
heads hanging."</TE>
<TE>   The Twins survived some harrowing late-inning moments before
sending the A's to their fifth straight playoff loss at home, dating
to Game 2 of the 2000 division series.</TE>
<TE>   With two on and one out in the sixth, Santana struck out
most-valuable-player candidate Miguel Tejada with a nasty slider and
got cleanup batter Eric Chavez, who had RBI singles in the first and
second innings, on a grounder back to the mound, preserving a 6-5
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Tejada had a chance to tie the score with a homer in the eighth
but, with a runner on first and two out, he struck out on Romero's
inside slider. The A's put two on with two out in the ninth off
Guardado, who had given up a dramatic three-run homer to Tejada in
the bottom of the ninth inning of a 7-5 loss on Sept. 1.</TE>
<TE>   But after stepping off the mound several times to gain his
composure, Guardado got pinch-hitter Adam Piatt to fly out to left on
a full-count pitch to end the game.</TE>

vs. Oakland</KH>
<HD>Howe Wanted to Save Hudson</HD>

<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>It wasn't exactly Gene Mauch pulling Mike Witt in the ninth inning of
Game 5 in the 1986 American League championship series, but Oakland
Manager Art Howe took some heat for yanking starter Tim Hudson with
the A's leading, 5-4, the bases empty and one out in the sixth inning
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Hudson was very "un-Hudson-like," in the words of teammate Ray
Durham, giving up three runs and six hits in the first three innings,
but the right-hander found a groove in the fourth, blowing a 94-mph
fastball by Jacque Jones and getting Cristian Guzman to foul out with
runners on second and third to end the inning.</LD>
<LD>   Hudson, who took an eight-game win streak into the playoffs,
retired the side in order in the fifth before giving up a solo homer
to Doug Mientkiewicz to open the sixth.</LD>
<TE>   After Michael Cuddyer's groundout on Hudson's 77th pitch, Howe,
knowing Hudson will start Game 4, if necessary, on three days' rest,
went to left-hander Ted Lilly, who coughed up the lead by giving up
three straight hits and an RBI groundout.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very surprised he took him out--usually you let your horse
go longer, and he wasn't losing," Durham said. "I'm not the manager,
but I felt he was still in control of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Said Howe: "I just thought he wasn't as sharp as he could be. He
gave up a couple of home runs.... That's not healthy, and I wanted to
get him a win. We had our left-handers ready to come in, and it just
didn't work out the way we wanted it to."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Twin pitcher Brad Radke, who gave up five runs, one earned, and
eight hits in five innings to gain the victory Tuesday, was one of
four players--Guzman, David Ortiz and Denny Hocking were the
others--who boarded the wrong subway train at their San Francisco
hotel and didn't reach Network Associates Coliseum until two hours

party.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this surprised anyone in the Twins' clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had guys go to the Astrodome in Houston, and they don't
even play there anymore," Mientkiewicz said. "We've had guys go to

him on their roster unless they advance to the next round.... Torii
Hunter's double in the second inning Tuesday was his first hit in 12

<LD>The key to beating Oregon State would appear to be putting the sort
of defensive pressure USC did on quarterback Derek Anderson--sacking
him five times in a 22-0 shutout.</LD>
<LD>   But UCLA defensive end Dave Ball isn't so sure.</LD>
<LD>   "We think it's going to be different. We think they'll try to run
the ball a lot more," Ball said. "We just don't think they're going
to pass that much after what [USC] did to their passing--plus, we
think they're going to look at our Colorado game."</LD>
<TE>   UCLA gave up 325 yards rushing against the Buffaloes, and Oregon
State has the Pacific 10's leading rusher, Steven Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   "We've just got to be a lot more tough versus the run," Ball said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins don't want to get blindsided by Oregon State like they
did by Colorado the week after USC manhandled the Buffaloes.</TE>
<TE>   "What we thought versus Colorado was wrong then. This time, we
have to step it up a lot more than we did against Colorado," Ball
said. "We didn't have a great week of practice then and were kind of
soft--not we, but I was personally.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like we're getting the teams coming off embarrassing
losses and right in the corner.... We have to be equally as intense.
It's like a wounded animal, you know."</TE>

<TE>   Tailback Akil Harris, expected to lose carries this week to Manuel
White, is still playing with a sore thumb but said it doesn't affect
him.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo said Harris has "missed some holes" but his
effectiveness also has been lessened by injuries to the fullback
corps.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it's just time to make the best of every carry," Harris
said. "Right now I just feel it's a change-up for what we're doing
this week."</TE>

him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't need to be on the front of the school newspaper with some
guy standing over me," Paus said.</TE>

would do it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   C.J. Niusulu will have a pre-preliminary hearing Nov. 5 and a

<HD>Pullman Life Was No Party</HD>
<DH>Simmons left Cougars after being beaten</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROB FERNAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Melvin "Champ" Simmons left Washington State 14 months ago confused
and disillusioned, his sense of justice shaken.</LD>
<LD>   A hard-hitting linebacker on the football field, Simmons was
beaten so badly at a fraternity party that he was hospitalized. But
prosecutors delivered a more painful blow when they decided not to
file charges in the case, citing conflicting witness reports.</LD>
<LD>   Simmons, recalling the moment his mother broke the news to him,
leaned forward in his chair at USC's Heritage Hall, rubbed his face
and spoke in a soft tone of resignation.</LD>
<TE>   "It hit me, 'Wow, look how crooked life can be,' " he said. "I
just became real down about life. I had a picture of what's right. I
had faith in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "At that moment, I couldn't figure out if I wanted to cry or get
mad, because I was so mind-boggled."</TE>
<TE>   Now, more than at any time in his football career, Simmons
realizes he must keep his emotions in check this week. The USC
linebacker will try to vent his anger before he steps onto the field
Saturday at Washington State to face his former team.</TE>
<TE>   The game will mark Simmons' first return to Pullman, Wash., since
he left in August 2001, and he doesn't want any painful memories to
affect his play.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to get all my frustration out the night before the game,
so I'm not trying to play overzealous," he said. "When I'm like that,
I tend to make mistakes, and that's not what I want to occur."</TE>
<TE>   So far, Simmons has been a picture of consistency in his first
season playing for USC. The 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior ranks second
among the Trojans in tackles and has earned praise from coaches and
teammates for his intensity and leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real instinctive player," Coach Pete Carroll said. "He's a
natural at [linebacker] and has a feel for plugging holes and
scrapping and adjusting to plays. He understands the game well.... I
expect him to have a really good year."</TE>
<TE>   Simmons was hungry to play again after having to sit out last
season because of his transfer. Considering that he played against
USC as a freshman and sophomore, it's understandable that the Compton
native felt awkward in his initial days on campus last fall.</TE>
<TE>   But those feelings quickly dissipated as Simmons made his mark in
practice and began to identify with the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard at first because I didn't feel like an SC guy," he
said. "Instead of looking at them as [opponents], I had to grasp the
idea of them being a part of me, and me being a part of them."</TE>
<TE>   Now, he said, "I couldn't imagine a situation [where] I could be
more happy."</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when Simmons thought Washington State was the
right fit. He liked the idea of going away to school after playing at
Compton Dominguez High. He made friends and developed a good
relationship with Coach Mike Price, whom he still holds in high
regard.</TE>
<TE>   After playing on special teams as a freshman, Simmons started 10
games as a sophomore and led the Cougars with seven sacks. His place
on the team seemed secure: a defensive leader with a bright future.</TE>
<TE>   But Simmons' attitude toward Washington State and the surrounding
area changed.</TE>
<TE>   On March 30, 2001, a Friday, Simmons said he went out by himself
about 9 p.m. and ran into a teammate, Patrick Henderson, outside a
Pullman bar. Simmons said Henderson invited him to a party at his
fraternity house later that night.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to come at 12 o'clock," Simmons recalled. "He was
going to let me in."</TE>
<TE>   However, when Simmons got to the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity house,
he couldn't find Henderson. Instead, he found several teammates and
other Washington State athletes outside the front door, trying to get
in.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Simmons said he saw a teammate who had tried to
crash the party getting the bum's rush by a group of fraternity
members.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to pull them off of him," he said. "That's when I got
pretty much dog-piled."</TE>
<TE>   Al Genatone, now a starting linebacker for the Cougars, said he
pulled Simmons out from under the pile of bodies.</TE>
<TE>   "He was sticking up for one of our guys, all by himself, when a
mob jumped him," Genatone said. "He got caught on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   When Genatone went to check on Simmons the next day in his dorm
room, he was shocked by what he saw.</TE>
<TE>   "His face was pretty swollen," he said. "I was scared."</TE>
<TE>   Genatone drove his friend to the hospital. Simmons had suffered a
concussion, a broken facial bone and a broken thumb. His nose and
mouth were numb because of nerve damage. Some witnesses reported he
had been kicked several times while on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons' parents were notified by Washington State coaches, and
their response was swift. They wanted their son home immediately. A
few days after the incident, Simmons flew home with his mother,
Kathleen, taking all of his possessions.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons said his parents screened calls from Cougar coaches,
telling them he wasn't coming back. But then he had a change of
heart.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem," he said, "was that I [left school] for my parents."</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks after leaving, Simmons returned to Washington State,
ready to make the best of an uncomfortable situation. Soon after, the
university imposed sanctions on the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity for
violence and alcohol issues.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons' father, Melvin Sr., said he believed authorities knew who
had kicked his son and were close to making an arrest. The family
alleges there were racial overtones in Simmons' beating. Most of the
fraternity members were white; Simmons is black.</TE>
<TE>   "The police called us and said they had a suspect," Melvin Sr.
said. "We felt good about that."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors, though, said they hit a dead end in their
investigation because of conflicting witness reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing could be established beyond a reasonable doubt," said Jim
Kaufman, a Whitman County prosecutor. "There were several versions of
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Another prosecutor, David Stevens, said Simmons himself had been a
suspect in the melee.</TE>
<TE>   "After extensive interviews with witnesses, basically it turned
out that the clearest picture we had of what happened was that Mr.
Simmons assaulted someone," said Stevens, now a Spokane County deputy
prosecutor. "How he came to get his injuries we could never prove.
Whether he was kicked, as he alleged, or, as other witnesses said, he
could have hurt himself when he fell."</TE>
<TE>   Genatone said that in the confusion, he didn't see Simmons get
kicked. But he has little doubt that is what happened.</TE>
<TE>   "A fight is one thing, but when someone gets kicked on the ground
you can get killed," Genatone said. "There was just a big pile of
guys. It got out of control. It happened in 30 seconds. It was hard
to tell what happened. All [investigators] could get was who was
there."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a moment of reflection, Genatone assessed blame.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we all were [at fault]," he said. "We should have just
left [the party] and let things be."</TE>
<TE>   The fallout, at least for Simmons, was losing trust in some of his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that I had teammates who were [members] in the frat house
that would not tell who had kicked me," he said. "Once that happened,
that blew my mind."</TE>
<TE>   All that summer, Simmons wavered on whether he would leave
Washington State. When he learned that prosecutors had dropped the
case, only days into training camp before the 2001 season, it was the
last straw.</TE>
<TE>   "That's when I said, 'All right, Ma, this isn't for me,' " he
recalled. "Being here any longer is not going to be for me. It's not
going to help my [healing] process. I actually started crying."</TE>
<TE>   After withdrawing from Washington State, Simmons had two weeks to
find another school. His family contacted USC, where Simmons' younger
brother Marvin, a former standout linebacker at Long Beach Poly High,
had signed a letter of intent.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin did not enroll at USC after his test scores were
challenged, but the Trojans were receptive to his older brother
joining the team. Although athletes normally are required to sit out
two years if they transfer from one Pacific 10 Conference school to
another, Simmons sat out only one year, the NCAA requirement, after
the conference rule was waived for him.</TE>
<TE>   Price, Washington State's coach, helped clear the way by writing a
letter on Simmons' behalf, an act of generosity that has not been
forgotten by the former Cougar.</TE>
<TE>   "That just made everything possible for me to come to SC," Simmons
said. "It made me have a better attitude about life, that I could
still have some trust that there are good people out there, even in
the town of Pullman."</TE>
<TE>   Of Saturday's game, Price said, "It will be strange to see Champ
Simmons on the other sideline."</TE>
<TE>   It will be strange for Simmons too. He acknowledges having a
curious relationship with his former school. Sometimes, in fits of
anger, he curses Washington State. Other times, he revels in the
football team's success.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a lot of fine relationships while I was there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Always lingering, though, is a sense of bitterness about Pullman
and its inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as that city and area are concerned," he said, "I have so
much built-up anger that just can't wait to be let out."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In August, Fred Matua was on his way to becoming the first freshman
in six years to start an opener on the offensive line for USC.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Matua and Coach Pete Carroll said he was instead on
track to redshirt.</LD>
<LD>   Matua, who has been hobbled because of a bruised right knee
suffered on Aug. 29, will not play Saturday against No. 17 Washington
State and will sit out the rest of the season if he is not able to
return for the Oct. 12 game against California, Carroll said.</LD>
<TE>   "This is kind of his last shot to be able to play this season,"
Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Matua worked with the first unit during training camp after senior
guard Zach Wilson strained his foot. He injured his knee a few days
before the opener and alternated with senior Derek Graf against
Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Matua did not play against Colorado, played as a reserve against
Kansas State and sat out last week's victory over Oregon State.</TE>
<TE>   "It's frustrating, but I want to give my leg that time to rest,"
Matua said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore running back Darryl Poston said his back pain eased
after a spinal epidural injection on Monday, but he still plans to
redshirt.... Defensive end Omar Nazel (sore shoulder) and defensive
tackle Shaun Cody (left hip flexor) sat out most of practice but are
expected back today.... Left tackle Jacob Rogers (strained right
knee) participated in light drills.... Receiver Sandy Fletcher
(strained ankle ligaments) will not play against Washington State....
Freshman receiver Chris McFoy, a receiver from Chino, may travel to
Pullman, Wash., and play on special teams, depleted because of
injuries.... Cornerback Ronald Nunn, who tore knee ligaments against
Kansas State, will wear a knee brace for three weeks after undergoing
surgery last week.</TE>

<LD>It's tough to organize a game of touch football in Melvin Simmons'
family. Everyone wants to play linebacker.</LD>
<LD>   Simmons, a junior at USC and starting weakside linebacker for the
Trojans, is the oldest of seven boys, all of whom play linebacker.</LD>
<LD>   "It wasn't like I planned it," said the boys' father, Melvin Sr.,
himself a former linebacker at Central High in Kansas City, Mo.
"They're tremendous hitters and they love to hit. It's just a natural
position for them. I never told a coach where to play them."</LD>
<TE>   Melvin, 21, who got the nickname "Champ" from his mother,
Kathleen, has paved the way for his siblings by having a successful
college career that started with a two-year stint at Washington State
before he transferred to USC last year. He is the second-oldest of 11
children.</TE>
<TE>   Following in his footsteps on the football field are:</TE>
<TE>   * Marvin, who is playing for Compton College with the hope of
transferring to USC after he earns the required credits. The former
prep All-American at Long Beach Poly High signed with USC after the
2000 season but did not enroll after his test scores were challenged.</TE>
<TE>   * Marlin, 19, a junior who starts for Poly, ranked second in the
