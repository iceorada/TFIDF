<HD>DJ Shadow Goes Multimedia</HD>
<DH>The enigmatic MC who defies categories adds film to his
feats of turntable and equalizer magic at the Mayan.</DH>

<LD>Moby might be the face of dance music, but Northern California's DJ
Shadow is the closest thing the genre has to a rock star right now.</LD>
<LD>   An enigmatic figure who is heavily influenced by hip-hop but is
also a master at sampling and creating rich, atmospheric grooves,
Shadow (born Josh Davis) has in a relatively short time created a
category-defying body of work, including his landmark 1996 debut,
"Entroducing," the "supergroup" U.N.K.L.E. (whose album featured
Beastie Boy Mike D and Radiohead's Thom Yorke, among others) and his
current release, "The Private Press."</LD>
<LD>   Playing before a capacity throng at the Mayan Theatre on
Wednesday, Shadow set aside his mystique to play MC in a multimedia
extravaganza. A 12-minute film called "Keepin Time," featuring
musicians ranging from veteran drummer Ernie Palmer to L.A.
turntablist Cut Chemist, provided a perfect introduction to Shadow's
90-minute set as it hit on many of the key aspects of his sound.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm trying a new style," Shadow said during the show. "I'm trying
to keep in tune as well as in time." It's that melodic and harmonic
component that helps distinguish Shadow from his peers, and it was in
large supply during the Mayan set.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on new, unreleased and old material, Shadow unleashed his
full arsenal, from the intoxicating soul-dance refrain "Lonely Soul"
to the funk of the new album's "Right Thing/GDMFSOB." Standing amid
what looked like a mini-recording studio with multiple turntables and
equalizers, Shadow used the tools of his trade to replicate a range
of instrumental sounds, introducing heavy percussion, horns and rich,
melancholy keyboards during the new album's mournful "Blood on the
Motorway."</TE>
<TE>   Shadow showed his skill at switching moods. Although not
especially noted for his technical DJ skills, Shadow laid out some
wicked turntable scratching and, more important, displayed
surprisingly fluid transitions throughout the night.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, by the end of the evening, it felt as if there were
nothing Shadow couldn't do behind a deck. Detractors complain that
Shadow's reputation stems from the mystique he has created, but that
side was de-emphasized Wednesday. He even thanked the crowd several
times and seemed genuinely moved by the audience's response to his
music.</TE>

<HD>Pianist Meets Mechanical Challenges With Style</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Expect big things of Laura Mikkola, the Finnish pianist who made a
good impression in her Hollywood Bowl debut five years ago and
returned Wednesday night for a first local recital, in Zipper Hall at
the Colburn School. At 28, Mikkola has all the tools of her trade
assembled and polished. Moreover, her musicality and versatility are
remarkable.</LD>
<LD>   As she showed on her recent first recording, the pianist excels in
several different styles. On that CD, she impressed with large works
by Haydn and Finnish composer Einojuhani Rautavaara. On Wednesday
night, Mikkola played Chopin, Liszt, Esa-Pekka Salonen and Ravel,
delineating each style astutely and with affection, and dispatching
all mechanical challenges with aplomb.</LD>
<LD>   At mid-program, her expertise brought out the best musical
features of both Liszt's "Spanish Rhapsody" and Salonen's 2-year-old
"Dichotomie," works of great contrast but similar, and extreme,
technical demands.</LD>
<TE>   Liszt's old chestnut has seldom been given such loving and
manicured care. Every passage glowed, every trill sparkled, and the
entirety emerged both serious and playful. "Dichotomie"--last heard
here on the Piano Spheres series in October--thrilled the listener
anew, its two halves, one Boulezian, the other Debussyan,
complementing each other perfectly</TE>
<TE>   In Chopin's G-minor Ballade and Ravel's "Jeux d'eau," both utterly
convincing stylistically, Mikkola made all the musical points with
panache. Only the closing work on the program, Prokofiev's Eighth
Sonata, lacked its full sense of compulsion and vehemence, despite
her conscientious and resourceful playing.</TE>

<HD>Smoothly, J.J. Jackson Aims to Lead Boomers in the Wave</HD>
<DH>In a switch, the man known for his MTV and L.A. rock radio
work will play jazz in drive-time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CARNEY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone who was a music fan 20 years ago remembers J.J. Jackson
beaming from the television set as one of MTV's original VJs. Many
others know him from his three decades on the airwaves for Los
Angeles rock stations.</LD>
<LD>   So, steeped in a background of rock 'n' roll, how did he end up
spinning smooth-jazz discs at the Wave, KTWV-FM (94.7)? Well, they
just called and asked him.</LD>
<LD>   "I was incredibly surprised," said Jackson, who starts Monday as
the station's afternoon drive-time disc jockey. "I was just flattered
and extremely pleased that they would consider me.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll be learning and trying to develop a style. It's like being
new again," said Jackson, who got his start at WBCN, a legendary
free-form rock station in Boston. From that he emceed concerts for
Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin and the Who, came to L.A. in the early
'70s as one of the original DJs at KLOS-FM (95.5), gained even more
prominence at MTV and most recently has hosted "The Beatle Years," a
weekly syndicated program about the Fab Four, and worked weekends on
KLOS. Now he'll be shifting gears, playing Sade, Toni Braxton and
Dave Koz from 2 to 7 p.m. weekdays.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole new genre," Jackson said. "I'm challenged by the
fact that there's a lot to learn. I love the fact that there's stuff
to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Even though he's most familiar with rock, Jackson said his tastes
span all types of music. He said the first records he bought at age
11 were by jazz greats Miles Davis, Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan. He
grew up in a home in which music variety was the rule; his mother
attended a Who concert in 1969, and she took the 5-year-old Jackson
to see singer Josephine Baker during her last tour.</TE>
<TE>   "We had more diversity, and certainly more than people would think
we'd have in a black household," Jackson said. "I like jazz, I like
classical, I like country--I'm a Dwight Yoakam fan."</TE>
<TE>   KTWV program director Chris Brodie said she jumped to hire Jackson
when she found out he was available, calling him a "musicologist" and
citing his demeanor and familiarity with all genres.</TE>
<TE>   "He's such a personable and outgoing guy. He's a fan of the
format," she said. "He thinks it's a pretty natural progression. You
find very few people in this format who didn't come from other
formats."</TE>
<TE>   And that migration among DJs seems to mirror the movement among
many listeners who have come to the increasingly popular "smooth
jazz" format.</TE>
<TE>   While traditional jazz stations are dwindling to near-extinction,
smooth-jazz stations have grown, especially in the past five years,
said Carol Archer, smooth-jazz editor of the trade magazine Radio &amp;
Records. They've attracted aging baby boomers who are no longer
getting what they want from rock and pop radio by playing everything
from Kenny G to Booker T. &amp; the MGs. So kids once wowed by the guitar
prowess of Eddie Van Halen get the same feeling listening to Pat
Metheny.</TE>
<TE>   For listeners and air personalities alike, "a lot of people in
their middle-aged careers have come from rock, and have sort of grown
up and out of rock radio and pop radio, and gone to a different place
in their lives, musically," Archer said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said a fan of smooth-jazz singer Norah Jones could very
well also be a fan of the Rolling Stones. But that same person might
no longer be up for a Limp Bizkit concert.</TE>
<TE>   "You're 45 years old, for heaven's sake. You don't want the kid
next to you, he's smoking a spliff and it's about to overtake you,
and another one is throwing up," he said, laughing. "They're just
excited to be there. You're standing there with your wife and maybe
your kid, and you're going, 'Who needs this?' "</TE>
<TE>   Even if that couple could stage-dive with the best of them 20
years ago, maybe now they're done with all that. So, Jackson said,
"you go across town and you have a really nice meal at a club, and
here comes this jazz band that's really deep and soulful."</TE>
<TE>   If fans of Jackson who previously listened only to rock now give
smooth jazz a try because he's introducing it, he said he'll be
happy. And if they decide they like the music and stay, even
better--Jackson said they can then discover and be energized by new
artists together. He said he was driving down Ventura Boulevard when
he first heard contemporary jazz chanteuse Diana Krall's version of
the oft-covered "The Look of Love." At one point, he said, "I got so
excited, I said, 'Sing it, lady!' I fell in love with her."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson takes over the afternoon slot occupied by Don Burns for 14
years. With a resonant voice even smoother than the station's format,
Burns soothed listeners during their drive home, advised them to
"have the kind of night you want to have" and often topped the
ratings for his time slot.</TE>
<TE>   "He's replacing someone very highly rated and extremely identified
with [the station], one of the true voices of the identity of the
Wave," Archer said of Jackson. "Afternoon drive with a recognizable
and highly regarded radio figure is a very, very wise move. And with
J.J.'s status, he's very well-known and very highly regarded."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he hopes to be the Jay Leno to Burns' Johnny
Carson--replacing an institution, but successful in his own right,
with his own style.</TE>
<TE>   "The greatest challenge for me is not to fill his shoes, but to
live up to their expectations," he said. "If they think I have the
talent to do so, I'm going to do my darnedest to prove them right."</TE>
<TE>   Burns left the station in mid-April when salary talks broke down.
He says he has no plans to return to radio and instead will focus on
voice-over work.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sound like there's any animosity, because there
isn't," he said. "It was time to go. Unless you're syndicated and
doing a political talk show or are Howard Stern, you're not going to
make any money in this business anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Brodie wouldn't comment on Burns' departure, saying only, "He
resigned."</TE>
<TE>   "I wish them the best," Burns said. "I don't know what's going to
happen. I'm not worried about my future, but I loved the Wave. We
have an audience of really classy people. They're intelligent,
they're esoteric, they're really a cut above."</TE>

<HD>Singing From Experience</HD>
<DH>Theater* Barbara Cook survived fame and the lack of it to
find a renewed career stretching out before her. She's touring with
'Mostly Sondheim.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHIP CREWS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's Barbara Cook's laugh that stays with you--a full, throaty,
lived-in, been-through-the-flood kind of laugh. Her knee is hurting
for some reason, and she's having all kinds of trouble pulling names
out of her memory bank. But in the end these frustrations, like so
much else, are answered with a chuckle.</LD>
<LD>   Seated in her sun-happy living room on Riverside Drive, the
74-year-old singer is marveling at the current upswing in her long
career. "Mostly Sondheim," an evening of songs written by or admired
by Stephen Sondheim, has been delighting audiences in various venues
for more than a year now, eliciting critical superlatives that exceed
the ones she routinely receives.</LD>
<LD>   "The first thing to acknowledge is simple incredulity," announced
the New York Times when the show played here in January. "Her soprano
pipes sound prime of life like: mellifluous, rangy, bell clear and
either full or delicate, as necessary."</LD>
<TE>   "Cook's voice is a natural wonder," concurred the Daily News.
Concluded the New York Post: "What a privilege to hear her in this
unexpected prime."</TE>
<TE>   So Cook has many reasons to be jolly on this afternoon. "Yeah,
this has been an amazing thing, really," she says. "To be a hit
again."</TE>
<TE>   She hasn't exactly been a flop during nearly three decades as a
concert and cabaret artist, but the point is well taken. For many
years she was a connoisseur's singer, admired and even revered by a
loyal claque. But suddenly Cook is, well, very hot. "We're doing very
well this year in particular," she acknowledges. "It's gotta be the
show, you know, the 'Mostly Sondheim.' ... It's the first time that
I've been booked as Barbara Cook doing this show, rather than Barbara
Cook singing whatever Barbara Cook is singing at the moment."</TE>
<TE>   It Started With</TE>
<TE>   Sondheim's List</TE>
<TE>   This production's point of origin was a list Sondheim assembled
two years ago, of songs he said he wished he'd written. His choices
were eclectic, including such disparate concoctions as "I Had Myself
a True Love," "The Trolley Song" and "Hard-Hearted Hannah." Cook was
intrigued and, with her longtime musical director, Wally Harper,
began assembling an evening combining Sondheim's own works with tunes
from his list. Early last year she took it to Carnegie Hall and
triumphed. (The performance was preserved on CD.)</TE>
<TE>   "No one sings theater songs with more feeling for the music or
more understanding of the lyrics than Barbara," Sondheim says.</TE>
<TE>   In spirit and demeanor, Cook seems to be of no particular age. The
wide face is framed by blond curls, and on it you can see various
former selves as she evokes them over a couple of hours of
reminiscence and reflection. She speaks directly about her work and
herself. Suggest that her voice is in remarkable shape and she'll
answer: "Yes, it's good, isn't it? Yeah."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember when I didn't sing," says Cook, who grew up in
Atlanta. "My father was a traveling salesman, and he would call home
several times a week, and I would always sing for him on the phone."</TE>
<TE>   In 1948, at 20, she came to New York, and in 1951 made her
Broadway debut in a musical satire called "Flahooley." It flopped.</TE>
<TE>   Around this time she married David LeGrant, a comedian. Their son,
Adam, now 42, is pursuing acting in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1955, she won the female lead in a mild success called "Plain
and Fancy." The next year brought her the role of the guileless and
impulsive Cunegonde in Leonard Bernstein's "Candide." The centerpiece
of the part was "Glitter and Be Gay." The vocal requirements of
Cunegonde were diabolical. The memory brings a chortle. "It was four
E-flats over high C. There were six D-flats, 16 B-flats and 21 high
Cs. Twenty-one high Cs. That's what it was. And I did that eight
times a week."</TE>
<TE>   "Candide," now a revered production, played only nine weeks.</TE>
<TE>   She finally scored an unqualified success in 1957, when she
originated the part of Marian the librarian in "The Music Man,"
opposite Robert Preston--a long run and Tony Awards all around. But
her later efforts didn't work out as well. "The Gay Life" (1961) had
Cook and a beautiful score but not enough beyond that. "She Loves Me"
(1963) was a wonderful show with superb performances and strong
reviews, and still only a nine-month run.</TE>
<TE>   On Broadway in the mid-'60s, big, splashy star vehicles were being
written to glorify the likes of Carol Channing, Angela Lansbury, Mary
Martin, Barbra Streisand and Gwen Verdon. Cook was nearing 40, and
opportunities to "work from the material" were growing fewer. In
1965, she divorced. And sometime in this period she began gaining a
great deal of weight.</TE>
<TE>   "I called it a kind of 'middlescence,' " she says. "Like
adolescence? A middlescence, like 'What do you do now?' "</TE>
<TE>   During that period, wounds were inflicted that she'll never
forget. "At some point I had to work," she says. "I had to make some
money. And it was hard for me. People were very unkind. Very cruel
about it."</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, she gave her first concert, and she gave it at Carnegie
Hall, receiving career-making critical homage. But "in the New York
Times there were these juxtaposed photographs, one of me weighing 106
and one weighing 206, or whatever I weighed at the time. And there's
this unattractive juxtaposition. And somebody called me on the
phone--how he got my number I don't know--somebody I didn't even know
very well.... He said, 'My name is Joe Smith,' and he said, 'I saw
the Times article, and I am astonished that you have been so
self-destructive, and how could you do that?' " The idea has her
cackling. "Isn't it unbelievable, that people think they have a right
to do that?"</TE>
<TE>   During that already rough period, Cook had another serious
problem, one she has only recently acknowledged publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know when you cross the line into what is alcoholic
drinking as opposed to social, having-fun drinking.... Like any other
alcoholic, the time comes when you think you're drinking because you
have problems, but the point has come where the main problem is the
drinking, only you don't know it."</TE>
<TE>   Around 1977 she stopped for six months. One night she went to a
party and "everybody else was drinking, and I was having my sparkling
water, and then on the way home I thought, 'I think I'll celebrate
too.' And I got very drunk very fast, because I hadn't had anything
to drink in six months. And I passed out, I'm sure--one calls it
'falling asleep,' but you know--and I woke up ... having a terrible
panic attack.</TE>
<TE>   "With each attack, there is some moment when you think you're
dying. You think, 'There is no way any human body can survive what my
body is going through right now.' And I suddenly for some reason made
the connection between that and the drinking. And you know, you'd do
just almost anything to not have those panic attacks.... I looked at
that wine glass--it was wine that I was drinking--and I said to
myself--I might have even said it out loud, I don't remember--'I'm
never gonna do that again.' And I knew it was true."</TE>
<TE>   Sharing Her Knowledge</TE>
<TE>   With Voice Students</TE>
<TE>   Cook regularly conducts master classes for voice students here and
elsewhere. What she talks about, at times, is the need to express
"what life has done to you." It's a big part of what she tries to do
onstage.</TE>
<TE>   "A song like 'Losing My Mind,' " she says. "I've been doing that
... off and on anyway, since I did the 'Follies' concerts. That was
in 1985, so that's what, 17 years.... I think I've grown into that
song. I think I present it better than I used to.... I live it more
and sing it less."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, she says, her approach to her work has changed
considerably in the last few years. "It was something that just came
to me naturally. And that is to communicate. I think partly it came
from my being scared to death if I'm just going out there to make
pretty sounds....</TE>
<TE>   "But if I can get involved in what the song is saying and what the
composer wanted to say," she says, "I don't have time to be nervous
for that moment. And that's why sometimes I don't want to come out of
a song. Sometimes--and I don't even realize it when I'm in the
song--it isn't until it's time to stop that I think, 'Oh, I've got to
go back.' You know? And I don't really want to. I am absolutely
inside this thing, and it's an unpleasant idea to come back. Because
I'm safe in there."</TE>

<HD>Gripping Trance and Dance From North Africa</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gnawa trance music from North Africa is not precisely what one
expects to hear in the salsa surroundings of the Conga Room. But
Marrakech-born Hassan Hakmoun, who sings and plays the traditional
three-stringed, lute-like sintir, is not your typical gnawa musician,
nor is the Conga Room solely a Latin music destination.</LD>
<LD>   The charismatic Hakmoun and his six-piece band did offer a set of
numbers in which the music, driven by the low, dark tones of his
sintir, resonated with the gnawa trance qualities characteristic of
traditional derderba ceremonies. But it also was underscored with
driving, often funk-drenched rhythms that blended the music into a
gripping combination of trance and dance elements.</LD>
<LD>   Hakmoun frequently alternates between traditional outings and
performances of the sort he presented at the Conga Room.</LD>
<TE>   In both cases, he is always the clear focus of attention, with his
penetrating, emotional singing and his remarkable capacity to use the
sintir to drive a stage full of electronic instruments. At the Conga
Room he occasionally supplemented his singing and playing with a
display of his lithe, energetic dancing.</TE>
<TE>   But his performance was undercut by a sound mix that tended to
bury his voice and his sintir, and by a volume level close to the
pain threshold. The Conga Room, in its admirable expansion of
programming into the world music and jazz arenas, needs to give more
careful consideration to the manner in which that type of programming
is presented.</TE>

<HD>Attack of the TV Clones: Thank 'L&amp;O' and 'CSI'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NOEL HOLSTON</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everybody's picking CBS' "CSI: Miami" to be the fall season's
slam-dunk hit--this despite the fact that the pilot, broadcast last
month as an episode of the mother series, was one of the creakiest
"CSIs" ever.</LD>
<LD>   "Miami" star David Caruso, the actor who vainly bolted "NYPD
Blue," exhibited little chemistry with the Las Vegas "CSI" contingent
or Emily Proctor, his female co-star-to-be.</LD>
<LD>   Why, then, the optimistic prognosis? Simple. Name recognition.
"CSI" is a brand now. It will stand out like Caruso's carrot top
among the unfamiliar (and often over-wordy) titles of new fall shows
in TV-listing grids. If "CSI: Miami" works, as it probably will, the
producers could very well franchise their brand, like KFC or "Law &amp;
Order." The hook, however, would be geographic: "CSI: Minneapolis"
(the snowy one). "CSI: New Orleans" (the jazzy one). "CSI: North
Platte" (the corn-fed one).</LD>
<TE>   Every city in the country with any pride and expectation of
progress will want its own. Getting a "CSI" pegged to your
metropolitan area will become a symbol of having arrived, like
getting a Bloomingdale's or an Ikea.</TE>
<TE>   We know what would likely happen next, TV being the medium where
cloning was invented and where plagiarism is the sincerest form of
flattery. More and more networks will turn to the producers of their
most successful series and say, "Could we get another of those--in
Cincinnati?"</TE>
<TE>   So fasten your seat belts and lock your tongues in cheek as we get
ready for:</TE>
<TE>   "The King of Jacksonville": Plump, parcel-delivery man and
too-cute-to-be-true wife share a cramped, cinderblock rambler in
Jacksonville, Fla., with her garrulous widower dad, a retired
greyhound trainer.</TE>
<TE>   "ER: Phoenix": With a cast that includes new faces and actors who
left the Chicago-based original for opportunities that didn't pan
out, it will offer a familiar mix of surgery and soap. In addition,
the producers will guarantee viewers they'll never see a drop of rain
or a flake of snow.</TE>
<TE>   "Will &amp; Grace: San Francisco," "Will &amp; Grace: New Orleans," "Will
&amp; Grace: Minneapolis": Capitalizing on the popularity of the New York
prototype, three more sitcoms featuring funny homosexual guys and
their straight female friends, set in America's most gay-friendly
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "Friends: Nashville": Comic misadventures of six lusty young
adults who live in the same apartment complex in Music City, among
them self-employed song plugger Chandler Bodine; his wife, barbecue
caterer Monica Wynette; her archeologist brother Hoss; and an
endearingly dense aspiring singer, Willie Tribbiani. Their home away
from home is a coffee shop and deli, Nashville Katz, operated by a
former New Yorker.</TE>
<TE>   "The West Wing: New York": Fast-talking drama set in the homes of
a former president and first lady, the latter now a rising political
figure.</TE>
<TE>   "LAPD Blue": Oh wait, that's already been done. They call it "The
Shield."</TE>

<HD>A Double Standard for Male and Female Emotions on Film</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH HORNBLOW</AU>
<BD>HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No matter what film critics have to say about Callie Khouri's "The
Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," one thing is certain: In the
reviews and stories that characterize the movie, the tale of a group
of mothers and daughters who bond despite their differences is bound
to be labeled a "women's picture," a "melodrama" or a "weepie."</LD>
<LD>   On the other hand, male-centric films in which groups of guy
friends do what guys do and wipe their noses on their sleeves before
the end (or, more likely, have a fistfight or talk about their
fathers) are never classified as "male weepies" except by
determinedly courageous (and solitary) female film critics such as
Molly Haskell.</LD>
<LD>   The sexual revolution and the go-girl movement notwithstanding,
the tradition of marginalizing and trivializing female experience is
alive and well in popular culture.</LD>
<TE>   "Women are compromised the day they're born," moans a remorseful
Paulette Goddard in George Cukor's 1939 film "The Women," and the
observation unhappily holds true in 2002, even if some of the
circumstances have changed.</TE>
<TE>   Films including "Ya-Ya Sisterhood," "Bridget Jones's Diary,"
"Steel Magnolias," "The Joy Luck Club," "Waiting to Exhale," "Thelma
&amp; Louise," "Fried Green Tomatoes," "Enchanted April," "Nine to Five"
and TV's "The Women of Brewster Place" and "Sex and the City" have
all borne the label "chick flick," just as earlier films--from
"Mildred Pierce" and "The Group" to "Stella Dallas" and "The
Women"--were termed "women's pictures," "three-hanky melodramas."</TE>
<TE>   Inherent in the classification is the idea that issues governing
women's lives are somehow uninteresting or unimportant to male
audience members, while the converse notion is rarely entertained
(except in video stores, where couples frequently disagree over which
titles to rent). Films about war, espionage, cowboys, mobsters, gang
violence, sports teams and other favorite male-bonding motifs are
typically reviewed and written about in a context that suggests this
material constitutes general-audience entertainment. There is no
accompanying "guy movie" or "boy's stuff" label to diminish the
themes or content in the minds of female audience members.</TE>
<TE>   On the contrary, the predominantly male critical establishment
legitimizes and sanctifies the life experiences of men as they are
represented in film, never pausing to consider special--or
marginal--classification status.</TE>
<TE>   Writing about a perceived critical "bias against emotional
fulfillment" in the February pre-Oscar edition of the New York
Observer, film critic and author Haskell wrote, "I wonder, where are
these skeptics when it comes to the alpha males bonding on the
screen? If Achilles had spent as much time moaning over Patroclus as
a character in 'Lord of the Rings' spends over an expiring comrade,
it would have stopped 'The Iliad' dead in its tracks. The
rehabilitation of the warrior culture has given grown men license to
cry over prolonged deathbed embraces in 'Lord of the Rings' and
'Black Hawk Down.' In the latter, soldiers (non-star grunts) run
after each other begging, 'Let me die instead of you.' And now
Nicolas Cage, Bruce Willis and Mel Gibson are the respective stars of
three ... war movies, in which there will surely be, along with
shoot'em-up gut-spilling gore, some hard-wrung male tears.</TE>
<TE>   "Male weepies are as chock-full of emoting as any male-female
romance, but the latter is conveniently relegated to a genre ghetto,
the Chick Flick, while war films ... are presumably ennobled by their
grim view of life as annihilation and despair."</TE>
<TE>   They are also ennobled by the notion that male tears have an
intrinsically greater value than women's, being tied to issues
understood to be of larger importance to society at large. Men cry in
battle; they cry at funerals for fallen comrades; they cry over
ideals of liberty, justice and honor. Except in rare instances,
female characters cry over a ruined dinner, the end of a
relationship, conflicts with family members, and only rarely, over
social or political malfeasance or the effects of war. Women's tears
rarely save the world; they just keep it running.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that some films about women such as the recent "Crush"
and "Waiting to Exhale" argue for marginal status because they are
flawed pictures, but a handful of others have been unfairly relegated
to secondary status simply by nature of the gender whose struggles
they dramatize.</TE>
<TE>   On the CineScene Web site, Chris Dashiell writes, "I have to admit
that I have a hard time opening myself up to the pleasures of a
'weepie'--the way the women in these stories suffer, suffer, and then
suffer some more, seems almost like a form of sadism."</TE>
<TE>   And what of "Black Hawk Down"?</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. Confidential"?</TE>
<TE>   "Gladiator"?</TE>
<TE>   "The Patriot"?</TE>
<TE>   Stories That Mirror</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers' Lives</TE>
<TE>   How is the suffering of male characters in these films any more
compelling or legitimate than what women go through in "Thelma &amp;
Louise" or "The Women of Brewster Place"?</TE>
<TE>   The fact that filmmaking remains a male-dominated profession is a
primary reason. Men--filmmakers and critics alike--naturally prefer
stories that come closest to mirroring their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Hurt men abound too, but their far-more-reluctant displays of
emotion are seen as powerful and strong, while women's are dismissed
as "emotional," "hormonal" or "sentimental."</TE>
<TE>   The typical male discomfort and fear of women who "go emo"
continue to color opinions of cultural products.</TE>
<TE>   Films like the recent Michael Apted-Jennifer Lopez collaboration
"Enough" and last year's "Tomb Raider" contrive circumstances in
which women fight back by ridiculous and unbelievably elaborate
means.</TE>
<TE>   But part of every "weepie" is about women fighting back sans brass
knuckles or martial arts. "The Women of Brewster Place" and "Steel
Magnolias," the women of "The Joy Luck Club" and "Enchanted April"
fight back by carrying on, leaning on their friends and defining
their lives by their own principles, just as men do.</TE>
<TE>   If women are most often depicted carrying on in beauty parlors and
kitchens and men are in battlefields and boardrooms, the substance of
the scenes is essentially the same: Male-bonding films boil down to
ideas about how difficult it is to be a man, how hard it is to be a
son. Female-bonding films turn on the trials of being a woman, the
problems of being some mother's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   It is only the continued dominance of the male point of view in
our popular culture that gives these stories an unequal weight.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"The Fast Runner (Atanarjuat)" is the cinematic equivalent of
adventure travel. Nearly three hours long and deliberately paced at
that, this first feature ever in the Inuit language is a demanding
experience. But the rewards for those who risk the journey are simply
extraordinary.</LD>
<LD>   "The Fast Runner" does more than use a previously unheard
language, does more than cast a spell with its mind-expanding
panoramas. The film deposits you deep within the compelling,
unfamiliar culture of the native people of the Arctic North. And it
tells a story of elemental passions, a mythic tale of courage and
mendacity, of undying love and corrosive lust that can't help but
hold our interest.</LD>
<LD>   The society of the Inuit (the word means "a man, preeminently")
has fascinated those in more hospitable climes at least since Robert
Flaherty's 1922 "Nanook of the North" and "Kabloona," Gontran de
Poncins' marvelous 1941 memoir of what was then called Eskimo life.
But it's never before been presented from the inside and in so
persuasive a way that the film won the Camera d'Or for best first
feature at Cannes and six Genies, the Canadian Oscar, including best
picture and best director.</LD>
<TE>   Although this is the first feature for director Zacharias Kunuk,
he has since 1990 had his own television and video production
company, based in the 1,200-person hamlet of Igloolik in Canada's
Nunavut Territory, where this film was shot. And the venerable nature
of "The Fast Runner's" story, an oral narrative forever in the heads
and on the lips of his people, has given the production a confidence
and assurance unusual for a first-timer from a culture without a
filmmaking tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Apak Angilirq, "The Fast Runner's" screenwriter, had eight
elders tell him their versions of this ancient Inuit story, set in an
indefinite past when Europeans were not even a rumor, when spirits
could take physical form and when men who were to become myths were
still merely human.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fast Runner's" story of the pervasiveness of evil and the
power of taboos begins when a malignant shaman visits a small Inuit
clan and infects it with dissension and death, including the murder
of the clan chief. "It just happened," someone explains, baffled,
powerless, "and we had to live with it."</TE>
<TE>   Because at first glance the film's characters dress alike and
resemble one another, and because the beginning of the story unfolds
in a deliberately fractured way, the opening sections of "The Fast
Runner" are as confusing as things would be if we personally found
ourselves in that foreign a situation. And Kunuk's unhurried pacing,
his decision to duplicate the temporal rhythms of Inuit culture, make
a willingness to give yourself over to the experience on its own
terms essential.</TE>
<TE>   But just as travelers acclimate to strange surroundings, less than
an hour into the film everything comes into focus, and the story,
which now remains in a single period with well-defined characters,
gets increasingly involving.</TE>
<TE>   At its heart, this is about two brothers with great powers.
Amaqjuaa (Pakak Innukshuk) is the older and stronger, but Atanarjuat
(Natar Ungalaaq), the title character, is the fleeter of foot. He and
Atuat (Sylvia Ivalu) fall in love, but she is promised in marriage to
the sullen Oki (Peter-Henry Arnatsiaq), son of the clan's evil
leader. Complicating things even more is that Oki's sister, the fey
Puja (Lucy Tulugarjuk), has eyes only for the fast runner. Norman
Cohn, the film's cinematographer, said, "The film is about love,
jealousy, murder and revenge. What else is there?"</TE>
<TE>   Actually, there is a good deal more, starting with Cohn's
compelling cinematography. Though "The Fast Runner" was shot on
wide-screen digital video (then transferred to 35 millimeter), the
images are nevertheless truly breathtaking--pictures that also tell
the indelible story of what it feels like to be frail humans in an
immense natural world. And the film's signature sequence, Atanarjuat
running naked across the snow with his life in jeopardy, is simply a
knockout.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fast Runner" has paid equal attention to painstakingly
constructing the physical world its people live in, creating a living
record of a culture that's threatened with extinction. Not just tools
and clothes, but also songs and dances, bawdy customs and deadly
serious rituals--ways of being in the world--are vividly reproduced.</TE>
<TE>   Because the story, performers and landscape are so unfamiliar,
everything combines in "The Fast Runner" to create a film that does
not feel acted and rather as if it is simply happening in front of
our eyes. This is so much the case that, when the closing credits are
run next to documentary shots of the film's crew at work, it comes as
a shock to see how the artifice was put together.</TE>
<TE>   At the film's beginning, one of the tellers of this tale says, "I
can only sing this song to someone who understands it." What's
special about "The Fast Runner" is that by its epic close, the select
group includes us.</TE>
<TE>   No MPAA rating. Times guidelines: one scene of lovemaking and
several of violence.</TE>

"Mutant Aliens" wastes little time in revealing that its depiction of
sex is going to stop just this side of hard-core. It's an unexpected
element and presented with Rabelaisian glee. To be sure, those
14-old-boys who manage to see the film will respond appropriately.</LD>
<LD>   Earl Jensen is a big, rangy astronaut about to be launched into
space with much fanfare by Dr. Frubar, a greedy, ambitious rocket
ship designer who has a severe blond flattop haircut. Apparently a
single parent, Earl bids a tender farewell to his 5-year-old daughter
Josie.</LD>
<LD>   No sooner has Earl's spaceship been launched than Dr. Frubar
presses a button emptying Earl's fuel supply--part of Frubar's plot
to get people to send him money to make space travel safer. In the
meantime, the shameless Frubar blames little Josie for having
unknowingly flipped that fuel supply switch.</LD>
<TE>   The look of "Mutant Aliens" is light and airy with the tone of
watercolors and a free and easy style of minimal sketching. The
buoyant feel of Plympton's graphics reflects the freewheeling spirit
of his story, which Plympton adapted from his graphic--perhaps in
more than one sense of the word--novel.</TE>
<TE>   Earl finds himself in a series of adventures on an alien planet.
He's greeted by creatures shaped like noses; their queen falls into
instantaneous lust with him, but he's kidnapped by creatures who are
fingers with single eyes, who will put him to heroic tests, like a
Roman gladiator.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, Josie, now working at an observatory (where
she's distracted by her dim but studly boyfriend Darby), discovers
that her father is miraculously on his way back to Earth. Dr. Frubar
wants him shot down as a meteorite, but his orders are foiled, so he
has no recourse but to give him a hero's welcome.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, the conflict between the now bearded and shaggy
Earl and Dr. Frubar begins in earnest and involves a specific group
of aliens, whom Plympton has given the form of such adorable,
outsized creatures as a caterpillar, frog, fish, pig, etc.</TE>
<TE>   By the time "Mutant Aliens" has completed its lively journey,
Plympton has punctured the traditional notion of aliens posing a
danger to humans--it's more the other way around--and taken some
potshots at big business and the excesses of advertising.</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: The film's sex sequences rule out it
for youngsters.</TE>

<HD>AFI Salutes a Humble Tom Hanks With Life Achievement Award</HD>
<DH>Movies* The popular Oscar winner says, 'I have been blessed
beyond the definition of good fortune.' *</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a ceremony that was warm, funny, patriotic and sometimes even
raucous, Tom Hanks received the American Film Institute's 30th annual
Life Achievement Award on Wednesday evening at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time Oscar winner joins the ranks of such Hollywood
luminaries as John Ford, James Cagney, Orson Welles, Barbra
Streisand, Sidney Poitier, Steven Spielberg, Gregory Peck, Jack
Lemmon and Billy Wilder who have previously received the AFI honor
over the past three decades.</LD>
<LD>   Hanks, a month shy of his 46th birthday, is the youngest recipient
of the Life Achievement Award--a fact that caused Steve Martin to
quip that Hanks was actually receiving the "The AFI Mid-Life
Achievement Award."</LD>
<TE>   "You folks are so swell," said a visibly moved Hanks to the crowd
of 1,000 upon receiving the award from his good friend Spielberg, who
directed him in the 1998 hit "Saving Private Ryan." "I have been
blessed beyond the definition of good fortune for a very long, long
while."</TE>
<TE>   The evening was full of firsts. It was the first time that the AFI
event was held at the Kodak Theatre--for the past 29 years the event
took place at the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton Hotel. And for the
first time fans--most notably members of the armed services--were
invited to sit in the balcony.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the event, Hanks said in an interview he had to
make his peace with receiving the accolade. "That took quite some
time," he acknowledged. "It's overwhelming when the phone call comes
in. You try to make some sense out of it, which is a fruitless
undertaking for a while. Then you give yourself up to the idea that
this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I will take it in the spirit in
which it is offered and just try to survive the white-hot attention.
It goes beyond calling it an honor. It's some other kind of thing."</TE>
<TE>   What he likes about the evening is that "as mainstream and
glamorous as it is, it is still a bit off the radar. It is
essentially for moviephiles."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his success, Hanks admitted that he still couldn't believe
his good fortune. "It is a combination of being both giddy and
incredulous at the same time," he said. "I must say like any actor, I
started out just hoping I would be able to work at some level beyond
the one I was already at. When I was first able to make the huge
break into television with 'Bosom Buddies,' that is beating
staggering odds just to get the job."</TE>
<TE>   Hanks says the feelings he had at his career's start have never
gone away. "Ron Howard and I were in the KC-135 aircraft over the
Gulf of Mexico shooting the zero-gravity shots in 'Apollo 13' and we
were just looking at each other and said, 'Can you believe we get to
do this? How did we get here?' "</TE>
<TE>   Whereas many of the AFI evenings have been reverential, this
ceremony was accessible, friendly and intimate, reflecting Hanks'
"Everyman" quality that was stressed by various speakers throughout
the night.</TE>
<TE>   "We love you, Tom," screamed a fan from the rafters as Hanks waved
to the audience. During the dinner, Hanks visited with friends and
colleagues handing out invites to the after-party. Hanks' wife,
actress Rita Wilson, was snapping pictures of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   And just before the ceremony started, the big screen on stage
flashed the last minute of the Lakers-Nets playoff game. The audience
started cheering at the Laker victory and Hanks gave the team a
standing salute. In between tributes from such actors as Peter
Scolari, who appeared with Hanks in the ABC series "Bosom Buddies,"
Meg Ryan, Elizabeth Perkins and Jon Lovitz, there were numerous
excerpts from a recent interview with Hanks as well as clips from
"Splash," "Big," "Punchline," "A League of Their Own,"
"Philadelphia," "Forrest Gump," "Sleepless in Seattle," "Apollo 13,"
"The Green Mile," "Cast Away" and "Saving Private Ryan." The AFI even
dug up a clip from his first film, the 1980 horror flick "He Knows
You're Alone."</TE>
<TE>   Among those singing Hanks' praises was Rawley Farnsworth, Hanks'
drama teacher at Skyline High School in Oakland, whom the actor had
singled out when he received his first best actor Oscar for
"Philadelphia." "He was one of the greatest kids," said Farnsworth,
who added that even as a teen Hanks "had enormous stage presence."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Sinise, who has worked with Hanks on three projects including
"Forrest Gump," said he quickly realized on the set he was "working
with an actor as gifted as they come." With "Forrest Gump," for which
Hanks won his second Oscar, the actor was "just beginning to show the
world what he was capable of. You found out your destiny was to share
your talent with the world."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hanks and Spielberg executive-produced the 10-hour HBO
miniseries "Band of Brothers," based on Stephen E. Ambrose's book
about a battalion of young soldiers fighting in Europe during World
War II. One of the evening's more emotional moments occurred when two
veterans from the real "Band of Brothers" walked out and saluted
Hanks, who, in turn, stood and saluted them back.</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of the two-hour ceremony, Hanks told the
audience about an area on the moon called the Lake of Dreams. "To
have you all here tonight and to be placed up with the other
honorees. I walked on the moon and experienced the Lake of Dreams....
God bless America!"</TE>
<TE>   The Hanks tribute will be telecast June 24 on the USA Network.</TE>

<HD>Hendler Paintings Mesmerize With Intense Hues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maxwell Hendler is the king of color. His monochrome paintings are
not correctly described as abstract, because their solid fields of
intense hue are not disassociated from the specific instance of the
unique color that is embodied. They refer to nothing but themselves.
The paintings might be more correctly described as realist, although
they're also devoid of the illusions of the visible world that tend
to cling to that term.</LD>
<LD>   Confused? Good. That's a sign of just how visually complex and
intellectually challenging Hendler's seemingly simple paintings are.
The gorgeous colors quickly seduce, but the painterly conundrums
promise lengthy relationships. At Patricia Faure Gallery, 14 recent
panels make up a mesmerizing exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   Hendler suspends pigment in a resin medium, which he applies in
layers to a Masonite panel. The resin gets sanded and buffed to a
high sheen. Each dazzling panel is saturated with its specific
colored light.</LD>
<TE>   All of the works are horizontal, which erases any associations
between the art and the human figure. (The only person present is
you--the active perceiver.) The smallest work here is "Siam," a white
panel just over 10 by 13 inches; the largest is "Fata Morgana," a
transparent gray-brown panel 4 feet high and nearly 6 feet wide.</TE>
<TE>   In between "Siam" and "Fata Morgana" is an array of panels in a
variety of sizes and jewel-like colors, for which names most often do
not exist. "Film Bleu" is a limpid Prussian blue, though deeper and
more intense. Raspberry ice, electric tangerine, toxic lime--by
making up a name, your mind struggles to wrap itself around the color
that floods your eye. (An anomalous work is navy blue--but it's
uniqueness is redeemed by being perhaps the only navy-blue monochrome
painting ever made.)</TE>
<TE>   Monochrome painting comes with lots of theoretical baggage. Much
of it is visionary or spiritually inclined, thanks to the mysterious,
oriental, feminine and pathological associations historically applied
to color. Despite the wry acknowledgment of that history made by
titles like "Siam" and "Fata Morgana," Hendler's monochromes banish
all that. His paintings are secular in the extreme.</TE>
<TE>   The almost severe intensity of these panels also eradicates the
other common assertion about monochromes--namely, that color is
superficial, cosmetic and inessential. Embodying color so forcefully
and fully, Hendler voids that claim.</TE>
<TE>   What's left is sensuality, where the surface of the painting
becomes the meeting ground for anxiety and pleasure. Hendler's art
recalls the 1960s, the last time an enthusiasm for color in art ran
high. But he restores the rectangle of easel painting to the mix,
which art in the 1960s necessarily abandoned. Easel painting couldn't
escape associations with representational art before the rupture of
the 1960s, but it can now. The realism of Hendler's monochromes is
not representational.</TE>
<TE>   When I was looking at the show, a couple stuck their heads in the
door, glanced around, murmured, "No pictures here," and left. They
were dead right in their instant observation. They also made a big
mistake in leaving so fast.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Faure Gallery, Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave.,
Santa Monica, (310) 449-1479, through June 22. Closed Sunday and
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Wit, Insight Characterize</TE>
<TE>   Sculptural Ensemble</TE>
<TE>   Like Atlas condemned to hold the sky upon his shoulders for all
eternity, the concrete-gray sculpture of a black man in "Soul Power"
kneels on one leg, the better to support the massive architectural
vault that looms above him. Pentti Monkkonen, in his second solo show
at Acme, has produced an astounding sculptural ensemble of pathos,
insight and wit.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven feet tall, "Soul Power" is classically divided into three
sections. At the bottom is a Baroque pedestal, its ornate cartouches
inscribed with the sculpture's title, the artist's name and the date.
In the middle is the kneeling man, dressed only in baggy shorts (his
boxers peek through at the back) and with dreadlocks hanging in front
of his lowered face</TE>
<TE>   Above this human "column"--and steadied by the figure's upraised
arms--is the lavishly decorated architectural fragment. The base of a
vault, its blossoming shape recalls a vase or urn. The sculpture was
cast in pieces from a durable material that includes plastic and
aluminum, strengthened by a steel armature, and it's meant for an
outdoor garden. The big urn, which would fill with rainwater, drains
through the kneeling figure's eyes. In a shower, "Soul Power" becomes
a weeping fountain.</TE>
<TE>   Monkkonen has adorned the shelf around the vault's base with
assorted attributes. Some, like the mace and heraldic standard, are
traditional symbols of valor and might. Others, like the bong and
skateboard, are more playful.</TE>
<TE>   They're more contemporary too. An old European culture built on
the suffering back of slave labor is sharply evoked, while the
present reality is more equivocal--a historical burden merged with
individual power and grace. Monkkonen wryly bills himself as "the
hardest-working man in the art business." Tongue out of cheek, his
monumental sculpture is a nuanced tour de force.</TE>
<TE>   Acme, 6150 Wilshire Blvd., L.A., (323) 857-5864, through July 6.
Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   An Artist Harmonizing</TE>
<TE>   Conflicting Forces</TE>
<TE>   Laszlo Moholy-Nagy is the most famous Hungarian artist of the 20th
century, and with good reason: His inventiveness in abstract film,
photography, graphic design and constructed sculpture was matched by
his broad influence as a Bauhaus master. However, as eloquently
demonstrated by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's recent show
about the Central European avant-garde, Moholy-Nagy wasn't the only
notable Hungarian artist.</TE>
<TE>   Janos Mattis Teutsch (1884-1960), who was included in the LACMA
show, is now the centerpiece of an ambitious, engaging exhibition at
Louis Stern Fine Arts, which comes with an impressive catalog. In 41
works dated 1910 to 1925, Mattis Teutsch emerges as a gifted colorist
who conceived of art as an energetic platform on which to harmonize
conflicting forces.</TE>
<TE>   "Composition VI" (1924), the show's most commanding painting,
marshals short, blunt strokes of chrome yellow, crimson, thalo green
and orange to create a dynamic arrangement that merges organic and
machine shapes. Lovely smaller paintings on board likewise evince an
acute color sense, which probably derives from folk traditions.</TE>
<TE>   Mattis Teutsch first trained as a sculptor. But the small,
figurative examples in carved wood here, which retain an older Art
Nouveau elegance, are among his weaker works.</TE>
<TE>   The show also offers some helpful context, with 33 works on paper
by 13 additional artists. Most notable are aerial photographs of
rustic subjects (including cracked earth and rope) by Judit Karasz, a
Cubist charcoal still life by Lajos Vajda and Cubo-Futurist scenes of
peasant life by Bela Kadar.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, an ethereal drawing with collage by Moholy-Nagy
masterfully exploits the sheet of paper as an abstract field. Forms
seem to shift between positive and negative, right before your eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Louis Stern Fine Arts, 9002 Melrose Ave., West Hollywood, (310)
276-0147, through July 20. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Setting Reinforces Theme</TE>
<TE>   of Urban Anomie</TE>
<TE>   As with his engaging Project Gallery installation last summer at
the UCLA Hammer Museum, San Francisco-based artist Chris Johanson has
used the main room at Roberts &amp; Tilton Gallery as a place to create
an environment in which to hang paintings. Their subjects tend toward
urban anomie, which is reinforced by the fabricated environment.</TE>
<TE>   Here the room's a maze, built from high walls made from corrugated
paper painted to resemble concrete blocks. If you feel a bit like a
rat maneuvering in a modern version of a medieval enclave, you also
see people in Johanson's brightly colored, folk-style paintings on
board who seem numb, anxious or disoriented. Occasionally he throws
in an abstract picture that suggests a flower drawn with a
spirograph--or perhaps it's a stylized explosion, or a dreadful
maelstrom.</TE>
<TE>   A man on his knees being pelted with water balloons; rows of heads
in profile, each tagged with a psychological diagnosis; a group of
people beneath a gigantic thought-balloon that morphs into a thunder
cloud--life in the Big City is harsh. Nowhere does Johanson capture
the experience better (or more succinctly) than in a small painting
on paper in the very center of the maze; showing a black blob with
human feet, it's labeled "horrible vortex."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts &amp; Tilton Gallery, 6150 Wilshire Blvd., (323) 549-0223,
through July 6. Closed Sunday and Monday.</TE>

<HD>Pete Yorn's Proving That New Jersey's Loss Is L.A.'s Gain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers aren't the only ones whose recent winning streak sent
Southland fans into spasms of joy Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   Rocker Pete Yorn may hail from the land of the New Jersey Nets,
but since he turned L.A. denizen in the mid-'90s, his adopted city
has treated him as one of its own. The reception he got from a packed
house at the Galaxy Theatre in Santa Ana on Wednesday probably was
just a hint of things to come tonight when he headlines the Wiltern
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The nerve he's touched with the alternately yearning, aching and
comforting songs from his hit debut album, "musicforthemorning-
after," also indicates that the market for heartfelt empathy in pop
will never bottom out.</LD>
<TE>   There were moments in the show when his twentysomething fans
looked on in adoration, the way their parents do when they go to hear
James Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   That's due at least in part to the way Yorn, like Taylor, never
gives the impression he's faking it.</TE>
<TE>   At times his songs simply mirror rather than transcend influences
as varied as Bruce Springsteen, R.E.M., Lou Reed, the Cars and Pearl
Jam. But his best numbers, exemplified by his breakthrough hit with
the monster groove "Life on a Chain," display a life of their own.</TE>
<TE>   At 27, Yorn's got more miles on him than all the teen acts to
which he represents a more literate and thought-inducing alternative,
yet with just the one album behind him, he's still finding his
identity.</TE>
<TE>   In the 15 heady months since the album was released, Yorn has been
called everything from a "mop-headed rocker" and "one of music's
best-kept secrets" to "a Jersey Eddie Vedder" and "a gloomier Bruce
Springsteen."</TE>
<TE>   As far as he's concerned, it's all good.</TE>
<TE>   "When you put yourself in play, you've got to be prepared to be in
play," he said this week as he neared the home stretch of a national
tour that hasn't let up since the album came out. "I prepared myself
to expect anything, so nothing I hear really shocks me too much."</TE>
<TE>   The success of "Music," which has sold nearly half a million
copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, has put his name in the mix
with latter-day singer-songwriters such as Ryan Adams, John Mayer and
Rufus Wainwright.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't bother me," he says. "I think the best
singer-songwriters over the years have had their own voice, their own
sound, their own style. I just think it's kind of lame just because
someone goes out under their own name that someone will lump 10 of
them together, even though musically they might be completely
different. But it's not like I'm losing any sleep over it."</TE>
<TE>   Yorn's had enough other reasons to lose sleep, like one tour,
festival or special event after the next as more and more pop fans
have discovered him.</TE>
<TE>   He's gone from playing coffeehouses around L.A. to headlining the
Wiltern as the wrap-up for the U.S. tour. Only after a couple more
weeks in Great Britain playing the sprawling Meltdown and Glastonbury
festivals and other shows will Yorn get his own morning after, and
some time to reflect on his rapid rise.</TE>
<TE>   Time has been a particularly rare commodity for him. Take his
enthusiastically received appearance in April at the Coachella
Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been up in Edmonton, and I had to fly down from there [and]
go play the show. I had maybe an hour to hang out, then I had to fly
right back to western Washington. I missed all the bands I had wanted
to see. I was so bummed."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such disappointments, Yorn couldn't sound more upbeat and
centered. Part of that owes to the solid emotional foundation he got
early on in Montville, N.J., (population: 20,000) from his father, a
dentist; his mother, who was a piano prodigy as a child; and his two
older brothers, Hollywood talent agent Rick Yorn (once the drummer in
Pete's band), and entertainment attorney Kevin Yorn.</TE>
<TE>   "For years my parents were like, 'Get a job! It's not going to
happen!' but my brothers would just say, 'Mom, Dad--chill out,' "
Yorn says. "They believed in me so much. They're really happy for me
now, but they also help me keep myself in check."</TE>
<TE>   Come July he expects to hunker down in the studio recording his
follow-up to "Music." He won't guess at what sound or shape that
album will take, but will say he's pretty certain he'll once again
play most of the instruments himself, even though he's reveled in
performing in a five-man rock band on tour.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, being in the studio and playing a lot of the stuff myself
is one of the most fulfilling things I do," he says. "It's really fun
for me, and I'm not about to deny that. I have parts in my head for
some of the guys in the band that I know they'll be great at.... But
at the core, I'll probably lay most of it down myself, because I'm
able to capture it the way that I want it.</TE>
<TE>   "Making the last record, I never stressed out," he says. "I hear
about people getting into the studio and getting all stressed, but I
had the best time. It was so pure, it was a really happy time for me.
So I'm looking forward to getting back to that place."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Yorn, with Jukebox Junkies and Minibar, plays tonight at the
Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd., L.A., 8 p.m. $23. (213)
380-5005.</TE>

<HD>Television's Overlooked Inventor Gets His Due at Last</HD>
<DH>Books * Tomes examine Philo T. Farnsworth's futile attempt
to get the credit that went to RCA.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRAZIER MOORE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Philo T. Farnsworth is hiding in plain sight wherever you look. He is
unseen yet impossible to miss.</LD>
<LD>   Unknowingly, the average American home affirms Farnsworth eight
hours each day. When he died--March 11, 1971--millions paid their
heedless respect by watching "Ironside," "Bewitched" and "The Jim
Nabors Hour."</LD>
<LD>   Philo Farnsworth, you see, invented television.</LD>
<TE>   And in this 75th anniversary year of TV's first successful
demonstration (on Sept. 7, 1927, he transmitted the image of a
horizontal line across the room in his San Francisco lab), the secret
is starting to get out.</TE>
<TE>   Some may yet dispute Farnsworth's status as the father of
television, but any lingering doubts reside in the misconception that
the Radio Corp. of America was TV's creator. This is a version of
history RCA was promulgating even as its boss, David Sarnoff, was
trying to crush the former Idaho farm boy who stood in his way.</TE>
<TE>   It's quite a tale, vividly told in a pair of new books: "The Boy
Genius and the Mogul" by Daniel Stashower and "The Last Lone
Inventor: A Tale of Genius, Deceit and the Birth of Television" by
Evan I. Schwartz, who, in an interview, concedes that until a few
years ago, he, like nearly everyone else, was unaware of Farnsworth.</TE>
<TE>   "I had heard the name. You can't forget the name," Schwartz says.
"But then I had these questions: Who was this guy? How could you
invent the defining technology of the century and remain virtually
anonymous? That's quite a trick."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz, a Boston-based journalist with a futuristic bent whose
books include "Digital Darwinism" and "Webonomics," couldn't get
Farnsworth out of his mind. And as he learned more about Farnsworth's
defiant quest, he rediscovered a truism: The wisdom for tomorrow can
be found in lessons from the past.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz knew what he had to do. In December 1999, he caught a
plane to Indiana to meet with Farnsworth's widow, Pem, then 91.
Schwartz's book was underway. With the same relentlessness he
displayed in life, "Farnsworth just wouldn't let go of me."</TE>
<TE>   One story will suffice to explain the inventor's hold on Schwartz
and fellow Philo-philes.</TE>
<TE>   Plowing his father's potato field in 1921, the 14-year-old lad,
already dead set on inventing TV, was lost in concentration as he
pondered the next piece of the puzzle. Suddenly he saw his answer in
the parallel furrows he was carving: A TV image likewise could be
electronically scanned, row by row, onto a picture tube.</TE>
<TE>   True to the brainstorm of a prodigy at his plow, TV in the present
day still works the way Farnsworth imagined it that morning.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, even in the 1920s, other theories for creating
"telegraph pictures" were afoot.</TE>
<TE>   The chief rival was "mechanical television," which proposed a
rotating disk punched with holes to codify an image in motion. But
despite the best efforts of research engineers at General Electric
and AT&amp;T, that led nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Farnsworth would go head to head with RCA's chief
television engineer, Vladimir Zworykin, and the vast resources of a
company whose boss had no intention of losing either a financial
windfall or eternal bragging rights as the father of TV.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, Sarnoff waged a war not just of engineering
one-upmanship, but also of dirty tricks, propaganda and endless
litigation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, the courts ruled that Farnsworth, not Zworykin, was the
inventor of electronic television.</TE>
<TE>   But thanks to Sarnoff, money woes and the lost years of World War
II (which put TV broadcasting on hold), the clock ran out on
Farnsworth's patents before he could profit from them.</TE>

<LD>   Aussies Upset with Hollywood Portrayal</LD>
<LD>   Miramax is at it again, this time incurring the wrath of
Australia's governing officials who say Philip Noyce's "Rabbit Proof
Fence" portrays their country in an unfair light. Based on a book of
the same name, the movie focuses on a period when aboriginal girls
were forcibly taken from their homes by a government-sponsored
program and then taught to be domestic servants. The film, which
stars Kenneth Branagh, opened to modest reviews in Australia 12 weeks
ago. But government officials became outraged with the American
marketing campaign: "What if the government kidnapped your daughter?
It happened every week in Australia from 1905 to 1971."</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Australia's Special Minister of State Eric Abetz
denounced Noyce and the film, declaring that he would publish
brochures about its inaccuracies. Government officials demanded that
Miramax apologize for the one-sheet poster--a proposal rejected by
Mark Gill, president of Miramax L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Gill predicted that controversy will only help market the movie,
which will be released in late fall or early next year in the U.S.
"This is not Tom Cruise in 'Minority Report,' where everyone is
rushing out to see it," he said. "Films like this wilt on the
vine.... In this world of multimedia conglomerates and
mega-blockbusters, the only chance for art films to get seen is if
there is publicity and noise around them."</TE>

<TE>   Rolling Stone's New</TE>
<TE>   Man at the Top</TE>
<TE>   Ending weeks of speculation, Rolling Stone founder-owner Jann
Wenner has chosen a new editor: Ed Needham, who has edited both the
British and American versions of FHM, a men's magazine featuring
women in bikinis on its covers.</TE>
<TE>   Needham, 37, says the new job is a "massive kind of adrenaline
buzz," one of the "great jobs in magazine journalism." Among his
pledges: increased fashion coverage, "shorter and snappier articles,"
and attention-grabbing design elements.</TE>
<TE>   Wenner said in April that he planned to replace the current
editor, Robert Love, to give the magazine a more youthful edge to
bolster lagging newsstand sales. Love had served for five years as
managing editor and 20 overall with the publication.</TE>
<TE>   Old-Timers Head List of Money-Making Bands</TE>
<TE>   The top-grossing artists in the music industry last year? The
Irish band U2, which took in $61.9 million, according to the issue of
Rolling Stone due out today.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top five were Dr. Dre ($51.9 million), the
Beatles ($47.9 million), the Dave Matthews Band ($43.4 million) and
Madonna ($40.8 million).</TE>

<TE>   Lakers Victorious--but Soft in the Ratings</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' trouncing of the New Jersey Nets translated into the
lowest-rated NBA Finals since 1981, when the games were not televised
in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's telecast of the series drew an average 15.7 million viewers,
with the Lakers' series-clinching Game 4 attracting 16.5 million
viewers, according to estimates from Nielsen Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   The poor showing allowed an unscripted Fox summer series,
"American Idol: The Search for a Superstar," to take a bite out of
basketball's traditionally male-skewing audience. "Idol" drew 11.2
million viewers airing against the Laker game in much of the country.
"Idol" improved on its audience from the premiere the night before.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, viewership of this year's NBA Finals was down 17% from
the first four games of last year's series. Next year, the finals
will move to ABC, which in January signed a six-year deal to televise
the NBA.</TE>

<TE>   PEOPLE</TE>
<TE>   Annan Heads West to Recruit Celebrities</TE>
<TE>   Lending glamour to the United Nations, Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and U.N. agencies are organizing a two-day meeting next week
with some 40 Hollywood stars, athletes and other celebrities who have
become advocates for the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Those expected to attend the Tuesday-Wednesday forum include Peter
Ustinov, Roger Moore, Vanessa Redgrave, Greek singer Nana Mouskouri,
Linda Gray, Danny Glover and former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are to find fresh voices and a new language to reach a
larger audience, they can do what we in some ways cannot," said
Gillian Sorensen, the U.N. official for external affairs. Fending off
criticism that celebrities have no place in politics, she added,
"These are serious people. They are serious about deepening their own
expertise in the United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Enlisting the help of celebrities is nothing new for the
organization. UNICEF has recruited stars such as Danny Kaye and
Audrey Hepburn to serve as goodwill ambassadors since 1953.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Charlton Heston will reprise his signature role in "Ben-Hur" in an
animated remake, lending his voice to a feature-length video to be
released by GoodTimes Home Entertainment in the fall....Bypassing a
theatrical release, Miramax Films will hold the U.S. premiere of
"Daddy and Them"--a tale about the impact of a murder on a poor
Arkansas family, written and directed by Billy Bob Thornton--on
Showtime. Thornton also stars, along with Laura Dern, Dianne Ladd,
Andy Griffith and Brenda Blethyn.... Many local TV stations are
planning live coverage of the Lakers' victory parade through downtown
L.A. this morning, with KABC-TV and KCAL-TV starting at 10 a.m. and
others joining in as the NBA champions make their way toward Staples
Center.... President Bush has nominated National Gallery of Art
director Earl A. Powell III to serve on the National Council on the
Arts, the advisory board to the National Endowment for the Arts.
Powell is former director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.</TE>

<HD>'Next Big Thing' Strains to Spoof Art Scene</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing big about "The Next Big Thing," a feeble and tedious
satire on the New York art scene. Director PJ Posner and co-writer
Joel Posner mean to skewer the role mystique plays in establishing an
artist's reputation, not a bad target, but their film is all strained
artifice, inhabited by individuals who either lack dimension or are
merely stereotypes. The result is a movie not nearly as amusing as
its makers may think.</LD>
<LD>   Gus Bishop (Chris Eigeman) is a struggling abstract painter who
just can't get anyone to take notice of his work. Con man-thief Deech
Scumble (Jamie Harris) lifts Bishop's wallet but ends up his artistic
advisor. The problem, declares Deech, is that Gus is a white
middle-class guy from New Brunswick, N.J., and therefore he is
boring.</LD>
<LD>   Deech renames Gus Geoff Buonardi and gives him a heart-rending
history of hardship and suffering that includes exposure to Agent
Orange in Vietnam.</LD>
<TE>   Under his new alias, Gus is swiftly on his way, churning out more
paintings in seclusion while Deech, as his representative, has a high
time working the art-world social circuit. Gus is none too happy with
this setup, and falling in love with pretty and influential art
critic Kate Crowley (Connie Britton), who of course does not know Gus
is actually Geoff, adds to his misery.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the ruse is easily uncovered by a private eye
(Walter Snitzken) hired by a rich art collector (Janet Zarish) to
locate the mysterious Buonardi. She's a woman not satisfied to get
hold of paintings by a hot new artist--she has to devour the guy
sexually as well.</TE>
<TE>   The Posners have not developed any of these characters to the
extent that they become distinctive, involving individuals, and the
overly generous screen time allotted to Zarish's tiresomely shrill
and aggressive art collector swiftly becomes a serious detriment to
the film. The film's one bright spot is provided by Farley Granger as
an urbane gallery owner. Now silver-haired and bearded, Granger
remains as lean and debonair as he was as the star of Alfred
Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train" half a century ago. "The Next Big
Thing" is, however, a bust.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and some sexuality, nudity. Times
guidelines: The sex scenes, while not graphic, are suggestive; also
some strong language.</TE>

<HD>It Was Just a Slight Detour</HD>
<DH>Pop Music* Guitarist David Bromberg dropped from sight
after years in demand. He's still a string man, but now he's selling
violins besides touring.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL OLLOVE</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL>WILMINGTON, Del.</DL>
<LD>Having not laid eyes on David Bromberg in more than 25 years--and
even then it was from the cheap seats and through a haze of cigarette
and marijuana smoke--I didn't have much to go on. As I looked around
the quiet coffee shop, what I had in mind were the words from one of
the songs he sang, "I know I ain't good-looking, but I swear I'm some
sweet woman's angel child." Like I said, not much to go on.</LD>
<LD>   He was skinny, gawky and 30-ish back then, with rimless glasses,
thick, curly hair, and a sparse beard and wispy mustache that you'd
only excuse on a 14-year-old. But if his appearance suggested
tentativeness or naivete, nothing in his music or his performances
confirmed the impression.</LD>
<LD>   Always around Bromberg was the air of the troublemaker. Not in the
sense of violence or malevolence, but trouble in its most appealing
version. His musical persona was brazen, sassy and comically
subversive. As we emerged from Vietnam and Watergate, Bromberg
offered the sort of sly rebelliousness that hewed closely to the
self-image many of us flattered ourselves with.</LD>
<TE>   What may have failed to register, except in the most visceral way,
was how learned his music was, how deeply it tapped into the richest
strains of American music: folk, blues, country and rock, with nods
to Dixieland jazz and Irish.</TE>
<TE>   Bromberg, now 56, had a large following, particularly on college
campuses, but you could never say his was a mainstream name in pop
music. He recorded albums, but sitting in a studio was torture to an
impatient man who yearned only for the live performance. While he was
not the best known of the old Greenwich Village folk crowd, hardly
any article about Bromberg from that period failed to use the phrase
"a musician's musician," largely because of those, including Bob
Dylan, Richie Havens and Jerry Jeff Walker, who sought him out as a
sideman.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a completely personal style of playing the guitar so that
just from his finger work, you know it's David Bromberg," says Jay
Ungar, who played fiddle in Bromberg's band in the 1970s. "The tone,
the attack, the phrasing. It's very bluesy and gutsy. But he also has
this sweet side of playing."</TE>
<TE>   Although accomplished and commanding, Bromberg largely disappeared
from public view in the early '80s. Although his music never seemed
dated or cliched, Bromberg himself seemed to have all but vanished.</TE>
<TE>   But you never really vanish, at least not to yourself. I might
have lost track of Bromberg, but he never did, even as he completely
reinvented himself--or, at least, his career. David Bromberg,
audacious musician, had become David Bromberg, violin salesman.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, I had some catching up to do, which is what brought me
to this Wilmington coffee shop, where I was told the troublemaker was
quietly having a sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   And, unmistakably, there he was, sitting alone at the table in the
rear, thicker than I remembered and grayer, but still with oversized
glasses and that same ungovernable beard.</TE>
<TE>   Not So Unflappable</TE>
<TE>   out of the Limelight</TE>
<TE>   He quickly proved that the unflappability evident in his music did
not extend to the man.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst period in my life to do an interview," he said.
His life, he said, was in upheaval. He had just arrived from Boston,
where he had attended an important but pressure-packed violin
auction. The next day, he was to begin one of the mini-tours he still
does with his band each year. He is also relocating his family from
Chicago to Wilmington while making a risky change in his business. In
a few minutes, he had to take off to the Philadelphia airport to pick
up his wife and the younger of his two teenage children, and later he
was to meet with band members to go over their program.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted him to take a deep breath. Actually, I wanted him to take
a Valium. But he agreed to let me accompany him to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   On the way, he related that in the late 1970s, he left New York to
follow his manager to Northern California--a disastrous move. "There
weren't people around that it was any fun to play music with." So he
didn't. He didn't practice and he didn't compose. When he did play,
he felt he was only faking it.</TE>
<TE>   After a while, Bromberg came to a troubling realization. "I
decided I wasn't really a musician anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It was a cataclysmic self-discovery. Music had been the
inspiration and the engine of his entire life, and had put him, the
son of a Jewish psychiatrist from the suburbs of New York, on a
wholly unexpected path. From the time he was a child and a black
caretaker exposed him to gospel music, Bromberg had been a musical
sponge.</TE>
<TE>   He taught himself the guitar as a teenager, but when he learned
that blind blues guitarist Rev. Gary Davis lived in New York,
Bromberg tracked him down and begged to be taken on as a student.
Davis agreed, but the lessons would not be limited to his apartment.
He had Bromberg lead him to black churches and clubs to hear the best
gospel and blues around.</TE>
<TE>   Bromberg quit Columbia after his second year, and soon became a
fixture performing in Greenwich Village and living on wages tossed
into baskets. He hung around with many future stars also traversing
the Village, including Dave Van Ronk, Stephen Stills, Emmylou Harris,
Linda Ronstadt and Dylan. He often jammed with them, and many of
those cutting records prevailed on him to play guitar for them. He
performed on records by Dylan, Ringo Starr, Bonnie Raitt, Tom Paxton,
Tom Rush and dozens of others.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Bromberg formed his own band, complete with horn and
rhythm sections. Playing in it, Ungar says, was a blast.</TE>
<TE>   "As a bandleader, he was very inspiring. The ethos of the band
was, if it excited us, if it turned us on, he encouraged that."</TE>
<TE>   Yearning for Family Life,</TE>
<TE>   He Changes Careers</TE>
<TE>   If the move to California brought an end to that period of
Bromberg's life, it was only one factor. His relationship with his
record label, which always had a hard time figuring out how to market
his eclectic music, was becoming intolerably acrimonious. But he also
felt burned out after 20 years on the road. In 1979, he had married
an artist named Nancy Josephson, and he knew that constant touring
was not conducive to the family life he wanted. It was time to pull
back from music.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, it was not a decision that left him bereft, because
by the time he reached it, he had found another passion: the violin.</TE>
<TE>   The violin had not been his primary instrument, but he had
developed a fascination with it, the richness of its history and the
variety of its craftsmanship. He loved hearing about the instruments,
reading about them, examining them. While on tour, he dropped into
music shops, and if a violin appealed to him, he'd buy it. He didn't
know much about the instruments, so he often sought advice from some
of the leading American violin dealers.</TE>
<TE>   The more he talked violins, the more convinced he was that he had
found his second career. "The only intellectual stimulation I got was
sitting in a violin shop," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But first he had to educate himself in the esoterica of fine
violins: how to evaluate the wood, the varnish, the cut of the
F-holes and scroll. Bromberg decided the best way to acquire that
knowledge was to learn how to make violins himself. So, he enrolled
in the Chicago School of Violin Making, one of the best in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Bromberg graduated from violin-making school after four years,
sold violins for a prestigious Chicago dealer and then, after a year
or so, went out on his own as an independent wholesaler. Now, he says
with evident pride, "I'm better known in the violin trade than in the
music world."</TE>
<TE>   He travels around the United States and, three times a year,
ventures to Europe searching out fine violins for clients, including
collectors, stores and individual users.</TE>
<TE>   After living in Chicago for more than 20 years, Bromberg and
Josephson began pining for the East Coast, and they soon settled on
Wilmington, where Bromberg's tour manager lived. The city of
Wilmington, which wants to promote its downtown arts district, was
eager to have the Brombergs.</TE>
<TE>   City officials agreed to essentially give a 3 1/2-story building
near the Grand Opera House to the Brombergs in return for a
commitment that they stay for seven years and that David give a few
performances a year. On the first floor, Bromberg will operate a
retail violin shop, something he has not done before. He also
estimates that it will cost $600,000 to renovate the building.</TE>
<TE>   The whole venture, he says, scares him to death. "It's a huge
gamble. I'm going into hock up to my kishkas."</TE>
<TE>   He never completely stopped touring. A few times a year, he would
bring together the same old band members. Even if there's a lot more
heft and a lot less hair, playing with them feels better than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "The music is no longer an obsession," he says. "Strangely enough,
having left it, I appreciate it in a way I didn't when I was living
it all the time. What a privilege it is, what a tremendous joy, what
a pleasure."</TE>

<HD>'Scooby-Doo,' Where Are You?</HD>
<DH>The '70s context is lost. The Great Dane is a computer

<AU>ROBIN RAUZI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The movie version of "Scooby-Doo" has been hanging like a threat over
the happy childhood memories of my funky '70s TV-watching habits.</LD>
<LD>   Like so much other pop-culture--"Star Wars," "Josie and the
Pussycats," "Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle"--would the cool crime solvers with
the groovy van be ruined when Hollywood revisited them? Would a look
inside the Mystery Machine reveal nothing but an ugly conversion van?</LD>
<LD>   I'm afraid so.</LD>
<TE>   As reformulated by the aggressively mediocre director Raja Gosnell
and screenwriter James Gunn, this "Scooby-Doo" is entertainment more
disposable than Hanna-Barbera's half-hour cartoons ever were. Gosnell
exposed his witless comedy before in "Big Momma's House" and "Home
Alone 3"--admittedly, big moneymakers--and here he drains all the
potential out of the Scooby premise to carve out this hollow kids'
movie.</TE>
<TE>   The script from Gunn (tellingly, author of the book "All I Need to
Know About Filmmaking I Learned From the Toxic Avenger") reunites the
disbanded members of Mystery Inc. on Spooky Island, a spring break
resort-theme park. Gunn seems to have sketched out the characters in
big letters on small Post-it notes: Fred=vain. Velma=smart.
Scooby=nice.</TE>
<TE>   Good casting represents the only creativity in any of these
TV-to-movie projects. But landing, say, John Goodman to play Fred
Flintstone guarantees nothing. Likewise, Sarah Michelle Gellar, who
walks the line between parody and drama so well in the TV series
"Buffy the Vampire Slayer," is underused as Daphne, who's trying to
overcome her history of helplessness.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Cardellini dons Velma's orange cowl-neck sweater with a
certain amount of smart-girl dignity. But a word to Freddie Prinze
Jr.: Blond is not your color.</TE>
<TE>   It's a tribute of some kind to Matthew Lillard (of "Scream" and
"SLC Punk") that we don't want to slap him after 90 minutes of that
Casey Kasem Shaggy voice, which he duplicated with aplomb. He's as
loose-limbed and gawky as any cartoon, and is the only actor who
effectively interacts with the computer-animated dog.</TE>
<TE>   As for Scooby, the effects team was smart to keep him moving at
nearly all times, so that his flatness is only momentarily
distracting. This is not the wow-look-at-those-dinosaurs! level of
special effects, but it's satisfactory. What's most disappointing is
that creating a CGI Great Dane seems to be the primary motivation
behind reviving "Scooby-Doo" at all.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are also the toys to peddle. And the
just-released DVDs of the original show. Maybe T-shirts and lunch
boxes too. Rather than characters, the movie "Scooby-Doo" gives us
Halloween costumes. Rather than story, it gives us chase sequences
stapled end to end. Rather than humor, it gives us a two-minute
belch-and-flatulence competition between Shaggy and Scooby. We should
expect more from movies that we show children.</TE>
<TE>   Intentional or not, the original "Scooby-Doo" infused some
grown-up (or at least late adolescent) subtext into its Saturday
morning cartoons. Really, what were those kids doing driving around
in that van? Why did Shaggy have the munchies all the time? And Velma
... just a tomboy? Removed in time and spirit from the 1970s, this
movie not only ignores those subtexts, it actively suppresses them.</TE>
<TE>   And not to get too academic-sounding, but there was also an ethos
to "Scooby-Doo," wherein the youth were protecting the world--one old
mill or abandoned mine at a time--from greedy old men who would
profit from exploiting that land. Sure, it was a silly cartoon, but
it was a silly cartoon with a point of view.</TE>
<TE>   Rip the scary mask off this scheme, and the greedy characters
exposed are the ones who ruined "Scooby-Doo."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG, for some rude humor, language and some scary
action. Times guidelines: Too scary for kids under 6 or 7. Victims
possessed by monsters; bad guy steals souls.</TE>

<HD>Call of the West</HD>
<DH>Under the Wyoming sky, a new museum seeks to change the way
natural history is presented, for a down-to-earth audience</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CODY, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>The Draper Museum of Natural History opened its doors June 4 for an
audience of 6,300 visitors. In attendance were two eagles, three
hawks, every size and shape of cowboy and several Native American
tribal chiefs, not to mention muckety-mucks from Hollywood and the
Bureau of Land Management, rangers from nearby Yellowstone National
Park, a few politicians and at least one plain-speaking heiress.</LD>
<LD>   The Big Sky was low and blue, white clouds scudded around the
Absaroka Mountains, and cottonwood trees sent their fine white
threads on a sweet high desert breeze.</LD>
<LD>   So why in tarnation would anyone want to shuffle around inside a
museum?</LD>
<TE>   Because the whole way natural history is being communicated is
changing. It's no longer the viewer and the viewed, the exhibit and
the observer, neatly divided by glass or bars or even concrete walls.
The Draper is not the kind of museum where you peer into creepy
dioramas, grip the edges of cases filled with treasures brought home
by explorers who had a heck of a lot more fun than you're having.
It's intended to make explorers of us all.</TE>
<TE>   The Draper Museum is the first museum of natural history to open
in the 21st century. "It could create a new conservation paradigm,"
said Anne Young, local landowner and Draper board member.</TE>
<TE>   Designed by Denver architects Fentress, Bradburn and Associates
and New York-based exhibit designers DMCD Inc., the
55,000-square-foot museum looks a bit like the Guggenheim in
Manhattan, only with more glass and more light. A great spiral of
levels descends through the building as though the visitor were
hiking home from alpine tundra to Douglas fir and lodgepole pine
forests, to plains and meadows, all edging a 10,000-square-foot
rotunda.</TE>
<TE>   At each level a different ecosystem--its smells, sounds, textures
and wildlife--is represented. At trail's end, there's a tiled map of
Wyoming and Yellowstone, with a great lighted "sky" above that will
someday also serve as a planetarium.</TE>
<TE>   "Envioramas," which include the observer in the exhibit, replace
dioramas; listening stations reveal the voices and opinions of
President Theodore Roosevelt; Arappoish, a Crow leader; Gifford
Pinchot, the first chief forester of the U.S. Forest Service; and
naturalist Rachel Carson. You can compare the heartbeats of humans
and bears; video "keyholes" take you inside habitats.</TE>
<TE>   A powwow circle has a domed ceiling with a fire ring that lowers
for sleepovers. And there are still the old-fashioned taxidermic
animals--pikas and yellow-bellied marmots and red-tailed hawks and
moose--and touching boxes for children filled with fur, feathers,
stones, scat and maps.</TE>
<TE>   And that's not all. At each level, text and videos help the
visitor understand the complex issues of land use, preservation and
extinction that erupt almost every day in newspapers, bars and
courtrooms in this part of the world.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, 30 Canadian gray wolves were reintroduced to
Yellowstone in 1995. The population now numbers between 260 and 550,
depending on who is talking, and wolves threaten livestock on
surrounding ranches at a cost to the government of $238,000 in
damages over the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our exhibit poses the question: Is there room for large predators
in the world? I sure hope so," says Charles Preston, curator of the
Draper.</TE>
<TE>   "How Would You Reduce Our Dependence on Foreign Oil?" a caption at
another exhibit challenges viewers of all ages. "How Would You Manage
Water as the Human Population in the West Continues to Grow?"</TE>
<TE>   The Draper calls itself the first natural history museum to
consider the human story and the "nature" story. It is the newest
jewel in the crown of five museums that make up the Buffalo Bill
Historical Center, beginning with the Buffalo Bill Museum,
established in 1927 and dedicated to the presentation and
interpretation of the town's controversial namesake, William Cody.</TE>
<TE>   The Whitney Gallery of Western Art opened in 1958, a gift from
Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. The Plains Indians Museum opened in 1969
and was redesigned and reopened in 1979. The Cody Firearms Museum
opened in 1976 with money from the Winchester and Luger families. The
McCracken Research Library contains material on Buffalo Bill, Western
artists, plains Indians, Western folk music and the natural history
of the greater Yellowstone area. Altogether, the center covers seven
acres.</TE>
<TE>   "This may be the only place where you can see fine art and
prizewinning taxidermy in the same place," one visitor said.</TE>
<TE>   The new museum cost $17 million to build. Wyoming benefactor Nancy
Carroll Draper provided $13 million. Grants from the National Science
Foundation, Harvard, Yale and Cornell helped finish the project.</TE>
<TE>   Preston, a biologist and environmental policy analyst, is a man
living a life-long dream. During his entire professional life, he has
walked the line between academia and what he calls interpretation for
"regular people."</TE>
<TE>   "Science is a good starting point," he says. "Policy-making,
particularly in the West, is driven by dogma and platitudes. We have
to get beyond conflict and do some critical thinking. This is the
role of the natural history museum in the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   He has plans for symposiums, conferences and debates featuring
folks on all sides of the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "In general," he says, "Western legislators have responded badly
to what many have perceived as the arrogance of environmentalists.
Legislators, to gain support, identify themselves as
anti-environmental. But when you start talking to people, you realize
that that is not a vision shared by most Westerners.</TE>
<TE>   "Just take Buffalo Bill, who many called an Indian-hater and a
bison-killer. Later in his life he was a great supporter of Native
Americans and a supporter of preservation. He lived through these
issues the hard way and came to his conclusions. It's time we took a
leadership role in the West to finding solutions for problems that
are occurring all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   The turnout at the Draper on June 4 was almost two-thirds the
town's population of 9,000 people, many of whom cannot afford the $10
entrance fee and perhaps attended, one observer said, because this
was one of the few days when entry would be free. But still they
came, in wheelchairs and strollers. And there is reason to believe,
judging from the scarcity of dry eyes when the national anthem was
played by the high school band, that they were proud.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Simpson, former Wyoming senator and chairman of the Buffalo
Bill Historical Center, arrived from Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to build a Western museum is with Eastern money," he
had said and chuckled gleefully from seat 9B of the only plane that
flies into Cody each day. From there Simpson, who is fifth-generation
Cody and 6 feet 7, could stretch his Western legs down the center of
the aisle.</TE>
<TE>   "Whitney was a dude, [Research Library benefactor Harold]
McCracken was a dude. These people came out from New York and New
Haven and fell in love with the West," he said. "Even Draper family
money comes from Eastern textile concerns."</TE>
<TE>   Even Clint Eastwood flew in for the opening, with Warner Bros.
President Alan Horn.</TE>
<TE>   "Western art and jazz are our only true American art forms," he
told an adoring crowd at the opening ceremony. "This new natural
history museum is a sensation."</TE>
<TE>   The keynote speaker was Richard Leakey, son of paleontologists
Richard and Mary Leakey and a longtime advocate of wilderness
preservation in his native Kenya. He echoed Parsons' hopes for the
Draper Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can figure out the answer to some of these questions of
land use and habitat protection and species preservation," he told
the crowd, "you will inspire the whole world."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Draper rose to speak to the crowd as 250 monarch butterflies
were released. The cowboys waved their hats in the air.</TE>
<TE>   " 'Preciate it," she said and gave the floor to Crow tribal
historian Joe Medicine Crow.</TE>
<TE>   "We pray that the Draper will help us heal the land," he said.
"Good trails to follow and places of beauty to enrich our souls."</TE>

<HD>This 'Reality' Hybrid States Its Case Well</HD>

<LD>Television's funhouse mirror turns short into tall, thin into fat. So
naturally prime time's felonies and body counts are mounting even as
the national crime rate shrinks.</LD>
<LD>   The major broadcast networks will start their fall campaign with
19 crime-related hours, and more are scheduled to arrive at
midseason. Packing heat is a tradition on TV, where crime has always
paid. That's also so for feature films, going back nearly a century
to that one-reeler "The Great Train Robbery."</LD>
<LD>   Television producer Dick Wolf ("Law &amp; Order," "Law &amp; Order:
Special Victims Unit" and "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent") makes
fabulous money tailoring TV to viewers hot for stories spun from the
same violence many of them claim to abhor.</LD>
<TE>   Americans "watch for the same reason they watch 'ER,' " Wolf said
from New York, where his NBC trio is filmed. "Life and death are the
highest stakes of all." Next to TV ratings, as he well knows.</TE>
<TE>   Viewers love what they hate. Go figure, but they enjoy seeing in
entertainment--which is an abstraction to them--what they recoil from
in real life. That appeal extends widely in 2002, from such highbrows
as ABC's "NYPD Blue," HBO's "The Sopranos" and Wolf's enduring "Law &amp;
Order" prototype to "The Shield," a new cop series whose revolting
antihero has earned a loyal following in his first season on cable's
FX. Inspired by the Rampart police scandal, the show's central
character is an LAPD detective whose corrupt and murderous acts are
mimicked by his closest colleagues. Although these thugs with badges
are heavy-handed, their conduct somehow goes undetected by the
department's foggy honest cops.</TE>
<TE>   A kinder, gentler, smarter LAPD is surely ahead in Wolf's
"Dragnet" remake, a series set to begin on ABC in January.</TE>
<TE>   But is he TV's doyen of depravity or what? The Wolf series to
watch Sunday is "Crime &amp; Punishment," starting a 13-episode run on
NBC that marches viewers through the trenches of criminal law.</TE>
<TE>   Called a "drama-mentary" by NBC, this is another of those
"reality" hybrids, but a very good one that promises a summer of
arresting insights.</TE>
<TE>   Any similarity here to Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment" is,
well, minimal. Although criminals starring in these abridged real
trials probably share Raskolnikov's belief about exemption from moral
law, they earn no purification through suffering. And San Diego is
not Russia's 19th century St. Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   Its district attorney's office, though, tries cases that produce
fascinating TV in a series functioning as entertainment while
affirming the rewards of cameras in courtrooms. California and 36
other states wisely allow them, subject to the discretion of
individual trial judges.</TE>
<TE>   Another is Arizona, locale for "State v.," a five-week prime-time
series (starting Wednesday) resulting from ABC News cameras getting
intimate access to courtroom action, lawyer strategies and even jury
deliberations in a number of homicide cases.</TE>
<TE>   Rigid as stone, though, is the federal system. It stubbornly bans
TV from its courtrooms, much to the dismay of those believing that
only rarely would cameras interfere with a defendant's right to a
fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf mounts this soapbox fervently. Why not cameras as a surrogate
eyewitness when "you can walk in off the street into any trial in the
country?" he argues. "This is supposed to be a free society. I can't
believe the people who came up with this judicial system felt that
the widest number of people should not be able to see a trial."</TE>
<TE>   If "Crime &amp; Punishment" witnesses are basking in their 15 minutes
of TV glory or notoriety, they hide it well in the first three
episodes. Nor do you sense grandstanding by judges, or by attorneys
beyond the usual shows they put on for juries. That's because the TV
technology here is unobtrusive--three small, stationary cameras
operated by remote control at various spots in the courtroom--and
easy to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Cameras are excluded from showing jurors but capture many
revealing trial nuances, as in Episode 2's flickering nervous eye
contact between the mother of a sexually abused child and Assistant
Dist. Atty. Jill DiCarlo when a prosecution witness is grilled
aggressively by a defense attorney.</TE>
<TE>   We're front-row voyeurs here, at times watching geysers of raw
emotions in private, unguarded moments (no one appears in the series
without giving permission) that don't seem faked. "Bill's more of a
purist than I am and won't re-stage anything," Wolf said of executive
producer Bill Guttenberg, a filmmaker whose numerous awards for his
documentaries include an Oscar for "You Didn't Have to Die."</TE>
<TE>   And speaking of high drama, Episode 3's murder trial ends with a
thunderous jolt that critics would dismiss as excessive and
unrealistic were this fictional "Law &amp; Order."</TE>
<TE>   "Crime &amp; Punishment" is self-consciously mannered, in fact, only
when leaving the courtroom to slice in supposedly candid
behind-the-scenes strategy chats among prosecutors, something that
distinguishes this series from Court TV. Although at times
interesting, some of these dialogues appear stiff and unnatural.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf, Guttenberg and executive producers David Kanter and Peter
Jankowski deliver highly watchable judicialese, in contrast with the
tedium you usually get when monitoring trials in their entirety.</TE>
<TE>   Yet ... if only this crowd were more like the testier bunch on
"Law &amp; Order." If only Assistant Dist. Atty. Dan Goldstein--whose
first "no-body" murder prosecution opens the series--were as nasty as
"L&amp;O's" Jack McCoy. If only Eugenia Eyherabide, upbeat supervisor of
the office's Family Protection Unit, were as dour and crotchety here
as "L&amp;O's" original D.A., Adam Schiff. Favorite line: "Close the door
before someone walks in with a case we can win."</TE>
<TE>   If only reality were more like art.</TE>
<TE>   Or in this case, selective reality, for Wolf says his series uses
only one foot of film for every 290 feet shot. Although there appears
to be enough reasonable doubt to acquit Sunday's defendant, for
example, keep in mind that only a sliver of this trial is shown. And
that the behind-the-scenes segments also have been severely chiseled
down with entertainment in mind.</TE>
<TE>   The D.A.'s office agreed to "no prior restraint, no post
restraint, no editorial [control]," Wolf said. The potential for
self-censorship looms as large here, though, as for Fox's "Cops" and
other police ride-along series whose lifeblood is accessibility to
their subjects. Wolf envisions "Crime &amp; Punishment" as an annual
summer series, should its ratings rock. Presenting district attorneys
in a bad light, though, would give San Diego and other cities pause
about taking part in the future.</TE>
<TE>   As they say in prime-time crime, though, that's show biz.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime &amp; Punishment" premieres at 10 p.m. Sunday on NBC. The
network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young children).</TE>

<HD>Not Quite Able to Connect the Dots</HD>
<DH>In a Sondheim festival revival, the musical about
pointillist painter Georges Seurat fails to capture the original
show's colors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Despite its initial acclaim, the Pulitzer Prize-winning
"Sunday in the Park With George" isn't revived nearly as often as
many of Stephen Sondheim's other landmark musicals. So it was one of
the most anticipated entries in the current Sondheim Celebration at
the Kennedy Center, especially for those who recall being deeply
moved by it in its 1984 premiere.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Schaeffer, artistic director of the ambitious festival,
selected "Sunday" as one of the two musicals he's personally staging.
It's sad to report that Schaeffer's production accomplishes little
except to reveal some of the reasons the show is so seldom dusted
off.</LD>
<LD>   For a musical that lasts two hours, 45 minutes, "Sunday in the
Park" has a surprisingly sketchy book, especially considering that it
was written by James Lapine, who also wrote Sondheim's heavily
plotted "Into the Woods." That its two acts are separated by a
century reinforces this quality.</LD>
<TE>   Act 1: In the 1880s, the French pointillist artist Georges Seurat,
obsessed by his painting "A Sunday on La Grande Jatte," drives his
mistress, Dot, out of his life and eventually--after she's pregnant
with his child--to America. Act 2: Dot's great-grandson George, a
divorced American conceptual artist, feels his own creative well
running dry but is inspired to move on to a new phase of his work by
memories of his great-grandmother and her life.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, not every other Sondheim musical has as driving a plot
as "Into the Woods" or "Sweeney Todd." But those that don't usually
offer empathetic characters who are caught in a dramatic situation
that inspires richly ambivalent feelings in both the characters and
the audience. Not so with "Sunday in the Park." At least in
Schaeffer's staging, Raul Esparza's 1880s George is a resolutely cold
fish. He doesn't appear to have inward feelings for Dot that must be
overcome in order for his art to triumph. Melissa Errico brings
everything to the role of Dot that Bernadette Peters brought to the
original, but she can't establish the link with George all by
herself.</TE>
<TE>   The weakness of the dramatic core in the first act makes the
antics of the supporting characters--the people whose momentary poses
are being caught for posterity in Seurat's painting--feel less like
comic relief and more like tiresome padding. Perhaps it's unfair to
expect them to be more fleshed out; Seurat himself didn't worry about
that in his painting. But this is a nearly three-hour event, not a
painting, and these characters are much more one-note than the
smaller roles in most of Sondheim's oeuvre.</TE>
<TE>   The first part of the second act remains as brilliant as ever.
First, in "It's Hot Up Here," Seurat's subjects gripe about the
downside of being recorded for posterity. Then we move forward to the
introduction of the contemporary George's latest mixed-media piece,
"Chromolume #7," and his acerbic "Putting It Together" number, in
which he offers his cynical guide to the politics of the modern art
world. For this production, the "Chromolume" is largely unseen,
although we see the reactions of the art crowd who have gathered for
its unveiling.</TE>
<TE>   Esparza looks appropriately lean and hungry as the later George,
and Errico convincingly alters her former voice and stance to play
George's grandmother. But the second half of the second act, which
had seemed so poignant in the original production, doesn't work
nearly as well here. Although George is inspired to "Move On," he has
been established as such a superficial, callow guy that it's hard to
have much confidence that he will find a new, worthwhile subject.</TE>
<TE>   The disguised autobiographical statement contained within
"Sunday"--compare Sondheim's professional and personal dilemmas to
Seurat's--is fascinating for anyone who admires Sondheim's work. But
this production makes it look as if the other layers of meaning in
this musical have diminished with time. Call it "Sunday on the Stage
With Stephen."</TE>

<LD>OK, so you're an aspiring actor, fresh out of Podunk, and you've just
gotten your first break in motion pictures. There's one problem:
You're sharing your "role" with 3,399 other hopefuls, and you're
filming on location in the Arizona desert, 240 miles from anywhere.
Worse, your older brother is not only spending time with the girl you
love, he's rocketing to stardom, while you're left wallowing in the
sand, enduring the Ten Plagues of Egypt. (Did we mention you hate
frogs?)</LD>
<LD>   Such is the plight of Benny, the fresh-faced naif at the center of
the high jinks in "Epic Proportions," Larry Coen and David Crane's
1930s period comedy, now at West Coast Ensemble. A sendup of
Hollywood in its heyday, "Proportions" is a slight but glittering
bagatelle, polished to a high gloss by director Richard Israel and
his energetic cast.</LD>
<TE>   The material may be featherweight, but Coen and Crane (Crane
co-created the hit TV series "Friends") know their way around a
one-liner and leave no surrealistically sensational opportunity
unexploited. The movie-within-a-play, directed by the legendary D.W.
DeWitt (an effectively deadpan Larry Lederman), is a kitchen-sink
epic so huge, it makes "Intolerance" look like a nickelodeon short.
Casting history to the desert wind, DeWitt lumps Cleopatra, Moses, et
al into one improbable sex-and-sand story line. The stuff of
catharsis "Proportions" is not, but it is sufficient pretext for the
cheerfully hammy actors to romp freely in the tall corn.</TE>
<TE>   The action cuts back and forth between the actual film shoot and
the romantic byplay off camera among sweetly woebegone Benny (Michael
Spellman); Phil (Paul Kouri), Benny's handsome but insensitive older
brother; and Louise (hilarious Madelynn Fattibene), the wholesome
production assistant they both adore. Mark Ehrlich, John Steven Rocha
and Ed Smaron are versatile backups, playing everything from pharaohs
to spear-bearers. Over-the-top Angela DeCicco amuses as a gum-popping
Cleopatra hot on the comeback trail. Evan Bartoletti designed the
set, Lisa D. Katz the lighting and David Spector the sound, which
includes an unctuous baritone voice-over a la "The Ten Commandments."
Costume designer Gina Davison's gleefully gaudy Egyptian togs go
light on historical authenticity and heavy on the glitter--standard
operating procedure for this lighthearted diversion.</TE>

<TE>   'Cherry Orchard' Tries to</TE>
<TE>   Honor Chekhov's Wish</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, there has been disagreement over how to stage
Chekhov's plays. The playwright's great patron, Konstantin
Stanislavsky, directed them as dramas at the Moscow Art Theater,
while Chekhov insisted they were comedies.</TE>
<TE>   An Odyssey Theatre Ensemble/Circus Theatricals production of "The
Cherry Orchard" tries to honor Chekhov's wish. But comedy, as Chekhov
wrote it, exists on a knife's edge between satiric silliness and
immense sadness. Director Jack Stehlin and his cast blunder too often
into broad comedy, which makes the characters seem merely ridiculous
and their downfall pathetic rather than sorrowful.</TE>
<TE>   The cast's two biggest names, Alfred Molina and Stephanie
Zimbalist, deliver the most effective performances.</TE>
<TE>   Molina is earnest but a bit arrogant as a successful businessman
in early 1900s Russia who tries to divert a once-wealthy
family--whose predecessors owned his father as a serf--from the
calamity of seeing its country estate sold at auction to settle
debts.</TE>
<TE>   Playing the estate owner's adopted daughter and the property's
caretaker, Zimbalist--tightly buttoned into her severely drab
dresses--is the picture of repressed emotion.</TE>
<TE>   As the estate owner, Jill Gascoine is so filled with the joy of
living that it's almost easy to forgive her disastrous lack of
practicality, while Greg Mullavey, playing her brother, is an
overgrown child, veering between extremes of rapture and despair.</TE>
<TE>   Mullavey is encouraged to play much too big at times, while actors
in some of the smaller roles are sent still further--especially Gigi
Bermingham (so excellent in the recent "Non-Vital Organs") as a
governess whose attention-grabbing theatrics and shrill voice put one
in mind of Megan Mullally's Karen on "Will &amp; Grace."</TE>
<TE>   "The Cherry Orchard" is a story about something important slipping
through one's fingers, vanishing irretrievably into the past before
it is even really gone. Unfortunately, that's exactly what happens to
this production.</TE>

<TE>   Offbeat but Predictable</TE>
<TE>   'Criminal Minds'</TE>
<TE>   A trio of criminals holes up in an off-season Florida miniature
golf facility in "Criminal Minds," an entertaining but insubstantial
play that holds our interest right up until it devolves into
predictable crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The play, the second production for the Company Rep at the El
Portal's Circle Theatre, opens shortly after Eddie Ray (Rob Arbogast)
has broken out of the pen along with fellow con Renfroe (Ron
Slanina). An opportunistic scumbag who spells trouble in capital
letters, Eddie Ray has coerced his long-suffering, trashy girlfriend
Billy Marie (Heather Simmons) into aiding and abetting his latest
harebrained scheme. That scheme revolves around the fact that
Renfroe, a courtly soul with a mysterious past, has absolutely no
memory, either short- or long-term--a quirk that makes him the
perfect patsy for Eddie Ray's next heist. However, Renfroe soon
concocts a passionate attraction for the tough-as-nails Billy Marie,
who finds herself softening under Renfroe's gentle influence.</TE>
<TE>   An early effort by Robin Swicord, now an A-list screenwriter whose
credits include "Practical Magic" and "Little Women," the play is
offbeat to the point of affectation, ending with an O. Henry twist
more mean-spirited than shocking. The play's faults are lessened by
Hope Alexander's energetic direction, and compelling performances by
Simmons and Slanina, whose rich, psychologically true turns are
triumphs of style over substance. Arbogast is less successful as
Eddie Ray, who is manic to a fault and less than menacing. Jackson
DeGovia's well-crafted set--a miniature golf course, complete with a
huge, made-from-scratch brontosaurus--is particularly striking.</TE>

<LD>   The young teens of the beautiful, emotion-charged "The Dangerous
Lives of Altar Boys" face perils real and imagined--although not of
the type raised by the current furor over pedophile priests. Instead,
this imaginative film, adapted from Chris Fuhrman's celebrated 1994
coming-of-age novel, suggests that life may be full of wonders but it
is also a terrifically risky business.</LD>
<LD>   These young people discover, in their initial collision of
innocence with experience, that part of growing up is having to
acknowledge that life is fragile and ever uncertain, its dark
undertow lurking never too far beneath an often deceptively placid
surface.</LD>

(Kieran Culkin), are in their early teens, living in an idyllic small
town in the 1970s, the kind with tree-lined avenues and spacious old
homes with inviting front porches. They and their pals attend the
local Catholic school, where Vincent D'Onofrio's Father Casey is a
firm but mellow presence. Sister Assumpta (Jodie Foster) is another
matter. She is a scathingly strict disciplinarian, her rigidity
emphasized by her prosthetic left leg. She is fiercely devout but
totally lacking in joy. Hellfire and damnation are painfully palpable
to her, and she sees it as her solemn duty to prepare her students to
cope with a troubled world in a manner designed to incur their
loathing.</TE>
<TE>   Francis, Tim and their pals, like many 14- and 15-year-olds,
escape into the fantasy world of comic books, but Francis, a gifted
artist, takes it a step further. He writes and draws a narrative in
which he and his friends become giant muscular hulks, taking on the
villainous Sister Nunzilla and her sisterly horde. They're trying to
help the beautiful Sorcerella in her struggle to unite a magical
sword and pearl to bring her derelict, abandoned kingdom back to
life.</TE>
<TE>   It is a special triumph that animator Todd McFarlane has brought
Francis' comic book fantasy to vivid life with such wit and style,
and that director Peter Care (a prize-winning maker of music videos
and commercials), writers Jeff Stockwell and Michael Petroni, and
cinematographer Lance Acord make the transitions between live action
and animation so remarkably fluid and natural-seeming. What makes the
mesh so effective is that Francis' fantasy narrative shifts gears
from time to time to reflect the twists and turns in his daily life.
Most important is that he and Jena Malone's pretty but troubled
Margie Flynn are drawn to each other in what is Francis' first rush
of emotional and sexual attraction. Margie and the secret that
imprisons her unconsciously become the source of inspiration for
Sorcerella and her plight.</TE>
<TE>   There's a streak of prankishness in the boys that goes pretty far,
yet so rich and engaging is this film and its people that we never
lose sympathy for them, even for Sister Assumpta, who means well yet
feels compelled to rip apart "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell," a
book of poetry and illustrations by Romantic poet William Blake,
Francis' idol, whom she labels "a dangerous thinker." (No wonder she
feels this way: Blake ends the book with the statement that "every
thing that lives is holy.") Sister Assumpta represents a bold
departure for Foster, the film's co-producer, who shows us the fear
and vulnerability that the nun desperately tries to hide.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch and Culkin, and Jake Richardson and Tyler Long as their
friends, all register as real teenagers in the throes of discovery of
self and the world. Hirsch's Francis is the central figure, not only
for his talent and imagination, but also for the grounding strength
of his solid, normal family life. Tim's parents fight constantly, and
Culkin shows us that Tim has a sense of reality's grimness and a
streak of recklessness that exceeds Francis' experience and feelings;
the same goes for Malone's Margie. D'Onofrio's Father Casey
understands that the boys are caught in the tug of war between the
lure of rebellion and the expectations of responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   The look and feel of the film is entirely beguiling. It is
deliberately not a period piece, heavy with dated styles and fads,
but instead evokes a sense of timelessness. In keeping with this
approach, Marco Beltrami's score is evocative rather than nostalgic,
and a pair of bell-bottoms is not to be found among designer Marie
France's low-key costumes.</TE>
<TE>   They have permeated their film with the spirit of William Blake,
and, like the poet's great works, "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"
leaves us with the feeling of the inevitable, inescapable
intermingling of good and evil.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, sexual content and youth substance
abuse. Times guidelines: The film is for mature audiences and is too
intense for children.</TE>

<DH>'The Bourne Identity,' which stars Matt Damon as a spy
without a memory but with some fierce skills, thrives under director
Doug Liman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine awakening one morning and finding yourself suddenly blessed
not only with nerves of steel and fluency in several languages, but
also the action reflexes of Bruce Lee, the driving skills of Michael
Schumacher and the climbing ability of Spider-Man.</LD>
<LD>   There are, however, a number of catches:</LD>
<LD>   You wake up not in your own bed, but in an Italian fishing boat in
the Mediterranean after being pulled from the stormy water with two
bullets in your back; everyone in Europe who wears a uniform, and
numerous people who do not, are seriously trying to capture and/or
kill you; oh yes, you have complete amnesia and have no idea who you
are, how those enviable skills came to be yours or why any of this is
happening to you.</LD>
<TE>   That's the premise of "The Bourne Identity," a tiptop espionage
thriller starring Matt Damon that takes this crackerjack premise and
runs with it. Based loosely on the 1980 novel by Robert Ludlum that
was filmed for TV in 1988 with Richard Chamberlain in the lead, this
is an entertainment that really entertains because any number of
interesting and unexpected choices were made, starting with the
selection of Doug Liman as the director.</TE>
<TE>   One of the bright lights of independent filmmaking, Liman was an
unusual pick to do the kind of major-studio secret agent movie that
usually ends up as stodgy and arteriosclerotic as "Spy Game."</TE>
<TE>   Liman is so jazzed at the opportunity to bring his outsider
sensibility to mainstream material that he's been able to treat the
story like it's spanking new. He has successfully fused elements of
both his previous features, the charming character-driven "Swingers"
and the overreaching but still vivid "Go," onto this production.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bourne Identity" gets its initial impetus from a
well-constructed screenplay by Tony Gilroy and William Blake Herron
that takes the film's fairly straight-forward plot and keeps it
nicely streamlined and surprising enough to be involving. (Though the
film had well-publicized script problems, they are not visible in the
finished product.)</TE>
<TE>   The man who wakes up on the boat (Damon) has but a single clue to
who he is: a mechanism, implanted in his hip, that displays a Swiss
bank account number. He travels to Zurich to check it out and
discovers not only an American passport that tells him he's Jason
Bourne, but also a veritable U.N.'s worth of papers in other names
from other countries. Plus a whole lot of money. And a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bourne is still in the dark about the details of his
identity, the film--through glimpses of distraught spymasters Ted
Conklin (Chris Cooper) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) at CIA
headquarters--has already let us in on the secret. Bourne is a top
Company assassin, part of a hush-hush project called Treadstone, but
his lack of success in his last job has so compromised this
super-clandestine world that Conklin feels compelled to insist, "I
want Bourne in a body bag by sundown."</TE>
<TE>   With no idea why everyone is chasing him, Bourne makes an
accidental connection with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente, the Lola of
"Run Lola Run"), a beautiful young vagabond with a tiny red Austin
Mini Cooper who--for a tidy sum--agrees to drive him to Paris. There,
circumstances conspire to keep them together as Bourne attempts to
survive the nonstop attempts on his life, as well as piece together
exactly what that life consists of.</TE>
<TE>   In Liman's hands, this potentially overly familiar scenario takes
on unexpected sparkle. For one thing, the director, occasionally
serving as his own camera operator (and working with cinematographer
Oliver Wood and editor Saar Klein), is so good at the mechanics of
action that they don't feel like mechanics. Laced with great shock
moments, "Bourne" moves along smartly on its own steam, drawing us
confidently into its orbit.</TE>
<TE>   Equally essential is the way Liman and his actors have used
intense but low-key line readings to infuse a sense of reality onto
these proceedings, to make this a character-driven story about young
people we might know caught in a situation we can barely imagine.</TE>
<TE>   With Cooper, Cox and Julia Stiles as the CIA folks and Clive Owen
as a rival assassin, "Bourne" is notably well-cast in its subsidiary
roles, but especially successful is the pairing of Damon as an
earnest would-be teddy bear who can't understand why he's a killing
machine and Potente as the woman who's attracted to him against her
better judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Although interpersonal relationships in espionage films often
can't get beyond the emotional opaqueness of James Bond, the
interplay here is surprisingly human. Bourne and Marie have a rapport
that's tentative and tender; they are hesitant with each other
because they're inescapably lost and confused. It's a small touch but
a vital one, and it underlines why "The Bourne Identity" commands our
attention and our respect.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for violence and some language. Times
guidelines: The violence is intense but not gratuitous.</TE>

<HD>Unable to Crack the Code</HD>
<DH>'Windtalkers' lacks the usual daring that we expect from
director John Woo</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, inevitably, John Woo has gone to war.</LD>
<LD>   Starting with Hong Kong classics like "A Better Tomorrow" and
"Hard-Boiled," and continuing into Hollywood extravaganzas "Face/Off"
and "Mission: Impossible 2," Woo is his generation's preeminent
orchestrator of violence, someone who truly loves the smell of napalm
in the morning.</LD>
<LD>   So his attraction to the astronomical bullet and body count of
World War II was only a matter of time. The resulting "Windtalkers,"
however, is not all it might have been, an oddly old-fashioned film
from a director who's usually anything but.</LD>
<TE>   In "Windtalkers," Woo takes off from one of the great true stories
of that conflict: how the impenetrability and difficulty of the
unwritten Navajo language turned it into a Pacific theater combat
code that the Japanese were unable to break. That secret was so
valuable that, at least according to the John Rice &amp; Joe Batteer
script, the Marines assigned the talkers (all but one of whom were
Navajos in real life) bodyguards instructed to "protect the code at
all costs," which meant killing the talker if capture was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "Windtalkers" star Nicolas Cage plays a Marine faced with that
assignment and, eventually, with that moral challenge as well. Woo
approached the filming of the "Windtalkers" combat scenes (with the
Hawaiian island of Oahu and parts of Southern California standing in
for Saipan and the Solomon Islands) with his usual gusto. The first
shot of the Saipan campaign alone, for instance, utilized 280
explosions and 700 extras, and Woo and cinematographer Jeffrey
Kimball at times used as many as 14 cameras to capture the action.</TE>
<TE>   But although the director remains both an enviable stylizer of
balletic violence and a fine creator of mythic sequences like the
film's opening journey through a misty Monument Valley, "Windtalkers"
does not make the kind of visceral impression previous Woo films have
almost taken for granted. "Windtalkers" feels behind the curve
visually--and that's the last thing you'd expect to say about a
filmmaker with Woo's bulletproof panache.</TE>
<TE>   After what we've seen recently in "We Were Soldiers" and
especially "Black Hawk Down," these battle scenes seem a tad
formulaic, as does the film's story. Initially, "Windtalkers" follows
two narrative threads. We see a pair of young Navajos, Ben Yahzee
(Adam Beach of "Smoke Signals") and Charlie Whitehorse (the debuting
Roger Willie, the film's only featured Navajo) as they learn to talk
the code talk.</TE>
<TE>   We also spend quality time, such as it is, with a stoic, sullen
Marine named Joe Enders (Cage). Enders wasn't always that grumpy, but
after a firefight in the Solomons that killed 15 of his buddies and
left him with hearing and balance problems and an ear that looks like
Mike Tyson has taken a crack at it, Enders is tormented by his part
in all of those deaths.</TE>
<TE>   With the help of sympathetic nurse Rita (Frances O'Connor), Enders
gets another combat assignment, and is chagrined to learn it's to be
the guardian-assassin of Yahzee. Another Marine, Ox Henderson
(Christian Slater), gets the same job for Whitehorse, and although
Enders knows neither he nor Ox should get too friendly with their
charges, the closeness of combat makes that inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   It has no shortage of violent situations, but "Windtalkers" also
seems to have its eye on being thoughtful and character-driven, but
Woo doesn't have the best touch for this, and Rice-Batteer's
standard-issue war movie script isn't any help. Throwing in
everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his
teeth, "Windtalkers" seems to have ransacked every old World War II
movie for overly familiar material. There's the guy who plays the
harmonica, the guy who gives the "if anything should happen to me"
speech, even the bigoted guy who sees the error of his ways once a
Navajo saves his life. When it comes to learning experiences, it's
hard to beat a really good war.</TE>
<TE>   Although most Woo movies have made violent action almost
exhilarating, the level of bloodshed in "Windtalkers" has the
opposite effect. With a body count rising to computer-game levels,
these combat sequences are more numbing than exciting, an exhausting
display of purposeless firepower. Even John Woo, it seems, can fall
victim to carnage overkill.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for pervasive graphic war violence, and for
language. Times guidelines: violence as extreme as R gets, including
a beheading.</TE>

<LD>That kid from "The Sixth Sense" sees dead people. John Edward, the
host of "Crossing Over," purports to talk to dead people.</LD>
<LD>   Sonya Fitzpatrick outdoes both as host of Animal Planet's "The Pet
Psychic," which premiered June 3. Fitzpatrick chats telepathically
with animals dead or alive--or so she would have us believe.</LD>
<LD>   Fitzpatrick counsels creatures in their habitats, then wows
members of her studio audience who bring their pets (or photos of
those that have moved on to the "spirit world") by doing her routine.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, Fitzpatrick meets an iguana who has issues with the
family cat, an ornery bat who lashes out at his keeper and a
mini-horse with no appetite. This is a rebroadcast of episode two.
New shows air Mondays at 8 p.m., repeating Fridays at 9 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In a style reminiscent of Edward, the British-born Fitzpatrick
mostly relays vague ideas and lets the pet owners fill in the
details. A dead cat reveals that "most of his life he was healthy,
until the end." The sessions often involve the color blue
(Fitzpatrick will turn and ask a dazzled pet owner, "Where is it that
you have something blue?").</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally Fitzpatrick scores an impressive hit, like tonight
when she asks a dog owner, "When is he going to have some more French
fries?" But you have to wonder whether Fitzpatrick, like the street
magician David Blaine, benefits from judicious TV editing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she has a rapport with animals, and she taps into the
undeniable bond between pets and their owners. Animal lovers may
relish these sessions without sweating their veracity, just as pro
wrestling fans delight in scripted mayhem.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics may be reminded of Mike Myers' succinct review of the
movie "All Dogs Go to Heaven" from "Saturday Night Live" in 1989: "As
if."</TE>

<LD>Laura Zigman sized up the row of wedding dresses at Barneys New York
in Beverly Hills. "Elise would probably choose Vera Wang," she said,
holding up a length of lace and organza. "Nothing too outside the
box, nothing tutu .... Something really simple, like a $25,000
dress." Zigman was talking about the protagonist of her new novel, a
bride-to-be. She mused on the subject of weddings. "Why is it
bridesmaid dresses are always so ugly?" she asked before advancing
her theory: "The bride doesn't want competition."</LD>
<LD>   Competition between women is at the center of "Her," Zigman's
novel about a woman who meets her fiance's ex, a woman who embodies
the sum of all female fears.</LD>
<LD>   Adrienne is "of French descent (France, not Canada); a graduate of
Yale (master's in art history); an avid rock and mountain climber
(Kilimanjaro, 1995); horrifyingly gorgeous ... and recently single,"
the book begins.</LD>
<TE>   Elise becomes obsessed with "her"--"the mother of all exes."</TE>
<TE>   "One minute I was taste-testing cakes, canapes, champagne;
sniffing stationery; fondling tulle ... the next, I was stalking
Adrienne," Elise recounts. "This transition ... from bride-to-be to
madwoman, was inexplicably seamless."</TE>
<TE>   Zigman, a former publicist for Knopf (now her publisher), was in
Los Angeles to promote the book, the rights of which she recently
sold to Julia Robert's Shoelace Productions. Zigman previously wrote
"Animal Husbandry" (Dial Press, 1998) and "Dating Big Bird" (Dial,
2000).</TE>
<TE>   Her first book became the 2001 movie "Someone Like You." When
Zigman visited the set, she had just given birth. "I stood next to
Ashley Judd and I felt like a different species," Zigman said. "I
asked the [costumer], 'What is she--a size 2?' and he went, 'If even.
She's a size 0.' That was the first time I realized there was a size
0."</TE>
<TE>   Women never stop comparing themselves to one another, she said,
and movies and magazines feed the urge.</TE>
<TE>   "The polls, like the sex surveys. 'Who's having sex and how much?'
" Zigman said.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that a long history of dating and exes, and you have the
existential question of the 21st century: "How do I rate?"</TE>
<TE>   "What did they do that was different, what was it like?" she said.
"By the time you're getting married, it's a full-blown neurosis."
Zigman is blissfully out of the game. She isn't married but lives
outside Boston with her partner, Brendan Dealy, and their son,
Benjamin, who is almost 2. So will Zigman ever don a Vera Wang? "We
were talking about it but then the baby happened," she said. "Now,
it's like: 'Do you want the wedding or the new fence?' "</TE>
<TE>   Risque and Classy</TE>
<TE>   "We want to put the 'V' back in VIP," said Ivan Kane, as he stood
on the red carpet in front of his new club, Forty Deuce, Wednesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the lounge on Melrose, Kane relied on a small,
well-used segment of his vocabulary: "risque," "fantasy," "sexy,"
"sexy" ... "sexy."</TE>
<TE>   "We try to keep it down-and-dirty but add a touch of class."</TE>
<TE>   There are no exclusive, celebrity sections in the club--it's all a
VIP area as far as Kane is concerned. Nicole Kidman, Elisabeth Shue
and even Barry Diller visited during preview parties for the club, he
is quick to mention, but on Wednesday, the official opening night,
most celebrities stayed away, possibly choosing the Lakers over the
lounge, where a burlesque show takes place every hour.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Kane was feeling good as he moved through the club, kissing
and complimenting skinny, sparkly women in his path ("beautiful,
sexy").</TE>
<TE>   The men got the thumb-locking handshake, and a few anointed got
the bear hug. Every two steps, someone called out his name. Wherever
Kane went, so moved the center of the party.</TE>
<TE>   He found the decor and theme for the bar "in the dark recesses of
my mind," he said, "the dark side, like Star Wars." He was becoming
the Darth Vader of Hollywood nightlife, he said, and laughed.</TE>
<TE>   At 11 p.m., he took the stage. Growing up in New York, he and his
friends would "cut class to go to 42nd Street, Times Square. The
strip clubs, like Metropol," he said. "The name [of the club] is an
homage."</TE>
<TE>   Following Kane, a woman wearing a pink satin evening gown with an
embroidered black dragon, took the stage. Catcalls and whistles from
the audience. As the dragon disappeared, the crowd--mostly couples
and some singles--fell silent. A few men at the bar bit their straws
intently. Nearby, a Britney Spears look-alike held hands with her
date as she watched the show.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Seymor Cassel, sitting in a red leather chair at the
horseshoe bar, smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "Ah," he said. "I grew up with burlesque. It's much more
interesting to have an act to look at." And, unlike strip bars,
there's no need for a flutter of dollar bills, he said, looking very
content.</TE>
<TE>   Cassel left--he had a golf game the next morning--and a crush of
publicists entered.</TE>
<TE>   Standing on the red carpet, a woman exclaimed to an arriving
guest: "It's a scene, it's a scene."</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "One night ... she had gone home, she'd been OK and then she had
like a backslide and they had to go back into the hospital. I think
it was around 4, 5 o'clock in the morning .... I said, 'So you had to
come back to the hospital, huh?' And she said, 'I missed the food.'
And we both started to howl."--Carol Burnett to Barbara Walters in a
"20/20 interview to air tonight on the death of her daughter Carrie
of cancer in January and how humor helped them through the suffering.</TE>

<DH>Debonair and saucy, Bill Blass was fashion's reliable
source for timeless elegance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALLI HERMAN-COHEN and BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As fashion spun into a maelstrom of ego, excess and experimentation,
Bill Blass remained the standard-bearer for fine and elegant clothes
that offered consistent style and quiet reassurance to generations of
influential women.</LD>
<LD>   Blass, who died at his Connecticut home of throat cancer Wednesday
just 10 days short of his 80th birthday, helped shape the image of
the American fashion industry through the 60 years he spent in New
York. He established Bill Blass Ltd. in 1970.</LD>
<LD>   "He was a statesman for the fashion industry," said Helen O'Hagan,
the former Saks Fifth Avenue executive who was his friend for 40
years. "He was a cult figure." Personally and professionally, Blass,
who was born in Fort Wayne, Ind., was the embodiment of restraint and
simple Midwestern values.</LD>
<TE>   His shows, particularly throughout the 1990s, became a respite
from the whiplash-inducing trend machine. Blass could remake simple
menswear pinstripes into a perfectly proportioned dress that would
appeal to women from 25 to 75, or create a variety of shift dresses
that women could wear for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "He understood how women dressed, and he listened," said Craig
Natiello, who was Blass' head designer until he took the design post
at Halston in 1999. "He would say, 'That looks dreadful on you. Take
it off!' "</TE>
<TE>   Each season, Blass, who retired in 1999, took pains to understand
his customers through 12 to 15 road trips to outlying cities, some as
far-flung as Tokyo or as mundane as Milwaukee. In L.A., his clothes
were sold at I. Magnin and Neiman Marcus. As his loyal customers
gathered and gushed, Blass would assume his charming but gruff
demeanor and delight in calling the most powerful women "dames,"
"gals" and even "broads." They loved it.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the first great American gentlemen of fashion,"
said John Fairchild, founder of trade journal Women's Wear Daily. "He
had the taste, the charm, the wit and the devilry, which made him a
very interesting personality."</TE>
<TE>   Virtually every mention of the designer lists his unusual
combination of skills, including, "a good eye for design, a shrewd
business brain and a personality that charms the birds off the
trees," according to Linda Watson's "Vogue: Twentieth Century
Fashion" (Carlton Books, 1999).</TE>
<TE>   Though he was undeniably one of the world's best-known designers,
a feat aided by his many licensing agreements, he aimed to stay out
of the spotlight. "He was the most 'unfashiony' fashion designer,"
Fairchild said. "He never talked about his own clothes." Nor would he
take credit for his many generous charitable acts, said Fern Mallis,
director of 7th on Sixth, which produces the New York fashion shows.</TE>
<TE>   Mallis recalled that on one occasion, during a Council of Fashion
Designers of America meeting, Blass learned that a talented young
designer, Christian Francis Roth, couldn't afford the organization's
dues. "Bill thought that was ridiculous that he should be barred,
since he had so much talent," Mallis said. "The next day, the check
came over from Bill to pay the membership dues."</TE>
<TE>   He also had to be cajoled into taking credit for the gift, and
later, talked into accepting the CFDA's Humanitarian award, Mallis
said. Blass quietly paid to have fresh bouquets of flowers sent to
the AIDS care unit at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Natiello
recalled, and frequently wrote checks to designers and friends who
had fallen on hard times. A devoted reader, he was famous for
donating $10 million to the New York Public Library in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Practical and self-deprecating, Blass was never swayed by his own
fame and accomplishments. "For years my clothes were considered very
wearable, and I used to think that was a terrible insult," Blass once
said. "But there's no point in making clothes nobody wears."</TE>
<TE>   New York designer James Purcell, who was twice considered to
replace Blass after his retirement, was a young designer when he
first met the fellow Hoosier. "I remember most his advice not to lose
my Midwestern sensibility," Purcell said. "That surprised me coming
from such a sophisticated, urbane man."</TE>
<TE>   Yet by embracing good taste and restraint, Blass limited his
impact on modern fashion. Though his lifelong publicist, Eleanor
Lambert, called him "one of the loveliest men who ever lived," she
also offered an unvarnished appraisal of his work. "He was a fine
designer," she said, "but he never changed fashion. He made things in
the spirit and mold of the time, but he did them his way."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he remained in high regard among colleagues and industry
leaders. "Bill Blass' designs were very sexy and trim," said Vogue
editor in chief Anna Wintour. "They had wonderful lines and were
never vulgar. He was very clever at making ritzy-looking clothes out
of simple fabrics, and simple-looking clothes out of rich ones."</TE>
<TE>   Blass was eventually replaced by Steven Slowick and Lars Nilsson
after his retirement and aimed to stay in the background, though he
assisted with two books about his career; a retrospective at Indiana
University in Bloomington will debut in October.</TE>
<TE>   Ever private, Blass requested no funeral or memorial.</TE>

<LD>Ft. Vancouver started out as an outpost for an English fur trading
company but became a place where weary travelers found supplies,
medicine, even a school. It was the anchor of one of the largest
towns in the West. Today, Ft. Vancouver National Historic Site in
Vancouver, Wash., is a world-class archeological site and a great
place to learn about American life in the 1800s.</LD>
<LD>   On a walk around the park you can learn how archeologists study
pieces of clothing, clay jars and old buildings to figure out how
many people lived there and what they did. You can meet real
archeologists and talk about what they have found in the park. You
can even help dig up historic pieces and learn how studying old trash
can teach you about everything from how a room was painted to the
toys with which kids played. School groups can join planned
activities that show what life was like in the past.</LD>

<TE>   * While traveling to the Northwest along the Oregon Trail,
firewood was scarce, so settlers burned buffalo chips--the dried
droppings left on the prairies by millions of bison.</TE>
<TE>   * People traveling West who could not afford covered wagons
sometimes put their household items in wheelbarrows and pushed them
all the way from Missouri to Oregon.</TE>

provided the settlers with food or other aid in getting through their
trip, or traded food for other goods.</TE>

<LD>Urban legends are anecdotes so engaging, entertaining,
anxiety-affirming or prejudice-confirming that people repeat them as
true, even when they are not.</LD>
<LD>   Their journalistic equivalent is the pithy "poll result" or "study
finding" that so neatly encapsulates a social ill or point of
partisan contention, that no talk-show host or stump orator can
resist them. Ronald Reagan, for example, was so notoriously fond of
dubious anecdotes that some of his close associates speculated that
his years as an actor had rendered him utterly incapable of passing
up a good line.</LD>
<LD>   But that provenance-be-damned attitude hardly ended with the Great
Communicator's retirement.</LD>
<TE>   CNN political analyst William Schneider, an authority on opinion
polling, believes that highly charged political issues or campaigns
are particularly prone to spin off fictional study results, which
then take on a life of their own.</TE>
<TE>   "Social Security is a classic case," Schneider said. "There is a
political legend that a 'recent' poll, which is never specified,
showed that more young Americans believe Elvis is alive than expect
to collect a Social Security check when they retire. Over the past
few years, every conservative on earth and every Republican
politician in Washington, including President Bush, has referred to
this finding. They all just say, 'polls or studies show this,' but
none ever has. Republicans go on citing this bogus finding
because--whether it's true or not--it has great value as political
currency."</TE>
<TE>   This week, it was possible to watch another such journalistic
legend being born. On Tuesday, the Wall Street Journal's Leisure &amp;
Arts page published an article excerpted from a speech delivered one
week ago by Bruce Cole, chairman of the National Endowment for the
Humanities. In it, he decried the fact "that Americans do not know
their history" and reflected on this collective amnesia's particular
perils in the wake of Sept. 11, whose memory he fears may even now be
fading.</TE>
<TE>   All fair points. But in their support Cole cited "a nationwide
survey recently commissioned by Columbia Law School," which he said,
"found that almost two-thirds of all Americans think Karl Marx's
dogma, 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his
needs,' was or may have been written by the Founding Fathers and was
included in the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Clear; helpful; alarming. Plausible, even, given the popular taste
for altruistic banality. Everything, in other words, that a good
rhetorical point should be. The problem is that is not what the
Columbia poll found.</TE>
<TE>   It is, however, what the May 29 press release announcing the
poll's findings said. In fact, its first paragraph read: "Almost
two-thirds of Americans think Karl Marx's maxim, 'From each according
to his ability, to each according to his needs' was or could have
been written by the framers and included in the Constitution,
according to.... "</TE>
<TE>   Note the subtle shift from the release's "could have been written"
to Cole's--or his speech writer's--"may have been written."</TE>
<TE>   The announcement's second paragraph quotes Columbia Law School
professor Michael Dorf on the troubling implications of the Marx
"finding" and points the reader to a column the professor has written
for a legal Web site, Findlaw.com. In that column, Dorf wrote that
"The survey found that 69% of respondents either thought that the
United States Constitution contained Marx's maxim, or did not know
whether or not it did."</TE>
<TE>   That is further yet from Cole's recitation of the finding.</TE>
<TE>   But what of the actual poll, which asked a national sample of
1,000 respondents five yes-or-no questions about the Constitution?</TE>
<TE>   In response to the query about whether the Marxist maxim is
contained the document, 35% said yes; 31% said no; and 34% said "they
did not know."</TE>
<TE>   Was Dorf entitled to conflate the yes and don't-know respondents
into a single alarming two-thirds? No, according to Schneider. "That
is a total misinterpretation of what people mean when they tell a
pollster they don't know. When people say that, they mean 'I have no
idea.' Choosing to interpret it as meaning 'I think it may be true or
could be true' simply is misleading on the writer's part."</TE>
<TE>   What it does do is add pungency to a finding Schneider described
as "wholly unremarkable. It's not at all surprising that about a
third of respondents thought that is in the Constitution. Most
people, for example, think the right to privacy exists in the
Constitution, when no such right is enumerated anywhere in it."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, what is remarkable--and far more relevant at the
moment--about the Columbia poll is what it shows Americans do know
about their Constitution:</TE>
<TE>   Fully 83% of the respondents recognized the first sentence of the
14th Amendment as part of the national charter, while 60% correctly
understood that the president may not suspend the Bill of Rights in
time of war. More than two-thirds were aware that Supreme Court
justices serve for life.</TE>
<TE>   The only other question the respondents flubbed was whether the
court's overturning of Roe vs. Wade would make abortion "illegal
throughout the United States." Less than a third of those polled
correctly said it would not, since state statutes guaranteeing choice
would remain on the books.</TE>
<TE>   These facts notwithstanding, it is a safe bet that radio and
television talk-show hosts, editorial writers and all the rest of the
usually suspect soon will be sighing, groaning, sneering and raging
over Americans' inability to distinguish the thought of James Madison
from that of Karl Marx. How long will it be before public education,
the liberal media, humanism and single-parent families are blamed?</TE>
<TE>   Commentary pages are the soft underbelly of American journalism.
Their writers, however self-interested, are held to a different,
which is to say lower, standard of proof because of their presumed
expertise. In fact, they are responsible for regularly injecting
false information of this sort into our public discourse. In the
marketplace of ideas, as on the used car lot, caveat emptor still is
the best policy.</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   Leo Braudy is university professor and Bing Professor of English
at USC and the author of, among other books, "The Frenzy of Renown":
"I've just finished a book on war and masculinity, which will be
published by Knopf next spring. We're really in the endgame,
discussing illustrations and the bibliography, though it doesn't yet
have a title. But all of a sudden--at some point in this process--the
right title will appear.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a study that stretches from the Middle Ages to the present
and explores the way in which perceptions of masculinity have changed
in relation to major wars, to changes in war technology, to changes
in the idea of the state and how it wages wars and to changes in
attitudes toward sexuality. Essentially, I'm tracking the metamorphic
quality of ideas of masculinity. The result is a counter to ideas of
innate masculinity or, for that matter, of innate femininity. Though
not polemical, it's an anti-sociobiological work because it attacks
the overemphasis on the innateness of human nature by stressing its
changeability.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially, it's about the both/and rather than the either/or
nature of our existence."</TE>

<DH>Not only flashy on the court, Lakers celebrate their
victory in leather 'Three-Peat' jackets designed by L.A.'s Jeff
Hamilton</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOOTH MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was impossible to ignore the multihued jackets Shaq, Kobe and the
rest of the Lakers donned immediately after their victory Wednesday
night in the NBA Finals. The 2002 Championship "Three-Peat" leather
jackets, emblazoned with the L.A. skyline and palm trees, were
created by L.A. designer Jeff Hamilton, who has done hundreds of
custom jackets for sports teams, as well as for celebs such as
Madonna, Michael Jackson and former President Bill Clinton.</LD>
<LD>   On an airplane back from New Jersey, Hamilton was unable to be
reached Thursday. But according to his Web site, he got his start in
1983. With $20,000 in his pocket, he started designing, manufacturing
and marketing the Guess? Jeans for men line. He expanded into leather
apparel in the years that followed gaining fame for his NASCAR-style
jackets, emblazoned with hand-cut appliques of licensed logos. The
Laker championship jackets ($1,800) are available at NBA.com.</LD>
<LD>   A Bridal Bonanza</LD>
<TE>   First niece and cover model Lauren Bush can now add fashion
designer to her resume. The 17-year-old face of Tommy Jeans has
designed a wedding gown to be auctioned on Bridesmade.com. Can a
clothing line be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   The online site for reselling bridal gowns, bridesmaids' dresses
and accessories enlisted Bush to sketch her dream gown. A dressmaker
created an actual dress for the charity auction, to be held online
June 20 to July 4.</TE>
<TE>   Other items offered as part of the celebrity bridal bonanza:
Christina Applegate's Reem Acra--designed dress, Liza Minnelli's
wedding cake (replicated in a smaller version for the highest
bidder), and a fireworks display orchestrated by the Grucci family,
as seen at the Brad Pitt-Jennifer Aniston wedding. Finding a location
is your problem.</TE>
<TE>   Inspired by Dreams</TE>
<TE>   Many people dream about romance or unfinished work, but Jennifer
McGarigle thinks about flowers in her sleep. The floral designer's
latest nocturnal inspirations turned into arrangements fashioned to
look like purses.</TE>
<TE>   "I had this dream that I was in a hotel in New York and I saw
these flowers being delivered," she said. "I think a lot of great
design ideas come from dreams."</TE>
<TE>   Not inspired by any specific handbag design, each brightly colored
flower purse ($75 to $125) is an original, said the Fashion Institute
of Design and Merchandising grad, who owns Floral Art in Venice.
Peonies, garden roses, orchid blossoms and more are arranged on top
of a purse-shaped wood form that's covered in fabric and trim.
"People love them," McGarigle said. "Especially people who are into
fashion."</TE>

<LD>Dear Fashion Police: As a favor to a buddy of mine, I recently
allowed his daughter to spend the day with me at my office. I'm an
advertising executive and she's studying advertising and business in
college.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe I'm getting old and out of touch with youth culture, but
when she arrived she was dressed very casually and had glitter all
over her face. At first I was going to say something, thinking maybe
she had accidentally run into a huge jar of glitter and hadn't gotten
it all off, but I asked a female co-worker who said that's the style
now.</LD>
<LD>   Am I hopelessly out of the loop, or is it OK to wear faded jeans
and have a sparkly face when spending the day at someone's office?</LD>
<TE>   --GUY WHO DOESN'T</TE>
<TE>   UNDERSTAND KIDS TODAY</TE>
<TE>   Dear Guy: You are hopelessly out of the loop, but don't worry. All
of us can't be in every loop all the time. It would make everyone too
loopy.</TE>
<TE>   Casual clothes and glittery makeup are indeed popular among teens
and young women, but it is not appropriate for every situation,
especially an office. On the appalling scale of 1 to 10 we rate this
an 8, but we can't really say we're that surprised.</TE>
<TE>   We find that young people in high school and college have little
or no guidance when it comes to dressing for important occasions such
as job interviews, internships, receptions, etc., when wearing the
right clothes can make a huge difference in creating a good
impression. There's no question that kids are extremely
fashion-savvy, gobbling up and spitting out the latest trends with
frightening speed. Teens and twentysomethings are every marketer's
dream, and that's evident in the stores, magazines, commercials,
films and TV shows that cater to them.</TE>
<TE>   However, ultra-trendy looks don't cut it for every situation, and
that's one thing a lot of young men and women haven't learned. We
know this because we've witnessed it firsthand, and also because of
the letters we get from parents asking how to plan their children's
wardrobe for things like first jobs. We don't blame parents for not
knowing--so many "rules" in fashion change in the blink of an eye
that they're often at a loss for information. And we're not
suggesting that that young people dress ultraconservatively or
suppress any sense of style--just have respect for the people around
them.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been nice if this young woman had been prepped for
her visit by a teacher or counselor at school. Since you're of the
male persuasion and a family friend, we're glad you didn't take her
aside and say, "Wipe that junk off your face." It wasn't your place,
and the admonishment would have only embarrassed her.</TE>
<TE>   Our advice for those on the brink of the real world is to realize
that the fashion rules you played by in high school or college do not
always apply. Every job and every office has its own dress code, so
be aware of it and plan accordingly. Do some research. If you're not
sure what to wear, ask your boss. Even if you're just visiting an
office for a day, dress up. This is not hanging with your friends.
Who knows, you might be applying for a job there someday, and believe
us, they'll remember what kind of impression you made the first time
around.</TE>
<TE>   Dear Fashion Police: I love to hike, but I can't find women's
hiking boots in narrow sizes. Please help me find a pair in time to
break them in for my trip to Alaska!</TE>
<TE>   --SNOWBOUND</TE>
<TE>   Dear Snow: Hiking boots in narrow widths aren't that easy to come
by, but we discovered a few pairs. At Zappos.com we found some Dexter
Klondike boots; they're $99 (www.zappos.com, or call [888] 492-7767).</TE>
<TE>   Campmor.com offers a Dunham Trail Triumph mid-weight boot for
$139.99 and a Vasque Sundowner MX2 backpacking boot for $209.99
(www.campmor.com, or call [800] 525-4784).</TE>
<TE>   You also might try finding a reputable backpacking supply store in
your area and explaining your size situation. Most boots come in
medium widths, but they can vary a bit, and the salesperson might
know the right boot and layered sock combination that does the trick.</TE>

<HD>A Salon Works on Tresses and All Sorts of Stresses</HD>
<DH>Each month, Venice locals flock in for free health remedies
and entertainment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN CARPENTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No one at the Slave hair salon in Venice got a haircut Tuesday night.
Instead, they sipped martinis, listened to live bands, watched a
belly dancer and got their backs cracked. It was hair salon as
theater; it was Ruby Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   From the outside and on its surface, the event's concept seems, at
best, confused, but to the Venetians who've been crowding in to this
Abbot Kinney Boulevard salon the second Tuesday of every month, it's
just another extension of this artistic, eclectic community where
anything can and does go.</LD>
<LD>   For the record, Reuben De La Casas, whose idea it was to create
Ruby Tuesday, does cut hair. The 44-year-old hairdresser with a
ponytailed beard, and muscles courtesy of Gold's Gym, has been
snipping and styling for 26 years. He's been at Slave for the last
nine months, and running Ruby Tuesdays there since January.</LD>
<TE>   It is, beyond hair, a "health and wellness beauty soiree" designed
to introduce people to nontraditional medicines in a relaxed and
festive environment.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in an area that's very nonconventional and artistic," said
Joshua Hammond, Slave's 22-year-old co-owner. "Every day's like a
blank canvas. We just like to have something for people to rally
around."</TE>
<TE>   This Tuesday, there were men in jeans with tanks, T-shirts and
motorcycle jackets. Women in miniskirt suits and peasant blouses,
teetering in their wedge heels. And children in fuzzy pink jackets
hanging around their parents' necks.</TE>
<TE>   All of them were milling around the cavernous, red-walled salon
with cathedral ceilings and exposed wooden rafters. Some chatted with
their friends, snacking on chips and dips. Others sat on leopard skin
couches and black vinyl stylist chairs, watching De La Casas ring a
girl's head with curling wands that made her look like Princess Leia.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want your back adjusted, give Ken Gee a try. He's
upstairs. He's great. It's free," De La Casas said, referring to the
chiropractor giving complementary spinal alignments to anyone who was
game.</TE>
<TE>   "There are free martinis in the back," he added, rolling a final
wand into the silky brown hair of a pretty girl in pink.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to take hairdressing beyond hairdressing.... By holding
these forums, I think we can bring out people's beauty and also
[reduce their fears] of trying new and innovative health care," said
De La Casas, who became involved with alternative medicine six years
ago after suffering a mild stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Seth Litton, 24, came to Ruby Tuesday with a friend who was
singing at the event. He had been there once before and enjoyed the
free drinks and snacks, but this time he thought he'd visit the
chiropractor.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to try something that I'd never done before," said
Litton, a sandy-haired studio manager who lives in Culver City. "It
kind of scared me, the idea of someone cracking my back, but that's
why I kind of wanted to face it and see what it was about."</TE>
<TE>   In an upstairs alcove, the chiropractor instructed Litton to lie
face down on the black table. After running a hand down his spine, he
then asked Litton to roll on to his side and cross both his arms and
legs. Laying one hand on Litton's shoulder, the other on his hip, he
pressed down quickly. The crack of Litton's spine was audible, even
over the finger cymbals and flutes accompanying the belly dancer
performing below.</TE>
<TE>   Sharnai Wiggins, a 29-year-old hairdresser from Ontario, came to
Ruby Tuesday with her boyfriend, who works at the barbershop across
the street. "It's good networking. Other stylists come out, see
what's new, what's hot," said Wiggins, who held an empty plastic
martini glass as she flipped through racks of hip-huggers and
camouflage bikinis in the clothing store at the front of the salon.</TE>
<TE>   "They also have really cute clothes," said Wiggins, who was
wearing a single-strap Lakers tank top she made her herself.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a punk band wailed in the background. Its singer: one
of Slave's hairdressers. Just like the other band and belly dancer
who had performed before her.</TE>
<TE>   At Ruby Tuesday, something new was happening every 20 minutes. The
multi-sensory extravaganza served as both an outlet for the
hairdressers' other talents and a means of keeping the crowd
entertained. "People's attention spans these days are very short.
You've got to keep things going," said De La Casas.</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what kept Lexy Smith at the event. "I thought I'd
do a drive-by 'hi,' but I've actually stayed more than 25 minutes. I
have ADD. It kept my attention," said Smith, a 24-year-old comedian
from Hollywood who has one green eye and one blue one.</TE>
<TE>   Previous Ruby Tuesdays have featured an acupuncturist,
nutritionist, herbalist, detox specialist and Indian head masseuse.
Next month, a fire-eater will perform.</TE>
<TE>   "It really embodies what we're all trying to do as artists here
and why we all pay the ridiculous rent," said Alec Ravencruz, the
27-year-old owner of a film production studio just off Abbot Kinney.
"This street, you're plunging a little bit more into the New York,
Melrose inner-city vibe.... It feels like a community. I walk up and
down the street every day. That's how I came here. Just saying hi to
Helen, the girl who works here. She was like, hey, come by tonight."</TE>

<LD>Riley looked at his best friend, Sam, as they stood at the
electronics counter at Baldwin's Department Store. "This must be what
I was meant to buy," said Riley. "A second CD player that you can
use, Sam. Just like you said." Sam smiled.</LD>
<LD>   "That'll come to $31.49, with tax," said the salesclerk.</LD>
<LD>   "But I've only got a $30 certificate," said Riley.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll loan you the $1.49. Pay me back tomorrow," said Sam.</TE>
<TE>   "OK, I guess," said Riley. He reached in his pocket for the
certificate. "But where is it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Dummy. Did you lose the gift certificate?" asked Sam.</TE>
<TE>   "Dummy?" said Riley. "I guess I am a dummy." Riley put the CD
player back on the shelf and ran toward the escalators.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are you going?" Sam called after him.</TE>
<TE>   "To get my gift," said Riley.</TE>
<TE>   Riley got the gift certificate from his father in the toy
department. Then he walked to the cashier carrying a cassette player
decorated with purple bunnies. "We can play music on it," said Riley
to his little sister, Wendy. "I've got some cassettes from when I was
a little kid that we can both listen to."</TE>
<TE>   "Please and thank you, Riley!" bubbled Wendy.</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Johnson's most recent book, "We Play Music," was published
this spring by Lee &amp; Low Books Inc. This story will be on The Times'
Web site at www.latimes.com/kids. A new, five-part story begins on

<DH>The state's first official poet laureate plans to bring
verse to the people</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Speaking by phone to poet Quincy Troupe, not quite 24 hours after his
accession to poet laureate status, is almost like listening not to
the man, but to a syncopated sample of his voice.</LD>
<LD>   Call waiting interrupts his momentum so frequently that his voice
begins to take on a rhythmic texture--the stutter step of ska, with
maybe an echo of dance hall reggae or garden variety rap. Oddly like
his poetry itself.</LD>
<LD>   " ... That was my agent. Sandra Dijkstra. She wanted me to mention
her name," chuckles Troupe, letting out a long 5-p.m. sigh, though
it's barely 10 a.m. "I told my wife, Margaret, it would be a day like
this."</LD>
<TE>   Click. It's NBC. It's Tavis Smiley. It's Fox.He finds a little
space to let his thoughts unfurl. "I'm just sponging this all up," he
says, "like Miles Davis would do with music. Like I do with poetry.
I'm just sponging this all up."</TE>
<TE>   All of it--being named California's first official poet laureate
this week, the attendant fanfare, the ribbing from his friends--has
caught him a little off guard, perhaps since he came to the notion of
filling this post somewhat reluctantly. "I just didn't know what it
was going to entail," he says, "so my first reaction was knee-jerk. I
thought I would have to read poems to every opening of the Assembly
and do that type of number," he explains, the worry still a touch
evident in his voice. "I'm very serious about poetry. I think poetry
is a sacred art. A great art and very powerful. I didn't want to
sully it...."</TE>
<TE>   But a friend and colleague, Hugh M. Davies, director of the Museum
of Contemporary Art, San Diego, where Troupe runs a reading series,
pressed the issue, talking up the possibilities. Finally Troupe
relented.</TE>
<TE>   Samples of his poetry were mailed off to Sacramento. The field
narrowed from 50 candidates to three--Troupe, Diane Di Prima and
Francisco X. Alarcon. "I didn't want to politic for this job,"
recalls Troupe. "I didn't want to call people and say: 'Vote for me!
Vote for me!' I wanted them to make a choice on merit. About the
poetry. Not about the politicking."</TE>
<TE>   So Troupe remained focused on his work: finishing and shipping off
a new draft of a screenplay adaptation of his Miles Davis
reminiscence, "Miles &amp; Me" (University of California Press, 2001) to
actor Don Cheadle and trying to put the finishing touches on a
collection, "Transcircularities: New and Selected Poems" (Coffeehouse
Press). "That's a name I made up," he cracks. And, of course, he had
to attend to his teaching at UC San Diego, where he is professor of
creative writing and teaches American and Caribbean literature.</TE>
<TE>   As the selection process neared its end, he was called in for an
interview with two of the governor's representatives--Lynn Schenk,
chief of staff, and Michael Yamaki, appointment secretary. Bottom
line: "They wanted to know about my work with Larry Flynt ... " says
Troupe, who was the editorial director of Code magazine, a style and
culture quarterly aimed at African American males that Flynt
published in the mid-to-late-'90s. "Basically, they wanted to know if
there was anything about that that might embarrass the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "There were no nekkid women," says Troupe. And other than a few
pointed editorials he wrote about then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush
("I've always been at odds with his political agenda") and a
high-voltage poem titled "A Response to All You: 'Angry White Men,' "
written in answer to an tirade by an Aryan Nations member he'd
glimpsed on television, he figured there was nothing else to declare.</TE>
<TE>   The governor must not have been too distressed by either.</TE>
<TE>   Troupe collected his new title and kudos Tuesday at a noisy
celebration in Sacramento. He traded stories with Gov. Gray Davis and
talked art and literature with his wife, First Lady Sharon Davis, who
presented him with the honors. And, before the ink was dry on his
fancy proclamation, had already started mapping out plans for
illustrating, advancing and underscoring the importance of poetry in
all of its forms.</TE>
<TE>   "In a way it surprised me that they selected me. Most people, when
they talk to me, know about me as a performer. I have a great
performing style. That comes from coming up with people like [Amiri]
Baraka, Wanda Coleman, Ojenke, Allen Ginsberg, Jayne Cortez. I used
to read at those political rallies, so you had to have a style that
projected to a huge crowd. 25,000, 10,000 people or 500. So you get a
style that is larger than the room you're in."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe, 62, is himself larger than life. Tall, with an elegant
drape of dreadlocks, he was a basketball star at 14 and is the son of
a baseball player. Later, his literary life propelled him around the
world, to Haiti, Ghana, Nigeria. He is a two-time winner (1994 and
1995) of the World Poetry Bout in Taos, N.M., a stand-up poetry
competition that anoints a yearly Heavyweight Champion of Poetry. But
he is probably most famous for his form-bending, bestselling book,
"Miles: The Autobiography" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988) as well as a
segment on the 1989 PBS documentary "The Power of the Word," hosted
by Bill Moyers.</TE>
<TE>   "What bothers me is that people think that this is where it all
ends. The performance. But I write villanelles, sonnets, haiku,
sestinas. I know what poetry is on the page. What disturbs me is that
when people identify me, they think of me only as a performance poet
because I've evolved this reading style--a style that comes from a
certain place," he explains, "so when I write a villanelle, I'm going
to put an African American wack on it. It will still be technically
correct, but maybe it has more kind of syncopation in it."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe, a music fanatic, says he's absorbed many influences, like
his style mentor Miles Davis, who taught Troupe to take it all in and
make it his own; Pablo Neruda, Amie Cesaire, Baraka, Sharon Olds. "I
grew up in the church, but I couldn't sing the normal way," he says.
"I couldn't seem to sing in tune, but I had the passion." He put that
passion into poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Though he grew up in St. Louis, in a home without art on the walls
and few options except the temptations on the streets, his mother
read him Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Dickinson, and those voices threw
open doors to his imagination. "I grew up listening to Miles Davis
and Johnny Ace. Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Sly Stone and James Brown, the
Temptations. The whole range of people. African Americans grew up in
a different kind of way. But that does not mean that I don't think
about what's going on the page. I'm always thinking about metaphor.
Simile. Iambic pentameter. Internal rhyme. I don't think I have to
assimilate into the white, Episcopalian way of writing--say, like
John Ashbery--whom I really admire, which is also valid, but that's
not me."</TE>
<TE>   That's why Troupe's very high profile as the state's poet laureate
may begin to unbutton the formal notions of poetry. That will happen,
he expects, through the lives he plans to touch and the new and
different places, over the next two years, he plans to take poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Having spent his time on the East Coast and then, in the 10 years
he's lived here, slowly shedding his own East Coast snobbery makes
him better suited, he figures, for handling the elitism of some East
Coast literati. "I know how they all think--that East Coast-centric
thinking--because it was how I used to think."</TE>
<TE>   But living in California--away from East Coast friends, influences
and the syncopation of the streets and of daily life--has influenced
the way he writes and even thinks about the page. It's changed him,
he says, in more ways than he could have expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd absorbed all of New York. The urban rhythms there. But, like
Miles, when he would talk not just about style, but about different
styles, it made sense. When I was 20, I was writing this way, 30
another, 40 another kind of piece. So as the person evolves, the work
is the mirror of the evolution. Over time I could see my voice
changing. I wanted it to change. It finally got to the point where I
could write these longer lines. They've become the tone to carry me
into my 70s. Not that I can't slip back into that N.Y. flip if I want
to. But I have evolved another voice that can carry me into my
old.... Hold on a sec--"</TE>
<TE>   It's Tavis Smiley on the phone again.</TE>
<TE>   "Tavis is not used to waiting."</TE>
<TE>   Troupe, from his new post, figures he can share his history,
context and perspective widely. "I would like to take poetry to lunch
at all of the major corporations around California. Movie studios.
Newspapers. Churches. Places poetry has never been. Maybe for a half
an hour or 20 minutes at lunchtime. Maybe before Laker basketball,
Dodger baseball. After the national anthem. We bring them in and
people can begin to understand that poets can and will be part of the
culture. Poets. Not rappers. Poets," he underscores.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to see poetry stitched through every fabric of
Californians' lives so that we can appreciate the power and the glory
and wisdom of poetry. And not laugh at it. The engineer at Caltech
needs to understand that his life needs balance, that art is just as
difficult as putting together a mathematical equation. It's just as
important to the culture as being a Hollywood actor or being a
doctor. To become a really great poet is just like going to med
school. I'll push that too. I'm a prime example how all of this can
make you human."</TE>
<TE>   Spreading that message will make him a bit of pied piper, like
Miles with his transforming horn. "I work with a lot of musicians,"
says Troupe. "They may open up a little space for me, and I can make
it up on the spot. But if you're not prepared, sometime you fall on
your face," he cautions, teasing out his metaphor. "If a musician ...
takes[s] the floor out from under you, then you go into a free fall.
You have to catch yourself, pull a parachute at that point." In other
words, "You've got to come back to the text."</TE>

the humidity. What he was actually using was a psychrometer, a

<HD>Lucent Expects Revenue Drop</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Company estimates a 10% to 15% decline from
previous quarter. Shares fall 5%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lucent Technologies Inc. said Thursday that it expects its
third-quarter revenue to decline by 10% to 15% from the previous
quarter, falling short of Wall Street expectations that revenue would
match the previous three-month period. Its shares were down 5% when
the New York Stock Exchange closed.</LD>
<LD>   Lucent's guidance indicated its revenue would be $2.99 billion to
$3.17 billion for the April-June period, down from $3.52 billion in
revenue recorded in its second quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had been
expecting Lucent would report revenue of $3.52 billion for its third
quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "Service providers continue to constrain their capital spending to
conserve cash, which is clearly affecting our top line," said
Patricia Russo, Lucent's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the drop in revenue, Lucent said it expects its bottom
line to improve from a second-quarter pro forma loss of 20 cents a
share. That loss included a tax charge of 6 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it's still too early to know if its third-quarter
results would improve on the loss of 14 cents a share excluding the
tax charge in the second quarter. Analysts were looking for a loss of
10 cents a share in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Murray Hill, N.J.-based Lucent declined 15 cents to
$2.80.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter earnings are scheduled to be released July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said restructuring efforts
remain on track and Lucent will reach an employee base closer to
50,000 by the end of its fiscal year Sept. 30.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said it expects a return to profitability during
fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Lucent makes switching equipment and other high-tech products for

<HD>Sprint Says It's Adding Fewer Customers</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprint Corp. said customer growth at its PCS Group wireless unit, the
fourth-largest in the U.S., will be 10% to 15% below forecasts this
year because of competition.</LD>
<LD>   Overland Park, Kan.-based Sprint had forecast 3 million new
subscribers for 2002 and hadn't given a second-quarter outlook. It
said it would add 300,000 new users in the period ending June 30,
compared with analysts' forecasts for 550,000 to 725,000. Sprint
attributed the shortfall to more stringent credit checks and price
cuts by rivals. The company added 725,000 new users in the first
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Sprint also reduced planned capital spending at Sprint PCS by $100
million, to $3.3 billion, and it cut capital spending projections for
the FON Group, which includes local and long-distance operations, by
$100 million, to $2.6 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Sprint shares fell 81 cents to close at $14.29 on the New York
Stock Exchange, before the updated forecast was announced. In
after-hours trading, shares that track the performance of the PCS
Group declined 43 cents to $5.99, and fell as low as $5.85.</TE>

<LD>Adobe Systems Inc., the largest maker of software for publishing and

million, or 25 cents, a year earlier. Sales in the period ended May
31 declined 7.8% to $317.4 million.</LD>

million, missing the average analysts' estimate of $328.2 million.
Its shares fell as low as $34.41 in after-hours trading after the

<LD>Liquid Audio Inc., an Internet music distributor, said it agreed to
buy closely held Alliance Entertainment Corp., a distributor of video

<HD>Schwab Expects to Miss Earnings Forecasts</HD>
<DH>Brokerages: Investors cut back on trades amid accounting
scandals and corporate crises. New assets show uptick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charles Schwab Corp., a leading online and discount brokerage firm,
Thursday said it will miss the Wall Street consensus earnings
estimate for the second quarter as investors shied away from trading
amid accounting scandals and corporate-governance concerns.</LD>
<LD>   "May was a fairly weak month, and that softness has continued,"
Schwab Chief Financial Officer Chris Dodds said.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco-based brokerage probably will post earnings of 7
cents or 8 cents a share for the second quarter, Dodds said. Analysts
on average expect Schwab to earn 9 cents a share in the quarter,
according to research firm Thomson Financial/First Call. Investment
bank Robertson Stephens Wednesday cut its estimate to 7 cents a share
in anticipation of a profit warning Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Schwab (ticker symbol: SCH) in May processed an average of 125,300
revenue trades a day, down 25% from a year ago and down 6% from
April. Revenue trades exclude mutual fund trades.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab took in $4.6 billion in new client assets in May, raising
total client assets to $833.2 billion. The brokerage firm brought in
$2.6 billion in net new assets in April.</TE>
<TE>   May's net new assets figure was "a credible if not spectacular
number," Dodds said. Schwab did see an "uptick" in new assets after
unveiling its new stock-grading system May 16, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab, which has nearly 8 million customers, is looking to profit
from the negative scrutiny surrounding Wall Street research by
touting the merits of its own system, which is free of investment
banking ties.</TE>
<TE>   It has started grading stocks on a scale of A to F, based on data
from a number of sources.</TE>
<TE>   However, not everyone was impressed with the early results of
Schwab's marketing campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhat disappointingly, given the firm's recent ad spending
ramp-up, new account openings were the lowest since September 2001,"
Salomon Smith Barney analyst Guy Moszkowski said in a research note.
He also said he would be lowering his quarterly earnings estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Schwab shares fell 39 cents to $11.15.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of full-service brokerages such as Lehman Bros. (LEH) also
fell Thursday after a Merrill Lynch analyst reduced earnings
estimates for the group.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco Stocks Rise as</TE>
<TE>   Regulators Clear IPO</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tyco International Ltd. rebounded strongly Thursday
after the company received approval to shed its lending unit and
announced plans to streamline operations.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco said it is selling its operational headquarters building and
moving employees to a nearby site as part of an effort to save $125
million a year. About 115 corporate staff positions will be cut,
Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz said Thursday. The company also
is getting rid of all its aircraft and consolidating, moving or
closing several other corporate offices.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Tyco (TYC), based in Bermuda but run from Exeter, N.H.,
rose $3.65, or 36%, at $13.80.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the changes came after a day full of up and down news at
Tyco on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Bright news that a plan to shed Tyco's lending unit is moving
forward was dimmed when the company said issues arising from the
indictment of its former chief executive will be studied by the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco said Wednesday that it would cooperate with the investigation
of former chief L. Dennis Kozlowski's activities at the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday, Tyco got some good news when the SEC approved the
registration of Tyco's lending unit, CIT, for an initial public
offering. The approval clears a major hurdle for Tyco, though it is
still unclear when the deal will be completed, said a source with
knowledge of the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Tyco said it expected the IPO to reap as much as $5.8 billion,
down from the $7.2 billion the company had earlier said it hoped to
get. Tyco paid more than $9 billion for CIT last June.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to use the proceeds to pay down about $27
billion in debt. Tyco had hoped to complete the deal by the end of
June, but said recently that could be delayed a week. Tyco's bonds
rallied Thursday on hopes the IPO will help the conglomerate pay down
debt.</TE>
<TE>   A conference call with investors was scheduled for today.</TE>

<HD>GM Passes Ford in Plant Efficiency for First Time</HD>
<DH>Autos: U.S. car makers remain behind their Japanese
competitors. Nissan again tops list.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Motors Corp. surpassed Ford Motor Co. in auto manufacturing
efficiency last year, while Nissan Motor Co. remained the most
efficient auto manufacturer in the U.S. for the eighth straight year,
according to a respected annual report on automotive productivity
released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first time GM ranked ahead of Ford in efficiency since
the Harbour Report began studying auto plants in the U.S. in 1989,
and is the latest good news for GM, which has been improving in the
last year in quality, profitability and market share.</LD>
<LD>   Nissan was followed by Honda Motor Co., Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
and Toyota Motor Corp. in average assembly efficiency in terms of
hours required to build a vehicle.</LD>
<TE>   Nissan scored 17.92 hours per vehicle versus 19.78 hours for Honda
and 21.82 hours for Mitsubishi.</TE>
<TE>   GM, Ford and Chrysler Group trailed the major Japanese
manufacturers, but closed the gap, a key step for GM to increase
profitability and for Ford and Chrysler to get back into the black.</TE>
<TE>   GM, the world's largest auto maker, improved 6.8% in efficiency to
26.1 hours per vehicle in 2001, and for the first time had one of its
factories win the title of most efficient plant in North America.</TE>
<TE>   GM's Oshawa No.1 plant in Ontario, Canada, which assembles the
Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo, displaced Nissan's assembly factory
in Smyrna, Tenn., which produces the Altima sedan, Frontier pickup
truck and Xterra SUV.</TE>
<TE>   GM's performance "is a direct result of the company's commitment
to building a strong foundation in lean manufacturing," said Ron
Harbour, president of Harbour &amp; Associates in Troy, Mich., which
publishes the report. "At long last the company's systems and
processes are paying off in improved quality, higher productivity ...
and lower costs."</TE>
<TE>   Nissan's Smyrna plant lost its most-efficient status because of
the changeover to a newly redesigned model of the Altima mid-size
sedan and thus the slip was expected, said Harbour Vice President
Laurie Felax.</TE>
<TE>   "Nissan is very, very strong but launched a vehicle, and when
you're in a ramp-up your number takes a negative hit," Felax said.
"We'll probably see them come back next year to better than before
the launch."</TE>
<TE>   It was the eighth straight year that Nissan was the most efficient
auto manufacturer overall, leading the continuing Japanese dominance
of automotive productivity.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese are pioneers of lean production, relying on
just-in-time delivery of parts to minimize expensive inventory,
ergonomically designed work stations designed to reduce wasted
movement, and workers who perform numerous tasks at once.</TE>
<TE>   "The best Japanese transplants tend to build their production
systems from the [worker] out: They focus on making the most of the
[workers'] time and effort, not to waste it," said John Shook, a
former Toyota lean production team member and now an automotive
manufacturing consultant in Ann Arbor, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi improved its productivity 8.6% to surpass Toyota and
become the third most efficient auto maker.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsubishi started a turnaround plan in 1999 that included
eliminating jobs and streamlining production at its plant in Normal,
Ill.</TE>
<TE>   Honda was the most efficient auto maker for engine production,
followed by Toyota.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota was No. 1 in stamping efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Honda had the highest profit per vehicle last year at $1,661,
followed by Nissan at $1,289 and Toyota at $1,182, the Harbour Report
said.</TE>
<TE>   It said GM had a marginal profit per vehicle of $337, while
DaimlerChrysler lost an average $1,679 per vehicle and Ford lost
$1,913.</TE>

<HD>CKE Reports Loss Due to Hardee's Write-Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CKE Restaurants Inc., owner of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's hamburger
chains, Thursday announced a large quarterly loss stemming from a
write-off due to a reduction in the value of its Hardee's
acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   However, both Carl's Jr. and Hardee's reported continued sales
growth at restaurants open at least a year, a key industry measure.
And excluding the write-off, CKE said it would have made a profit of
$13.2 million, or 23 cents a share.</LD>
<LD>   "All in all, it was a pretty positive quarter," said Anton
Brenner, an analyst at Roth Capital Partners.</LD>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara-based chain said it lost $162.6 million, or
$2.84 a share, in its fiscal first quarter ended May 20, with the
$175.8-million Hardee's charge. That compares with a loss of $37.1
million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell nearly 8% to
$434.5 million because of the sale and closure of under-performing
stores.</TE>
<TE>   The company bought Hardee's four years ago for about $760 million.
The chain's value has declined because annual sales at a typical
outlet are lower than in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Carl's Jr. reported a same-store sales hike of 4.2%, its fifth
consecutive quarter of comparable sales growth. Hardee's sales
increased at a more modest 0.3%. The strong performance of such
premium products as the Six-Dollar Burger helped drive sales, the
company said.</TE>
<TE>   Hardee's, which has dramatically scaled back its product
discounting, contributed $2.4 million to operating income, excluding
some charges. That contrasts with an operating loss of $4.5 million
in the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   CKE, which recently has diversified its holdings by snapping up
the Green Burrito and La Salsa Mexican chains, said it expects to
earn 57 cents to 60 cents this year, before so-called goodwill
write-offs like the one related to Hardee's.</TE>
<TE>   CKE shares increased 10 cents on Thursday to close at $10.10 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Disney Plans Companywide Boost for ABC</HD>
<DH>Media: The firm will promote the sagging TV network's fall
lineup at theme parks and other units in an attempt to prop up its
ratings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In hopes of boosting ratings at its foundering ABC television
network, Walt Disney Co. will aggressively cross-promote its new fall
TV lineup at Disneyland, in feature films, at retail stores, on
record labels and even in ESPN Zone restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy comes as Disney works to improve the performance of
ABC, which has fallen from first place to third in the ratings in the
last two years as the network failed to find replacement hits for
"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."</LD>
<LD>   Disney typically has relied on ABC to promote its movies and theme
parks, not the other way around.</LD>
<TE>   "It's really an effort companywide to support ABC in a way that
we've never done before," said Chris Curtin, vice president of
corporate synergy and special projects for Disney. "This is a major
priority for the company."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's prime-time ratings are down more than 20% this season, which
has contributed to Disney's stock price falling 30% in the last year.
Disney's shares Thursday fell 11 cents to close at $21.04 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner and President Bob Iger have
said turning around ABC is their top priority.</TE>
<TE>   With seven new shows on its fall schedule, ABC must attract
viewers early.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly it's a priority to fix ABC," said David Miller, a media
analyst with Sanders Morris Harris in Los Angeles. "They just don't
want to leave any stone unturned."</TE>
<TE>   Cross-promotion is common among other large media companies, such
as Viacom Inc., whose CBS network and billboard operations heavily
tout the company's MTV and Nickelodeon channels.</TE>
<TE>   No amount of promotion, however, will substitute for hit shows,
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "It couldn't hurt, but at the same time ABC is more like a
sailboat in the middle of an ocean waiting for a breeze to blow it,"
said Jordan Rohan, an analyst with Wit SoundView. "There's nothing
ABC can do to promote a fall lineup if viewers don't like their
shows."</TE>
<TE>   Disney's ESPN Zone restaurants, which draw more than 4 million
visitors annually, will feature coasters with information on "Monday
Night Football" games and will play video clips touting upcoming
shows such as "Push, Nevada" and a late-night program starring
comedian Jimmy Kimmel.</TE>
<TE>   At Walt Disney World in Florida, summertime visitors at the ABC
Theatre within the Disney-MGM Studios park will see a live show with
network stars promoting some of the fall programs. Disneyland in
Anaheim also will present an ABC Fall Preview Weekend with network
stars in a parade and a live performance by sitcom star Jim Belushi
and his band.</TE>
<TE>   Disney's Buena Vista Music Group will include inserts in CDs,
promoting ABC's "Happy Hour" block of family programs. And Disney
Online will run a promotion this summer that will give viewers a
behind-the-scenes look at the making of a comedy called "8 Simple
Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter" starring John Ritter.</TE>

<HD>DirecTV's Access to Cable Shows to Stay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Broadcast satellite operator DirecTV and other rivals of the nation's
big cable TV operators won a victory Thursday when federal regulators
extended a government law granting cable competitors equal access to
cable TV programming.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-1 vote by the Federal Communications Commission was an
acknowledgment by the agency that a decade of government effort to
stimulate greater competition in the cable-TV market had fallen
short. Cable giants such as AT&amp;T Corp., Comcast Corp. and AOL Time
Warner Inc. still control more than 70% of the subscription video
market, the FCC said.</LD>
<LD>   Congress did not have that outcome in mind when it approved the
1992 Cable Act establishing the prohibition on exclusive programming
contracts. Lawmakers had hoped to stimulate more video competition by
preventing cable operators such as AOL Time Warner, which own
affiliated video production units, from entering into exclusive
programming with other large cable operators.</LD>
<TE>   But the majority of FCC commissioners--resisting intense lobbying
by large cable operators--extended the ban for another five years,
saying a continuation of the exclusive contract ban was necessary.
They want to ensure that regions of the country that lack cable
service and only have access to satellite video from companies such
as Hughes Electronics' DirecTV and EchoStar would be able to receive
the Home Shopping Network, QVC and the estimated 40% of other cable
television shows now controlled by major cable operators.</TE>
<TE>   "The record supports the order's conclusion that the prohibition
against exclusive contracts continues to be necessary to preserve and
protect competition and diversity," said FCC Commissioner Kevin J.
Martin, a Republican.</TE>
<TE>   The industry was divided over the FCC vote. One leading cable TV
trade blasted the FCC decision. But representatives of smaller cable
TV operators and satellite TV executives voiced support of the FCC's
action.</TE>
<TE>   "The program access rules were instrumental in helping DirecTV
obtain programming to compete with entrenched cable operators, and
today's decision by the FCC preserves competition and diversity in
the multichannel TV marketplace," said Roxanne Austin, DirecTV's
president.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Brenner, a senior vice president at the National Cable &amp;
Telecommunications Assn., said his group was "disappointed that the
FCC chose not to eliminate this regulatory relic.... Today, nearly
every customer has several video distributors to choose from, and
nearly one-quarter of subscription television customers choose
[direct broadcast satellite] over cable."</TE>
<TE>   Pay TV competition has grown over the last decade. Satellite
operators such as EchoStar and DirecTV now control about 20% of the
market with 18 million subscribers.</TE>

<HD>Heinz to Spin Off Some Businesses</HD>
<DH>Food: Firm will own 75% of Del Monte, which will add tuna
and pet brands in $1.8-billion stock deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>H.J. Heinz Co. will unload such sagging brands as StarKist Tuna and
9Lives cat food in a $1.8-billion deal with Del MonteFoods Co. that
gives Heinz shareholders a 75% stake in Del Monte, the companies said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The stock deal, valued at $1.8 billion, allows Heinz to focus on
its core ketchup and frozen food products while increasing Del
Monte's presence on supermarket shelves.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Del Monte also will get Heinz's Kibbles 'n
Bits, College Inn broths and domestic baby food business in the deal
that will more than double its sales to $3 million.</LD>
<TE>   Del Monte, the largest U.S. distributor of canned fruits and
vegetables, will keep its company name but run the newly acquired
Heinz divisions out of Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Some 5,000 Heinz employees, or about 11% of Heinz's global work
force, will transfer to Del Monte. Fewer than 100 jobs will be
eliminated, Heinz said.</TE>
<TE>   The spinoff follows similar moves by consumer and food companies
such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and ConAgra Foods Inc. to dump
under-performing assets.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Wall Street had long expected the Heinz divestment, which
the company disclosed as it reported an 18% increase in quarterly
earnings that matched forecasts. Investors and analysts have pressed
the company to improve earnings and crank up its stock price, which
has lagged peers.</TE>
<TE>   "It gets rid of some problems for Heinz, but at a real cost," said
David Nelson, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston, noting the
deal will cut Heinz's dividend and near-term earnings. "The deal
emphasizes that Heinz hadn't done enough to stop canned pet food and
canned tuna from going down."</TE>
<TE>   Investors were skeptical as well. Heinz shares fell $2.05, or
4.9%, to $39.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   There may be a silver lining, though. Several analysts said the
deal might position Heinz for an eventual buyout by a bigger food
company.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz said the transaction was designed to make the company more
flexible and profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "Some companies go for volume; we are going for growth," Heinz
spokeswoman Debbie Foster said.</TE>
<TE>   For Del Monte, the deal is a gamble because it now will go against
baby food giant Gerber Products Co. and stiff competition in the pet
food market, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Del Monte said it is planning to invest about $100 million of
merger-related savings on advertising over three years in an attempt
to breathe new life into the old Heinz brands.</TE>
<TE>   "The question is, 'Do these businesses have underlying strength?'
" Del Monte Chief Executive Richard Wolford told Reuters in an
interview. "I think they do."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Del Monte--which targeted earnings growth of 9% to 11% a
year--rose 90 cents, or 8.4%, to $11.65.</TE>
<TE>   Del Monte is buying the Heinz assets by issuing 157 million new
Del Monte shares to Heinz shareholders--worth $1.8 billion based on
Del Monte's share price of $11.65. Heinz shareholders, who will get
0.45 Del Monte share for each Heinz share they own, will control
74.5% of the new Del Monte company.</TE>
<TE>   Del Monte also will assume about $1.1 billion in debt in the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Heinz said earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter rose 18% to
$219.4 million, or 62 cents a share, as sales rose 4.8% to $2.57
billion, fueled by stronger sales from frozen food brands acquired
this year.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Drop on More Uncertainty</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Investors question economic recovery on news of a
decline in retail sales. Dow falls 114.91 points.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks took another nose dive Thursday when a drop in retail sales
and reduced outlooks for financial companies prompted investors to
again question the pace of the economic recovery. The Dow Jones
industrial average had its second triple-digit loss in three days.</LD>
<LD>   Selling accelerated in late afternoon after several attempts at a
rebound failed.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a lot of uncertainty out there. When you have
uncertainty, the market drifts," said Michael Murphy, head trader at

<TE>   The Dow closed down 114.91 points, or 1.2%, at 9,502.80. The drop
erased all of the Dow's 100.45-point advance Wednesday, when stocks
rose in a late burst of buying driven by technical factors and a
rumor--which proved unfounded--of pending positive earnings news from
Microsoft.</TE>
<TE>   The broader market also declined. The Nasdaq composite index fell
22.26 points, or 1.5%, to 1,496.86, offsetting the 21.94 points it
gained Wednesday. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index stumbled 10.70
points, or 1.1%, to 1,009.56.</TE>
<TE>   Losers led winners by a 5-to-3 margin on the New York Stock
Exchange and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq. Trading was active.</TE>
<TE>   A big pull on the market Thursday came from a 0.9% decline in
retail sales for May. It was the largest drop in six months and was
due to decreased spending on cars and clothes, the Commerce
Department said.</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales also were weaker than many analysts expected, and
overshadowed a positive economic report from the Labor Department,
which said wholesale prices fell 0.4% in May. Analysts were expecting
the producer price index, which measures inflation pressures before
they reach consumers, to rise by 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Doubts about the economy, and concerns about a third year of
decline on Wall Street, have been big factors in the market's
protracted slide. Stocks are headed for their fourth straight weekly
decline, with the Dow having dropped 8% since May 17. Nasdaq has
fallen 14% since then, while the S&amp;P has lost nearly 9%.</TE>
<TE>   All three indexes also are inching closer to the three-year lows
they hit in the first week of trading after the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks--8,235.81 for the Dow, 1,423.19 for Nasdaq and 965.80 for the
S&amp;P 500. Falling through those levels would be a major blow to
investors, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "People are hesitant to make big bets," Murphy said. "People say
we will be lucky to end [the year] up 5%."</TE>
<TE>   Bond prices rallied on the economic reports, with the yield on the
benchmark 10-year Treasury bond sliding from 4.96% on Wednesday to
4.90%--its lowest since the end of February.</TE>
<TE>   Oil rose $1 a barrel to $25.64 as oil workers threatened to strike
in Norway, a major non-OPEC producer.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news Thursday:</TE>
<TE>   * Retailing and auto stocks fell after Thursday's retail sales
report. Wal-Mart Stores slid $1.80 to $56.50, while DaimlerChrysler
sank $1.71 to $45.69.</TE>
<TE>   * Financial issues fell after Merrill Lynch reduced its yearly
earnings estimates for the sector. Morgan Stanley fell $1.46 to
$42.29, while Lehman Bros. stumbled $1.34 to $58.02. Merrill fell 6
cents to $38.70.</TE>
<TE>   * Among gainers, ImClone regained 25 cents to close at $8.08, as a
House panel held a hearing on allegations of insider trading. ImClone
has lost 90% of its value since December due to the rejection of a
leading drug prospect by the Food and Drug Administration. Former
Chief Executive Samuel D. Waksal was arrested Wednesday on charges he
used inside information to sell ImClone shares just before the FDA's
rejection.</TE>
<TE>   * Doubts about the trustworthiness of corporate America's
accounting also were evident when Omnicom slumped 12% on questions
about its accounting practices. Omnicom fell $7.66 to $54.62 even as
Wall Street analysts defended its accounting methods.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Bans Chicken from 7 U.S. States</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexico has quietly banned chicken and other poultry imports from
seven U.S. states, including California, after meat was found to be
contaminated with a type of avian influenza not found in Mexico, its
poultry union said.</LD>
<LD>   The move would not have a big effect on California producers,
industry officials said, because they mainly sell fresh chickens and
export less than 2% of their 250 million chickens.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, veterinarians said, because California's strain of the
disease isn't very virulent, it poses little threat to the state's
flocks or humans.</LD>
<TE>   But industry officials fear that a prolonged ban could lead
producers in other states to dump excess product in California,
depressing prices paid to local producers.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, [the ban] won't last long," said Bill Mattos of the
California Poultry Federation. "Mexico is a big market for the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico banned chicken and poultry products from Virginia, West
Virginia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Maine, Texas and California,
beginning June 11, the poultry union said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The union said that products from those states were found to
contain "subtypes of avian influenza that do not exist in Mexico,
which represent a very high risk to Mexican poultry."</TE>
<TE>   Veterinary specialists in California said that since avian
influenza is predominantly spread from live chicken to live chicken
through feces, the chances of spreading infection were remote.</TE>
<TE>   Excluded from the ban are poultry products that have received
thermal treatments, such as chicken sausages.</TE>
<TE>   Reuters was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Suit Filed Against Record Firms</HD>
<DH>Music: Two consumers accuse the groups' copy-protected CDs
of being defective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two California consumers have filed a class-action lawsuit against
the major record companies, arguing that copy-protected CDs are
defective products that should not be allowed on the market.</LD>
<LD>   The case pits Universal Music Group, EMI Music Publishing, BMG
Entertainment, Sony Music Entertainment Inc. and the Warner Music
Group against the law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach,
which is famed--or, in some quarters, infamous--for bringing
class-action cases that seek huge financial penalties.</LD>
<LD>   The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday,
seeks either to block the discs or require warning labels identifying
them as inferior in quality and hazardous to computers.</LD>
<TE>   Copy-protected discs use a variety of electronic techniques to
deter digital copying. Some can't be played at all on computers and
other devices with CD-ROM drives, while others try to confuse the
drives so they can't extract the disc's data.</TE>
<TE>   "If you use an Apple computer, you can't even get the disc out of
the tray. It requires the time and cost of taking the computer into a
repair shop and having it removed that way," said plaintiff attorney
Nicholas Koluncich, who is representing his sister in the case. "At
the very least, the labels should make sure they sell a product that
actually works."</TE>
<TE>   Cary Sherman, president of the Recording Industry Assn. of
America, called the case "frivolous" and insisted that the music
labels have every right to use encryption technology to protect their
intellectual property from theft.</TE>
<TE>   "Music creators have the right to protect their property from
theft, just like owners of any other property," Sherman said. "Motion
picture studios, and software and video game publishers have
protected their works for years, and no one has even thought to claim
that doing so was inappropriate, let alone unlawful."</TE>
<TE>   All of the major record companies have been testing these
technologies, often by selling copy-protected discs without
disclosing the protection.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of one soundtrack album released by Universal,
none of the labels have done any full-scale releases in the United
States of copy-protected discs--at least not that they've
acknowledged. The main reason is that the discs still have
compatibility problems, particularly with computers that don't run
Microsoft's Windows software, DVD players and high-end sound systems
that use CD-ROM drives.</TE>
<TE>   The case was brought by Matthew Dickey of Huntington Beach and
Elizabeth Koluncich of San Bernardino, who had purchased
copy-protected audio discs and either were unable to make back-up
copies of the tunes, or had problems using the discs on their
personal computers. They are seeking unspecified financial damages,
and an injunction that would force the discs off the market.</TE>

<HD>Pleasant Care Settles Federal Worker Suit</HD>
<DH>Labor: Nursing home operator to pay $1.1 million to 937
current, former employees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON LEE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An operator of more than three dozen nursing homes has agreed to pay
$1.1 million in back wages and penalties to settle a federal
complaint alleging labor violations involving hundreds of workers.</LD>
<LD>   Labor Department officials said Thursday that La Canada-based
Pleasant Care Corp. and its subsidiaries will provide $910,000 in
unpaid minimum wages and overtime pay to 937 current and former
employees. Some of the penalties were assessed for violating
child-labor laws and record-keeping rules.</LD>
<LD>   Pleasant Care and its principal owner, Emmanuel Bernabe Sr., did
not return telephone calls Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Federal labor officials, who conducted a 10-month investigation of
37 Pleasant Care facilities in California and Arizona, said the fines
and wage recoveries were among the largest for a single nursing home
company.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is somewhat symptomatic," said Jerry Hall, deputy
regional director of the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division in
San Francisco. "This is an industry that we have put on our radar
screen. It's a low-wage industry that has problems."</TE>
<TE>   Pat McGinnis, executive director of California Advocates for
Nursing Home Reform in San Francisco, said it was unusual for skilled
nursing facilities to be fined such a large amount for labor
violations. She said the action should trigger an investigation by
state health officials to determine whether labor practices affected
the delivery of care to residents.</TE>
<TE>   According to state health inspection records provided by McGinnis'
group, about half of Pleasant Care's 32 facilities in California
exceeded the average number of complaints and deficiencies found for
nursing homes in the state. One Pleasant Care facility in Santa Cruz
last year received 109 complaints and state officials recorded 84
deficiencies. McGinnis said that on average a nursing home received
five complaints and 16 deficiencies last year. A manager at the Santa
Cruz facility said Thursday that she could not comment on the
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Labor officials said most of the Pleasant Care workers who were
shortchanged were cleaning crew, administrative staff and licensed
vocational nurses. Hall said those workers typically earned $7 to $10
an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Some workers, he said, put in as many as 30 hours of overtime
without receiving the time-and-half wages as required by law.
Investigators reviewed labor records from July 1999 to July 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said Pleasant Care also was fined for allowing two
15-year-old students to put in excessive hours and another
15-year-old to work in the kitchen.</TE>

<HD>Jurors Hint at Conviction for Andersen</HD>
<DH>Courts: Panel's question to judge suggests disagreement
over who the guilty party is within the accounting firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Jurors in the Arthur Andersen trial asked the judge Thursday if they
could convict the firm even if they couldn't agree on which Andersen
executive violated the law.</LD>
<LD>   The question suggested that at least a bloc of jurors is leaning
toward conviction. But U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon did not
give an answer, saying she would need to research case law on the
issue.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin said the jury's note, "on its
face, would look to be discouraging" to the defense. But he said the
jury's question and subsequent requests for other testimony indicated
jurors still are sorting through the evidence.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors had resumed their deliberations Thursday after telling
Harmon the day before that they failed to reach a unanimous decision.
Harmon had read a special instruction, called an Allen charge, asking
the panel to renew efforts to reach a verdict in hopes of avoiding a
mistrial.</TE>
<TE>   The panel raised the conviction question in a note to Harmon on
Thursday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "If each of us believes that one Andersen agent acted knowingly
and with a corrupt intent, is it for all of us to believe it was the
same agent?" the jury asked in the first of a series of notes. "Can
one believe it was agent A, another believe it was agent B, and
another believe it agent C?"</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said federal courts already have settled the question in
its favor, but prosecutors disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as they agree on the bottom line, it isn't necessary for
them to agree on the same actor," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew
Weissmann.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said, "They do have to unanimously agree that at least one
person had corrupt intent."</TE>
<TE>   Several legal experts said there is no clear legal precedent,
sending the case into uncharted territory.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia University Law School professor John C. Coffee said the
jury note indicates at least some jurors believe Andersen committed a
crime but disagree on the individual responsible.</TE>
<TE>   If Harmon rules that the panel has to agree that a single
executive carried out the crime in order to convict, Coffee
suggested, some jurors could change their minds to reach unanimity.</TE>
<TE>   "The prosecution should be encouraged by the fact that it seems
that the disagreement is the issue of who the guilty party is within
the firm," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the law, a partnership such as Andersen can act only through
its executives, or "agents." In order to convict the firm, the jury
must find that "one or more" executives "corruptly persuaded" others
to destroy Enron-related files and also possessed the intent to
conceal them from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have identified four Andersen executives as the agents
who acted to persuade others: in-house attorney Nancy Temple and
Houston-based partners David B. Duncan, Thomas Bauer and Michael
Odom.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, fired by the firm in January, has pleaded guilty to a
separate obstruction charge and testified in the case. Temple and
Bauer each invoked their rights against self-incrimination and
refused to testify. Odom was not called as a witness by either side.</TE>
<TE>   If the jury fails to reach a unanimous decision, a mistrial would
be declared and prosecutors said they would retry the case.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said that earlier this week, as the jury's deliberations
stretched on, his team had "talked ourselves into" the possibility
that they might obtain an acquittal in a case once considered by many
to be unwinnable for Andersen. But Thursday, Hardin said he had begun
to consider asking Harmon to declare a mistrial on the grounds that
the jury has reached an impasse.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an option.... [It] doesn't mean she'd grant it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors also sent out two notes asking to see a videotape exhibit
and to have certain testimony read back to them by a court reporter.</TE>
<TE>   The panel said it wanted to review a videotape of an Oct. 10
training session in which Odom encouraged executives to comply with
the firm's document-retention policy, which calls for discarding
drafts and papers deemed unnecessary for Andersen's final audit
files.</TE>
<TE>   Odom made the presentation to about 80 people, about 10 of whom
worked on audits of Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also asked to hear again portions of the testimony of
Duncan and Andersen partner Amy Ripepi.</TE>
<TE>   At least six jurors scribbled furiously on notepads as the court
reporter recited testimony from Ripepi, the head of Andersen's
accounting-specialist team, who said on the witness stand that she
participated in a hastily arranged conference call Oct. 20 in which
senior executives discussed a letter of inquiry that Enron had just
received from the SEC. Ripepi said in-house lawyer Temple advised
executives on the call to "follow the policy."</TE>
<TE>   The court is expected today to read Duncan's testimony on a
discussion he had in mid-October with former Enron Chief Accounting
Officer Richard Causey about Enron's third-quarter losses. The jury
also is expected to hear Duncan's testimony about an Oct. 23
conference call in which executives discussed Enron's possible
restatement of past earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon could rule on the crucial question asked by jurors when
court resumes today.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether a ruling in favor of the prosecution would provide a
solid basis for appeal, Hardin said, "The fact that we may have very
valid points on appeal doesn't do me much good right now."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jerry Hirsch contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Sony Wins Rights to Cantinflas' Works</HD>
<DH>Courts: Ruling caps nine years of legal wrangling over
rights to slapstick movies starring the late Mexican film legend.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled that Sony Corp.'s Columbia
Pictures owns the lucrative rights to 34 films starring the late
Mexican film legend Cantinflas instead of the comedian's son.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge William J. Rea's decision Tuesday caps nine
years of rancorous legal wrangling over rights to the slapstick
movies--some that are 60 years old--that still generate millions of
dollars each year.</LD>
<LD>   Rea also ruled that Cantinflas' son, Mario Moreno Ivanova, who
lives in Mexico City, must turn over to Sony any film negatives the
family has. The Culver City studio also can recoup $4.6 million in
film royalty payments it placed in an escrow account while the case
was being tried.</LD>
<TE>   "Our position was vindicated," said David A. DeJute, Sony
Pictures' assistant general counsel. "All we wanted from the
beginning was to have the contract that his father signed honored."</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, Cantinflas, whose real name was Mario Moreno Reyes,
signed with Columbia Pictures, and the studio began distributing his
mad-cap film capers throughout Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Crowds adored Cantinflas, who satirized the police, politicians
and the social elite. He wore a tiny mustache, a grubby vest and a
rope for a belt, which sometimes failed to keep up his pants.</TE>
<TE>   But audiences were most enchanted by the way the ragamuffin
character could talk his way out of any scrape with streams of
nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   Cantinflas' most popular film in the U.S. was the 1956 adventure
"Around the World in 80 Days," also starring David Niven, which won
the Oscar for best picture.</TE>
<TE>   Cantinflas still is so popular that Sony spent untold millions for
attorneys to clear the clouds over the film rights; it now is free to
continue distributing his films.</TE>
<TE>   "These films are really the exception to the rule that films get
less valuable as they get older," DeJute said. "Cantinflas is revered
in Mexico in an "I Love Lucy" or Charlie Chaplin way."</TE>
<TE>   But since Cantinflas' death nine years ago, the rights to his
films have been contested.</TE>
<TE>   Courts in Mexico are still trying to unravel whether Cantinflas
bequeathed his estate's film royalties to his son or to a nephew. The
nephew claims his inheritance stems from an agreement signed by
Cantinflas two months before he died.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles case did not delve into who was Cantinflas' heir,
leaving that to the Mexican courts.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit that Rea decided was originally filed by the nephew
against Columbia Pictures and Cantinflas' son. Columbia eventually
settled with the nephew, leaving the son and Columbia bickering over
the worldwide film property rights.</TE>
<TE>   The judge sided with Columbia's position that it acquired the
rights to the most popular and profitable of the Cantinflas films
during a convoluted series of transactions in the 1960s involving
partnerships in the Grand Cayman Islands, Liechtenstein and a British
holding company to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno's attorney, Timothy C. Riley, had argued that Columbia
failed to prove that Cantinflas signed away his film rights because a
key document contained no signatures.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge ruled that Cantinflas signed relevant agreements
transferring film ownership, and witnesses during the three-week
trial provided convincing testimony that the unsigned agreement had
been approved by all parties.</TE>
<TE>   Riley said the judge's ruling was "odd" and that he would appeal
the decision.</TE>
<TE>   Cantinflas' son contends that he still owns newer copyrights on
some films after they had fallen into the public domain.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not dealing with used cars," Riley said. "These are films,
intellectual property from Mexico."</TE>
<TE>   But Rea ruled that Columbia "was the owner of all rights, title
and interest" to the most lucrative Cantinflas films, not his son.</TE>
<TE>   So, Sony said, any copyright claims would be moot. "We're not in
the business of wasting money establishing double rights when single
rights will do just fine," DeJute said.</TE>

<HD>Wholesale Prices, Retail Sales Fall</HD>
<DH>Economy: May sales decline is sharpest in six months. Some
economists predict the Fed will further delay raising interest rates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retail sales in May suffered their sharpest decline in six months
while wholesale prices fell as energy costs tumbled, according to
government data released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The reports led some economists to predict that the Federal
Reserve will further delay increasing interest rates, amid mounting
signs of a weak economic recovery and fears of a consumer spending
slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   Although investors drove down retail and other stocks in reaction
to the data, the sluggishness in retail spending last month may have
had more to do with weather than with consumer weakness, some
analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Unusually cool temperatures throughout the northern part of the
country, particularly in the first three weeks of May, along with a
wetter-than-usual spell in the Midwest, dampened sales of summer
clothing, building supplies and other outdoor merchandise, retailers
said.</TE>
<TE>   This month, sales at giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and
Target Corp. are up more than expected, those retailers say.</TE>
<TE>   "The weakness in retail sales raises the specter that consumers
are pulling back," said Michael Niemira, an economist and retail
analyst with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. "I just don't
think so. I think it's a pause after the strength of April numbers
that was accentuated by weather."</TE>
<TE>   Retail sales dropped 0.9% in May from the month before, three
times the drop economists had expected and the biggest decline since
November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   May sales, however, were 1.9% above the same period a year ago,
according to Commerce Department data.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding decreases in auto and gasoline sales, retail sales fell
0.1% in May, the first decline since September, the Commerce
Department said.</TE>
<TE>   "However, these declines followed a surge of 1.2% in April," said
Steven Wieting, Salomon Smith Barney's senior U.S. economist. "In
addition, early June chain store sales data have been very
encouraging."</TE>
<TE>   Still, based on Thursday's retail sales data, economists at Lehman
Bros. pushed back until December their forecast for when the Fed will
start raising interest rates. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. switched its call
on the first increase to November. Both firms had been forecasting a
September rate rise. The Fed's policy-setting committee next meets
June 25-26.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in another sign of a lack of inflationary pressures,
wholesale prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers--as
measured by the producer price index--unexpectedly dropped 0.4%. That
was the largest drop since December and followed a decline of 0.2%
the previous month, the Labor Department said. Analysts were
expecting a rise of 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   Energy prices dropped 2.3%, pulled down by a 9.6% fall in gasoline
prices. Food prices declined 0.2%.</TE>
<TE>   Even when volatile food and energy prices were stripped out, the
report showed inflation was under control.</TE>
<TE>   So-called core prices were flat, also lower than the 0.1% climb
expected by analysts. That followed a 0.1% rise in April.</TE>
<TE>   The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for state
unemployment benefits rose less than expected last week, suggesting
companies are under less pressure to eliminate jobs.</TE>
<TE>   States received 390,000 initial jobless benefits claims in the
week that ended Saturday, up from a one-year low of 384,000 in the
week before last, the Labor Department said.</TE>
<TE>   That marked the second straight week below 400,000, which hasn't
happened since mid-March.</TE>
<TE>   Among retailing stocks, Wal-Mart fell $1.80 to $56.50 and Target
dropped $1.33 to $38.88, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News and Reuters were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Soaring Fares, Lingering Fears Put European Travel on Hold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The dollar's recent weakening against the euro isn't helping to boost
overseas leisure travel this summer, but tour operators say sky-high
prices--and some residual 9/11 flying fears--are keeping more
vacationers grounded. Bargain fares to Europe are simply too hard to
find.</LD>
<LD>   "You have to really hunt and peck around to get a decent rate
right now," said Jerry Greenberg, president of Baldwin Travel Bureau
in Los Angeles, which specializes in foreign vacations. "And by
decent I mean, there's nothing bargain about it."</LD>
<LD>   Americans still are crossing the Atlantic, but they are doing so
in smaller numbers. About 13% fewer Americans will be traveling to
Europe this summer, and those going are probably experienced
travelers who have few qualms about flying and are unwilling to put
off their vacations for any reason, travel agents said.</LD>
<TE>   Summer travel overall is expected to be flat this year, with air
travel down 14% from last year, according to a forecast by the Travel
Industry Assn. of America. More Americans will be hitting the
road--rentals of cars and RVs are up 25% and 40%, respectively--as
vacationers plan shorter trips that are closer to home.</TE>
<TE>   A mix of fearful fliers, higher summer fares, fewer Europe-bound
flights since Sept. 11 and, to a lesser extent, a stronger euro all
are contributing to fewer tourists heading for Europe. The dollar has
dropped about 9% against the euro since Feb. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The European Travel Commission, the New York-based tourism bureau
representing 31 nations, expects about 5.5 million Americans to fly
to Europe from May through the end of September this year, compared
with 6.35 million for the same period last year and a record 6.71
million in 2000. With each tourist spending about $2,000, the
decrease represents about $1.7 billion in lost revenue for Europe's
tourism industry.</TE>
<TE>   "It could take another few years to get back to our 2000 levels,"
said commission spokesman Neil Martin.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't forget that the economy is a huge factor in all of this
too.... We need several things to turn around for us to fully
recover."</TE>
<TE>   Those who are heading across the pond tend to be repeat customers
or veteran travelers, according to the nation's travel agents. The
American Society of Travel Agents estimates that group tour
bookings--especially for escorted bus trips within Europe preferred
by fledgling tourists--are down 15% this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The fear factor remains for first-time travelers, yes, because
they are not savvy enough to understand how safe it is to go," said
Mamia Reynolds, an agent at TraveLeaders in Irvine. "The clients
we're getting for Europe have been there many times before, they know
the drill and they are ready to fly across the ocean, no problem."</TE>
<TE>   But some still have to get over "air fare shock," said Tom
Livermore, chief operating officer of TraveLeaders, a national
network of 30 agencies and 600 employees. A round-trip, coach ticket
to Paris in July booked within the last month, for example, is
running about $1,100--far more than many vacationers were counting
on, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "To think you're going to get a $400 fare to Europe now, forget
about it," said Livermore, noting that his company's bookings to
Europe are off as much as 20%. "Trust me, there is no inventory in
the cheap-fare category."</TE>
<TE>   At Delta Air Lines, the largest U.S. carrier to Europe with 38
daily departures, spokesman Anthony Black said international fares
are bringing in more revenue than domestic bookings, but neither is
near what they were a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although Delta cut some international flights post-Sept.
11--mostly from Los Angeles to Japan--the airline has since added two
new Europe-bound flights: from Atlanta to Milan, Italy, and from
Cincinnati to Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Air fares are in line with last year's rates because there are no
low-cost carriers to contend with and because Europe remains popular
among seasoned travelers, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers who made reservations late last year or earlier this
year may have snagged some of the low fares that have since
disappeared, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "With domestic travel, people have all kinds of options," he said.
"But when you want to go to Europe, you won't be driving or taking
the train."</TE>
<TE>   To get the most for their money this year, many travelers are
opting to stretch out their vacations in Europe from the typical
seven or 14 days to a month or more.</TE>
<TE>   Charlene Levin of Laguna Beach said her son bought her and her
husband tickets to Paris this summer as a Christmas present, and the
couple decided to extend the trip for most of July to cover jaunts to
Rome; Florence, Italy; and Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised and disappointed that the prices weren't
lower," said Levin, adding that her son paid about $7,000 for the
first-class tickets to Paris and they threw in $2,000 for the
additional flights within Europe. "So we decided if we're going to
spend that much, we better make the most of it."</TE>
<TE>   As for the strengthening euro--the dollar is buying about 94
euros--Levin said it was a nonissue.</TE>
<TE>   "We'd like it to be better, sure," she said. "But we're not going
to wait for the exchange rate to improve so we can take a vacation of
a lifetime."</TE>

<HD>Ex-CEO of ImClone Refuses to Testify</HD>
<DH>Securities: Samuel Waksal asserts 5th Amendment right. His
brother does speak to House subcommittee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The brother of former ImClone Systems Inc. Chief Executive Samuel D.
Waksal testified Thursday that he phoned Waksal with bad news about
the firm's flagship product the day before family members began
dumping shares in allegedly illegal insider trading.</LD>
<LD>   Harlan W. Waksal, who replaced his older brother as ImClone's CEO
last month, told a House subcommittee he informed Samuel Waksal on
Dec. 26, 2001, that the Food and Drug Administration was about to
reject the company's application to market a widely touted
experimental cancer drug. By the time the rejection was announced
publicly two days later, causing the share price to plummet and
outside investors to suffer big losses, Waksal family members already
had sold $10 million of stock.</LD>
<LD>   The younger Waksal's testimony appeared to corroborate key
elements of the government's criminal case against Samuel Waksal, who
was arrested Wednesday by FBI agents on eight charges of securities
fraud, conspiracy and perjury.</LD>
<TE>   Free on $10 million bail, Waksal appeared before lawmakers shortly
before his younger brother. He declined to answer questions,
asserting his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said the
ImClone stock sales provide more evidence of ethical lapses within
the executive suites of corporate America. In addition, they said the
alleged offenses call attention to problems with the FDA's process
for fast-tracking promising new treatments for life-threatening
illnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The saddest story is not about investors losing money," said Rep.
W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), the committee's chairman. "What we see
is a drug development and FDA review system that is not necessarily
serving the best interests of the people of America and its cancer
victims.... We've got to fix this system."</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin and others said they still hold out hope for Erbitux, the
bioengineered drug that ImClone wants to market as a treatment for
advanced colon and rectal cancer. But it appears that an FDA decision
is, at best, months away. Many terminal cancer patients were led to
believe that approval was probable in early 2002, lawmakers said.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA refused to consider ImClone's application Dec. 28, citing
flaws in clinical trials of Erbitux. ImClone officials said they hope
to resolve those issues and believe the drug still holds promise for
cancer victims who do not respond well to other treatments.</TE>
<TE>   "If ever a drug was a good candidate for fast-track, Erbitux was
it," said Harlan Waksal, who was chief operating officer of ImClone
at the time of the FDA rejection. He took over as CEO after his
brother resigned. "As the company's new chief executive officer, I am
absolutely committed to getting this drug approved."</TE>
<TE>   New York-based ImClone was founded in 1984 by Samuel Waksal, an
oncologist and researcher turned entrepreneur. Waksal, 54, has become
a prominent Manhattan socialite, cultivating relationships with
luminaries in business, politics and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The future of ImClone depends largely on the success of Erbitux,
which may slow the spread of cancer by blocking a growth factor in
some tumors. But the drug's vindication would not resolve the
problems faced by Samuel Waksal and possibly other family members.</TE>
<TE>   Harlan Waksal said he was informed Dec. 25 that FDA rejection of
ImClone's request was a virtual certainty. But he waited until the
next day to phone his brother, who was vacationing in the Caribbean,
and other ImClone executives.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't feel it was appropriate to wreck Christmas for people at
the company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the evening of Dec. 26 and the next morning, Samuel Waksal
allegedly relayed the information to two family members. On Dec. 27
and 28, they sold about $10 million of ImClone stock, which was
trading around $55 a share.</TE>
<TE>   It is illegal for corporate officials to trade stock if they are
aware of significant developments that have not been disclosed to the
investing public. It also is illegal for outsiders to buy or sell
shares on the basis of information divulged by company insiders.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA's rejection of Erbitux was announced after the close of
trading Dec. 28. By Dec. 31, ImClone's share price had fallen to
about $46. Shares on Thursday fell 25 cents to $8.08 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has filed a civil
lawsuit in the case, said Samuel Waksal tried to sell some of his own
ImClone shares by transferring them to another family member's
account Dec. 27. But his brokers refused to process the transaction
because of restrictions on insider stock sales.</TE>
<TE>   The ImClone affair has reached beyond the Waksal family to
lifestyle entrepreneur Martha Stewart, a friend of Samuel Waksal.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has acknowledged that she sold all of her ImClone stock
for about $228,000 on Dec. 27. She said she had no conversations with
Waksal about the transaction, although she tried unsuccessfully to
call him that day. Stewart, a former stockbroker, said she sold them
because the market price fell below $60, a level she regarded as a
sell threshold.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has not been accused of wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Jury Query Reveals a Gray Area of the Law</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA GIRION</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The issue raised by jurors in the Arthur Andersen case Thursday--can
the firm be convicted if they disagree about who at the firm is
guilty?--is unsettled, with legal experts divided on the question.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon left the bench Thursday without
answering the question, saying she needed to research the issue.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a gray area," said Laurie Levenson, a former federal
prosecutor and a professor at Loyola Law School. "I am unaware of a
case that directly answers this question for the court."</LD>
<TE>   The jurors' question stems from instructions Harmon gave them June
5. They were told that to find Andersen guilty, prosecutors had to
prove that "each of the elements of the offense ... was committed by
one or more agents of Andersen, acting within the scope of their
employment with the firm."</TE>
<TE>   Harmon went on to tell jurors that if "an agent, such as a partner
of Andersen, acting within the scope of his or her employment,
improperly induced, or attempted to improperly induce, another
employee or partner of the firm or some other person to withhold,
alter, destroy, mutilate or conceal an object, and that the agent did
so with the intent, at least in part, to subvert, undermine or impede
the fact-finding ability of an official proceeding, then you may find
Andersen committed the first element of the charged offense."</TE>
<TE>   One of the notes jurors sent Harmon in their eighth day of
deliberations sought clarification. "If each of us believes that one
Andersen agent acted knowingly and with a corrupt intent, is it for
all of us to believe it was the same agent?" the note said. "Can one
believe it was agent A, another believe it was agent B, and another
believe it agent C?"</TE>
<TE>   Because the law is so unsettled, the answer could be up to Harmon,
said Leslie D. Corwin, a partner at Greenberg Traurig and the author
of a book on the law of limited liability partnerships, such as
Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really virgin territory," he said. "It's really going to
boil down to what her interpretation of the indictment is. It's not a
simple question."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, the jury must find that there was an individual acting
with "corrupt intent" and must agree on who that individual is, said
John C. Coffee, a Columbia University law professor.</TE>
<TE>   But Robert Weisberg, a criminal law professor at Stanford
University, said he believes the law does allow jurors to reach a
conviction without agreeing on who committed the misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   The language of model jury instructions in corporate liability
cases suggests jurors need not agree on who committed the misdeeds in
order to convict the organization, said Vincent Marella, a former
federal prosecutor who now is a white-collar criminal defense lawyer
in Los Angeles with Bird, Marella, Boxer &amp; Wolpert.</TE>
<TE>   Marella said jurors may be struggling with the testimony of David
B. Duncan, a fired partner who pleaded guilty and testified for the
prosecution. On cross-examination, Duncan testified that he did not
initially believe that he broke any laws by shredding documents, many
of which were on file in duplicate elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "What the jury may be doing is focusing on Duncan as if he were
charged," Marella said. "That may give rise to the question, 'We
didn't think Duncan did anything wrong--can we still find them
guilty?' "</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the lack of law on the issue, Loyola's Levenson said
the court could take guidance from criminal conspiracy cases in which
jurors might not agree on every element of the crime.</TE>
<TE>   "There could be a dispute over exactly how the crime was
committed," she said. "But it's still a valid verdict if they agree
the crime was committed."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Jerry Hirsch contributed to this report.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Viacom Inc., Blockbuster Inc.'s majority owner, didn't pressure film
studios to join a plan giving movie makers a cut of video rental
revenue in exchange for discounts on films, Chairman Sumner Redstone
testified.</LD>
<LD>   Redstone was the first witness to testify in the case brought by
independent video retailers who claim the 1997 arrangement between
the world's biggest video rental chain and the studios was intended
to drive them out of business.</LD>
<LD>   "I never asked for, nobody offered and I never received" an
exclusive deal with any of the studios, Redstone said during his four
hours on the stand in San Antonio federal court.</LD>
<TE>   Three video store owners sued for damages and the same deal as
Blockbuster.</TE>
<TE>   If Blockbuster loses, it probably will face dozens of additional
lawsuits from independent retailers.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants in the case include Sony Corp.'s Columbia TriStar
Home Entertainment, Walt Disney Co.'s Buena Vista Home Entertainment,
News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment and Vivendi
Universal's Universal Studios Home Video.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Dallas-based Blockbuster fell $1.18 to $26.20 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Asks Banks for $1.5-Billion Loan</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. is asking two banks to arrange a
$1.5-billion loan to help the company continue operating when it
files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, people familiar with the
matter said.</LD>
<LD>   The sixth-largest U.S. cable company asked Citigroup Inc.'s
Salomon Smith Barney Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. for the
financing, which would be the largest bankruptcy loan since Enron
Corp. got $1.5 billion from banks in November. General Electric
Capital Corp. also may participate in the loan, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Adelphia, in default on more than $7 billion in bank debt and
delisted from Nasdaq, is on the brink of filing for bankruptcy,
investors have said. Adelphia shares have plunged more than 99% since
the company revealed in March that it guaranteed billions in loans to
partnerships controlled by company founder John Rigas that weren't
included on the balance sheet.</LD>
<TE>   The loan would give the company time to sell assets, such as cable
systems, and regain footing under protection from creditors.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespeople for Adelphia, Salomon and J.P. Morgan declined to
comment.</TE>

<BD>Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., the biggest U.S. long-distance phone carrier, asked
federal regulators to halt a review of Verizon Communications Inc.'s
long-distance application for New Jersey and investigate early
advertising of the service by Verizon.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon admitted to the Federal Communications Commission on June
11 that about 554,000 local telephone customers in New Jersey
received advertisements in their bills marketing long-distance
service although the company does not have permission to offer it.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon said it has told the FCC it will send a letter to
customers who received the advertisement that it was sent to them in
error and it would take steps to prevent future mailing mistakes.</LD>
<TE>   An FCC spokesman said the agency is reviewing the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC is set to rule on Verizon's New Jersey bid by June 24.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, AT&amp;T said it will reduce a monthly fee used to help
subsidize service for poor and rural customers to 11% from 11.5%,
effective July 1, after the FCC agreed not to raise its costs.</TE>
<TE>   The agency said it would move cash from an account that pays for
Web access in schools and libraries to prevent raising the amount
long-distance companies pay into the so-called universal service
fund.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of AT&amp;T rose 41 cents to $10.38 and Verizon fell 36 to
$41.35, both on the NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Boston Scientific Wins Ruling on Stent Drug</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boston Scientific Corp. won a judgment against Cook Inc. in a dispute
over a drug used to coat stents, devices that prop open heart
arteries after angioplasty.</LD>
<LD>   The news sent Boston Scientific shares up $1.74, or 6.9%, to
$26.86. Shares of Guidant Corp., Cook's partner in the dispute and
the top maker of stents in the U.S., fell $2.45, or 7.2%, to $31.70.
Both trade on the NYSE.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras ruled in Chicago that Cook's
agreement with Guidant to develop a stent coated with the cancer drug
paclitaxel violated a contract Cook had with Boston Scientific.
Guidant and Boston Scientific are trailing Johnson &amp; Johnson in the
race to bring a drug-coated stent to market, an advance that's
expected to double the $2-billion annual market for the devices.</LD>
<TE>   Paclitaxel is the generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.'s
Taxol. Cook, a closely held company, plans to appeal the ruling, said
Guidant Chief Executive Ronald Dollens. The court scheduled a hearing
for June 27.</TE>

<HD>Fear Hangs Over Tunisian Jews After Temple Attack</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DJERBA, Tunisia</DL>
<LD>DJERBA, Tunisia -- Murdoch Cohen is frightened, terribly frightened.
He can't forget the day when a suicide bomber rammed a truck into the
whitewashed wall of the ancient synagogue here, sending a blast of
heat, fire, blood and bodies right toward him.</LD>
<LD>   Of course the memory of the attack keeps him on edge. But that's
not all that's haunting Cohen. It's the feeling of vulnerability, not
just in terms of his safety, but of his entire way of life.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen is a Jew in an Arab country, and even as his community has
dwindled in numbers over the years, he and his neighbors have lived
comfortably with the conviction that they are safe.</LD>
<TE>   Then came the April 11 blast, which killed 21 people--mostly
German tourists--and rattled the collective sense that this secular
Muslim country of nearly 10 million people is a perfectly welcoming
place for about 1,600 Jews who call it home.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long time I had panic attacks," the 77-year-old said as he
pointed to the faded bloodstains on the floor mats of the Ghriba
synagogue. "In the beginning, I wasn't fine--I was terrified."</TE>
<TE>   What makes Cohen unusual is not so much that he talks about
struggling to get over the blast, but that he talks about the blast
at all. Many Jews on this island off the northern coast of Africa,
and in the capital, Tunis, would rather forget that it ever happened.</TE>
<TE>   The dogged insistence that nothing changed that day appears to
stem from the same fear that hangs over Cohen--that the Jews'
centuries-old presence on Djerba, and throughout Tunisia, could be
under threat.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Jewish institutions have been turned into fortresses to
guard against another attack, and even as the government--which is
very supportive of the Jewish community--has acknowledged that it was
a terrorist act, Youseff Ouazan, president of a Jewish community
organization in Djerba, still insisted that the explosion might have
been happenstance.</TE>
<TE>   "It could have been an accident, like a plane crash," he said,
shaking his head aggressively at any suggestion otherwise. "We don't
have any problems. We have all rights. All Tunisian people have the
right to do whatever they want. Here things are calm."</TE>
<TE>   The roughly 1,000 Jews of Djerba live in a community that dates
back to the destruction of Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. Lore has it
that the first Jews brought with them a stone from that synagogue and
in 586 BC built a temple on the very site where Ghriba rests today.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, more than 100,000 Jews lived in Tunisia. But the
turmoil of the last half century, the Arab-Israeli wars and a rise in
regional anti-Semitism have prompted most to leave. Those still here
are a remnant of what was a diaspora within a diaspora.</TE>
<TE>   They have clung, for better or worse, to the sandy shores of
Djerba, perhaps best known as a resort for wealthy Europeans. They
stubbornly refuse to let the modern world separate them from their
traditional way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Marriages are still arranged, and even after they're engaged men
and women can't be alone together. The study of French--the
predominant second language in Tunisia--or English is prohibited in
school by rabbinical decree, forcing the focus on Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a small Jewish community trying to survive," said Yechiel
Bar Chaim, country director for the U.S.-based American Jewish Joint
Distribution Committee, an 88-year-old philanthropic organization
that provides financial help and expert assistance to Jewish
communities the world over.</TE>
<TE>   Ouazan, who lives in Hara Kbira, the largest Jewish quarter in
Djerba, is a tall man, with slightly rounded shoulders and an unkempt
mop of salt-and-pepper hair. He tools around the island on a moped
and sells jewelry in the open-air market. He is proud to show off the
yeshiva where boys study Hebrew texts, and proud to point out a
synagogue where his family has worshiped for 300 years. .</TE>
<TE>   But that is where his loquacity stops.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it happened, but it is not my business," he said of the
explosion. "We built our lives here. Politics, I don't want anything
to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   Ouazan has been forced to at least think about politics since a
truck loaded with a crude bomb crashed into the synagogue, an attack
that some reports have linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish leaders willing to discuss what happened insist that the
extremists--or whoever was responsible--must have been targeting the
tourism industry as a way to undermine the secular government of
President Zine el Abidine ben Ali. They insist that it was not Jews
who were singled out.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, for me it is not a Tunisian," insisted Joseph Roger
Bismuth, 76, president of Tunisia's largest Jewish organization,
based in Tunis. "In my opinion, Tunisia was targeted. I very strongly
believe the extremists were after Tunisia."</TE>
<TE>   As isolated as Djerba's Jews are on their little island, Tunis'
mainland Jewish community already seems like it is slipping away.</TE>
<TE>   In La Goulette, a Jewish suburb of the capital, a retirement home
for Jews is an armed camp. The director is unwilling even to step
outside to greet visitors without an appointment, and plainclothes
security swarm all over the street outside.</TE>
<TE>   Solange Sebag has lived in La Goulette most of her life and with
her husband, William, runs what is billed as a kosher restaurant,
Club Les Jasmin. But only 3% of the clientele is Jewish, and the
closest it comes to being kosher is selling kosher meat. If an
observant Jew comes in, she said, the food must be served on a
disposable plate to meet the purity requirements.</TE>
<TE>   But observant Jews don't show up much these days, not when the
nighttime attraction is salsa music and dancing. Sebag says she has
no intention of leaving, but she is sensing a different attitude from
some of her non-Jewish neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "The very young people, not the old people, they think we are
Zionists," she said. "Some kids come up and insult us as if we were
responsible for Middle East events."</TE>
<TE>   Bismuth, a businessman, has spent his whole life in this
community. These days, when he says, "I am Jewish," his shoulders
shrug up to his ears and his voice rises as if asking a question.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what life is like as a Jew in Tunisia, he said, as if it
were something he has thought a lot about, "You should ask why I am
still a Jew." The answer? "Because I like it."</TE>

<HD>As Argentina's Economy Sinks, Firebrand's Stock Is on the
Rise</HD>
<DH>Politics: Elisa Carrio, a chain-smoking single mother who
vows to revive the nation, is the front-runner among presidential
hopefuls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>For months, the news here has been dominated by a recurring image:
the harried faces of Argentine officials explaining again and again
what their country must do to please the technocrats at the
International Monetary Fund, seemingly the only force capable of
rescuing this troubled nation from economic catastrophe.</LD>
<LD>   As the country sullenly waits with hat in hand for an IMF bailout,
many Argentines are looking for another kind of savior. And they
think that they've found one in a chain-smoking, twice-divorced
single mother who promises to restore Argentina's wounded honor.</LD>
<LD>   "It's embarrassing to see our government officials in Washington,
getting on their knees and acting submissive," said Elisa "Lilita"
Carrio, a deputy in Congress from Argentina's impoverished north and
the leader in recent polls. "A country with even a minimum amount of
dignity cannot allow this."</LD>
<TE>   Carrio's quick rise from backwater lawmaker to presidential
front-runner is a measure of the growing anger here toward the IMF,
the Bush administration and the Argentine political elite--three
forces that Carrio is famous for skewering with wit and eloquence.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where few establishment politicians can step out in
public without being booed or worse, Carrio is happy to accept the
mantle of outsider. She revels in being "a fat woman" and "a
provincial who never shuts up." And unlike the current president,
Carrio says, she would never kowtow to the United States.</TE>
<TE>   With Argentina's banking system in ruins and a quarter of the work
force unemployed, the government of President Eduardo Duhalde has
been trying since January to secure an emergency loan from IMF
officials. Those Washington-based administrators, echoing the
policies of the Bush administration, are demanding sharp budget cuts
and key legal reforms in exchange for bailout funding.</TE>
<TE>   "They're telling us to do things that would never be done in the
United States," said Horacio Verbitsky, a columnist with the daily
newspaper Pagina 12. "They want us to cut government spending in the
middle of a recession."</TE>
<TE>   When the Argentine Senate debated one of the reforms demanded by
the fund last month, several legislators wondered aloud who was
really running the country: Duhalde, the nation's beleaguered
president, or Anne Krueger, a top IMF official whose comments on the
Argentine crisis are a fixture in the media here.</TE>
<TE>   "Day after day, the United States demonstrates its decision to
keep an imperial control over the world," said former President Raul
Alfonsin, now a senator for the centrist Radical Party.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF was demanding that Argentina revoke the law of economic
subversion, which Argentina's military dictatorship used in the 1970s
to prosecute alleged supporters of leftist guerrillas. Now the law is
being used to prosecute bankers charged with spiriting money out of
the country as the financial system collapsed last year.</TE>
<TE>   IMF officials have said that such prosecutions are politically
motivated and chill the investment climate. But many here see the
IMF's insistence on repealing the law as an attempt to help its
friends in the banking community, including a handful of jailed
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Eight senators from Duhalde's Peronist party abandoned the
president and voted to keep the law--despite Duhalde's threats to
resign if it wasn't revoked. The Senate eventually overturned the law
by a single vote.</TE>
<TE>   Protest Inside Congress</TE>
<TE>   During fierce debate on the law in the lower house of Congress,
the Chamber of Deputies, a lawmaker rushed to the podium and placed
an American flag on the rostrum in protest.</TE>
<TE>   "Let those people who've transformed our Congress into nothing
more than clerks of the IMF lower our national flag and replace it
with this one," yelled the deputy, Alicia Castro, amid insults and
cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Carrio has said she would reinstate the law because the IMF has
"coerced" Congress into revoking it.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent polls here, Carrio is far ahead of the
candidates of the Peronist party. A Marxist activist, Ruben Zamora,
isn't far behind in second place. Zamora has called on Argentina to
break off all negotiations with the IMF.</TE>
<TE>   But Duhalde believes that he has little choice but to implement
the IMF program, including its deep cuts in outlays to the country's
provinces.</TE>
<TE>   Already hit hard by cuts last year, some provincial governments
owe their employees many months in back pay.</TE>
<TE>   'Fewer Cards to Play'</TE>
<TE>   "Every day the crisis becomes more grave, and every day Duhalde
has fewer cards to play," said Eduardo Rodriguez Diez, an economist
with Fundacion Capital, a think tank here. "He has become a more
isolated figure."</TE>
<TE>   Since Duhalde assumed the presidency in January in the wake of
riots and political chaos that drove four predecessors from office in
just two weeks, Argentina's economy has plunged further into
recession. The national currency, the peso, has lost two-thirds of
its value. Its rapid devaluation, in turn, has driven up the price of
gasoline, utilities and basic foodstuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Millions of Argentines have had their savings frozen by a
government decree designed to prevent a run on the banks. Frustrated
depositors protest outside banks in central Buenos Aires every
working day, often vandalizing the banks--including U.S. institutions
such as Bank Boston and Citibank--with hammers and spray paint.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, Argentina embraced the neoliberal economic
policies advocated by the IMF and proponents of free trade.
Railroads, utilities and even the nation's oil reserves were all sold
to the private sector.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are angriest now are the ones who believed most in
the [neoliberal] economic model," Verbitsky said. They put their
money in U.S. and European banks because they believed that it would
be safer there. They supported the "convertibility" plan that made
the peso equivalent to a dollar, even as the government went slowly
bankrupt trying to keep the peso strong.</TE>
<TE>   Now the economic model of the 1990s is in shambles. The peso is
worth 27 cents. And Argentina must endure the harsh criticisms of
U.S. officials such as Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. The latter said in an interview
that Argentina doesn't have an export economy because "they like it
that way. Nobody forced them to be what they are."</TE>
<TE>   The war of words continued last week, with IMF Managing Director
Horst Kohler declaring that he was irritated with Argentina's delay
in reaching a budget agreement with its provincial governments.</TE>
<TE>   "If the IMF wants us to work quicker, then it should help us
quicker," retorted a Duhalde aide.</TE>
<TE>   Duhalde has, in fact, worked for months to push through the IMF
program in the face of opposition from nearly every sector of
Argentine society.</TE>
<TE>   His approval rating, according to a recent Gallup poll, has sunk
to an abysmal 24%. Last month, he reportedly agreed--in private talks
with provincial governors--to step down long before December 2003,
when his term is scheduled to end.</TE>
<TE>   Most observers anticipate a presidential election some time this
year.</TE>
<TE>   A Nationalistic Climate</TE>
<TE>   Dismissed by many as an annoying gadfly just a few months ago, the
45-year-old Carrio is gaining support in the tense, increasingly
nationalistic climate. She is the politician most closely identified
with the argument that Argentina's economic crash was caused by
corrupt politicians and businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   "This country has to choose between truth or lies, between justice
and impunity, between the hard way or the easy way," said Carrio, who
led a congressional committee that investigated money-laundering by
Argentina's business elite. "We have to choose whether it's worth
fighting for this country."</TE>
<TE>   Carrio is a colorful and controversial figure with a reputation
for integrity and toughness. The daughter of a lifelong Radical Party
activist, she was married and became a mother at 17. By the time she
was 24, she had gone to law school and become a judge.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Carrio often stages impromptu street-corner news
conferences denouncing corruption--on a few occasions, her charges
later proved false.</TE>
<TE>   Even people who dislike her acknowledge, using a popular Argentine
phrase to describe strong women, that Carrio "has ovaries."</TE>
<TE>   Carrio calls herself "a liberal democrat" who believes that wiping
out corruption can provide the stimulus to turn around Argentina's
moribund economy. She repeats this mantra over and over in this
nation's many nightly news talk shows, in which she is a frequent and
popular guest.</TE>
<TE>   "Elisa Carrio is well-placed to win the next presidential
elections ... because she represents a utopian hope in a moment of
social frustration and instability," pollster Rosendo Fraga wrote
this month in the magazine Veintitres.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Carrio can govern Argentina--and not just inspire its
people--remains an open question, Fraga wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Carrio has heard such doubts before. Asked what qualifications she
has to run this nation of 37 million people, she rattled off a list
of her accomplishments during eight years in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Elected as a member of the Radical Party, she and two other
deputies formed a dissident party in 2000, Argentines for a Republic
of Equals.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, we were three deputies, and now we are 30," she said.
In October, her newly formed political party finished third in
congressional elections.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to build a party," she said. "I was able to form
alliances with other parties in Congress. I got laws passed
unanimously."</TE>
<TE>   She paused, took a drag on her second cigarette in half an hour,
and then thought of another qualification that has prepared her to be
president: "And I am a woman!"</TE>

<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>South Korea called in China's ambassador today to protest an incident
in which Chinese police entered the South Korean Consulate compound
in Beijing and grabbed a North Korean would-be asylum seeker, the
Foreign Ministry said.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Foreign Minister Kim Hang Kyung held talks with the
ambassador, Li Bin, at the ministry's offices in the central
government complex in Seoul, the South Korean capital.</LD>
<LD>   Chinese police forced their way into the consulate in Beijing on
Thursday to retrieve a North Korean man seeking asylum. Scuffles
broke out between the police and South Korean diplomats, and at least
one diplomat was hurt. The detained man's son managed to stay inside
the building, joining 17 other North Koreans.</LD>
<TE>   It was not immediately clear what Kim told Li, but the Foreign
Ministry issued a carefully worded statement late Thursday saying the
Chinese police had violated diplomatic rules by entering the
consulate and should hand back the detained man.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's incident, barely a month after Beijing settled a
similar row with Japan, came amid tougher measures by the Chinese
government to stem a wave of North Korean asylum seekers entering
foreign missions in China.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of North Koreans fleeing famine and repression have sought
refuge at missions in China.</TE>

<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A suicide attacker crashed a bomb-laden car into a guard post outside
the U.S. Consulate here this morning, killing five people and
injuring dozens.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the bomb was concealed in a white car that the driver
crashed into the guard post, destroying part of the wall. It also
damaged the nearby Marriott hotel and dozens of cars.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses reported seeing body parts scattered at the scene. At
least one of those killed was a Pakistani plainclothes guard.</LD>
<TE>   The Reuters news services reported that all five of those killed
were Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue teams rushed to the scene, and police sealed off the area.</TE>

<LD>World military spending grew 2% last year, according to official

Sept. 11 attacks are included, a security policy think tank said.</LD>
<LD>   "World military expenditure in 2001 is estimated at $839 billion,"
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said in the 33rd
edition of its yearbook.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure the increase will be much larger due to Sept. 11, which
has led to additional expenditure in the United States but also in
other countries," the institute's Elisabeth Skons said in Stockholm.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 300 asylum seekers shipped to the Pacific nation of Nauru
by Australia last year have been denied refugee status, and fears
mounted that a boat carrying others has been lost at sea.</LD>
<LD>   The United Nations rejected 219 asylum seekers and Australia an
additional 108, most of whom were among 433 boat people rescued by
the Norwegian freighter Tampa last August after their vessel began
sinking in the treacherous seas between Australia and Indonesia. Most
of those rescued were Afghans and Iraqis.</LD>
<LD>   Australia fears that other asylum seekers might have drowned in
recent days after their vessel, believed headed for Australia or New
Zealand, set out from West Java, Indonesia, 22 days ago. The boat,
believed to be carrying 42 asylum seekers, has not been seen since.</LD>

<LD>NATO-led peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina arrested a Bosnian Serb
man who had been secretly indicted by the U.N. tribunal in the
massacre of more than 200 people in August 1992.</LD>
<LD>   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization said the arrest of Darko
Mrdja, who allegedly headed a special police unit that carried out
the massacre, should serve as a warning to other fugitives, in
particular Bosnian Serb wartime leader Radovan Karadzic and his
military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic.</LD>
<LD>   NATO said that Mrdja's unit is accused of killing at least 228
non-Serb men on Mt. Vlasic in Bosnia.</LD>

countryside since her release from house arrest May 6.</LD>
<LD>   Suu Kyi's car was joined by three other vehicles carrying her
National League for Democracy party vice chairman, Tin Oo, and his
wife, other senior members of the party, youth members and a doctor,
party officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Suu Kyi, 56, left without fanfare, apparently to keep a big crowd
of supporters and journalists from following her.</LD>

<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>ROME -- A U.N.-sponsored World Food Summit ended Thursday with calls
to halt the scourge of hunger, but differences about how to go about
it appeared wider than ever after four days of controversy and
bickering.</LD>
<LD>   The gathering, sponsored by the United Nations' Food and
Agriculture Organization, committed governments to honor a 1996
pledge to halve the number of hungry people in the world by 2015.</LD>
<LD>   Although about 80 world leaders attended the summit, few heads of
Western powers showed up, prompting charges that leading
industrialized nations were indifferent to the plight of the
estimated 800 million people who suffer chronic hunger.</LD>
<TE>   The World Food Summit, the first since 1996, revealed divisions
about how to attack the problem of hunger pitting the North against
the Southern Hemisphere, charities against governments, and some
Western powers against the United Nations.</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Moves to Allay Pakistani Ire</HD>
<DH>Asia: Defense secretary tones down his remarks about Al
Qaeda presence in Kashmir. Despite the controversy, his peace mission
is still on track.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Working swiftly to heal a diplomatic rift with Pakistan that
threatened to distract from his peace mission to South Asia, Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Thursday said he had no hard
information that Al Qaeda fighters were operating near the
Pakistani-Indian frontier in Kashmir.</LD>
<LD>   "The facts are that I do not have evidence and the United States
does not have evidence of Al Qaeda in Kashmir," Rumsfeld told a news
conference here after a day of talks with President Pervez Musharraf
and other Pakistani leaders.</LD>
<LD>   "We do have a good deal of scraps of intelligence ... ," he added.
"It tends to be speculative. It is not actionable, it is not
verifiable."</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's remarks came only 24 hours after he told reporters in
New Delhi that he had "seen indications" of Al Qaeda's presence in
Kashmir--a statement that delighted India but caused dismay and
thinly concealed anger in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Although embarrassing, the controversy appeared to cause no
immediate damage to U.S. diplomatic efforts to pull the two
nuclear-armed nations back from the brink of war over Kashmir, a
mainly Muslim region divided between them and claimed by both.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal ... is to see that the tensions are reduced, and I think
progress is indeed being made," Rumsfeld said.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi has justified its military buildup in Kashmir as a
necessity to defend itself against Pakistan-supported militants
crossing into the Indian-controlled portion of the disputed region.
U.S. claims that Al Qaeda elements are a part of this incursion would
seem to buttress India's strong actions.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani authorities have never denied that some Al Qaeda
fighters found refuge in Pakistan after the collapse of the Islamic
fundamentalist Taliban regime in neighboring Afghanistan in December.
But Thursday, they dismissed as baseless allegations of Al Qaeda
activity in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to ease tensions with India, Musharraf this year
began reining in myriad lesser-known Islamic militant groups that had
conducted a guerrilla campaign in Indian-controlled areas of Kashmir
from bases on the Pakistani side of the frontier.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's initial statement carried an added sting here in
Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, because Musharraf is already under
pressure domestically from the country's vocal fundamentalist
minority, first for siding with the West against the Taliban last
fall and more recently for the crackdown against militants in
Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   "After doing so much to assist the United States in the war
against terrorism, these remarks won't be taken so kindly," Interior
Minister Moinuddin Haider said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf's spokesman, Maj. Gen. Rashid Qureshi, was less
diplomatic in his reaction to Rumsfeld's comments in New Delhi:
"Absolutely incorrect," he told Reuters news service.</TE>
<TE>   During a 30-minute news conference, Rumsfeld worked hard to soothe
Pakistani sensitivities, repeatedly praising the country's
counter-terrorism efforts under Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he said that if there were what he termed
"actionable intelligence" on the presence of Al Qaeda fighters in
Pakistani-controlled areas, he was sure that Islamabad would act.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't a doubt in my mind that the Pakistani government
would go find them and deal with them," the secretary told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The authorities already have. Working closely with American
intelligence, Pakistani police arrested about 20 Al Qaeda members in
the cities of Lahore and Faisalabad in April. A month earlier, again
acting on U.S.-provided information, authorities arrested Abu
Zubeida, a top Al Qaeda leader.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's two-day visit to the troubled South Asian region was
the second this month by a senior member of the Bush administration.
Tensions began to ease late last week after Deputy Secretary of State
Richard L. Armitage coaxed a series of initial steps from Indian and
Pakistani leaders that appeared to reduce the immediate risk of war.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld on Thursday appeared to be consolidating those gains.</TE>
<TE>   He referred to Pakistan's efforts to reduce infiltration of armed
militants into Indian-controlled areas, as well as New Delhi's
decision to withdraw some warships from forward areas in the Arabian
Sea and its intention to return its ambassador to Islamabad, as signs
that the leaders of both countries wanted to step back from the
prospect of armed conflict.</TE>
<TE>   But Rumsfeld, together with Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdus
Sattar, cautioned that these diplomatic moves had yet to be
accompanied by any sign of a military pullback on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcomed the steps, however marginal, that India has taken
[because] they have had a certain psychological impact," Sattar told
reporters. "But there is no change whatsoever in the capability of
Indian forces massed on our borders."</TE>
<TE>   The so-called Line of Control separating Pakistani- and
Indian-held areas of Kashmir reportedly was quiet Thursday after days
of artillery and small-arms fire between the two armies.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he had brought no specific proposal for independent
monitoring of the Line of Control as a way to build confidence
between the two South Asian nations, but he stressed that the U.S.
was prepared to explore the possible use of electronic devices along
the frontier.</TE>
<TE>   "If people want to do that, we'd be happy to provide the technical
people to discuss it," Rumsfeld said.</TE>

<HD>Arafat's Cabinet Meets After Delay</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian leader, addressing his new ministers,
decries Israeli blockade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Yasser Arafat convened his new, streamlined Cabinet at his
headquarters here Thursday, three days after Israeli tanks blockaded
the complex and caused a delay.</LD>
<LD>   Israel ended the blockade in Ramallah on Wednesday, and on
Thursday five new ministers swore allegiance to the Palestinian
Authority. The slimmer Cabinet--down to 21 ministers from 31--came
after Israel, the U.S. and Europe demanded that the Palestinian
Authority president reform his corruption-ridden administration.</LD>
<LD>   The Cabinet was appointed Sunday and had been scheduled to meet
Monday, but the Israeli military moved into Ramallah early Monday and
surrounded Arafat's headquarters. Addressing his Cabinet, Arafat
charged that Israel's incursion was an attempt to "sabotage"
Palestinian efforts to run their affairs and work to achieve a state
"with Jerusalem as its capital."</LD>
<TE>   Arafat said the new Cabinet must "guarantee the restructure of the
ministries and institutions of the Palestinian Authority to be more
efficient," as well as "rebuild the damage caused by Israel's
escalating aggression."</TE>
<TE>   One of the officials held over from the previous Cabinet, Planning
Minister Nabil Shaath, flew to Washington on Thursday to provide
Palestinian input on Mideast peacemaking. His trip came after Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon met President Bush and congressional
leaders this week.</TE>
<TE>   Bush met for about 20 minutes Thursday with Saudi Foreign Minister
Saud al Faisal, according to White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Bush said he was not ready to disclose his administration's
ideas for reviving the Middle East peace process. Secretary of State
Colin L. Powell this week had said one proposal could be creating an
interim Palestinian state as a step toward a longer-range solution.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's probably wise for people not to spend a lot of time
speculating," Bush said. "I'm going to lay out my vision at some
point in time. It's going to be a vision that will help lead toward
two states living side by side.</TE>
<TE>   "Israelis are going to have to be responsible, Palestinians are
going to have to be responsible, the Arab world is going to have to
assume responsibility to achieve this vision," he said.</TE>

<LD>Two South Korean girls died Thursday when a U.S. Army armored vehicle
struck them during a training exercise in a suburb of Seoul, the Army
said in a statement.</LD>
<LD>   The accident happened three days after hundreds of anti-American

worker at a U.S. military base.</LD>
<LD>   "We are deeply saddened by this tragic event," Lt. Gen. Daniel

<HD>Karzai Chosen as Leader, Vows to Rebuild Nation</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: Even rivals join in celebrating what they see
as a fresh start for the war-torn country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Charismatic nobleman Hamid Karzai on Thursday became Afghanistan's
first peacefully empowered president, inheriting responsibility for
one of the poorest countries and for the daunting task of reconciling
ethnic rivals and rebuilding what a generation of war has destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   Karzai was selected as head of state by a loya jirga, or grand
assembly, Afghanistan's chaotic traditional forum for deciding the
country's future and expressing the will of the people. He has been
the nation's interim prime minister for six months.</LD>
<LD>   Although challenged by two other candidates, his victory was
preordained by the controversial influence of U.S. and other foreign
advisors, which could taint the credibility of his tenure. Mohammad
Zaher Shah, the nation's former king, withdrew from the political
stage on the advice of President Bush's envoy. Former President
Burhanuddin Rabbani's departure from the race is believed to have
been arranged in return for a prestigious title to be bestowed later.</LD>
<TE>   Still, Karzai's selection--he received 1,295 of the 1,575 votes
cast--clearly reflected majority sentiment among those gathered for
the weeklong convocation. Even his rivals joined in the spirit of
celebration over what they see as the beginning of a new age in their
homeland.</TE>
<TE>   "He won. That's democracy," said Massooda Jalal, a female
physician with the World Food Program, who came in second with 171
votes. Mir Mohammed Mahfoz Nadai, a delegate who works for the
government, received 89 votes. The remaining 20 votes were
invalidated.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after the announcement on state-run radio and television,
the Islamic faithful were called to prayer, and Koranic chants and
the national anthem were broadcast across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   In what might be the most encouraging sign of social improvement,
at least in Kabul: There was none of the celebratory gunfire that
marked the capital's liberation in November and the end of the
Ramadan fast and Karzai's inauguration as prime minister a month
later. The capital was awash in munitions then. Now, many civilians
have been disarmed and an International Security Assistance Force
keeps the peace alongside nascent units of the Afghan police and
national guard.</TE>
<TE>   "You've put your trust in me and, God willing, we will rebuild
Afghanistan again," Karzai told delegates after his selection.</TE>
<TE>   In an address to the nation today, Karzai is expected to
congratulate his fellow citizens on choreographing a peaceful
transition of power in a country more prone to take up arms than
engage in civil discourse.</TE>
<TE>   The 44-year-old ethnic Pushtun leader of the noble Popolzai clan
must renegotiate the delicate power-sharing agreement he has had for
the last six months with former commanders of the Northern Alliance
to include broader ethnic representation.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance, dominated by Tajiks and Uzbeks who drove the Taliban
from power, still controls the tanks and troops and will have to be
appeased to keep peace in the country. Pushtuns make up the nation's
largest ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   More daunting still will be the challenge of raising up a
physically and psychologically wrecked country. Karzai will be under
the intense pressure of outsized expectations among people who suffer
some of the world's worst health afflictions, poverty and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   One in four Afghan children dies before the age of 5, and three
years of drought have exacerbated food shortages, leaving more than a
third of the population dependent on humanitarian aid for sustenance.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai will also have to keep the foreign allies focused on the
long-term need to assist and advise his government as it undertakes a
reconstruction effort unparalleled since the U.S. Marshall Plan
bankrolled Germany's revival after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   And that challenge of holding the attention of U.S. and other
donors who have pledged more than $4 billion in aid will coincide
with the expected drift of attention as the U.S.-led war on terrorism
extends from Afghanistan to other targets.</TE>
<TE>   Karzai has been credited with making impressive moves toward
ethnic reconciliation even in his brief term as interim prime
minister. A Sunni Muslim, he visited a Shiite Muslim mosque in March
and assured the religious rivals, "We are all brothers." In his
speech accepting his nomination, he even reached out to those swept
up by the Taliban excesses, blaming the massacres and mistreatment of
the previous five years on foreigners who manipulated Afghans.</TE>
<TE>   But the Pushtuns are demanding a louder voice in the next Cabinet,
the national assembly to be selected from among the loya jirga
delegates and the constitutional convention to be called ahead of
nationwide elections in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Pushtuns have complained bitterly of discrimination under the
interim government because of its preponderance of Northern Alliance
figures, including the powerful ministers for defense, the interior
and foreign affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Those claims of mistreatment seemed to be borne out by the staunch
opposition that Tajik and Uzbek ministers raised to the possible
return to power of Zaher Shah. They find Karzai, though also a
Pushtun, less susceptible to manipulation by the largest ethnic
group.</TE>
<TE>   It was the unspoken threat of a military uprising in the event
that the king is selected that is believed to have prompted Bush's
envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, to persuade Zaher Shah to bow
out of the leadership race.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan-born U.S. envoy has been unapologetic about the counsel
he gave the king, insisting that it was neither unsolicited nor
strong-armed.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great day for Afghanistan--electing a government rather
than a government through coups, military intervention or violence,"
Khalilzad said after Karzai's victory.</TE>
<TE>   Many lauded the first loya jirga in more than 25 years for
ushering in respect for intellect and initiative over the clout of
the gun.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a democratic environment. Everyone has the right to express
himself," said delegate Abdul Rehman of Kunduz as he and others cast
their ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Others reveled in the validation of women's place in society after
five years of abject repression under the fundamentalist Taliban
regime. More than 200 female delegates--disproportionately active and
outspoken in comparison with past forums over the last 1,000
years--forced the political focus on the issues of peace, security,
equality and prosperity and urged the empowerment of leaders
untarnished by the past bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Jalal told the delegates in her nomination speech that Afghan
women had suffered enough and "we will no longer be victims."</TE>
<TE>   It was her husband, Sayed Jalal, also a delegate, who first
proposed that the traditional form of election--a show of hands--be
replaced by a secret ballot so that no one had to fear intimidation.</TE>
<TE>   "I agree with Mr. Jalal that it should be secret," said Karzai,
stepping up to the microphone to put an end to the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   "If even one person here fears voting in the open, we must do it
in secret," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alluding to the forum's excessive embrace of debate and ceremony
that set the loya jirga two days behind schedule after only three
days of meetings, interim Finance Minister Hedayat Amin Arsala
insisted, "We mustn't worry about time. The concern is democracy."</TE>
<TE>   Although the loya jirga has made strides toward hauling
Afghanistan out of the social and economic Stone Age, it has fallen
far short of what Westerners would regard as an exercise in
democracy. Some delegates won their seats through bribery, threats or
favor-trading.</TE>
<TE>   The government and organizing committee added several dozen
delegates to the traditional 1,500 members plus the king, apparently
intent on ensuring the desired outcome.</TE>

<HD>S. African Schoolkids Take Defense Into Their Own Hands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN M. SIMMONS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ATLANTIS, South Africa</DL>
<LD>A boy calmly approaches a girl, grabs her head with one hand and her
throat with the other. The girl thrusts her knee toward the boy's
genitals and pretends to jab him in the eyes with her fingers. As the
boy's knees buckle and he feigns excruciating pain, the classroom
erupts in laughter.</LD>
<LD>   "Why is it important to know self-defense?" teacher Menicia
Wildeman asks the group of preteens at Protea Park primary school in
Atlantis, a hotbed of abuse and crime in South Africa's Western Cape
province.</LD>
<LD>   "To protect yourself," the kids shout back in unison.</LD>
<TE>   A rise in assaults in schools, including rape, has pressed the
national Education Department to join forces with the private agency
Crime Busters to launch the "Safe Schools" campaign, which aims to
teach girls to defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "The level of sexual abuse in our schools we know is exceptionally
high, so just having awareness is not enough," said Martin Prew, the
Education Department's director of school safety.</TE>
<TE>   The program was launched last month in 63 schools in notoriously
high-crime areas of South Africa. The government's goal is to reach
920 schools by August. Some schools, including Protea Park, have been
part of a pilot program for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Schoolgirls from about age 5 and up are the prime targets of the
self-defense program. The girls are taught simple techniques on how
to disable an attacker, defend themselves and get away.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa has one of the world's highest rates of sexual
assault, with an estimated 58 child rapes a day and the rape of a
woman every 26 seconds, according to statistics gathered by child
welfare activists and local rights groups. In January, a report by
the Medical Research Council in Pretoria found that a third of all
child rapes in South Africa are committed by teachers.</TE>
<TE>   About 21,000 cases of child rape were reported to police last
year. But activists say countless other cases go untold.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to create awareness against criminal activities and
to empower children and women against any form of attack," said
Merlin Hendricks, a program coordinator in charge of the self-defense
program for the Western Cape's Education Department.</TE>
<TE>   At Protea Park, the twice-a-week self-defense classes are part of
an overall life orientation course that includes physical education,
religion and health matters. About 400 boys and girls, ages 11 to 14,
are participating in the program.</TE>
<TE>   Most of them live in the nearby concrete jungle of apartment
blocks that have become a breeding ground for gangs and violence. It
is a starkly typical feature of Atlantis, a settlement about 35 miles
north of Cape Town, which was built in the 1970s to house people
classified as "colored" under the former apartheid regime.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the children come from the flats, and that's where there
is gangsterism, and molestation of small children takes place," said
Wildeman, who was trained to instruct children under the Safe Schools
program. "Our children have to walk home. Their parents don't have a
car to pick them up or drop them off. Anything can happen between
their house and the school."</TE>
<TE>   And once in the classroom, they are not immune to assault. A
recent survey by an independent researcher in cooperation with the
University of the Western Cape found that one-third of all
schoolgirls in this province experienced sexual harassment at school.
Other abuses are also common.</TE>
<TE>   "[Kids] come in to school with knives and sticks to defend
themselves," said Melvin Losper, Protea Park's principal. "We teach
them to protect themselves with their own body, not with weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Oosthuizen, national director of Crime Busters, the group
that trains the teachers to instruct self-defense classes, said the
techniques are so simple that even a 5-year-old can use them.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy involves a combination of hitting, pushing, pulling
and jerking one's body free. The trainers are loath to give away too
many details, lest a potential rapist learn their secrets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about strength," Oosthuizen said. "It's not about
kicking 40 feet in the air, or throwing a big man over your shoulder.
What we want to teach the learners is to get loose and run to
safety."</TE>
<TE>   Girls are also encouraged to avoid walking alone and to wear a

<TE>   Losper, Protea Park's principal, noted a significant decline in
the rate of petty assaults at the school in recent months. School
officials recorded 23 assaults among students since the start of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of problems in the past with kids attacking each
other with pens, scissors, anything they can lay their hands on,"
Losper said. "That's definitely changed. The attitude has changed to
'think before you act.' "</TE>
<TE>   Many students involved in the self-defense program say that being
able to protect themselves has boosted their self-esteem.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel more confident," Protea Park student Bianca Gloete, 11,
said during a recent self-defense session. "If someone grabs me
around the neck, I would use the tactics that I have learned in the
class."</TE>

<HD>Opposition Delivers Blow to S. Korean Ruling Party</HD>
<DH>Elections: The majority of local and regional races go to
conservatives as the gap between the two presidential front-runners
vanishes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>In a crushing defeat for President Kim Dae Jung, South Korean voters
Thursday handed the conservative opposition a landslide victory in
local elections held around the country.</LD>
<LD>   Results released this morning showed the Grand National Party
winning a majority of races in 11 out of 16 districts, in an election
to fill more than 4,400 mayoral, gubernatorial and city council
positions.</LD>
<LD>   The lopsided results set the stage for a strong bid by the
conservatives to win the far more important presidential election
scheduled for Dec. 19.</LD>
<TE>   Lee Hoi Chang of the GNP is running in a virtual dead heat in
polls for that race with human-rights lawyer Roh Mu Hyun, the
candidate of the ruling Millennium Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, Roh was more than 20 percentage points ahead of
his conservative challenger in the polls, but the arrest last month
of Kim's youngest son on corruption charges and other scandals
swirling around the presidency have undermined the credibility of the
ruling liberals.</TE>
<TE>   "We humbly accept the results," Roh said in a statement this
morning. He said he would ask the ruling liberals to reconfirm his
selection as the party's candidate for president.</TE>
<TE>   "This election reconfirms that voters leave you if you mismanage
national affairs," Lee said Thursday night after hearing the results
of exit polls.</TE>
<TE>   It had been widely anticipated that the conservatives would
prevail in the local elections, but they did far better than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   In the most important race, GNP candidate Lee Myung Bak was
elected mayor of Seoul. The 61-year-old former construction executive
at the giant Hyundai conglomerate ran against a 38-year-old former
student activist, Kim Min Seok, who was angling to become the
capital's youngest mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The conservative opposition party captured five of nine provincial
governorships, as well as mayoral races in six of seven major cities.
In fact, the ruling liberals won only in their party's traditional
power bases in the southwest.</TE>
<TE>   To the extent that the elections were a contest between experience
and youth, the former easily prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   Young voters who had been expected to support the youthful
candidates put up by the Millennium Democratic Party refrained from
voting, repelled by the corruption scandals and distracted by the
World Cup soccer tournament that is being held in South Korea and
Japan. Voter turnout was about 48%, a record low for the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really a political crisis for them," said political
scientist Hahn Sung Deuk at Korea University, referring to the ruling
liberals.</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that Roh would dramatically restructure the party so
as to distance himself from President Kim. The South Korean leader
resigned as head of the party last year and as a member last month in
order to boost its electoral prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Although the 77-year-old former dissident is a Nobel Peace
laureate and an acclaimed figure in international politics, his
popularity as president has crumbled at home because of the scandals
in his government and disappointment that more was not achieved
through his hallmark "sunshine" policy of engagement with North
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   If the conservatives win the presidency in December, they are
expected to pursue dialogue with North Korea as well, but most likely
at a slower pace than Kim.</TE>
<TE>   But the conservatives are not gloating yet, knowing that the South
Korean electorate is notoriously fickle and the presidential vote is
still six months away.</TE>
<TE>   "It is too early to celebrate," said Park Won Hong, a GNP
lawmaker. "Historically, Korean people do a balancing act. When one
party wins a landslide in one election, they vote for the others in
the next."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Banker, Father Indicted in Money Fraud</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A bank official and her father were indicted Thursday in one of the
biggest embezzlement, fraud and money laundering cases in Israeli
history, allegedly taking the money to pay off the gambling debts of
the woman's brother.</LD>
<LD>   Over five years, Esther Alon and her father, Avigdor Maximov,
stole about $50 million from the Trade Bank where she worked, to pay
the debts of her brother, Ofer Maximov, the prosecution told the Tel
Aviv District Court.</LD>
<LD>   The case undermined Israeli public confidence in the banking
system. Customers of the Trade Bank told reporters at the court that
their accounts, savings and investments had been plundered by Alon.
Shortly after the embezzlement was discovered, the Israeli government
offered to cover at least 95% of the losses.</LD>
<TE>   The defendants did not submit a plea Thursday, and their lawyers
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Four other people were indicted Thursday in connection with the
case. All four were owners of illegal gambling establishments where
Ofer Maximov incurred debts.</TE>
<TE>   The police hoped that the case would enable them to prosecute
leading Israeli crime bosses, newspapers said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we have uncovered only a fraction of the things that
were done, and we will keep investigating," prosecutor Ela Rubinek
said.</TE>

<DH>Ethics: Recent business scandals elicit memories of the
1980s, renewing demands for reform.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Allegations of illegal and tawdry behavior by executives have become
an almost weekly spectacle, shaking investors' trust in the nation's
business leadership and prompting criticism that a new era of greed
has tainted corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest Wednesday of ImClone Systems Inc. co-founder Samuel D.
Waksal on insider-trading charges is the latest in a spate of
scandals involving high-profile executives. It comes a week after the
indictment of former Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive L.
Dennis Kozlowski on charges of tax evasion, which in turn followed
revelations of questionable behavior by top brass at Adelphia
Communications Corp., WorldCom Inc. and, of course, Enron Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Boards of directors have begun to take action, sweeping out
executives at these companies and others. But critics say it has been
too little, too late to dispel the cloud of mistrust darkening
America's executive suites.</LD>
<TE>   Investor discontent can be seen in the slumping stock market and
in the remarkable success during this season of annual meetings of a
number of shareholder initiatives taking direct aim at lavish CEO pay
packages and attempting to boost director independence.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators, regulators and prosecutors at the federal and state
levels have ramped up investigative activity to a pitch not seen
since the savings-and-loan and Wall Street scandals of the 1980s.
Some say the current disenchantment even surpasses that of the Decade
of Greed as symbolized by Gordon Gekko, the villain of the 1987 movie
"Wall Street," who was modeled in part on inside trader Ivan Boesky.</TE>
<TE>   "In my lifetime, American business has never been under such
scrutiny," Henry M. Paulson Jr., chairman of the investment bank
Goldman Sachs, told an audience at the National Press Club in
Washington last week. "To be blunt, much of it is deserved."</TE>
<TE>   Business scandals always have been an unwelcome byproduct of an
economic system that rewards the pursuit of self-interest, said Daryl
Koehn, director of the Center for Business Ethics at the University
of St. Thomas in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   What's new and disturbing, she said, is that corporations and
boards of directors are "showing a tendency to cater to the personal
greed of their executives and are turning a blind eye to conflicts of
interest."</TE>
<TE>   Enron directors, for example, explicitly voted to suspend the
company's conflict-of-interest policy so that Chief Financial Officer
Andrew S. Fastow could run outside partnerships that enriched him
personally, Koehn noted.</TE>
<TE>   At Adelphia, WorldCom and Tyco, top executives received huge
personal loans from the companies in addition to their hefty salaries
and stock options.</TE>
<TE>   All three companies are reeling financially and embroiled in
scandal. All three also recently ousted their top managers--John
Rigas and his three sons at cable TV operator Adelphia, Bernard
Ebbers at phone giant WorldCom and Kozlowski at Tyco, the
manufacturing conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of ImClone, authorities charge that Waksal got early
word of a devastating Food and Drug Administration ruling against the
biotech firm's top drug prospect. Waksal allegedly tipped off family
members so they could dump millions of dollars in ImClone stock
before the news reached the public.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, reportedly under pressure from ImClone's board, stepped
down as chief executive three weeks ago and was replaced by his
brother and company co-founder Harlan W. Waksal--who is himself the
subject of questions regarding his trading of ImClone stock.</TE>
<TE>   Samuel Waksal's lawyer said the charges were based on "entirely
circumstantial" evidence, and Harlan Waksal's attorney described the
timing of his client's stock sales as "coincidental."</TE>
<TE>   Do the abrupt departures of Samuel Waksal and the others mean
corporate directors are finally getting tough with management? Not
necessarily, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact you're seeing more exits than before is a good thing,
but it's too bad these boards didn't act decisively before so much
damage was done," said Charles Elson, director of the Center for
Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   Pressuring Kozlowski to resign a day before his indictment was not
exactly a stern test for Tyco directors, said Jamie Heard, chief
executive of Institutional Shareholder Services in Rockville, Md.,
which advises pension funds and other institutional investors on
issues of corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski's resignation voided his multimillion-dollar severance
package, but Tyco said it had entered into "good-faith negotiations"
with him on a new deal. Those negotiations will be a better test for
the board, Heard said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they vote him even a penny of severance, it will be a penny
too much," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not they are reacting quickly, directors are feeling
the heat from shareholders. Of 174 nonbinding corporate governance
resolutions submitted by shareholders this year, 40% passed,
shattering the previous record of 25%, according to the Investor
Responsibility Research Center, a Washington-based proxy advisory
service.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the proposals addressed executive pay and fringe benefits.
That level of success is striking because such resolutions are nearly
always opposed by company management and directors.</TE>
<TE>   Domini Social Investments, a mutual fund company that uses its
financial clout to promote corporate responsibility, reported this
week that its own shareholder initiatives also had achieved unusually
strong support this year.</TE>
<TE>   "A post-Enron crisis of confidence appears to have fueled
shareholder discontent," said Adam Kanzer, Domini's director of
shareholder advocacy.</TE>
<TE>   Former Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay was revealed this year to
have sold more than $70 million in stock back to the company in 2001,
much of it while assuring worried employees that the company was
solid and the stock a good buy.</TE>
<TE>   Lay's spokeswoman, Kelly Kimberly, has said the sales were forced
upon him by margin calls, or demands for collateral from
broker-lenders.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski also quietly cashed in tens of millions of dollars in
Tyco options while publicly maintaining that he seldom sold company
shares.</TE>
<TE>   For investors whose Tyco shares have slid 75% this year, the
details of the Kozlowski indictment must have been galling. The
now-former CEO allegedly had empty crates shipped to New Hampshire to
avoid paying about $1 million in New York state and city sales taxes
on $13.2 million in fine art purchased for his Fifth Avenue
penthouse. Kozlowski has pleaded not guilty to all the charges
against him.</TE>
<TE>   "This idea that paying taxes is for suckers is part of a contempt
for government that goes hand in hand with the mania for
deregulation," said Marjorie Kelly, editor and publisher of Business
Ethics magazine in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski had moved Tyco's official base to Bermuda five years ago
to avoid U.S. corporate income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   A Bermuda neighbor of Tyco's is Global Crossing Ltd., the
once-highflying telecommunications company that filed for bankruptcy
protection in January.</TE>
<TE>   Founder Gary Winnick, who ran Global Crossing out of a Beverly
Hills replica of the White House Oval Office, cashed in stock worth
more than $600 million while the company was still on the rise. The
bankruptcy filing cost his employees and other investors hundreds of
millions as the company's stock price plunged.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Winnick did not return calls for comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly said a "winner-take-all mentality" formed during the
downsizing wave of the early 1990s has led to excesses in personal
and corporate behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders themselves seem to believe that their problems
may be more image than reality, a new survey for Chief Executive
magazine indicates.</TE>
<TE>   True, "unethical corporate behavior" was cited as the
second-greatest threat to America's corporate reputation, according
to the survey by Harris Interactive released last week. But the top
threat, cited by 49% of the 600 corporate CEOs and presidents
participating, was "media criticism."</TE>
<TE>   However, Goldman Sachs' Paulson, in his National Press Club
speech, asserted that the business community's black eye has been
largely self-inflicted.</TE>
<TE>   Looking for ways out of the ethical morass, Paulson called on
corporate America to bolster the independence of boards of directors
and to require executives to forfeit any gains on stock sales that
come within a year before a bankruptcy filing.</TE>
<TE>   Some of his suggestions echoed proposals made last week by the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Board proposed strengthening the independence of directors
and disclosing more information about stock options and personal
loans to company directors and officers.</TE>
<TE>   "The New York Stock Exchange doesn't normally pay much attention
to corporate governance issues," said Heard of Institutional
Shareholder Services. "So when they do something, it only shows how
worried people are. All these ethics issues have had a terribly
corrosive effect on public trust, and that has been very bad for the
markets."</TE>

<HD>Fly on Wall May Have an Engine</HD>
<DH>Micro aircraft could serve many purposes, from exploring
space to espionage. The laws of aerodynamics are a big obstacle for
designers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>No machine, not even a $100-million jet fighter, can match the
airborne prowess of a fruit fly.</LD>
<LD>   The tiny insect can swerve into 90-degree turns that would rip
apart any aircraft. It can bound into flight even with a large part
of a wing missing. If blinded, it can navigate using its other
sensors.</LD>
<LD>   To a close fraternity of researchers, the fruit fly may hold the
key to one of aviation's boldest and perhaps most pesky challenges:
to build tiny robotic airplanes known as micro air vehicles.</LD>
<TE>   The speck-size fruit fly is the "most sophisticated flying animal
in the world," said Michael Dickinson, a leading expert on bug flight
at UC Berkeley. "Unless you totally destroy it, it'll get up and
start flying again. If we can understand how they do that, I believe
you can build almost anything better."</TE>
<TE>   Since Leonardo da Vinci first envisioned a mechanical bird,
inventors have been preoccupied with building aircraft that can go
higher and faster while carrying ever-larger loads.</TE>
<TE>   That great ambition has produced super-fast planes such as the
SR-71 spy craft and super-large passenger jets such as Airbus'
555-seat A-380.</TE>
<TE>   But now engineers are pushing in a radically different direction,
trying to design aircraft so small that in a decade or less the
proverbial "fly on the wall" may well become a technological reality.</TE>
<TE>   All sorts of people are involved in the pursuit: college students
tinkering with bat-like airplanes, professors studying hummingbirds,
weapons developers and small aerospace firms looking for the next big
product.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of micro aircraft say the uses for such vehicles are
limited only by the size of a person's imagination.</TE>
<TE>   Some envision them following a golf ball, giving television
audiences a bird's-eye view of its flight. Others see them being used
for more deadly purposes, such as carrying miniature bombs or toxins
down the air vents of bunkers or caves.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena even
believe that micro air vehicles could help NASA explore Mars for
signs of life. Others foresee a use in homeland security. A micro
vehicle could be used as a video tracking device, following suspected
terrorists or sniffing out potential chemical or biological threats.</TE>
<TE>   For Pentagon strategists, tiny planes could help U.S. military
personnel see individuals and small weapons hidden under trees or
within buildings that spy satellites and the current generation of
unmanned reconnaissance aircraft are unable to detect.</TE>
<TE>   Pioneering research is being conducted locally at universities
such as Caltech and UCLA and by companies such as AeroVironment Inc.
in Simi Valley and Lockheed Martin Corp.'s super-secret Skunk Works
laboratory in Palmdale.</TE>
<TE>   Dickinson, for instance, will be moving his research from Berkeley
to Caltech, where he says he will be able to tap some of the leading
experts on aerodynamics.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest sources of funding for research into micro air
vehicles has been the Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, or DARPA. For several years, the agency has quietly funneled
hundreds of millions into micro air projects, including Dickinson's
fly research.</TE>
<TE>   "We see a lot of utility in these small vehicles," said Jan
Walker, a spokeswoman for DARPA. She declined to say how many micro
aircraft programs exist, because some are classified.</TE>
<TE>   Developing tiny airplanes flies in the face of generally accepted
laws of aerodynamics such as lift and drag.</TE>
<TE>   These mini machines, measured in fractions of inches and ounces,
should lack the power or maneuverability to stay airborne without
floundering to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get below a certain speed and size, there is a serious
degradation of aerodynamic efficiency," said Peter Ifju, an
engineering professor at the University of Florida, where students
have been developing remotely controlled airplanes not much more than
4 inches long.</TE>
<TE>   "Large birds can soar for long periods of time without flapping,
but smaller birds and insects can't do that, because the aerodynamics
is degraded," he said. "It's another area of aerodynamics that we
don't know much about."</TE>
<TE>   Tantalizing clues are coming from nontraditional sources--from
scientists such as Dickinson to an eccentric mix of engineering
students who are tinkering with the latest advances in tiny
batteries, propulsion systems and actuators.</TE>
<TE>   Top engineering students from more than a dozen universities
around the world gather every year to test some of the smallest
planes ever built.</TE>
<TE>   Aerospace engineers say the divergent fields of study are
beginning to converge, raising prospects for the development of tiny
airplanes that could not have been imagined just a few years ago. To
some, the quest to build micro air vehicles is reminiscent of the
chaotic days of powered flight at the turn of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a disruptive technology," said Martin R. Waszak, senior
aerodynamics engineer for NASA. "It can't just come from study of
engineered structures or just from study of biological structures. It
will have to be an integration of a number of disciplines."</TE>
<TE>   Dickinson is a neurobiologist by training and began studying the
aerodynamics of the fruit fly as a way to understand how the brain
functions.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, he has poked and prodded the insect and even subjected
it to a battery of tests in flight simulators--albeit the size of
coffee cans--that would make NASA astronauts envious. One of the
simulators, attached to gimbals, twists and turns in response to
minute fluctuations in the fly's body movements.</TE>
<TE>   First, Dickinson attaches a fly to a needle--a virtual science in
itself: The fly is placed in a recessed bed that's smaller than a
grain of rice. The bed is lined with tiny holes that pull the fly's
body down with air suction and is cooled to immobilize the bug. The
point of the needle is dipped in glue, then carefully attached to the
body.</TE>
<TE>   Once the fly is tethered to the head of the needle, Dickinson
places it inside a circular chamber, where the insect is tricked into
flying in a certain direction.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic displays lining the inside of the chamber affect the
bug's view of the world by projecting different shapes and colors.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, changing the position of a black vertical line
displayed in the chamber prompts the insect to change its wing and
body movements in the direction of the line.</TE>
<TE>   A much more complex simulator dubbed the Rock &amp; Roll Arena
actually allows the fly to bank, yank and turn. The simulators,
equipped with dozens of tiny sensors and cameras, have provided
invaluable insight into how the insect flies.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular belief, flies flap their wings back and forth,
not up and down, defying the old school's theory about aerodynamics.
When the wing flaps forward, it is angled sharply upward, which would
cause most flying machines to stall and plummet to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   But instead a fly creates a so-called delayed stall, a momentary
swirl of air that it uses for lift as the wing rotates and goes over
it backward.</TE>
<TE>   It is, Dickinson said, essentially creating its own lift as it
flaps back and forth an astounding 200 times a second.</TE>
<TE>   To further study the bug's flying capabilities, Dickinson has even
built large mechanical replicas, dubbed Robofly and Bride of Robofly,
that are immersed in 2-ton vats of mineral oil to simulate and
understand what the tiny insects must be experiencing trying to fly.
The air essentially feels gooey to flying insects, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Fearing, Dickinson's colleague at Berkeley, is taking the
research one step further and has designed a half-inch-tall robotic
fly based on Dickinson's research. He recently tested a tiny wing for
the mechanical insect that flapped 150 times a second and generated
enough thrust to move itself forward about a foot.</TE>
<TE>   While Dickinson's colleagues have been able to apply his work to
design a rudimentary robotic fly, a cadre of engineering students has
been constructing traditional fixed-wing airplanes that are pushing
the limits of size from the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, student engineers gathered for the sixth annual Micro
Air Vehicle competition at a turf farm near Provo, Utah, to test
their latest experiments.</TE>
<TE>   Students from Brigham Young University won the endurance
competition with a remotely controlled plane shaped like a bat and
barely more than 4 inches long. When the competition began six years
ago, the smallest plane was 30 inches long.</TE>
<TE>   The miniature plane this year flew for more than 14 minutes,
making sharp banks, dives and climbs before coming down within inches
of its takeoff point. It was launched with a slight flick of the hand
and carried an electric motor, not much bigger than a dime, that
powered tiny propellers. It was constructed of foam and balsa wood
and packed with a transmitter, receiver and tiny controls. It weighed
slightly more than an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   Another entrant with a tiny camera in its nose transmitted video
images of a target nearly a mile away. The plane silently hovered,
barely noticeable to anyone or anything except for a few curious
swallows that flew by to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of pushing the envelope, this is cutting-edge stuff,"
said John Asplund, an aeromechanical engineer at AeroVironment, an
aerospace company that has pioneered the development of several
airplanes including Helios, which holds the altitude record for a
solar-powered aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The students' work has been getting a lot of attention from the
Pentagon, which sees potential applications including surveillance
and carrying weapons.</TE>
<TE>   There is an inherent advantage to small vehicles. They disappear
from sight a few hundred feet above the ground and are hard to detect
with radar. Even if they are detected, it's often difficult to
distinguish them from small birds or bats.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon already is testing tiny autonomous airplanes to help
an infantry unit, for instance, to see what's behind a hill or what
may be in a cave or a building.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, some of the nation's largest defense contractors also
have begun research into micro air vehicles, though with little
fanfare.</TE>
<TE>   Engineers with Lockheed Martin, Boeing Co. and Raytheon Corp. are
developing many variants of small, remotely controlled airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the planes at the Utah competition were powered by tiny
lithium batteries and electric engines that together can fit in a
matchbox. The propellers are an inch or two long.</TE>
<TE>   The students are creating leading-edge designs, NASA officials
said. The agency sponsored the competition this year, hoping to glean
from the micro air vehicle technology developed by the participants.</TE>
<TE>   "We're learning how these planes can be put together," said David
L. Raney, an aerodynamics and control engineer for NASA's Langley
Research Center in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Joel M. Grasmeyer, an AeroVironment engineer who has developed
several micro air vehicles for DARPA, says the students are doing
work that is going further than the aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   "In the next few years," Grasmeyer said, "we're going to see them
make new developments that even NASA and DARPA will be able to learn
from."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Bishops Apologize for Scandal</HD>
<DH>Religion: Church confesses failures and vows reforms as
Catholic prelates convene meeting on sex abuse. They hear from angry
victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Confessing failure, the leader of the nation's Roman Catholic bishops
opened a national meeting on priestly sex abuse Thursday by offering
"the most profound apology" for derelict leadership, begged
forgiveness and pledged to do penance by enacting tough reform
measures.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the United States
Conference of Catholic Bishops, admitted that too often bishops were
more worried about scandal than preventing abuse and too often had
treated victims as "adversaries and not as suffering members of the
church."</LD>
<LD>   Gregory called on all victims of clergy abuse to report crimes
committed against them, pledging the church's love and help in
seeking justice. He also urged all abusive priests and bishops to
step forward and confess their own crimes.</LD>
<TE>   "This crisis is not about a lack of faith in God," Gregory said.
"The crisis, in truth, is about a profound loss of confidence by the
faithful in our leadership as shepherds.... Only by truthful
confession, heartfelt contrition and firm purpose of amendment can we
hope to receive the generous mercy of God and the forgiveness of our
brothers and sisters."</TE>
<TE>   Gregory's address, which drew a sustained standing ovation, set
the tone for an opening session that featured testimony from
sex-abuse victims and the strongest criticism of the elite body ever
permitted at its national conference. The gathering, which many
bishops described as the most morose and humiliating they had ever
experienced, is devoted to the single issue of crafting what would be
the American church's first mandatory national policy aimed at
preventing clergy sex abuse against minors.</TE>
<TE>   Father Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, called
the day's events "absolutely unique and historic." In the two decades
he has attended the bishops' conferences, he said, "I've never seen
the bishops be so forthright in admitting what they did was wrong.
Instead of sidestepping and legalese ... [Gregory] confessed the sins
of the bishops publicly and promised he would make sure they would
never do this again."</TE>
<TE>   In the day's most emotional moments, four victims of priestly
abuse tearfully shared their experiences and lasting scars to the
full body of about 300 bishops--the first time victims had spoken to
a full conference.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Martin of Minnesota described the alcoholism, shattered
self-esteem and aberrant sexual behavior that his abuse at 11 by his
parish priest had triggered 35 years ago. Paula Gonzales Rohrbacher
of Alaska, who was assaulted by a seminary student as a child, spoke
of a nervous breakdown, suicidal thoughts and near divorce. Michael
Bland of Chicago chronicled how abuse drove him out of the
priesthood, even as the perpetrator is scheduled to teach at an
unnamed national Catholic university.</TE>
<TE>   And David Clohessy, the director of a national victims' advocacy
group that has become the leading moral force for change, asked
bishops to pass around a photo of a victim who committed suicide,
Eric Patterson of Kansas, and offer prayers. Clohessy and other
victims' groups have demanded the ouster of all priests who abuse
children, the removal of bishops who reassign rather than dismiss
perpetrators, and the opening of all financial and personnel records
to scrutiny by law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't settle for cheap talk, grave expressions of concern,
eloquent apologies, for pledges to do better," said Clohessy of the
Survivors' Network of Those Abused by Priests. "Hold out for the real
thing. That's what our children deserve."</TE>
<TE>   The bishops, appearing somber and spellbound, were dressed down by
two lay leaders for their arrogance, lack of accountability and
failure of moral authority.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Appleby of the University of Notre Dame told the leaders
that their negligence had placed at risk the church's moral and
pastoral mission and sent tens of thousands of good priests reeling
in shame and pain. He challenged bishops to "name the protection of
abusive priests for what it is: a sin, born of the arrogance of
power," and called on them to empower the laity, particularly women,
with greater decision-making roles.</TE>
<TE>   Several bishops said the powerful testimonies Thursday--along with
the media glare of more than 700 reporters--appeared to be
solidifying support for a "zero tolerance" policy that would oust
from the priesthood any perpetrator of sexual abuse, past or present.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, a committee of the bishops' conference issued a draft
proposal to defrock any priest guilty of sexually abusing minors
after the new policy takes effect. In a widely criticized loophole,
however, the committee proposed that priests guilty of a single
incident of abuse could be returned to ministry if they had sought
psychological counseling, were found not to be pedophiles, and had
the backing of a lay-dominated sexual-abuse committee.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, one of the conference's
most outspoken proponents of tough reform, predicted that the
loophole would be deleted from the draft proposal by the time the
bishops vote today.</TE>
<TE>   Although passage of the policy will require a two-thirds vote,
Mahony said he was pushing for unanimous backing to send the measure
to the Vatican, whose approval is required to make it binding on all
194 U.S. dioceses.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said he plans to make a full public accounting of how much
the Los Angeles Archdiocese has spent in settling sexual-abuse cases
after completing research now underway. Mahony said that a recent
spot check of 60 parishes showed no decline in Mass attendance or
contributions, and that the archdiocese had not been forced to sell
property holdings or other assets to cover legal claims.</TE>
<TE>   Addressing the rising clamor for penalties against church leaders
who cover up sexual abuse, Mahony said that any bishop who aids and
abets misconduct by reassigning rather than dismissing priests should
find it "impossible to remain in office."</TE>
<TE>   Under canon law, however, only the pope can remove a bishop, and
Bishop Anthony Bosco of Pennsylvania predicted that the draft
proposal will not include any new measures to discipline bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Even without concrete measures, Reese, the Jesuit magazine editor,
said the creation of lay-dominated review boards will "hold the
bishops' feet to the fire" by monitoring each diocese's performance
and making public those bishops who fail to aggressively implement
the reform proposals</TE>
<TE>   The leader most responsible for sparking the current
crisis--Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston--was not granting interviews.
But some bishops were reported to have privately asked for and
received apologies from him for his malfeasance in reassigning
priests who allegedly abused up to 100 children.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for San Bernardino's Bishop Gerald Barnes said Law
apologized to Barnes on Thursday for transferring the Rev. Paul
Shanley--one of several priests at the center of the national
scandal--to California in 1990 despite a history of sexual misconduct
allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Barnes accepted the cardinal's apology as "heartfelt and sincere,"
his spokesman said. "This has dissipated some of his anger."</TE>
<TE>   In a related development, a Southern California man Thursday
accused Shanley of abusing him as a child, church officials said. The
allegation--the only one brought against Shanley in California--was
made by an unidentified man to a church employee, Barnes' spokesman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gregory, without naming names, admitted in his morning remarks
that many bishops were angered by their irresponsible colleagues.
Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati, a former conference
president, said there had been "some talk" about encouraging
resignations.</TE>
<TE>   "The very solid and good work that has been accomplished by the
majority of bishops in their dioceses has been completely
overshadowed by the imprudent decisions of a small number of bishops
during the past 10 years," Gregory said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is as if the fabric of good work that has been accomplished
had never existed or had completely unraveled. The anger over this is
very real and very understandable."</TE>
<TE>   After the bishops spent three hours in closed executive session
Thursday, Gregory said they "spoke very frankly about their angers,
their fears, their disappointments." He said some unnamed bishops
"expressed regret" for their actions.</TE>
<TE>   Pilarczyk called the meeting "the most somber and the most
difficult I've ever been to."</TE>
<TE>   Bosco said it was the "worst time I've ever had as a priest."</TE>
<TE>   "People are depressed, hurt, angry shamed, sorry," Pilarczyk said.
"This is not an old-boys gathering. This is a hard-working group of
guys trying to do the right thing."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gloom, Gregory vowed to move forward. He commended the
victims' courage for sharing their painful tales and said the bishops
would move to end what he called the "cornerstone of sexual
abuse"--secrecy.</TE>
<TE>   "They not only shared their stories but more importantly, they
shared their tears, and we felt their agony," Gregory said. "We
cannot restore [their] innocent childhoods that were robbed, but we
can prevent the robbery of other children's' childhoods. This is what
we pledged to do."</TE>

<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>By any measure, the scene that unfolded at the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops meeting Thursday had all the marks of a historic
turning point in how the long-defensive church confronts its sexual
abuse crisis.</LD>
<LD>   Never before had victims of abuse by priests confronted the
bishops as a whole with agonizing personal stories of betrayal and
trauma when they were minors.</LD>
<LD>   Never before had the bishops been told to their faces by victims,
Catholic scholars and priests alike that bishops--not only priest
offenders--must be held accountable for ignoring pleas for help,
covering up for abusive priests and allowing them to continue to
minister and molest.</LD>
<TE>   And never before had the bishops, chastened and humbled by
scandal, seemed so ready to accept responsibility for a decades-long
sexual abuse crisis that has built to a crescendo in the last six
months.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's gathering was a kind of collective exorcism: The 300
bishops dared to confront their own demons, as if they might purge
them from within. They listened to several victims--their voices
choking, their eyes moist--speak of their pain in detail so graphic
that in any other circumstance it would have bordered on the
pornographic.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the bishops conference,
said flatly, "What we are facing is not a breakdown in belief, but a
rupture in our relationship as bishops with the faithful.... We are
the ones, whether through ignorance or lack of vigilance, or God
forbid--with knowledge--who allowed priest abusers to remain in
ministry and reassigned them to committees where they continued to
abuse."</TE>
<TE>   The real test of whether bishops mean what they say will come not
only with today's vote on the church's first national policy to deal
with sexual abuse. Equally important will be the years ahead, as they
demonstrate how faithful they can be in carrying out the policy.
Still, Gregory's speech--coming from a bishop in a church known for
its magisterial hierarchy and a clerical culture that often
trivialized the thoughts and suggestions of the laity--was a
confession to remember.</TE>
<TE>   Compare it to a similar gathering 10 years ago in Washington when
the bishops took up the abuse issue. Then, protesting abuse victims
were kept behind police barricades outside the conference hotel. The
best the victims could get was an impromptu meeting with a few
bishops. This time, victims are part of the formal agenda, grafted
into the policymaking process itself.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago the bishops approved a policy but made it optional
for each diocese. This time, the conference is attempting to make
national norms mandatory. How binding they will be will depend on the
Vatican's approval. In the meantime, leaders of the bishops
organization say they hope to hold their brother bishops accountable
by issuing annual public reports on how well a local bishop is
voluntarily complying.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how tough a policy bishops adopt today, they may still
be behind the curve. If they had enacted a policy like the one now
before them five or 10 years ago, they might have come off as heroes.
Instead they came up short. Now, though the victims are prepared to
applaud the new proposal, they are simultaneously saying these new
rules, by themselves, are not good enough.</TE>
<TE>   The victims are calling for something not in the policy draft: a
declaration that bishops themselves be disciplined for knowingly
foisting abusive priests on unsuspecting parishes and continuing to
put children in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   There were glimmers of light amid the shadows Thursday. They lay
in the way some of the victims went out of their way to thank their
own bishops and others in the church who had stood by them. They lay
in the words of Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, who remembered the
"stridency, almost confrontation and lots of anger 10 years ago," and
contrasted it to a new "desire and willingness to work together to
resolve this."</TE>
<TE>   And it lay in the words of David Clohessy, national director of
the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   Victims and everyday Catholics, Clohessy said, have long believed
that the only way they could exercise power in the church was to
withhold their money. Now, in the face of what could be a turning
point in the long and painful crisis of sexual abuse in the church,
Clohessy allowed that perhaps victims should withhold something else:
their judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "Dallas," Bishop Gregory told the conference, "has to be a first
step. A significant first step, but a first step." After decades of
halfhearted and tepid responses by the bishops, Gregory hopes
rank-and-file Catholics will reach one conclusion about the bishops.</TE>
<TE>   "Our people have to be able to say, 'They got it.' "</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Raging east in the pine-lined mountains above Ojai, the Wolf fire
showed no signs of slowing.</LD>
<LD>   Flames from the head of the ravenous wildfire danced and leaped
100 feet in the air as it seemed to gain acres by the hour. Rare
species, including the revered California condor, were in the path of
the blaze.</LD>
<LD>   That was the scene last week, more than 70 years since a wildfire
torched the Sespe Wilderness. Now Aaron Gelobter faced the task of
trying to stop it from happening again.</LD>
<TE>   With a low-key personality and a view of the world seen from
behind wire-rim glasses, the 50-year-old career U.S. Forest Service
worker heads the elite management crew of 44 firefighters culled from
across the state and given the difficult job of plotting the Wolf
fire's course and stamping it out.</TE>
<TE>   After some anxious moments last week, stemming from the fear that
winds could shift and push the growing blaze south into Ojai,
improved weather and a relentless assault by the more than 2,000
firefighters in Gelobter's command have slowed the fire to barely a
crawl.</TE>
<TE>   At a cost to federal, state and county agencies of more than $14
million, fire crews had the nearly 2-week-old blaze where they wanted
it Thursday and expected full containment by 6 p.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   "The most concern came the day after I got here because the fire
had made a major run at night," said Gelobter, who arrived two days
after the fire started June 1. "That caused some anxiety for me but
then I knew we could catch this thing."</TE>
<TE>   At first glance, Gelobter looks more like a college professor than
a tough-talking wildfire commander.</TE>
<TE>   But in Los Padres, he turned his troops into an army battling the
enemy. On the front fire lines, hand crews split into divisions and
hiked into the smoky Sespe Wilderness in single-file lines.</TE>
<TE>   Tired, windburned firefighters with hand radios called in air
support and talked about flanking and pinching maneuvers.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the hectic base camp at Soule Park in Ojai, Gelobter and
his planning and operations teams charted the fire on giant
topographic maps and kept in contact with crews battling the blaze on
the ground and from the air.</TE>
<TE>   Gelobter is the first to admit he has more in common with an
outdoor-loving ski bum than the hard-charging, take-no-prisoners
types who used to lead crews in to battle wildfires.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the old incident commanders were big, gruff guys who
looked like they could knock your head off," said Gelobter, a native
of Whittier who started working for the Forest Service 32 years ago.
"Now we have environmental issues and political issues. I still can
get pretty gruff, but I pick and choose my times to do that. Leading
a group means you have to have a strong presence."</TE>
<TE>   For the past two years, Gelobter has served as commander of
California Incident Management Team 4. There are five teams across
the state and 17 throughout the country, with headquarters in Boise,
Idaho. Members of the California teams come from fire departments up
and down the state and are pulled from their regular jobs when a
wildfire overpowers local fire agencies.</TE>
<TE>   That means leaving home for days or weeks at a time and taking up
residence in tents, living with portable toilets, the occasional
shower and camp food.</TE>
<TE>   Gelobter of Porterville was able to break free from the wildfire
long enough to drive home and see his son graduate from high school
last week. He was back in camp by 11 p.m. that night. He will take
another break for a few hours Saturday to see his daughter graduate
from UC Santa Barbara. Then it's back to camp for final meetings
before leaving.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Ojai fire, Gelobter has directed coverage for
wildfires as large as a 93,000-acre blaze in the Wenatchee National
Forest in Washington and as small as an 800-acre blaze this spring in
New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Like every wildfire, the Wolf fire came with a complicated jumble
of safety, environmental and political concerns.</TE>
<TE>   As the fire grew each day, so did the danger to the crews who were
dropped into the woods to fight it. A wind shift here, a spot fire
there and young fire crews--known as hot shots--could find themselves
trapped by flames.</TE>
<TE>   While never life-threatening, the wildfire had charred miles of
brush and burned into the federally protected Sespe Wilderness. Next
in its path was the condor sanctuary, the town of Piru and maybe even
Ojai.</TE>
<TE>   Although prohibited by law, bulldozers were needed to clear ground
in the fire's path to keep it from moving to the south and east.
Gelobter made a phone call to a Forest Service official who had the
power to approve the move.</TE>
<TE>   The bulldozers were soon in action.</TE>
<TE>   For those who have spent the past 12 days working with Gelobter,
his low-key, low-pressure approach is appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "He's like a calming force and you never see him rattled," said
Dennis Burns, a fire behavioral specialist on Gelobter's team and a
captain with the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department near Oakland.
"Aaron takes it to another level. He has a genuine concern for us.</TE>
<TE>   "We're leaving our families, but we're going to our second family,
and we have a common goal."</TE>

<HD>Priest's Faith Transcends the Scandals of Imperfect Church</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Whatever your take on the Catholic Church scandal, I think we can all
agree on one thing: The priesthood does not look like a particularly
attractive career choice at the moment.</LD>
<LD>   Even for the most virtuous padres who've ever worn the robes, it
must be difficult to avoid guilt by association, given the sad parade
of child molesters and cover-up artists.</LD>
<LD>   That's why I was intrigued when a monk I've known for several
months told me he was leaving the solitude of his monastery near
Palmdale and plunging into the fire of parish ministry.</LD>
<TE>   What could possibly possess someone to do this, I wondered, at
perhaps the worst moment in church history?</TE>
<TE>   As bishops met in Dallas on Thursday to apologize to victims of
sexual abuse, I hooked up with Father Paul Pluth at a Pasadena coffee
shop. Pluth and I had e-mailed and chatted by phone, but we'd never
met. He had been both a critic and defender of the church, and of my
columns, too.</TE>
<TE>   What I didn't know was that Pluth, 48, came to Catholicism
relatively late in life. In fact, he was raised a Lutheran and was a
Lutheran minister in Long Beach for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a great congregation, I had a great house, I had two dogs,
I had a Saab turbo I loved driving, and I felt lost and so
depressed," says the red-haired, blue-eyed Pluth, who grew up in
Woodland Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of his time as a Lutheran minister, Pluth kept a
secret. Early each morning, he would sneak off to a Catholic church
that was far enough away so he wouldn't be seen by a member of his
own flock.</TE>
<TE>   The diversity and fervor of parishioners attending morning Mass
made him envious, but that wasn't the only appeal. Pluth felt a
stronger connection to a higher being than he ever felt in the
Lutheran Church.</TE>
<TE>   (With regard to that last paragraph, I'll be curious to see
whether Lutherans can match the letter-writing fury of Catholics, but
I'm not expecting quite the same passion.)</TE>
<TE>   "The Catholic Church has a very real sense of transcendence,
otherness, and a mystical concept of God," Pluth says. "There was a
palpable sense that people were experiencing something meaningful and
from beyond."</TE>
<TE>   Pluth decided to stop sneaking around. He quit the Lutheran
ministry, converted to Catholicism in 1987, joined the St. Andrew's
Abbey monastery in 1988, and was ordained a priest in 1996. Not even
the scandalous headlines of the last several months have made him
regret the move for a minute.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even comprehend" how priests could abuse children, or how
bishops and cardinals could transfer them into parishes where they
would prey on more children, Pluth says. But the church is first and
foremost a "vessel in a quest for deeper meaning," he says, and none
of the current problems should get in the way of that purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "My faith is not in the institution, it's in Jesus Christ," he
says, and he believes most Catholics are with him on that, however
horrified they are by the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Every institution, and every denomination, is imperfect, Pluth
says. But the good thing about the current storm is that the church
has been forced into the kind of self-examination that will make it
more honest and responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when the stories hit the news, he was reluctant to wear the
cleric's collar on his trips into L.A. diocesan headquarters, where
he worked on a marriage tribunal, having been trained in canon law.</TE>
<TE>   But the reaction of strangers on the street lifted him. He was
treated with civility and respect, and Catholics didn't seem to have
lost their heads over the scandal. He recalls one incident in
particular.</TE>
<TE>   "I was asked for a blessing by someone on the subway, and it
almost brought tears to my eyes."</TE>
<TE>   That experience helped Pluth decide he wanted to be closer to the
heart of the church--its people. So he's taken a job in Seattle,
beginning July 1, in which he'll do canon law half the time and serve
a parish the other half. Because of a shortage of priests, that
parish is now run by a nun.</TE>
<TE>   Pluth said he hopes the born-again convention in Dallas produces a
zero-tolerance policy on sex abuse. But the more important reform, he
says, is for clergy to bring lay people in as partners in the running
of the church.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure that newspaper columnists are going to be invited to
that party. My Catholic guilt forced me to confess that some of my
readers think I'm headed for trouble in the hereafter for taking the
church to task. As one of them wrote:</TE>
<TE>   "May God Have Mercy on Your Soul!"</TE>
<TE>   I was curious to see whether Pluth thought I'd condemned myself to
eternal damnation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's ridiculous," he said. "God has a sense of humor." Besides,
he added, "You're just holding the church up to the scrutiny called
for by its own claims."</TE>
<TE>   Our loss. Seattle's gain.</TE>

<HD>Bishop Speaks Out on Church's Failures</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Excerpts from an address delivered in Dallas on Thursday by Bishop
Wilton D. Gregory at the United States Conference of Bishops,
apologizing for the church's handling of its priestly abuse scandal.</LD>
<LD>   "The crisis, in truth, is about a profound loss of confidence by
the faithful in our leadership.... [That is] because of our failures
in addressing the crime of the sexual abuse of children and young
people by priests and church personnel.</LD>
<LD>   "We did not go far enough to ensure that every child and minor was
safe from sexual abuse. Rightfully, the faithful are questioning why
we failed to take the necessary steps.</LD>
<TE>   "We are the ones, whether through ignorance or lack of vigilance,
or--God forbid--with knowledge, who allowed priest abusers to remain
in ministry and reassigned them to communities where they continued
to abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the ones who chose not to report the criminal actions of
priests to the authorities, because the law did not require this. We
are the ones who worried more about the possibility of scandal than
in bringing about the kind of openness that helps prevent abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "And we are the ones who, at times, responded to victims and their
families as adversaries and not as suffering members of the church.</TE>
<TE>   "If we bishops have learned anything, it is how devastating are
the effects of sexual abuse on the children and young people who
suffer it. Even the passage of many years does not wipe away the
memory of these terrible crimes. And so often, beyond the wounds
inflicted on the memory, a person's whole personality also shows the
results of these violations of innocence. Those of us who have not
experienced sexual abuse in our childhood can never fully understand
what it has done to you.</TE>
<TE>   "But I promise you this: We bishops will make every effort to take
on your perspective, to see the world and the church through your
eyes, and to look at our own actions over the last decade from your
point of view."</TE>

<LD>Despite the darkness on that frigid winter night, 13-year-old Qudsia
Bekeran could make out the remains of slaughtered civilians strewn
around her.</LD>
<LD>   She and her family were fleeing to Pakistan to escape the
communist regime that had seized control of her native country. The
family crossed mountains, and trudged through fields of the dead,
victims of Soviet soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   "At points you would see so many dead bodies that it was
like human life had no value," she said. "It was at that moment I knew,
if I survived, I would be fighting for peace."</LD>
<TE>   Today, as UCLA's student commencement speaker, the 27-year-old
political science graduate and women's rights activist will explain
how "education has been a weapon" in this struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Her desire to finish her education and work for peace gave her the
strength to adjust to a new country, endure the loss of her father
and flee an abusive husband, she said. Now, after earning her
undergraduate degree, she plans to return to Afghanistan and use her
experiences to tell others, especially Afghan women, what is
possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Those wouldn't be just words," Bekeran said. "I can prove it."</TE>
<TE>   She grew up as the privileged youngest daughter of a politician
loyal to the royal family of Afghanistan. As a child, Bekeran
attended private schools and was at the top of her class.</TE>
<TE>   Her father, Abdulrahman, was a confidant who taught her to value
and love learning. He served as governor of Kandahar and mayor of
Mazar-i-Sharif, among other posts. When he refused to join the
Communist Party, however, the family's comfortable life ended.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of my dad's friends were put in jail," she said. Before one
was taken away, he got a message to her father, instructing him to go
Pakistan before he and his family were captured as well. Her father
decided that Bekeran, her two older brothers, a sister-in-law and her
mother should make the trip the next day. He stayed behind for the
time being.</TE>
<TE>   Bekeran was terrified, because she had seen propaganda movies on
television illustrating what happened to families who tried to
escape. One had aired just the night before. It didn't have a happy
ending: The family was killed.</TE>
<TE>   In the morning, her family left the house one by one, the women
wearing burkas so no one would recognize them. They walked to a car
about a mile from their home. Bekeran struggled through the thick
snow that was falling, straining to move in her heavy clothing. Men
standing nearby laughed at her trouble walking, because "it looked
like I had never worn a burka before--and I hadn't," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They took a bus to another city, where a guide met them. The
family rode in a car for five or six hours in a shallow river covered
by trees to avoid notice by bombers who attacked any sign of human
life. The car got stuck in snow, however, so they walked, eventually
crossing the mountains after nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   They were careful to step exactly in their guide's footsteps.</TE>
<TE>   "On the right, we could fall off a cliff," she said. "On the left,
there was a minefield." The family made it to Peshawar, Pakistan,
where Bekeran's father joined them 10 days later. There, Bekeran
attended a high school for Afghan refugees and earned her diploma
when she was 15. Already fluent in Persian and Pashtu, she studied
Arabic and picked up Urdu.</TE>
<TE>   The family sought political asylum in the United States.
Meanwhile, her father pushed her to become engaged to a dangerous
Pakistani man, afraid that he would harm the family if she refused.
He said she could break the engagement once the family arrived in
America.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving her fiance behind, she settled in Redondo Beach with her
family. Then 17 years old, Bekeran enrolled at Mira Costa High School
in Manhattan Beach and began to learn English.</TE>
<TE>   Six months later, her father died of a heart attack. "It was then
I knew I lost my hopes and dreams," she said.</TE>
<TE>   With her father gone, her older brothers insisted that she return
to Pakistan and honor her marriage commitment "to save the family
name," she said. She returned and married the man, who she said
abused her physically and emotionally. But she devised a plan of
escape: She gained his permission to go back to Redondo Beach by
promising to bring him there, though she had no intention of
following through.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the U.S., she used her knowledge of the Koran and Islam to
persuade her family that this abusive marriage violated their
religion. The idea that women should submit to their husbands no
matter what "has to do more with custom and culture than religion. If
I didn't know about Islam, I wouldn't have known my rights."</TE>
<TE>   Although she is still afraid of her husband, Bekeran does
not allow the fear to interfere with her activities--including her
plans to return to Afghanistan and work for women's rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't just hide for the rest of my life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In this country, she tried to focus on earning her degree. It was
tough finding a balance between working, studying and caring for her
mother, who developed Parkinson's disease as soon as Bekeran's father
died.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she was valedictorian at El Camino College in Torrance,
where her papers and speeches focused on women's issues, she said.</TE>
<TE>   After transferring to UCLA in 2000 as a political science major,
she became active as a speaker for the Afghan Women's Mission, a
Pasadena-based fund-raising organization.</TE>
<TE>   Then came Sept. 11 and American involvement in the war in her
homeland. Suddenly, fellow students and others showed more interest
and respect for her insight into the Taliban and its treatment of
women, she said. She empathizes as well with American citizens; she
remembers what it is like to run for her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt the fear they are going through," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bekeran has admirers in many quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a tremendous testimony about what it's like to be
oppressed as a woman," said Steve Penners, president of the women's
mission.</TE>
<TE>   That testimony is what prompted a UCLA committee to select her as
a commencement speaker. She wrote a proposal for the talk the day it
was due. After learning of the competition at the last minute, she
skipped a class to put her thoughts into words. When she learned she
had won, "all the hair on my body stood up," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She intends to go to law school, although she first plans to
return to Afghanistan. Later, she would like to work for the United
Nations.</TE>
<TE>   Those close to her believe she will succeed in her quests,
especially Ann Brown, Bekeran's English teacher at Mira Costa High
and now a close family friend. "She has an incredible nobility about
her, " Brown said.</TE>

<HD>Stadium Planner Reveals Location</HD>
<DH>Sports: Group led by Philip Anschutz repeats threat to drop
bid for an NFL team if opposition doesn't soften. Coliseum boosters
won't relent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT and SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The group behind a drive to bring a National Football League team to
Los Angeles pinpointed for the first time Thursday a four-block area
near Staples Center where they hope to build a 64,000-seat stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz told
downtown business leaders and civic activists that they hope to build
the $450-million stadium on land bounded by 11th Street and Pico
Boulevard, and Hope and Olive streets.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, they issued yet another statement that they will
walk away from the deal if their proposal continues to draw strong
opposition from government officials and others hoping to attract an
NFL team to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   "We will not go through a major political battle because we are
trying to do something good for Los Angeles," said Tim Leiweke,
president of Anschutz Entertainment Group. "Two sites competing
against one another is an absolute invitation to be used and abused
by the NFL."</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz's plan to build a downtown stadium--on land in the city's
South Park area, currently occupied primarily by parking lots and
warehouses--has been questioned by some city and county officials in
recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite promises from the would-be developers that no public money
will be needed for the project, some local leaders worry that
taxpayer money ultimately would be used to underwrite it. County
officials plan to file a lawsuit next week challenging the city's
redevelopment plan, litigation that could block construction. Others,
meanwhile, have suggested that the Coliseum or even the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena would be more suitable sites for an NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there are many in Los Angeles who have a lot of questions
about this," Councilman Jack Weiss said. "People don't understand why
the city should rush headlong into this kind of commitment."</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor James K. Hahn on Thursday continued to voice strong
support for the AEG proposal, calling it "the only game in town." He
also expressed concern that support for the Coliseum--in lieu of the
South Park site--could undermine efforts to get a football team.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there really has been a pretty strong signal from the NFL
that they have no interest in the Coliseum," Hahn said. "I hope we
are not spinning our wheels and wasting our time by talking about
it."</TE>
<TE>   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, appearing last month at a league
owners meeting in Houston, was asked whether the renovation of the
Coliseum remains a viable option. He answered, "No."</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Leiweke told members of the Central City Assn.,
gathered for a breakfast meeting, that he believes the Anschutz plan
represents Los Angeles' best chance for bringing an NFL team back to
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to do the right thing here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Joined by Casey Wasserman, owner of the Arena League L.A.
Avengers, Leiweke released other new details about the proposed
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The plan envisions a tiered facility that would offer a view of
downtown Los Angeles. And the stadium's facade would resemble that of
Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke and Wasserman also spoke optimistically about holding
Super Bowls, NFL Pro Bowls, soccer's World Cup and other events at
the site.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the Anschutz development group--which includes
Wasserman, supermarket mogul Ron Burkle and developer Ed
Roski--initially proposed renovating the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   At two early meetings with the NFL, "we were begging, pleading,
cajoling them into the Coliseum," Leiweke said. "It didn't work. Per
the NFL, we were directed to other locations."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said the Anschutz group has already spent $5 million on
the proposal. In coming weeks, it would have to spend tens of
millions more to exercise options on the purchase of the land.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke warned last week that threats of legal action, public
complaints and the possibility of competition from the Coliseum have
so frustrated Anschutz and members of the development team that they
are "close" to pulling out.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they think we're bluffing, and I don't think we're
bluffing," Leiweke said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He also scoffed at recent suggestion by city and county officials
that the Coliseum remains a viable location for an NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lynch, the Coliseum's general manager, responded: "Not only
are we viable, we were viable in '99," when the Coliseum was in line
for an expansion franchise that ultimately went to Houston. "And
we'll be viable into the future.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't believe me, talk to our leadership, the historical
preservationists, the construction people, the architects and the
Community Redevelopment Agency."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas and County Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky said the city should demand that the NFL take another
look at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the NFL has a warped idea of what the Coliseum is,"
Yaroslavsky said. "You've got a bunch of owners who remember things
from 25 or 30 years ago and don't think anything has changed."</TE>
<TE>   Ridley-Thomas said Anschutz "should have never accepted the NFL's
assertion that the Coliseum was unacceptable. They have to stand up
for Los Angeles and its assets."</TE>
<TE>   To make the AEG plan work, the city would have to float up to $100
million in low-interest municipal bonds to pay for land for the
stadium. That money would be repaid through taxes on tickets, sales
taxes and excess property taxes, with the developers promising to
make up any shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke said Thursday that current projections peg the annual
shortfall at $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   Developers also must come up with ways to mitigate traffic in the
area, including rerouting Grand Avenue--which would dead-end at 11th
Street on the north and Pico Boulevard on the south under the plan
unveiled Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "There are obviously planning issues that need to be dealt with,"
said Councilwoman Jan Perry, who represents the area. "The proposal
will evoke strong reactions, pro and con. I am optimistic we can
provide a process and a public forum so we can deal with and confront
those issues."</TE>
<TE>   Others remained concerned about the stadium's impact on housing.
Some of the land slated for the stadium was supposed to be turned
into homes, said Marie Condron, who runs the www.newdowntown.com
online message board. "South Park was supposed to be a residential
hub," she said.</TE>

<HD>Conservatives and Liberals Are Unified by Church Sex
Scandal</HD>
<DH>Catholicism: The traditional adversaries find common
ground, but also hope that by bashing bishops they can advance their
own opposing agendas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Through their mishandling of the abuse crisis, America's Catholic
bishops have unified a collection of dissident groups that for years
lobbied with little impact for competing causes within the church.</LD>
<LD>   Now they are bashing the bishops.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic conservatives, some of whom historically blamed priestly
abuse on homosexuality, and progressives, some of whom blamed it on
celibacy, were standing together Thursday on the premise that the
church's bishops should be held accountable for failing to rein in
predatory priests.</LD>
<TE>   In the 93-degree heat outside the bishops' national conference and
in meeting rooms across the city, they talked about the heady, albeit
unlikely, prospect of forcing the resignation of any bishop who
allowed an errant priest to roam parishes or schools.</TE>
<TE>   The momentary alliance between people historically at odds over
everything from birth control to women's ordination stunned some
observers.</TE>
<TE>   "When the right and left come together," said Mary E. Hunt, a
Catholic feminist theologian, "you know a revolution is happening."</TE>
<TE>   The bishop-bashing could be read on the signs of protesters
standing outside the conference's headquarters at the Dallas Fairmont
Hotel: "We Want Holy Bishops, Not Paranoid CEOs" and "Zero Tolerance
for Bishops' Sex Abuse Politics."</TE>
<TE>   The common goal is natural, said Michael Brennan, 59, of
Rochester, N.Y., a member of Concerned Roman Catholics of America, a
conservative group. He stood behind police barriers with signs
quoting Pope John Paul II: "Everyone Can Recognize When Someone Has
Committed a Crime."</TE>
<TE>   Protection of children and the bishops' cover-up of abusive
priests are easy rallying points for both sides. But self-interest
also has propelled them. With bishops weakened by the crisis, the
activists see a vacuum that could be filled by their personal cause,
whether it's barring homosexuals from seminaries and the ministry or
allowing women to become priests.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither the right nor left has any power," said Frances Kissling,
president of Catholics for a Free Choice, a liberal group. "The
conservatives are just as weak as we are. The bishops have had all
the power."</TE>
<TE>   As an illustration, the advocates cite the draft of the bishops'
sexual abuse policy that was released last week and will be voted on
today. Nowhere in it did the bishops--who run individual dioceses and
report directly to the Vatican--place accountability measures on
themselves in case they were found to have protected a molesting
priest.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, when news reports of abuse and lax personnel
oversight began to mushroom throughout the nation, stories of bishops
failing to oust errant priests have become almost routine. On
Wednesday, the Dallas Morning News published a survey stating that at
least two-thirds of the bishops who head the 194 U.S. dioceses
allowed priests with credible allegations of sexual abuse in their
past to continue in ministry. Many worked among children.</TE>
<TE>   "They have no policies to deal with themselves," Kissling said.
"And they are the ones who really fueled the scandal by moving
priests and insisting on confidentiality agreements."</TE>
<TE>   The eruption of the scandal has allowed various advocacy groups to
promote long-standing causes as part of the solution. For example,
some conservatives believe a homosexual subculture has been allowed
to develop within the church and led to a loosening of sexual morals.
Some liberals have argued that sexual abuse shows that mandated
celibacy doesn't work and that married and female priests are needed
for a healthy clergy.</TE>
<TE>   At the conference, these theories have drifted into the background
while the bishops' responsibility has been pushed front and
center--even overshadowing the conduct of abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   "Bishops are supposed to be shepherds, and a good shepherd lays
down his life for their sheep when they're attacked by wolves," said
protester Lisa Nicholas, a 44-year-old graduate student at the
University of Dallas. "These bishops are even more at fault than the
priests."</TE>
<TE>   The prelates' lack of action spurred Juan and Sara Perez,
conservative Catholics from Phoenix, to drive 1,000 miles to Dallas
to protest outside the conference.</TE>
<TE>   "We want back our clean, beautiful Catholic Church with holy
bishops and cardinals," said Sara Perez, a 52-year-old grandmother of
three, wiping her brow with a handkerchief. "We are tired of this."</TE>
<TE>   Progressive Catholics from a variety of advocacy groups who met
Thursday at a nearby Dallas hotel said they had little hope that the
conference would end with any bishops resigning or putting
significant penalties in place for their own misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   But they said they were encouraged that public pressure had forced
the bishops to at least consider such proposals during a closed-door
session Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "They are being put on the spot, and don't they deserve it," said
Ruth Hittner Steinert, a self-described radical feminist from
Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Many believe that the marriage of convenience is fragile; some are
simply relishing it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't consider it to be strange bedfellows," said Hittner
Steinert. "The Holy Spirit works to bring people together with
fundamental truth, and support has come from those who most
vehemently oppose us. The fundamental truth is: Many bishops have
lied, embraced self-preservation and faced nothing."</TE>

<HD>EPA Proposes Easing Rules on Air Pollution for Industry</HD>
<DH>Policy: Administration plan would relax controls for plants
when they are built or expanded. Democrats assail the changes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In an overhaul of the Clean Air Act, the Bush administration proposed
Thursday to relax rules that require a host of industries to
strengthen pollution controls whenever they build new plants or
expand old ones.</LD>
<LD>   The changes, announced by EPA Administrator Christie Whitman, have
been long sought by power companies, chemical firms, paper mill
operators and other major industries.</LD>
<LD>   In Congress, reaction from Democrats was swift and angry. Sen.
James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.), chairman of the Environment and Public
Works Committee, said he plans to hold joint hearings with the
Judiciary Committee this year to examine how the EPA reached its
conclusions.</LD>
<TE>   "This appears to be the biggest rollback of the Clean Air Act in
history. Instead of taking us forward on environmental initiatives
the Bush administration continues to move us backward," Jeffords
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) accused the EPA of reneging on a
pledge to ensure strict air quality. "Last month the EPA made a
commitment to me that refineries in California would not get off the
hook when it comes to meeting environmental standards,'' she said.
"This decision goes back on this promise.''</TE>
<TE>   In May, however, 26 members of Congress, mostly Republicans,
called for a revamping of new source review in a letter to the EPA in
May.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials and environmentalists oppose the proposal as a
serious blow to Clean Air Act enforcement, particularly in the
Northeast and Midwest.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA's proposed revision of the so-called new source review
program reflects concerns by businesses that the program is often
difficult to interpret and creates uncertainty and costly delays.
Those drawbacks sometimes impede plant upgrades, including use of
energy efficient equipment, Whitman said.</TE>
<TE>   New source review is a "valuable program in many respects, but the
need for reform is clear and has broad-based support," Whitman said.
"Our review clearly established that some aspects of the program have
deterred companies from implementing projects that would increase
energy efficiency and decrease air pollution."</TE>
<TE>   Critics charge that the EPA proposals give polluters too many
breaks and are a product of intense political lobbying by industry
representatives who worked last year with Vice President Dick Cheney
to draft the administration's national energy plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these changes represent weakening from the status quo.
These are a step back from what we currently require from industry.
We will have less environmental protection and air pollution will
suffer accordingly," said S. William Becker, executive director of
the Assn. of Local Air Pollution Control Officials, which also
represents air quality officers in the states.</TE>
<TE>   New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer said that the EPA's revisions
violate the Clean Air Act and that he intends to challenge them in
court.</TE>
<TE>   "[President] Bush is seeking an opportunity to keep the dirtiest
power plants on line without an obligation to increase their
emissions control technology," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are seeing today is a direct outgrowth of Cheney's energy
plan, which was a product of the lobbying of the energy industry, not
solid thought and analysis," Spitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   Northeastern states, which are downwind of coal-fired power plants
in the Midwest that lack advanced pollution controls, have spent the
last three years suing utilities to force compliance with new source
review requirements. Some of those cases have been settled, but state
prosecutors say the proposed changes could hamper their ability to
pursue new cases.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA is pursuing seven major regulatory changes, three of which
will become final after a review by the White House Office of
Management and Budget later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Four of the proposed rule changes require public comment over the
next year.</TE>
<TE>   New source review is an arcane, but pivotal, component of the
Clean Air Act. The Bush administration's proposed changes would be
among the most ambitious attempts to alter the law in a generation.
For more than 25 years, the reviews have been the principal tool
regulators used to ensure that business growth does not lead to
dirtier air. Since new source review went into effect in 1970,
pollution levels have fallen dramatically at the same time the
economy has grown substantially.</TE>
<TE>   "It has generally worked very well. It has pushed companies to
find new and better technologies and it cleans the air,'' said Mike
Scheible, deputy director of the California Air Resources Board.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses, however, have long considered the program a major
headache. It requires new or expanding plants to install the best
available controls, which can knock out smokestack pollution by 95%,
but cost millions of dollars, as well as offset any new pollution
they cause by paying for greater emission reductions from nearby
businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Yet exactly when and where those provisions apply at a complex
industrial facility is frequently a source of contention. Disputes
sometimes drag on, and the EPA says businesses lose precious time and
advantage in the marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA says its proposed changes will make the process less
opaque and more streamlined and will provide flexibility for
business.</TE>
<TE>   One change calls for putting a limit on all of a factory's
polluting equipment and allowing the company to choose the most
cost-effective reductions, rather than requiring specific reductions
on each individual piece of equipment. Other proposals call for
rewriting rules governing how emission reductions are to be measured
when clusters of polluting equipment are added to a facility at once.
Another change would ease the way pollution is to be reduced when one
small change in a plant affects the whole operation.</TE>
<TE>   "Business planners need the certainty these new rules help
provide," said Michael Baroody, vice president of the National Assn.
of Manufacturers.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms "will help remove regulatory roadblocks that have kept
us from pursuing those goals," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the EPA plan is too sweet a deal for industry.</TE>
<TE>   For example, one change the EPA advocates would allow a polluter
to avoid requirements to use state-of-the-art controls by claiming
credit for an antipollution device installed up to 10 years ago at a
plant.</TE>
<TE>   Critics also fault the way the EPA proposes to define "routine
maintenance" at a plant. Repairs and maintenance are exempt from new
source review requirements, but the EPA is considering broadening the
exemption by waiving the regulation if annual upgrades total less
than 15% of the replacement cost of the facility, Becker said. That
would allow a $1-billion refinery, for example, to upgrade its plant
by as much as $150 million per year without triggering new controls.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy over new source review is the latest flash point
between clean-air advocates and the Bush administration. The two
camps have been at odds over global warming, diesel pollution
controls and enforcement of clean-air laws.</TE>
<TE>   The lobbying effort by manufacturing and power industries over new
source review has been prolonged and intense. Influential Republicans
working on industry's side include Haley Barbour, the former
Republican National Committee chairman; former Montana Gov. Marc
Racicot; and former White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the EPA's chief enforcement officer, Eric Schaeffer,
resigned, in part because of what he charged were attempts by
administration officials to stall new source review requirements. He
charged that the Bush administration was intent on weakening air
pollution controls.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>The Boston Archdiocese's chancellor answered questions under oath
Thursday about a broken financial settlement with alleged victims of
a now-defrocked priest.</LD>
<LD>   Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney for alleged victims of John
Geoghan, deposed David W. Smith, the archdiocese's chief financial
officer, in preparation for a July 21 hearing at which a judge will
hear arguments on the enforceability of the settlement.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the archdiocese backed out of the settlement, under
which the church was reportedly to pay $15 million to $30 million to
86 alleged victims of Geoghan. The archdiocese cited concerns that
not enough money would be available for future settlements.</LD>
<TE>   Transcripts of Thursday's deposition were not made public.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt as though this guy was holding a lot back," said Patrick
McSorley, who says he was abused by Geoghan. "When he commented on
his thoughts that [the attorneys] weren't going to get all 86
plaintiffs to sign, he was really surprised that we all did."</TE>
<TE>   An archdiocese spokeswoman did not return calls for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Geoghan is serving a nine- to 10-year sentence for fondling a
10-year-old boy in 1991. He is accused of molesting more than 130
other people.</TE>
<TE>   The revelation that the archdiocese moved him from parish to
parish after learning of abuse allegations sparked the scandal
rocking the Roman Catholic Church.</TE>

<HD>In Texas, Bush Gives GOP His All</HD>
<DH>Politics: If Democrats win elections in the Lone Star State
this fall, it will embarrass the president. Then there's the matter
of U.S. Senate control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Little would give Democrats greater satisfaction this year than to
embarrass President Bush with November victories in the Texas
governor and U.S. Senate races.</LD>
<LD>   The outlook for the Democratic candidates is hazy, at best.
Businessman Tony Sanchez is far behind in the gubernatorial race.
Former Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk is in a tight Senate race, but he, too,
is trailing at the moment.</LD>
<LD>   Still, Bush is taking few chances, even though a popular president
shouldn't have to be too concerned about the prospects of home-state
politicians he supports.</LD>
<TE>   So he has already attended one fund-raiser for Atty. Gen. John
Cornyn, the Republican seeking the U.S. Senate seat that Republican
Phil Gramm is vacating, and he is going out of his way tonight to
help Gov. Rick Perry's election campaign. Perry, who was Bush's
lieutenant governor, acceded to the governorship in December 2000
when Bush left Austin for Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The president will be the draw at two receptions in Houston that
the Perry campaign says should add $1.5 million to the governor's
campaign treasury.</TE>
<TE>   When it is released this weekend, the Texas Poll, sponsored by
several Texas newspapers and television stations, will show Perry
leading Sanchez by a 20-percentage-point margin; in the Senate race,
Cornyn has a 5-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   A Democratic victory in either would be a personal blow--and
possibly worse--to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the home-state factor and the Senate factor at work,''
said Bruce Buchanan, a political science professor at the University
of Texas at Austin and an expert on the state's politics.</TE>
<TE>   Control of the Senate, which is now Democratic by one vote, hangs
on several races across the country. Losing the Texas seat held by
Gramm would make it all the more difficult for the GOP to regain a
majority.</TE>
<TE>   But the gubernatorial race is particularly sensitive. Bush and
Perry have been political allies for longer than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Gov. Perry is building on the strong education, health-care and
economic foundation that George W. Bush worked so hard to achieve
during his time in the governor's office,'' Perry spokesman Ray
Sullivan said, making the point that Bush has a "vested interest'' in
the outcome of the race.</TE>
<TE>   And if that wasn't enough, he said, Karl Rove, Bush's chief
political advisor, and others in the White House "have been checking
in regularly.''</TE>
<TE>   Republicans' concerns about winning the top statewide races in
Texas are forcing the president to play defense, protecting his
personal turf. That's not exactly where he would like to be.</TE>
<TE>   "You never want to be forced to defend your own territory,'' said
a Republican who has worked for Bush and is active in party politics
in Texas. He said the president would prefer to come to Texas just
for recreation at his ranch and devote his political time to close
Senate races in other states.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush cannot take his party's chances in Texas for granted.</TE>
<TE>   For several election cycles, Republicans have carried the three
major races in the state: Republicans hold both U.S. Senate seats,
Bush was a two-term governor, and his strength at the top of the
ticket helped elect Perry to the post of lieutenant governor in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be an embarrassment if Republicans didn't carry all of
these races,'' Buchanan said. "It would be a stinging rebuke to Bush
not to carry any of these seats. He doesn't want to read
international headlines about not carrying his state."</TE>
<TE>   Both the Cornyn and Perry campaigns expect Bush to return for
campaign visits again before the November election. His fund-raising
stop tonight is being added to the end of a day that begins with a
commencement speech at Ohio State University.</TE>

<HD>In Colo. Blaze Battle, 1st 'Real Counterpunch'</HD>
<DH>Fire: In less combative weather, 1,000 firefighters dig
fire lines and pilots employ military planes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The weather finally cooperated with crews battling a 100,000-acre
wildfire south of Denver. Pilots attacked the blaze from the air,
using borrowed military tanker airplanes, while nearly 1,000
firefighters made a stand on the ground Thursday, backed by long
lines of fire engines.</LD>
<LD>   "Things have been pretty quiet today. For the first time, they
were able to get on it," said Pam Devore of the U.S. Forest Service.
It was the first day that firefighters were placed on the fire's
north end, which had been burning out of control.</LD>
<LD>   Even as they offered some good news, fire officials told
beleaguered evacuees that it could take as long as three months to
contain the Hayman fire, the largest in Colorado's history.</LD>
<TE>   As of Thursday evening, the Hayman fire was 20 miles long and 14
miles wide, spreading north from Lake George about 80 miles southwest
of Denver and burning to the city's southern suburbs. More than 6,000
suburban-town residents had been evacuated, and thousands more
remained on alert.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's strategy was to encircle the fire with crews digging
fire lines and defend homes in the fire's path. Reinforcements from
across the country bolstered the firefighting effort, the most
intensive since the fire broke out in the Pike National Forest on
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first day we've had a real counterpunch," said Rep.
Scott McInnis (R-Colo.), who toured the burn area with Forest Service
head Dale Bosworth.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis said the Hayman fire had been particularly fierce in the
forests above 9,000 feet. "It's like gunpowder up there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McInnis said the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Thursday
gave Colorado $20 million toward the cost of fighting the seven major
fires raging in the state. Altogether, 150,000 acres were burning
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Forest Service officials told Congress that the
Colorado fires were costing $3 million a day to fight and warned that
the government's $383-million fund for fighting wildfires would be
exhausted by the end of July, when the fire threat in the West
usually peaks.</TE>
<TE>   The huge fire south of Denver continues to throw off incredible
heat. Meteorologists said the Hayman fire's 15,000-foot smoke plume
was spawning nightly thunderstorms in neighboring states and had
triggered two tornadoes that spun through Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   The dense smoke has often grounded tankers and helicopters. Even
when water-carrying helicopters have been able to dump their loads of
thousands of gallons of water on the fire, the heat in the upper
atmosphere has been so intense that most of the water evaporated
above the treetops.</TE>
<TE>   Officials warned that one day of reasonable conditions would not
make much of a dent in the Hayman fire.</TE>
<TE>   Unpredictable winds in part caused on-again, off-again evacuation
orders, frustrating thousands of residents. Many have chosen to clear
out.</TE>
<TE>   The fire, with its sudden directional changes, trapped and killed
about 30 head of cattle on the loose from a burned dude ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was 5% contained as of Thursday evening, officials said.</TE>

<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Many of the flags that have been waving furiously since Sept. 11 have
reached their tattered end and will be disposed of ceremonially today
in Flag Day observances around the country.</LD>
<LD>   Civilians inexperienced in the proper disposal of a worn-out U.S.
flag--folding and burning it in a solemn ceremony--have turned to
groups like the American Legion or the Veterans of Foreign Wars.</LD>
<LD>   "We call it 'disposing of the flag,' " said Ernie Sanchez, 62,
past commander of American Legion Montoya y Montoya, Post 1, in Santa
Fe, N.M. "We don't 'burn' the flag. Only hippies burn the flag,
antiwar radicals of the '60s and '70s. We dispose of them properly."</LD>
<TE>   "To me this is a special day, like the Fourth of July, if not even
more so," Sanchez said.</TE>

<DL>ROSEAU, Minn.</DL>
<LD>ROSEAU, Minn. -- Exhausted residents were rescued from their flooded
homes Thursday, and National Guard helicopters air-dropped sandbags
to those still fighting record floods that inundated much of Roseau,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   More than half of the 2,800 residents of the northwestern
Minnesota town hard by the Canadian border boarded National Guard
trucks to be evacuated, said Roseau Police Chief Ward Anderson.</LD>
<LD>   Some holdouts remained to battle the record-high Roseau River,
swollen by a foot of rain that fell over the weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a lake around my house--and it's not beachfront
property," Anderson joked.</TE>
<TE>   So far, sandbaggers aided by construction crews have managed to
save the town's school complex, its hospital and its leading
employer, Polaris Industries Inc. Polaris, which makes snowmobiles,
provided all-terrain vehicles to those who needed to ford the waters.</TE>
<TE>   A thin drizzle added to the gloom Thursday, as boats patrolled the
surrounding region of sugar beet and wheat farms, much of it
submerged. Thirteen northern Minnesota counties were under a state
emergency.</TE>

<DL>HUNTSVILLE, Texas</DL>
<LD>HUNTSVILLE, Texas -- Texas executed a former nurse's aide by lethal
injection Thursday for shooting a service station clerk in the face
during a January 1996 robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Reneau, 27, and an accomplice, Jeffery Wood, took a safe
and cash box containing $11,350 in cash and checks from the Texaco
service station in Kerrville, Texas, after Reneau shot the
31-year-old clerk, Kris Keeran.</LD>
<LD>   Wood was also convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death
for his role in Keeran's death.</LD>
<TE>   He is on death row in Texas but his execution date has not been
set.</TE>
<TE>   Reneau and Wood were arrested the next day after witnesses
described their appearance. Reneau, the 16th person executed in Texas
this year and the sixth this month, did not make a final statement.</TE>
<TE>   Since resuming capital punishment in 1982, after the U.S. Supreme
Court lifted a national ban on the death penalty, Texas has executed
272 people, far more than any other state.</TE>

<HD>Hundreds Attend Gotti Wake</HD>
<DH>Tribute: Mobster to get two days of private viewing. A
memorial Mass will be after burial.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of mourners filled a funeral chapel overflowing with flowers
Thursday to bid private farewell to a very public mobster: John
Gotti, once the most powerful Mafia boss in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Gotti, renowned for his $1,800 suits, pinkie ring and lavish
lifestyle, was returned to his native New York after his death Monday
from cancer. His wake was held in a funeral home in a working-class
neighborhood in Queens borough.</LD>
<LD>   The wake was scheduled for a second day today, with burial
Saturday. There will be no funeral Mass for Gotti, the Diocese of
Brooklyn decided, although a memorial Mass will be held after the
burial.</LD>
<TE>   At the Papavero Funeral Home, a closed coffin containing the
"Dapper Don" sat in the front of the chapel. Dozens of wreaths--many
in red and white carnations--filled the room.</TE>
<TE>   "To the chief," read the card on one wreath, while another bore
the name of Gotti's old Queens hangout, the Bergin Hunt and Fish
Club.</TE>
<TE>   "John, we love you," read another card. "You will always stay in
our hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Gotti, 61, died in a prison hospital in Missouri a decade after
his conviction for murder and racketeering ended his run as mob boss.
He ascended to the top of the Gambino crime family in 1985 with a
street hit on his predecessor, Paul Castellano.</TE>
<TE>   Among those expected to miss the wake were Gotti's two brothers,
Gene and Peter, and his son John.</TE>
<TE>   All three were behind bars when Gotti died.</TE>
<TE>   Gotti's gold coffin was flanked by a pair of candles flickering
behind red glass.</TE>
<TE>   A collection of family pictures was on a table near the coffin; on
a glass coffee table stood a framed photo of a tanned, smiling Gotti.</TE>
<TE>   Men in dark suits greeted one another with a kiss on the cheek.
Within the first hour of the wake, several hundred people had already
come to visit with the Gotti family.</TE>

<HD>Jury Hears Taped Calls in Smuggling Case</HD>
<DH>Crime: N.C. finishes arguments against brothers accused of
aiding Hezbollah with cigarette profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Prosecutors wrapped up their case Thursday against two brothers
accused of supporting a Lebanese guerrilla group with profits from
cigarette smuggling.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors played taped telephone calls for the jury, including
conversations alleged to be between defendant Mohamad Hammoud and a
senior Hezbollah official.</LD>
<LD>   According to an English translation of the calls in Arabic between
Hammoud and Sheikh Abbas Harake, Hammoud asks whether he can send a
gun to Lebanon and wants Harake to put a scare into Hammoud's nephew.</LD>
<TE>   "I want you to rough him up a little," Hammoud tells Harake, who
agrees to help out after the nephew beat Hammoud's niece.</TE>
<TE>   Hammoud, 28, and his brother Chawki, 37, are accused of operating
a smuggling ring that took cheap North Carolina cigarettes to
Michigan, where they were resold without that state's higher taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The government says the operation was run by the Hammouds and
others as part of their Charlotte-based Hezbollah support cell.</TE>
<TE>   A 1996 anti-terrorism law makes it illegal to provide material
support to Hezbollah and other groups designated as foreign terrorist
organizations by the State Department.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Deke Falls said Mohamad Hammoud wanted to take the
stand in his defense.</TE>
<TE>   "He is determined to exercise his constitutional right to
testify," Falls said. "He is determined to tell his side of the
story."</TE>
<TE>   As the mostly Arabic phone conversations were played over
courtroom speakers, jurors read English translations that scrolled on
computer screens.</TE>
<TE>   In many of the calls, Lebanese men living in Charlotte excitedly
discussed Israel's withdrawal from their country in May 2000 and
Hezbollah's activities.</TE>
<TE>   In one call recorded May 22, 2000, a man known only as Kamal asks
co-defendant Ali Hussein Darwiche, "They've withdrawn and the Hizb
[Hezbollah guerrillas] went in?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, yeah, they went in.... The Hizb went in on them," Darwiche
replied.</TE>
<TE>   In a call five days later, Harake, who is in Lebanon, told Mohamad
Hammoud, "I swear, all we're missing is for you to come and see this
honor," apparently referring to the Israeli withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   Hammoud replies, "Yeah, yeah, we were burning up here on TV as
we're seeing all these scenes, something that drives us crazy."</TE>
<TE>   On July 11, 2000, Hammoud asked Harake whether the military
commander would be able to retrieve a gun from the airport for him if
he sent it to Lebanon by plane.</TE>
<TE>   Harake also tells Hammoud: "Pray for us in New York on some
skyscraper. Go up and you'll be a little closer [to God]."</TE>
<TE>   After the prosecution closed its case, Falls called a handful of
witnesses, including several members of Charlotte's small Lebanese
community.</TE>
<TE>   They said they attended Thursday night Muslim prayer meetings at
Hammoud's home but were never asked to donate to Hezbollah, as
several prosecution witnesses have testified.</TE>
<TE>   Other defendants in the case, which began with arrests in late
July 2000, have entered guilty pleas. Several testified for the
prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted and sentenced at the maximum level on all counts,
Hammoud could spend the rest of his life in prison. Chawki Hammoud
faces a lighter sentence.</TE>

<HD>Cabinet Security Proposal Sailing Through Congress</HD>
<DH>Defense: Democratic, GOP leaders to push for quick passage
of Bush's anti-terrorism initiative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>With a major shove from top Democrats usually at odds with President
Bush, congressional leaders on Thursday accelerated their drive to
win swift approval of his far-reaching homeland security plan.</LD>
<LD>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) told reporters he
hopes to pass a bill creating the Cabinet-level Department of
Homeland Security by late July, before Congress breaks for its summer
recess.</LD>
<LD>   In the House, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) and Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) announced a road map for action.
The bipartisan strategy, Gephardt said, would "bring the bill to the
floor quickly so that our new Homeland Security Department can get up
and running as soon as possible."</LD>
<TE>   Gephardt has set the most aggressive timetable for the measure,
pushing for final congressional approval by the anniversary of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Bush has embraced that goal, though some
leading Republicans caution that more time may be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's announcements, coming one week after the president
announced his proposal to create what would be the third-largest
Cabinet department, offered the strongest confirmation yet that many
lawmakers from both parties are eager to give Bush's plan their
blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that attitude is tempered by the certainty that crafting
the legislation will prove difficult as Congress puts its own stamp
on the president's plan. And some senior lawmakers are warning
against haste.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not rush into it and figure out that we've done something
wrong at a later date," said Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska). He chairs the
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which oversees
some agencies, including the Coast Guard and Transportation Security
Administration, that would be swept into the new 169,000-employee
department.</TE>
<TE>   History suggests the difficulties Congress may face as it seeks to
clear a government reorganization plan this year. A case in point is
the consolidation most often cited by the Bush administration as a
comparison to its proposed Homeland Security Department: the creation
of the modern Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   It took President Truman more than a year and a half to convince
Congress to merge the armed services after World War II. Before he
could launch the Defense Department, Truman had to overcome enormous
infighting within his military and on Capitol Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Several other Cabinet departments created since then were also
debated for a year or more before winning congressional approval. And
some presidential reorganization plans were rejected altogether.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts and lawmakers say the dynamic this year is different.
Lawmakers are keen to help Bush restore a sense of safety to the
nation that long considered itself almost immune from foreign attack.</TE>
<TE>   "This responds to an immediate threat and has so much force behind
it," said Stephen Hess, a presidential analyst at the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. "People are scared.
They want all the protection they can get. They want to feel secure."</TE>
<TE>   Leading Democrats are joining the president's call for rapid
action on the Homeland Security Department, in part because they are
reluctant to cede an election-year issue to Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle noted that Democrats had pushed a reorganization plan
similar to Bush's through the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
earlier this year over GOP objections--"Before it was cool," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle said the committee, chaired by Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman
(D-Conn.), would consider Bush's plan even before it is formally sent
to Capitol Hill in coming weeks. Senate leaders would then settle on
a compromise bill to be moved to the floor by mid- to late July, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The House plan announced by Hastert and Gephardt would set up a
procedure to ensure the bill moves quickly.</TE>
<TE>   First, the House Government Reform Committee and other panels
would examine the legislation. Then it would be refined by a special
committee, chaired by House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas),
before moving to a floor vote.</TE>
<TE>   The procedure allows the House leaders to give the Government
Reform chairman, Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), a key initial role. But it
also puts the leaders in position to overrule him and other committee
heads if the legislation seems to be spinning out of control.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge continued his
drive to win congressional support for the Bush plan. Ridge briefed
senators behind closed doors, a day after doing the same with House
members.</TE>

<HD>Church Can Shelter Homeless on Steps</HD>
<DH>Court: Order bars New York from removing people sleeping
at Fifth Avenue Presbyterian.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court has ruled that homeless people can seek
evening shelter on the steps of a prominent church in a prime
Manhattan shopping and tourist area.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed Wednesday a lower
court's temporary order stopping New York City from removing homeless
people sleeping on property owned by the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian
Church, across the street from the Trump Tower and Tiffany's.</LD>
<LD>   "The church has demonstrated ... that its provision of outdoor
sleeping space for the homeless effectuates a sincerely held
religious belief and therefore is protected under the Free Exercise
clause" of the 1st Amendment, the three-member panel said.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, the church officially designated two areas, the landings
within its arched entryways and its front steps, as evening shelter
for the homeless. The church said it considers its outdoor space a
sanctuary for homeless people who do not want to sleep in shelters.
About 20 to 30 people would spend the night on its steps and
perimeter property.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the city told the church it would no longer allow the
homeless to sleep on the property. On three occasions in December,
police removed people staying outside the church during the night.</TE>
<TE>   The church sued the city Dec. 17, during the final weeks of Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration.</TE>
<TE>   It said in court papers that it is "commanded by Scripture to care
for the least, the lost and the lonely of this world," and, in
ministering to the homeless, the church is "giving the love of God."</TE>
<TE>   A district judge found that the church had shown a likelihood of
success on the merits of its claim if the case went to trial, and he
issued an order stopping police from removing people staying on the
church's steps and landings.</TE>
<TE>   Although the judge said the city could prohibit people from
sleeping on sidewalks surrounding the church, he ruled that the
church's steps are not covered by city regulations.</TE>
<TE>   The trial judge held that allowing people to sleep on the private
property constitutes protected religious activity because doing so
enables the church to interact with and help the homeless in
bettering their lives.</TE>
<TE>   On appeal, the city argued that it has the power to enforce
minimum standards for unregulated shelters and that the church
violated local zoning laws.</TE>

<HD>Politics May Stall Aid for Terror-Hit Insurers</HD>
<DH>Funding: Parties split in Senate over whether people harmed
in attacks should be able to sue companies for punitive damages.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>While Congress tries to move quickly on creating a Department of
Homeland Security, partisan bickering threatens to stall another
element of the U.S. response to terrorism, providing temporary
financial help to insurers in the event of future attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate grappled anew with the issue Thursday, but a chasm
exists over one dispute: Whether people harmed in a terrorist attack
should be permitted to sue companies for punitive damages.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush asked for legislation months ago that would address
warnings from insurers that they could not cover liability costs from
a future terrorist attack without government assistance.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats and Republicans agree such a measure is urgently needed,
especially as insurers have stopped writing terrorist insurance
policies or have dramatically raised premiums, making it difficult
for businesses to secure loans for projects.</TE>
<TE>   But Bush's economic advisors have said they would recommend a
presidential veto if the bill sent to him includes a
Democratic-backed provision allowing companies to be sued for
punitive damages. Republicans say that would amount to a second
attack on business.</TE>
<TE>   ''First, you've been attacked by the terrorists.... Then you're
going to be attacked by the lawyers,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell
(R-Ky.).</TE>
<TE>   Democrats accuse Republicans of holding hostage America's economic
security to force through an agenda that has nothing to do with the
terrorism threat.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Democratic-led Senate turned back a GOP effort to
strip the insurance bill of the provision allowing victims to seek
punitive damages. The provision's backers say such damages would be
justified in cases in which businesses failed to take reasonable
precautions against terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But with the GOP-led House opposing the provision, prospects for
agreement on a final bill appear bleak.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate worked Thursday to try to pass its version of the bill,
with some lawmakers holding out hope that a compromise is possible.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is a test in our post-9/11 world,'' said Sen. Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.) "Can this body deal in a bipartisan way with a
complicated issue that is vital to our future? We have to be in a new
frame of mind. We have to come together.''</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has repeatedly prodded the Senate to act.</TE>
<TE>   ''No measure is more important to mitigating the economic effects
of terrorist events than the passage of terrorism insurance
legislation,'' Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and the president's
other economic advisors wrote Senate leaders earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   But the dispute over punitive damages is part of a longtime
Republican effort to rein in the costs of lawsuits, including
limiting the fees of trial lawyers. And it has become a political tug
of war between Bush and the top Democrat in Congress, Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.</TE>
<TE>   After months of unsuccessful negotiations with Republicans on the
issue, Daschle decided to bring the bill to the Senate floor.</TE>
<TE>   ''We cannot afford to let this critical measure be held hostage
any longer by a handful of senators who want to use it to pass
extraneous measures,'' Daschle said. ''The risks to America's
economic security is too great.''</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed Senate legislation, the total paid by
individual insurers after a terrorist attack would be based on their
market share. The government would pay 80% of the remaining losses
for an attack costing less than $10 billion and 90% for one costing
more than $10 billion.</TE>
<TE>   The program would be in effect for the rest of this year, with a
possible one-year extension. The temporary backstop is designed to
give the insurance industry time to find a better way to deal with
terrorist risks.</TE>
<TE>   Under the House bill, when claims from an attack exceed $1
billion, the government would cover 90% of the losses, up to $100
billion. The government would recoup its money from an assessment on
insurance firms and perhaps a surcharge on policyholders.</TE>
<TE>   Estimated claims from the Sept. 11 attacks total $50 billion,
which the insurance industry has said it expects to be able to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Julie Rochman, a spokeswoman for the American Insurance Assn.,
said that she hopes the dispute over punitive damages doesn't derail
the entire bill.</TE>
<TE>   She said of the provision on punitive damages: ''If it's in there,
that's great. But the underlying legislation is so important to us
that we would hate to see it fall because of that partisan debate.''</TE>
<TE>   An estimated $7 billion worth of commercial real estate activity
has been suspended or canceled because of the lack of terrorism
insurance, according to the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   Clifton Rodgers, senior vice president of the Real Estate
Roundtable, a Washington-based lobbying group, called the bill
''vitally important, not just for real estate but for other business
sectors ... as well as the state and local governments that have to
insure infrastructure, such as bridges and tunnels.''</TE>

<HD>Missing Girl's Family Is Examined</HD>
<DH>Crime: Salt Lake City police consider relatives one of many
avenues in the Smart investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>Police acknowledged Thursday that they were looking at the extended
family of the teenage girl apparently kidnapped at gunpoint from her
home, but they said it was not the main avenue of the investigation.</LD>
<LD>   "I would say [it is] one of many theories," said Salt Lake Police
Capt. Scott Atkinson. On the ninth day of the search for 14-year-old
Elizabeth Ann Smart, police also were looking at the neighborhood and
everyone who knows the teen.</LD>
<LD>   In a story in Thursday editions, the Salt Lake Tribune reported
that detectives believe a family member could have been involved
because they have been unable to explain how the abductor could have
entered the house through the small window that appeared to be the
entry point.</LD>
<TE>   The story said investigators have surmised that a window screen
appeared to have been cut from the inside, possibly to make it look
like a break-in.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper said its information came from four sources. But
detective Dwayne Baird told Associated Press that "whoever made
reference to four law enforcement sources was not referring to the
inner circle" of investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's extended family is large. Her mother, Lois, is the
second-youngest of eight siblings; her father, Ed, is the
second-oldest of six. She has at least 70 first cousins.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday afternoon, David Francom, Elizabeth's uncle, told
reporters the family isn't concerned about the newspaper's report and
that they know it's "police procedure."</TE>
<TE>   "We have full faith and confidence in the investigation," he said.
"We have cooperated in every way that we have been asked."</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper report followed a day of intense hunting for a
26-year-old transient who police said might have information about
the teen's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Bret Michael Edmunds was identified through a partial license
plate number provided by a milkman who had seen a car in the
neighborhood June 3, two days before the kidnapping.</TE>
<TE>   A statement signed by Ed Smart said the family had looked at
Edmunds' photograph and did not recognize him.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister, Mary Katherine Smart, described the
kidnapper as a 5-foot-8-inch man. Edmunds is 6 feet, 2 inches tall
and weighs 235 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't think he's a suspect at this point," police spokesman
Fred Louis said Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Metal Detectors Will Take Center Stage in New Era</HD>
<DH>Security: Old machinery causes many checkpoint delays. Not
under the TSA, Washington says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Airline passengers have grown accustomed to long lines at security
checkpoints as they wait to pass through metal detectors. Most accept
the inconvenience patiently--even patriotically--as a necessary
consequence of increased security.</LD>
<LD>   But it turns out that many of the delays are the result of
obsolete equipment rather than keen vigilance. They stem from metal
detectors that can't distinguish pocket change from a pistol,
government and industry officials say.</LD>
<LD>   Moreover, many of the current airport magnetometers have other
flaws that make them less than 100% effective at finding real
weapons. For example, they don't measure down to the floor and
therefore would miss a knife that was artfully concealed in a shoe.</LD>
<TE>   "The old ones kick out about 25% to 30% of the people going
through," said Rep. Harold Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of a House panel
that oversees transportation funding. "The new ones kick out about 7%
and measure all the way to the floor. They are capable of discerning
the difference between a tack in your shoe and a weapon."</TE>
<TE>   The government has promised that passengers will have to wait no
more than 10 minutes to clear checkpoints after federal screeners
complete their takeover of security this fall at 429 airports with
regular airline service. The lowly metal detector is belatedly
emerging as one of the main variables in that equation.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of people are now being pulled aside and "wanded" with
hand-held metal detectors because they set off an alarm at the
initial screening. With newer machines, about three-quarters of those
passengers would pass through with no problem. "Hopefully, there'd be
a lot less shoe-removing," Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   Metal detectors received scant attention after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, as
Congress focused on requiring checked bags to be screened for
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the machines in use at airports were inherited from the
airlines, which had a long-standing policy of keeping security costs
as low as possible. Now, the Transportation Security Administration
is scrambling to write tougher standards for airport metal detectors.
Congress is considering authorizing $20 million to $25 million to buy
modern machines as part of an emergency funding bill for
anti-terrorism programs.</TE>
<TE>   "A new specification is being developed," said Ken Lauterstein,
security technology manager for the TSA. "Within the security area,
equipment becomes obsolete as time goes on. This is part of our
continuous improvement program."</TE>
<TE>   The vagaries of airport metal detectors have mystified Mark
Greenfield, a Los Angeles lawyer who regularly travels on business.
After the attacks, Greenfield began packing his keys, change, cell
phone, pens and other metallic items in a plastic bag. He places that
in his briefcase, which goes through the airport X-ray machine.</TE>
<TE>   Greenfield reasoned that a little preparation on his part would
keep him from setting off alarms and having to undergo wanding. But
that's not always the case, he has found.</TE>
<TE>   "I have had business trips where, in the course of the same day, I
have gone through two or more metal detectors wearing the same
clothing and accessories," Greenfield said. "One I set off, and the
other I didn't, but nothing on my person had changed."</TE>
<TE>   When a metal detector beeps, Greenfield said he usually is wanded
and asked to remove his shoes for inspection. Sometimes, he also is
patted down.</TE>
<TE>   To Rogers, that represents a waste of taxpayer money. Unreliable
equipment means the TSA has to hire thousands of additional employees
to perform wand searches and shoe checks that might otherwise be
unnecessary. With a projected force of 65,000 screeners, the TSA is
on its way to becoming the biggest federal law enforcement agency.</TE>
<TE>   "If [new] magnetometers can save the need for a lot of
hand-wanders and shoe-carriers and all of that, let's do it now,"
Rogers said. "It would save the need for a lot of personnel, not to
mention the inconvenience to travelers."</TE>
<TE>   Metal detectors work by generating an electromagnetic field and
then measuring changes in that field caused by the presence of metal
objects. Newer metal detectors can direct operators to the area of
the body where a gun or knife might be hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say that federal aviation security authorities
have not taken a close look at metal detector technology for a
decade. In the meantime, Canada and Europe have instituted more
rigorous standards and purchased modern machines for their airports.</TE>
<TE>   The current U.S. standards, written by the Federal Aviation
Administration, are geared to finding guns, not knives. An industry
paper circulating in Washington says that the U.S. standards now in
force only require a detection rate of 83% for a test sample of three
firearms.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, the FAA had little or no interest in metal detectors
and spent most of its time on explosives detection," said aviation
consultant Douglas Laird, a former security director for Northwest
Airlines. "Now that TSA is taking over security, it's facing a
dilemma."</TE>
<TE>   As the TSA develops new standards for metal detectors, one issue
is whether the agency will require 100% detection of test weapons
before it approves a particular brand of machine. Accuracy in finding
knives is another.</TE>
<TE>   Lauterstein, the TSA official, declined to release any details
about the new standards under discussion. However, he hinted that
they would require machines that can find hidden knives as well as
guns.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're looking to process hundreds of people an hour, you
don't want a line three blocks long," Laird said. "You need a metal
detector that has the ability to differentiate between box cutters
and a pocketful of quarters."</TE>

<HD>As Treaty Dies, Missile Site Born</HD>
<DH>Defense: Work is to begin Saturday on a test facility for a
planned shield system.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The death of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty on Thursday
cleared the way to begin digging interceptor silos in Alaska and for
futuristic missile tests barred by the pact.</LD>
<LD>   A groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled Saturday at Ft. Greely,
Alaska, where President Bush plans a test facility that he hopes
could also serve as an emergency defense by September 2004.</LD>
<LD>   And Thursday night, an interceptor rocket fired from a Navy ship
off Hawaii slammed into a dummy warhead in space in a success for a
troubled part of the U.S. missile defense program.</LD>
<TE>   The exercise showed that a rocket guided by a warship's radar
system can knock down a medium- or long-range missile under
controlled conditions. Pentagon officials said the test wasn't meant
to be realistic but would help gather data to guide further
development of ship-based antimissile systems.</TE>
<TE>   The missile test would have been legal under the treaty, and the
timing of the test was "sheer coincidence," said Chris Taylor, a
Missile Defense Agency spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   No coincidence, however, was the start of earthwork for silos to
house future interceptors at Ft. Greely, about 100 miles southeast of
Fairbanks. Breaking ground for a national missile defense base was
barred by the treaty.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said Thursday that Bush was
committed to deploying a missile defense "as soon as possible to
protect the American people and our deployed forces from the growing
risks of terrorist nations or terrorists possessing weapons of mass
destruction."</TE>

<HD>Judge to Let Moussaoui Represent Self at Trial</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: Sept. 11 plot suspect alludes to 'secret
evidence' and mistaken identity. He makes 'a bad situation more
difficult,' the court tells him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge on Thursday grudgingly allowed accused terrorist
Zacarias Moussaoui to represent himself at his upcoming conspiracy
trial, but an upset Moussaoui demanded to be freed from prison
immediately because he says authorities are wrongfully trying to
implicate him in the Sept. 11 hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   Moussaoui, declared mentally competent moments earlier by U.S.
District Judge Leonie Brinkema, told a packed federal courtroom he
has ''secret evidence'' showing that authorities on both sides of the
Atlantic have been trailing him for years.</LD>
<LD>   ''I have physical evidence that the government was monitoring my
movements since I entered the United States of America.... They knew
I was not in contact with these people who are supposed to have done
the hijacking,'' he said.</LD>
<TE>   Moussaoui, the only person charged in the United States as part of
the Sept. 11 conspiracy, insisted on giving a street address in
London where he said armed British police raided his home in 1998.
That address alone, Moussaoui said, should be enough to ''see me
leaving the jail today.''</TE>
<TE>   The defendant was so adamant about giving the London address,
spelling the street and coming back to it several times, that FBI
agents in the courtroom had it checked out to make sure it was not a
coded message to outside terrorists, according to a law enforcement
source who asked not to be identified. The address appeared to match
an address where he had actually lived.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities suspect Moussaoui was slated to be the ''20th
hijacker'' had he not been jailed in Minneapolis last summer on an
immigration violation after he acted suspiciously at a flight
training school. Although prosecutors have not alleged that Moussaoui
had any direct contact with the 19 hijackers, they say his
activities--in attending flight training school and receiving a
$14,000 wire transfer from a suspected terrorist--mirrored those of
the Sept. 11 terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's latest dramatic court appearance included none of the
violent invective that marked an earlier diatribe in April, when he
stunned the courtroom by calling for the destruction of America and
Jews everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   But in his dialogue with Brinkema on Thursday, Moussaoui ratcheted
up his charges that the government--and his former defense
attorneys--were conspiring to have him killed. He said that is why he
wants to defend himself, perhaps with help from an unidentified
Muslim lawyer who contacted him a few months ago.</TE>
<TE>   ''My life is at risk and I will never compromise it,'' Moussaoui
said. ''My life is very precious to me, it is given by God, and I
will not play with it.''</TE>
<TE>   Former defense attorney Frank Dunham Jr., who was relegated to the
role of ''standby'' counsel midway through the hearing after the
judge ruled that Moussaoui could represent himself, told reporters
that the defendant's conspiracy theory is the ''rambling'' of a
disturbed man.</TE>
<TE>   Dunham and colleagues on the former defense team said Moussaoui's
conspiracy defense was news to them.</TE>
<TE>   ''If you try to figure out the significance of anything he said,
you're wasting your time,'' Dunham said. Calling Moussaoui's decision
to be his own lawyer ''a disaster," he added: "There's no way he can
get a fair trial representing himself.''</TE>
<TE>   The judge herself told Moussaoui--who is not a lawyer but says he
received a master's degree in business in England--that she thought
his decision was unwise. ''You make a bad situation more difficult,''
Brinkema said.</TE>
<TE>   Among a host of potential problems cited by the judge and
attorneys in the case, Moussaoui will likely be denied access to
sensitive national security material that would normally be reviewed
by defense attorneys, and it could take him months to prepare for a
trial tentatively scheduled to start at the end of September.
Moussaoui agreed to accept a computer at the jail to prepare for the
case only after the judge assured him that his former attorneys will
not set it up.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the judge said that, based in part on a psychological
evaluation and the observations of Moussaoui's jailers in Alexandria,
she believes he is mentally competent to represent himself. She then
asked Moussaoui whether he understands how serious the charges
against him are and that several counts carry a mandatory sentence of
life in prison without parole, or the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   ''I understand fully the gravity of the charges,'' Moussaoui said
in a clipped French accent. ''I understand fully the U.S. system of
justice, and [if convicted] I will never see the light again.''</TE>
<TE>   Brinkema concluded that, although Moussaoui's decision is clearly
unorthodox, ''I'm satisfied that you understand what you are doing by
waiving your right to counsel.''</TE>
<TE>   The judge was reluctant to let Moussaoui delve into his
proclamations of innocence, cutting him off repeatedly as he began
making cryptic allegations about the ''secret evidence'' against him.</TE>
<TE>   ''You've won your motion. That's the end of it,'' Brinkema said.</TE>
<TE>   But Moussaoui insisted that the judge was trying to ''censure''
him, saying he could prove his case in just 10 minutes. Ultimately
the judge gave him a few minutes to expand on his theory.</TE>
<TE>   In discussing the government surveillance against him, he referred
several times to a police raid at his home in London.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Scotland Yard declined to discuss any intelligence
that may or may not have been gathered on Moussaoui. The spokesman
did say, however, that on Jan. 29, 1999, uniformed police went to the
address to follow up on a public complaint against a man believed to
be in possession of a firearm who reportedly entered the apartment.</TE>
<TE>   ''There was no one on the premises fitting the description given
and no one was found to be in possession of a firearm. No arrests
were made,'' the spokesman said. He would not say whether Moussaoui
was linked to the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui also appeared to suggest he was the victim of mistaken
identity and that another man at the Minnesota flight school was the
one involved in the hijackings.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said the issue was irrelevant to the motions she was
hearing and that Moussaoui could explore the question later. He vowed
to bring an ''emergency motion'' to have himself freed so he could
leave jail as soon as Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   His mother sat in the second row in traditional Muslim headdress.
The emotional Aicha Moussaoui, who lives in France, stood up as her
son entered the courtroom in prison garb and met with him afterward
in private for the first time since his imprisonment. ''He will
always be my son,'' she told reporters later in French.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Pakistan officials confirmed that they have detained
several U.S. citizens in recent weeks, but they downplayed any Al
Qaeda or Taliban connections. Two Afghans who apparently have U.S.
citizenship were taken into custody Wednesday on charges of illegally
crossing the frontier, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   However, law enforcement officials in the Northwest Frontier
Province said the arrests occurred Tuesday in the South Waziristan
agency and that only one of those detained had a U.S. passport. The
authorities there released no identities of the detained individuals
but said they appeared to have no links with the Taliban or Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, officials said, the men had served with the Northern
Alliance, which fought the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and were believed to
be on a mission to recruit local tribesmen for the new Afghan army.</TE>

<HD>W. Nile Virus' Spread Feared</HD>
<DH>Health: The disease has established itself in the East and
may hit other parts of U.S., CDC says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>ATLANTA --West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne illness that has killed
at least 18 people in the United States since 1999, has established
itself in the eastern half of the country and threatens to spread to
other parts of the Americas, U.S. health experts said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   A report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said the virus, which can cause deadly brain inflammation in humans,
birds and horses, was detected in 359 counties in 27 U.S. states and
the District of Columbia last year, including 16 states previously
free of the disease.</LD>
<LD>   Nine Americans died in 2001 after contracting the virus and 57
others were infected, according to the CDC</LD>
<TE>   Officials with the CDC have been tracking West Nile since it
struck the New York City area three years ago, killing seven people
and infecting dozens of others.</TE>
<TE>   They said they expected the virus to continue expanding into
unaffected areas, largely through the migration of infected birds.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on what we've seen in the last couple of years, there is no
reason that the virus wouldn't continue to expand its geographical
range within the United States," said Dr. Stephen Ostroff, acting
deputy director for the CDC's National Center for Infectious Disease.</TE>
<TE>   Ostroff added there was nothing stopping the virus from marching
into the Caribbean and Central and South America, which had ecologies
he described as "conducive" to its spread.</TE>

<HD>Plutonium Will Be Sent to S.C.</HD>
<DH>Court: Governor's suit to halt nuclear shipments is
dismissed. He says he'll try to block transfers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFFREY GETTLEMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>AIKEN, S.C.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge Thursday threw out South Carolina's lawsuit to halt a
massive plutonium shipment, clearing the path for 34 tons of
radioactive material to begin arriving here as early as next week
despite intense local resistance.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Jim Hodges repeatedly has threatened "to do whatever it
takes" to stop the shipment. He has even vowed to lie down in the
road if necessary.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, Hodges took a less dramatic tack, stressing he would
pursue all available "legal means," starting with an appeal of the
judge's decision.</LD>
<TE>   "This is bad for the people of South Carolina, very bad," he said.
"We'll go all the way to the Supreme Court if that's what it takes."</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he still plans to stage a roadblock as a last
resort, the governor abruptly called an end to his news conference
and drove off.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued a
statement saying "the department intends to proceed with those
shipments."</TE>
<TE>   Abraham didn't provide a date--that's classified, his spokesman
said. But energy officials had set Saturday as the earliest they
could start moving plutonium from the Rocky Flats nuclear facility
near Denver, where much of it is stored.</TE>
<TE>   "We're working under the assumption there won't be a blockade,"
Energy spokesman Joe Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's developments were the latest volleys in the clash over
the fate of the nation's stockpile of weapon-grade plutonium: 34
tons; enough for 5,000 nuclear bombs.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute has pitted the Energy Department against South
Carolina, home to the Savannah River Site nuclear facility, 200 miles
east of Atlanta, where energy officials intend to recycle surplus
plutonium into nuclear power plant fuel. The recycling is part of an
arms control agreement with Russia.</TE>
<TE>   Hodges has said he doesn't trust the federal government to follow
through on its plan to build a pioneering recycling facility. Despite
assurances from Abraham, Hodges worries that the dangerous material,
coveted by terrorists, will be abandoned at the Savannah River Site.
He has accused Energy officials of favoring Rocky Flats to help
reelect Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.). Energy officials have denied
these claims.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Hodges, a Democrat who also is up for reelection this
fall, asked U.S. District Judge Cameron McGowan Currie to delay
shipments until the Energy Department further studies the matter. In
his motion for an injunction, he accused the department of violating
the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to file supplemental
environmental reports after plans changed about how to store the
plutonium.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we're the repository, we can't tell the government
what to do--we wish we could, but we can't," said Hodges' attorney
Bill Want. "All we can ask is that they do some serious environmental
reviews before jumping into this."</TE>
<TE>   Energy Department lawyers responded that all environmental and
safety issues had been analyzed. They pointed to a series of studies
going back to 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Currie agreed and not only dismissed Hodges' bid for an injunction
but also granted summary judgment, throwing the case out.</TE>
<TE>   "There were detailed studies," she said, "and the courts have
consistently ruled that federal courts must defer to the judgment of
the agencies." But Currie did not go so far as to grant the
department's request to preemptively stop Hodges from staging a
roadblock.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to presume the governor will break the law."</TE>

<HD>Ailing, Orphaned Orca Captured</HD>

<DL>OFF VASHON ISLAND, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Orca experts on Thursday captured an orphaned 2-year-old female whose
growing coziness with humans had raised fears she could injure
herself or capsize a small boat.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,200-pound killer whale--known to be infected with worms and
a skin condition--approached capture boats on her own, and crew
members acclimated her to their presence by scratching and petting
her for at least half an hour. Finally, a crew member looped a rope
around her tail and she was guided into a sling, then hoisted by
crane onto a 65-foot powered barge.</LD>
<LD>   She appeared to offer little resistance after some initial
splashing when the rope was looped. She was released into a nearby
net pen.</LD>
<TE>   "It went very smoothly," said Lynne Barre, an observer and
fisheries biologist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration. "We saw very little splashing. She seemed to be under
control very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The operation was led by Jeff Foster of Auburn, who has caught and
tagged orcas for the Norwegian government and assisted in the as-yet
unsuccessful effort to return long-captive adult killer whale
Keiko--star of the movie "Free Willy"--to the wild near Iceland.</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Bishop Apologizes to Parishioners for Affairs</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SHRUB OAK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>A New York bishop who admitted having affairs with women has written
a letter of apology to parishioners, saying "there is no excuse
possible" for what happened.</LD>
<LD>   James McCarthy, 59, resigned Tuesday as pastor of St. Elizabeth's
in Shrub Oak and as an auxiliary bishop of the New York Archdiocese
after a woman revealed to Cardinal Edward Egan that she had had a
sexual relationship with McCarthy.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot begin to imagine the thoughts and emotions which are
yours because of my sinfulness so many years ago," McCarthy wrote in
a letter posted Thursday on the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton parish Web
site.</LD>
<TE>   "I am truly sorry and apologize to you. I wish it were possible
for me to do this kneeling before each of you individually,
especially the younger members of Seton," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The bishop acknowledged an improper relationship more than two
decades ago with a woman of about 21, and admitted improper sexual
contact with other women.</TE>
<TE>   "Let it be absolutely clear that I take full responsibility for my
sinfulness," he wrote. "It is not the fault of my accuser or anyone
else. My behavior was wrong and betrayed the trust the Church placed
in me."</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, who had been at the parish six years, was a secretary to
the late Cardinal John O'Connor.</TE>

<HD>$21 Million for Shipwreck Victims' Kin</HD>
<DH>Settlement: Coast Guard rescue effort was called
'substandard.' Government doesn't appeal verdict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLESTON, S.C.</DL>
<LD>The federal government will pay about $21 million to two families of
three children who drowned in 1997 after their sailboat wrecked on
the Charleston Harbor jetties in a storm.</LD>
<LD>   The wreck and the Coast Guard's failure to find the children after
one boy radioed a partial distress call led to a nationwide review of
Coast Guard rescue policies. A federal judge ruled last year that the
children could have been saved had the Coast Guard conducted a proper
search.</LD>
<LD>   The government had until Wednesday to appeal but decided against
it, said Charles Miller, a Justice Department spokesman.</LD>
<TE>   The award to the families, $19 million plus nearly $2 million in
interest for the time the case was on appeal, will come from a
special Treasury Department fund to pay judgments.</TE>
<TE>   "The loss for both of these families has been so dramatic and
emotional," attorney Gedney M. Howe III said. "It's great that it's
over and that they can heal and move on, hopefully in a positive
way."</TE>
<TE>   Michael Cornett, 49, of Hiltons, Va., and his sons, Michael Paul,
16, and Daniel, 13, died in the wreck of the Morning Dew in December
1997. Bobby Lee Hurd Jr., their 14-year-old cousin from Mountain
City, Tenn., also died.</TE>
<TE>   The families alleged that the Coast Guard botched the search after
one of the boys radioed for help, and U.S. District Court Judge David
Norton agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "This tragedy was avoidable," Norton wrote in his ruling last
year. "It was not an angry sea or cruel weather that impeded the
Coast Guard's ability to rescue the ... Morning Dew's passengers. It
was human error, the impetuous termination of a search and rescue
mission."</TE>
<TE>   As the boat foundered, Daniel Cornett radioed a partial mayday. A
Coast Guard officer said he tried to return the call but got no
reply. Later, the officer said he did not hear the word mayday.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours after the call, a crewman on a container ship reported
hearing cries for help from the water. A harbor pilot notified the
Coast Guard and returned to the area, but no Coast Guard rescue
mission was started at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The National Transportation Safety Board concluded Cornett's
failure "to adequately assess, prepare for and respond to the known
risks" of an open ocean voyage was the probable cause of the wreck.
But it also called the Coast Guard response "substandard."</TE>

<HD>Jury Gets Case of Infant Starved Over 'Prophesy'</HD>
<DH>Court: The boy's father, a sect leader, admits he let the
child waste away because of a perceived order to deny food.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAUNTON, Mass.</DL>
<LD>Jurors began deliberating the murder case Thursday of a religious
sect leader who admitted that he watched his 1-year-old son starve to
death because he believed a miracle would save the boy.</LD>
<LD>   The jury must decide whether Jacques Robidoux is guilty of
first-degree murder, a lesser charge or should be acquitted in the
1999 death of his son, Samuel.</LD>
<LD>   Robidoux, 29, a leader of a small sect known as "The Body,"
testified that he watched the infant waste away over 51 days after
Robidoux's sister received a prophesy that they should withhold solid
food from the child.</LD>
<TE>   His attorney, Francis O'Boy, maintained that something other than
starvation could have been the cause of the baby's death.</TE>
<TE>   The jury deliberated for four hours Thursday without reaching a
decision. They were to resume today.</TE>
<TE>   In closing arguments, O'Boy urged jurors to recognize that
Robidoux acknowledged his mistakes and find him not guilty. He noted
that the sect did not believe in modern medicine, and he suggested it
might have been ignorance on the part of Robidoux that led to the
boy's death.</TE>
<TE>   "He's no John Gotti," O'Boy told jurors. "He's somebody who's
willing to come before you and say, 'I did something wrong.' Was that
something wrong the cause of death? You've got to decide."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Robidoux saw his son dying over the period in
which he allowed the infant to feed only on his mother's breast milk,
which had started to run dry because his mother had become pregnant
again.</TE>
<TE>   "You certainly can't hide behind your religion and say, 'I had to
let my son starve to death,' " prosecutor Walter Shea said.</TE>
<TE>   The defense put on its only witness, other than Robidoux, earlier
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Forensic pathologist Dr. Jeffrey Hubbard testified he could not
establish a cause of death, though he acknowledged he had written a
report that listed starvation as a possibility. He said the boy also
could have suffered from scurvy.</TE>
<TE>   Medical experts who testified for the prosecution during the
seven-day trial said the brittle, porous condition of Samuel's bones
suggested malnutrition as the cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Robidoux testified Wednesday that his wife, Karen, wanted to feed
the boy solid food, but he wouldn't allow it because he believed it
would have violated a prophecy from God that had been related by his
sister, Michelle Mingo.</TE>
<TE>   "She had been reading the Bible and she had come across three
different scriptures. One of them was Karen had pride and
foolishness, that she was vain because of the way she looked ... and
that God wasn't happy with that," he testified.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Robidoux faces a later trial on a charge of second-degree
murder. Mingo faces trial on a charge of assault and battery on a
child.</TE>

<HD>Spacewalkers Turn 'Surgeon,' Replace Arthritic Joint in
Wrist of Robot Arm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Two spacewalking astronauts successfully performed wrist surgery
Thursday on the international space station's 58-foot robot arm,
replacing an arthritic joint.</LD>
<LD>   "Time to wake up the patient and see how the big arm's doing after
surgery," Mission Control said after the repairs made by Franklin
Chang-Diaz and Philippe Perrin.</LD>
<LD>   Half an hour later, after power coursed through the arm, Mission
Control declared success.</LD>
<TE>   "There have been surprises we encountered," Chang-Diaz radioed
down. "But with everyone's help, we got the job done."</TE>
<TE>   It was the first repair work done on the billion-dollar mechanical
arm since its launch to the station over a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   One of the three wrist joints in the Canadian-built high-tech
construction crane seized up in March.</TE>
<TE>   NASA managed to work around the problem during a building project
in April but wanted the joint replaced in case more trouble
developed. Without a reliable robot arm, space station construction
would come to a halt.</TE>

<HD>House OKs Tax Relief for Married Couples</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>House Republicans pushed through legislation Thursday granting
permanent tax relief to married couples, overriding Democratic
complaints that they were draining Social Security trust funds to
gain election-year advantage.</LD>
<LD>   The 271-142 vote sent the bill to the Senate, where Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) gave it a tepid reception.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't want to have a $42-billion annual tax increase that goes
into effect Jan. 1, 2011, because people are married," said Rep. Roy
Blunt (R-Mo.).</LD>
<TE>   But Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said the bill is part of a "fiscal
irresponsibility rampage" by Republicans, coming on the heels of last
week's bill making estate tax repeal permanent.</TE>
<TE>   "With all the work we've got to do, I think it would be difficult
to anticipate another tax debate," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the legislation that House Republicans pushed, tax relief
targeted to married couples beginning in 2005 would be extended
permanently.</TE>

<HD>Padilla Linked to Closed Islam Charity</HD>
<DH>Terrorism: A worker for a group accused of funding Hamas
led a Florida mosque frequented by the U.S. bomb detainee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Jose Padilla, the American accused of plotting with Al Qaeda to set
off a radiation-dispersal bomb, frequented a Florida mosque whose
spiritual leader worked for an Islamic charity suspected of helping
finance terrorism, local Muslim leaders said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Padilla, now under arrest in a Navy brig, is accused of plotting
to detonate a "dirty" bomb capable of spewing radiation across an
American city. During the 1990s, when he lived in Florida, he
attended Al-Iman Mosque here while Raed M. Awad was the imam, members
of South Florida's Islamic community said.</LD>
<LD>   Awad, a 42-year-old Palestinian immigrant, was the chief
fund-raiser in Florida for the Texas-based Holy Land Foundation for
Relief &amp; Development, whose premises were raided and assets frozen by
the U.S. government in December.</LD>
<TE>   In announcing the crackdown Dec. 4, President Bush charged that
Holy Land used its tax-exempt status to raise $13 million during the
year. He said much of that went to Hamas, a group that has claimed
responsibility for suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism in
Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The charity, based in Richardson, Texas, has hotly denied any
connection with terrorism and filed a federal lawsuit demanding that
the millions of dollars in donations seized by government agents be
released.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla also took classes on the Koran and precepts of the Islamic
faith at the Darul Uloom (House of Knowledge) Institute, an Islamic
study center in Pembroke Pines, Fla. Its principal, Maulana Shafayat
Mohamed, said the young convert might have been pushed toward a more
intolerant strain of his new religion through contacts with
fundamentalist Arab clergy in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys, I would meet them formally as a religious leader
occasionally. But I deliberately did not do so more often because I
had a feeling that they think Caribbeans or Indians [of the Muslim
faith] are less than they are," said Mohamed, a native of Trinidad
who is active in ecumenical organizations promoting understanding
among Muslims, Christians and Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally kept away from [Awad]," Mohamed said.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Javed Quereshi--the Taco Bell manager who hired Padilla
and the Islamic convert he married and later divorced, Cherie Maria
Stultz--said both went to Al-Iman Mosque. Quereshi is an activist in
the South Florida Muslim community and the co-founder of a mosque and
school in the Fort Lauderdale area.</TE>
<TE>   Awad, who family members said has left Florida, collected funds
for the Holy Land from as far away as the Caribbean and Latin
America. In a newspaper interview, he denied that the foundation's
chief officers were ever involved with Hamas.</TE>
<TE>   "The FBI has been investigating this organization since 1992, and
every time they've come up with nothing," Awad told the Orlando
Sentinel in December.</TE>
<TE>   For four or five years, family members said, Awad led the prayers
at Al-Iman until he left about a year ago. The current imam, Rafiq
Mahdi, said he succeeded Awad in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't say anything about him," Mahdi said. "I think he's a
Jordanian or a Palestinian. He may have had American citizenship."</TE>
<TE>   Quereshi said the former imam is Palestinian and that he may have
vacated his post for health reasons. "I heard from sources he wasn't
feeling well. Personal problems and some depression," Quereshi said.</TE>
<TE>   Reached by telephone, Karl Overington, 17, the Muslim cleric's
stepson, said Awad no longer resides at the family's northwest Fort
Lauderdale home. "He moved to Alabama, I believe," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Overington said he did not know how to contact his stepfather.</TE>
<TE>   For a few months from 1995 to 1997, Padilla attended Saturday
religious classes at Darul Uloom, headed by Mohamed.</TE>
<TE>   "The only unusual thing about him was the way he dressed, and he
was very quiet," the principal said. Padilla had petitioned a Broward
County court in 1994 to have his name changed, identifying himself as
Ibrahim. He wore a red head scarf, or kaffiyeh, "like Yasser Arafat
wears," Mohamed said.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody else wears this," added the clergyman. "Even Arabs who
come here don't wear it."</TE>
<TE>   Mufti Syed M. Hasan, an Indian-born Muslim scholar identified by
Mohamed as instructor of the class, said he couldn't remember
teaching Padilla or the other five male and two female pupils.</TE>
<TE>   After being shown a class photo in which Padilla is present, Hasan
said he could recall only Padilla "on account of his kaffiyeh." He
said he must have seen him on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Another American who had just embraced Islam and took the same
classes said that, in spite of Padilla's uncommon headgear, he had no
recollection of him.</TE>
<TE>   "Why did he become a radical? I really can't say," said Mustapher
Olaniyan, 28, a computer network specialist.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he was one of the guys who saw in the media how Muslims in
Bosnia or Palestine were suffering and decided to do something about
it. I think it's stupid, but there are people who feel like that.
Some people are predisposed to that."</TE>

<HD>Va. Speaker Resigns in Sex Harassment Case</HD>
<DH>Government: House official admits to paying a woman at
least $100,000 in hush money to settle the issue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>RICHMOND, Va.</DL>
<LD>RICHMOND, Va. -- S. Vance Wilkins Jr. resigned as speaker of the
Virginia House on Thursday after admitting he paid at least $100,000
in hush money to a woman who accused him of sexually harassing her.</LD>
<LD>   The resignation came after a drumbeat of demands from top party
officeholders over the last few days.</LD>
<LD>   Wilkins, a Republican who was the state's most powerful
legislator, said he would decide in the next few weeks whether he
will also relinquish his seat in the House of Delegates. He has
served for 24 years.</LD>
<TE>   "It is in the best interest of the [Republican] caucus and in the
interest of myself that I resign now," Wilkins said during a
conference call with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins, 65, became the state's first Republican speaker in 2000
after leading the GOP to control of the House of Delegates for the
first time in history.</TE>
<TE>   Pressure had been growing for him to resign since last Friday,
when the Washington Post reported that Wilkins had reached a
settlement with Jennifer Thompson.</TE>
<TE>   "I think under the circumstances the speaker did do the right
thing, and I'm proud of him for taking a step I know was very hard
for him to take," said Delegate Jeannemarie Devolites, the House GOP
whip. "I'm very saddened what has happened in the last week has
overshadowed what a good job he did as speaker."</TE>
<TE>   Thompson claimed that Wilkins groped her and pinned her against
furniture last year at the building that housed the speaker's
hometown office as well as the road-building company that he once
owned.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkins has denied he sexually harassed the woman.</TE>
<TE>   She never filed a claim in court, and the settlement barred
Wilkins and Thompson from ever discussing the allegations, the
newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   As speaker, Wilkins had control over committee appointments, which
gave him enormous influence over which bills lived and which died.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a difficult decision for the speaker, but one that was
correct given the serious allegations of the past several days," Gov.
Mark Warner, a Democrat, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Under House rules, the interim speaker will be Delegate Lacey
Putney, an independent who organizes with the Republicans. Putney,
73, is an ally of Wilkins and has served in the House for 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   A permanent speaker could only be appointed by a vote of the full
100-member House.</TE>

<HD>Solar System Like Ours Is Called 'Missing Link'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Astronomers searching for worlds around distant stars announced the
discovery Thursday of the first solar system like Earth's, boosting
hopes that there are other habitable spots in the universe.</LD>
<LD>   "One of the big questions in science is, 'Are we alone?' " said
Anne Kinney, who directs the astronomy and physics division at NASA
headquarters. This "brings us one step closer to answering that."</LD>
<LD>   While scientists did not find an Earth, they found a close cousin:
a Jupiter. It is the first planet scientists have found with a
roughly circular orbit that is a healthy distance from its star, like
many of Earth's neighbors.</LD>
<TE>   "It's got the smell of our own solar system," said Geoff Marcy,
the UC Berkeley astronomer who leads the planet-hunting team. "In a
sense this solar system is a missing link."</TE>
<TE>   Since the first extrasolar planet was discovered seven years ago,
91 have been discovered. But many have been so odd--many times the
size of Jupiter, so close to their suns they'd be permanently
scorched or on wild, elliptical orbits--scientists began to wonder
whether our home solar system was unique. Looks like it's not.</TE>
<TE>   The planet, a gas giant known as "55 Cnc d," circles around the
star 55 Cancri, about 41 light-years from Earth. The middle-aged star
is about the same size as our sun and is visible to the naked eye.</TE>
<TE>   The new planet is about four times the size of Jupiter and is
about the same distance from its sun as Jupiter is from ours. While
that planet looks comfortingly familiar, the solar system also
contains some strange elements: two other large planets hundreds of
times larger than Earth that circle very close to the sun.</TE>
<TE>   Those oddities carry the "wacky stink of some of the strange solar
systems we've been finding over the past few years," Marcy said. They
underscore that while Earth's orderly solar system is not unique,
neither is it the norm.</TE>
<TE>   Finding planets is difficult work. They are not visible, even to
the powerful Hubble Space Telescope, because they give off only a
faint glow of reflected light, light that is imperceptible in the
glare coming from the stars they circle. Instead, Marcy's team
detects planets using a sensitive technique that measures the slight
wobble of stars caused by the gravitational yank of planets circling
them.</TE>
<TE>   The technique has a bias that explains why most findings so far
have been of big, close-in planets--"oddballs" that are easiest to
find because they perturb their stars the most. The smallest planet
discovered so far, one of 14 others also announced Thursday, is about
half the size of Saturn, or 40 times the size of Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Planets the size of Earth would not be visible. For example, if
the team looked at our own solar system from afar with its technique,
it could detect only the two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn.</TE>
<TE>   The reason many of the early discoveries have been of planets
close to stars is because their full orbits take only days. The
wobbles caused by the planets cannot be analyzed until at least one
full orbit has been made. A planet farther away, that takes years to
orbit its star, takes years of monitoring to detect.</TE>
<TE>   The newly discovered Jupiter-like planet took 13 years to orbit
its sun, and therefore took 13 years to detect.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a tremendous amount of persistence required for this
work," said Alycia Weinberger, an astronomer at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington who was not involved in the research. "It's
an experiment that doesn't necessarily give its most exciting results
right away."</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers are debating whether a smaller planet could exist in a
temperate zone among 55 Cancri's three Jupiter-like planets.</TE>
<TE>   The outer Jupiter might serve, as ours does, to absorb the blows
of comets and asteroids that could otherwise explode into our planet
and wipe out life.</TE>
<TE>   Theories suggest that gas giant planets form in the outer part of
the solar system and exist near stars only if they migrate there.
Behemoths spiraling toward the core of a solar system could pummel
smaller planets out of existence. But Weinberger said enough dusty
material might survive this transit to allow an Earth-sized planet to
form after the monsters passed by. UC Santa Cruz theoretical
astronomer Greg Laughlin has shown that a small planet could survive
in a stable orbit between two giants.</TE>
<TE>   Marcy and Paul Butler, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institution,
have spent 17 years perfecting the process of planet hunting and
waited nearly a decade before finding their first planet. Now, their
system works so smoothly, "we're actually drowning in planets," Marcy
said. Last week, the team had planned to announce 13 new planets at
its news conference. It found two more over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Given the length of time the astronomers have been monitoring some
stars, they expect to find more and more "normal" planets in these
distant regions from their suns that have never been probed. "We're
entering virgin territory," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   The team plans to conduct a census of the 2,000 stars within 150
light-years of Earth in an attempt to see how common our solar system
is. "Are we one in a hundred? One in a thousand? We have no idea
right now," Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists do not expect that they--or anyone else--will find
another Earth for at least a decade. That will have to wait for new
technology now being developed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.</TE>
<TE>   The NASA center working on several space telescopes to be launched
this decade and next will continue the search for new planets with
far more powerful tools and attempt to take the first images of these
distant worlds.</TE>
<TE>   The Jupiter-like planet announced Thursday is a good candidate for
the first portrait, scientists said, because it is relatively close
to Earth and far from the blinding light coming from its home star.</TE>

<HD>A Traumatic Future for Hospitals</HD>
<DH>County medical centers need a tax transfusion to avoid
being shut down.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GAIL V. ANDERSON Jr.</AU>
<BD>Dr. Gail V. Anderson Jr. is medical director of
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and assistant dean at the UCLA School of
Medicine. The views expressed here are his own.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month, a 10-year-old girl riding her bike home from school
landed in the hospital after she was struck by a car and dragged for
a distance. After stabilizing her, the hospital transferred her to
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for special surgical care.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall at a Carson construction site, the roof of a giant
sewage tank collapsed, impaling two workers with steel rods and
injuring nine others. Harbor trauma experts provided critical
surgical care.</LD>
<LD>   After a 1998 oil refinery explosion, more than 100 of the
refinery's workers and neighbors who developed breathing problems
from smoke exposure sought care at Harbor's emergency department.</LD>
<TE>   These events illustrate the fact that all of us, resident or
visitor, may at some time need acute life-saving services from the
public teaching hospitals of the Los Angeles County Department of
Health Services.</TE>
<TE>   Harbor and its sister county hospitals are the backbone of the
greater Los Angeles network for trauma, emergency and critical care.
This network provides care to half the trauma victims in the county,
regardless of the insurance status of those who need help.</TE>
<TE>   As the aftermath of Sept. 11 has so clearly underscored, these
hospitals also are an important part of our community's civil
defense. A reduction in these services would be a great and dangerous
loss to the community.</TE>
<TE>   Today, county hospitals are threatened by a decline in federal and
state funds that would result in a $688-million cumulative deficit by
2005, forcing the Department of Health Services to begin shrinking
the public health-care system immediately.</TE>
<TE>   We should take action to protect the system even if it means
paying more taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Our county teaching hospitals are ideally positioned to respond to
community crises such as terrorism, earthquakes and other natural
disasters for a number of reasons:</TE>
<TE>   * They are strategically located near potential terrorist targets.
Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center is just east of downtown's
skyscrapers and federal buildings. King-Drew Medical Center is near
the Coliseum and the Sports Arena. Harbor is between the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach, the South Bay oil refineries and LAX.</TE>
<TE>   * They can quickly mobilize many physicians. Greater numbers of
physicians are on site 24 hours a day at teaching hospitals than at
community hospitals. Unlike many community doctors, most resident and
faculty physicians are not spread out in multiple patient settings.</TE>
<TE>   * They are pre-existing sources of expertise and medical
information. Besides being on the forefront of trauma, emergency and
critical care, Department of Health Services staff members have
training and education in biological and chemical hazard response.</TE>
<TE>   * Paramedics, sheriff's deputies, police officers and firefighters
know and trust them.</TE>
<TE>   Budget-cutting proposals that are being considered include
complete or partial closure of at least two hospitals and major
reductions in trauma- and emergency-care capacity. Reducing the
Department of Health Services trauma capacity could dangerously
strain the fragile safety net at a time when non-public-sector trauma
centers are struggling with the high cost of providing this service.</TE>
<TE>   The enemy of the trauma patient--rich or poor--is time. Increased
travel distance and longer waits for operating rooms because of fewer
centers could mean the difference in survival from a car crash.
Victims of other time-sensitive conditions, such as heart attacks and
strokes, could face longer waits for care if emergency-care capacity
is reduced.</TE>
<TE>   So how do we ensure the system will be here when we or our loved
ones need it?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly the county should continue to aggressively seek
financial support from Washington and Sacramento. But all of us--you,
me, our neighbors, even our region's tourists--need to take
responsibility for creating a sustainable source of local funding.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a new sales tax could be earmarked to support our
network for trauma, emergency and critical care. When their trauma
system was threatened with collapse in 1992, Miami voters passed a
dedicated half-cent sales-tax increase to preserve that crucial
service. We deserve the same chance to save ours.</TE>

<HD>Father Knows Best--Sometimes It Just Takes Him Awhile</HD>
<DH>To his embarrassment, a dad realizes it's not his gay son
who has a problem.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For a few years after my son, Adam, came out to me, Father's Day
became a day of mourning, the day when I was reminded of what I lost.</LD>
<LD>   What I lost was every dream I ever had for my 21-year-old
first-born child. He was going to be the captain of the football
team. He was going to be the stud I bragged about to my co-workers.
He was going to be the husband I'd be proud of, the father of
children I would cherish. I grieved that he would become none of
these people.</LD>
<LD>   Eventually, as I looked back at the person he did become, I
thought about my own role in developing his character, and I wasn't
sure I liked what I saw. Even as we do things for our children, we
fathers have an underlying selfishness. We unconsciously place
unwarranted expectations on them.</LD>
<TE>   For instance, I spent hours showing Adam how to throw a baseball.</TE>
<TE>   I told myself it was because I wanted him to enjoy the camaraderie
of team sports, but really it was because I was embarrassed by his
lack of athleticism. I work in construction. The type of people I
hang out with, well, when they saw Adam out in the field, I knew what
they were thinking: He throws like a girl.</TE>
<TE>   That stung me like a mad bee. And it kept stinging me for years. I
was profoundly embarrassed by him, the depth of which now embarrasses
me. I'm still working on forgiving myself.</TE>
<TE>   For Adam, as a young boy, to witness my disappointment in him was
possibly my greatest failure as a father. Unfortunately, my failure
continued throughout his growing-up years, especially when I found
myself living a dad's nightmare: I had fathered a gay son.</TE>
<TE>   I tried to be stoic, but I'm sure my face betrayed the emotions I
was trying to hide. I didn't want anyone to know that Adam was gay,
and I made sure they didn't. Peer pressure is just as strong at my
age as it is at Adam's.</TE>
<TE>   For four years I chose my public image over my love for my son.
Homosexuality makes cowards out of most of us.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict between the genuine love for my son and the endless
disappointments he seemingly foisted on me eventually came to a head.
Was I going to be a stooped old man, burdened by the disappointments
of his first-born, or was I going to be something bigger than that?</TE>
<TE>   After a lot of prayer and counseling, I realized that, contrary to
my perception of being a self-sacrificing father, I was actually a
selfish one. On the field or off, I wanted him to want what I wanted
for him. As a child, he disappointed me because he wasn't interested
in rough-and-tumble play. As a teen, he disappointed me because he
wasn't interested in sports. And now, as a young man, he disappointed
me because he wasn't interested in women.</TE>
<TE>   I had a right to be disappointed by his homosexuality. But how
long was I going to sacrifice love for self-righteous discontent?</TE>
<TE>   One day, as a Little League coach, I realized I had become what I
hated in other fathers. They too had a long list of disappointments
that their sons had "burdened" them with, and they did nothing to
hide their displeasure. It dawned on me that I was doing the same
thing to my son that they were doing to theirs: Convincing him that
he would always be a failure in my eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Today, my son and I are closer than we've ever been. I even give
him advice on his boyfriends. He still annoys me now and then (he
could party less and study harder in college) but he doesn't
disappoint me anymore. That's because I now realize that all those
dreams I had weren't really for Adam. They were for me.</TE>
<TE>   Adam can't disappoint me anymore because I've committed myself to
supporting his dreams, not mine. Father's Day has changed for me. It
isn't any longer about what I lost, but what I gained: the ability to
love my son unconditionally.</TE>

<HD>This Is War, and Military Justice Is Appropriate</HD>
<DH>Our Constitution can't be a cover for our enemies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUGLAS W. KMIEC</AU>
<BD>Douglas W. Kmiec is dean of the Catholic University of
America School of Law, distinguished policy fellow at Pepperdine
University and former constitutional legal counsel to President
Reagan and former President Bush.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are at war. Whether one fully grasps that fact is what divides
those who affirm the military detention of Yaser Esam Hamdi and Jose
Padilla, also known as Abdullah al Muhajir, and those who don't.</LD>
<LD>   Civil libertarians insist that the president has acted without
authority in undertaking these detentions, betraying our most
precious constitutional rights. This misstates the nature of the
president's legal authority and does not distinguish between common
criminals and those in league with terrorists--U.S. citizens or
not--captured on the field of battle in Afghanistan or in clandestine
dealings with Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   As long ago as 1582, international jurists made it plain that
"brigands"--today's unlawful belligerents or unlawful
combatants--"are not qualified to bargain about matters that only
inure to the benefit of 'just' enemies." The Hague Convention in 1907
defined unlawful belligerency as lacking membership in a group with
recognized command structure or uniform and engaging in secreting of
arms or operations outside the laws of war--such as attacking unarmed
civilian populations with passenger planes or "dirty" bombs.</LD>
<TE>   So what should we do with unlawful combatants? The pirates of the
17th and early 18th centuries are the closest analogy in our national
experience. These "enemies of mankind"--who didn't have nearly the
money or nuclear or biochemical potential to wreak havoc, as does Al
Qaeda--were described by common-law jurists in an 18th century South
Carolina case as "brutes" and "beasts of prey." Lawful captors were
admonished that "if they [could] not with safety to themselves bring
them under some government to be tried [they are to be] put to
death." This is somewhat harsher than being denied access to the
local public defender.</TE>
<TE>   Given the current threats to our security, President Bush's
alternative of extended detention and humane interrogation is
generous. Hamdi and Padilla, as American citizens, are not subject to
military trial under the president's order of November 2001. Bush
should rethink that exclusion. Supreme Court precedent makes it clear
that even U.S. citizens who choose to become war criminals can be
brought to justice before such tribunals. There is no definitive
precedent, however, that insists that American-born war criminals be
tried in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution is not a suicide pact, and those who live under
it need not have their lives jeopardized by those whose fanatical,
suicidal schemes place them outside the laws of both war and peace.</TE>
<TE>   Should we be concerned that Padilla, an American citizen, is being
denied the criminal justice system, while noncitizen Zacarias
Moussaoui, who has made plain his hatred for Americans, gets the
benefit of it? Frankly, yes. Moussaoui's referral to a regular
civilian court was a mistake. He is as much an unlawful combatant as
is Padilla, and we would be better off with him sitting in a brig
somewhere being questioned. His arrest in the U.S. misled us. The
supposition that the conspiracy charges brought against him could be
proved without jeopardizing the war effort now seems incorrect. John
Walker Lindh also makes use of the federal court system, but at least
it seems likely that he has little or no information about any active
terrorist plotting.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the dangers that are seeking us out, many Americans resist
accepting the war on terrorism as a real war. Thus the anxiety about
trusting the president and the military to hold captives without
counsel or specific criminal indictment will remain.</TE>
<TE>   To answer it, Bush might consider a military review panel--not to
try those being held in detention but simply to assess and
periodically report on the need for further detention without charge.
Hamdi, Padilla and the detainees in Cuba are not entitled to such
review under the Geneva Convention. It would be an act of tremendous
goodwill toward those who wish us none. And it might ease the minds
of Americans as well.</TE>

<HD>Statehood Would Reward Suicide Bombings</HD>
<DH>To create a Palestinian homeland now would only lead to
more violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID MAKOVSKY</AU>
<BD>David Makovsky is a fellow at the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy and a contributing editor of U.S. News &amp; World
Report.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush obviously has doubts about whether Yasser Arafat is a
realistic partner for peace. He should trust that instinct and resist
the pressure coming from European and Arab capitals to put the force
of the U.S. behind prematurely creating a full-blown Palestinian
state in virtually all the West Bank. To do so would be, in effect, a
reward to the suicide bombers who have terrorized Israelis.</LD>
<LD>   Pressure is on Bush to enter a diplomatic time warp and support a
Mideast peace plan that virtually resets the clock to the end of the
Clinton administration. Though Israelis and Palestinians are likely
to eventually negotiate a just peace along lines close to this, to
advance a Clinton-era strategy now based upon such a large-scale
Israeli withdrawal would send the terrible message that terrorism
pays.</LD>
<LD>   Washington has stated its intentions several times. Last November,
Bush told the United Nations that he favors the establishment of a
Palestinian state. That didn't stop the violence. Later that month,
Secretary of State Colin Powell delivered a detailed speech calling
for an end to Israeli settlement activity and the creation of a
Palestinian state; the violence did not stop then either.</LD>
<TE>   These positions were affirmed and expanded a third time when the
U.S. agreed to send mediator Anthony Zinni to the region, a fourth
time when Washington decided to effectively ignore the interception
of an Arafat-funded smuggling ship from Iran, a fifth time when the
U.S. endorsed U.N. Security Council Resolution 1397 this year,
formally endorsing Palestinian statehood, and a sixth time when the
president gave his landmark address April 4.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the terrorism continues.</TE>
<TE>   Now, again, the White House is being asked to offer Palestinians a
light at the end of the political tunnel without any real prospect
that the ongoing terrorism will cease. Moreover, these Arab and Euro
allies want the administration not only to endorse the thrust of the
Clinton ideas for peacemaking but also to affirm a timetable for
completing the process--about three years. In short, their focus is
not just to determine what political horizon Bush envisions but to
guarantee a very specific political outcome--one that, if history is
a guide, will only serve as a baseline for further demands on the
U.S. and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   After one cuts through the "diplomatese," the approach being
pitched boils down to this: Despite the terrorism, smuggling, lying,
corruption and mismanagement that has marked Arafat's leadership,
let's wipe the slate clean and give the Palestinians everything they
rejected at the end of the Clinton administration--a virtual return
to the 1967 borders and a commitment that Palestinian statehood will
come by a certain date, regardless of the consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The worst aspect of this approach is that it would invite more
terrorism, not encourage less. Whereas the Clinton-era ideas at least
were the product of U.S.-led negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians, a full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank today will
have been due solely to the Palestinians' success in killing a
sufficient number of innocent Israelis in discos, pizzerias and
shopping malls. This would be the ultimate gift to the bombers, whose
attacks have, with numbing frequency, taken place with the support or
praise of the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   In the long term, this approach will only help those Palestinians
who argue that their goals are more easily achieved via violence, not
negotiations--the same argument made by Hezbollah when Israel
retreated in haste from Lebanon two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The message of American policy shifting under fire is already
having its effect. A poll by the Ramallah-based Palestinian Center
for Policy and Survey Research released last week said that 67% of
Palestinians believe violence will pay political dividends. Another
poll by the Jerusalem Media Communications Center was even more
worrisome; it showed that 51% of Palestinians believe that the goal
of intifada violence should be restoration of "historic
Palestine"--meaning the elimination of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   We have to get beyond "all or nothing" and look for practical ways
to rebuild the trust. But timing is everything. Putting forward the
idea that now is the time to create a Palestinian state in this
turbocharged context will define the nature of Israeli-Palestinian
relations: violence over diplomacy.</TE>
<TE>   If the people of the Middle East come to believe that through
suicide bombings the Bush administration's policy in the region can
be transformed into Clinton redux, then the prospects for peace are
truly doomed.</TE>

<LD>Government's first duty is to protect its citizens, and keeping a
terrorist from devastating an American city with a nuclear device
certainly fits the bill. So we're grateful that federal agents tailed
Chicago gangbanger-turned-Muslim extremist Jose Padilla and arrested
him long before he could do what the government says he intended:
explode a "dirty" bomb capable of spewing radiation.</LD>
<LD>   But Americans must always temper their gratitude with skepticism.
They believe in this democracy because, with very few exceptions, the
Constitution demands that it go about its business in full public
view. This openness is the only way to guarantee individual
rights--including the rights of the accused.</LD>
<LD>   When Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft revealed this week that Padilla had
been arrested May 8, he was also disclosing that for more than a
month the government had kept an American citizen--and the democratic
process--in a dungeon of secrecy.</LD>
<TE>   Forget, for a moment, the thousands of immigrants and foreign
visitors detained since Sept. 11, many held secretly and for months
before getting a hearing. Padilla is a U.S. citizen. Yet at the
direction of President Bush, the Justice Department has again cut
constitutional corners.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla was arrested as a material witness. Federal agents also
subpoenaed him to testify before a New York grand jury investigating
the terror attacks. When Padilla reportedly refused to testify, Bush,
relying on the president's war powers, declared him an "enemy
combatant."</TE>
<TE>   As such, Justice Department officials contend, Padilla can be held
indefinitely--or until the war on terrorism ends (which is to say,
indefinitely). He need not be charged with a crime, and he hasn't
been. The government transferred him to a South Carolina military
brig without his lawyer's knowledge, and her efforts to see him have
been unsuccessful. The government claims that it need not hold a
hearing to present the evidence against Padilla or allow him the
right to contest his combatant designation. In short, by presidential
fiat, the Constitution no longer applies to Padilla.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not how we do things in this country, in large part
because we don't trust the government unless we can see what it's up
to. In this case, that would mean, at the very least, granting
Padilla his right to know the charges against him and to mount a
defense before a judge. Indeed, that's how the government is
proceeding against another U.S. citizen, John Walker Lindh, who was
caught on the battlefield in Afghanistan. And that's how it's
proceeding against Zacarias Moussaoui, a French national and alleged
terrorist, who will also be tried in federal court.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are willing to make sacrifices for security. But if
Padilla can be held in secret for as long as it takes to make him
talk, his constitutional rights suspended or bent to fit
investigators' immediate goals, then the government can similarly
abuse the rights of any American citizen. That's too big a sacrifice.</TE>

<LD>The Bush administration's decision to make homeland security a
Cabinet position, after months of denying that any changes were
necessary, is a turn in the right direction. But as the slim 24-page
draft issued by the administration last week indicates, the
department is very much a work in progress. The 24 pages of
flowcharts and bold type outline an agency that would have nearly
170,000 employees, a multibillion-dollar budget and potential
authority over parts of the CIA, FBI, Transportation Department and
more than a dozen other agencies. The administration and Congress
have lots of fleshing out to do, offering many opportunities for
missteps and political mischief.</LD>
<LD>   The Justice Department's announcement Monday that it had foiled a
plot to detonate a "dirty" radiation-containing bomb in a major city
was well orchestrated to underscore the urgency of creating a
Department of Homeland Security. The arrest of former Chicago gang
member Jose Padilla, who goes by the name Abdullah al Muhajir, is a
trumpeted success for intelligence agencies. But if Padilla turns out
to be the terrorist the government says he is, it also will mean that
recruitment inside the United States is a real threat.</LD>
<LD>   Once President Bush submits a legislative proposal in a few weeks,
Congress must ensure that the new agency's director is not the
figurehead that Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has been.</LD>
<TE>   The administration correctly seeks to pull together agencies such
as the Coast Guard, immigration service and Transportation Security
Administration, but in some instances it goes too far. Congress will
need to distinguish which departments inside those agencies should be
controlled by Homeland Security. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services, for
example, do all sorts of public-health work that is distant from
terrorist threats. Anything from AIDS vaccine research to childhood
disease studies could be disrupted.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and other
lawmakers are right to warn that the Bush plan may not go far enough
in assuring cooperation between the FBI and CIA. The head of Homeland
Security should have control over the counter-terrorism section of
the FBI rather than simply being a passive consumer of information,
as envisioned in the Bush proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is it realistic to claim, as Bush does, that the new
department won't cost taxpayers more than existing agencies. The
administration isn't asking for new funding for 2003, and it appears
that it also wants to use the department to skirt traditional civil
service requirements in order to weaken government unions. This is no
time for such machinations: Congress should put a stop to end-runs
around civil service and appropriate at least an interim budget as
soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   No matter how much or how quickly Congress strengthens the
structure of the department, its effectiveness still will depend on
who's in charge. With his color-coded charts and unwillingness to
insist on his own authority, Ridge has not shown that he is capable
of much beyond loyalty to his boss. Pulling together this mammoth
agency will take a savvy nonpartisan bureaucratic warrior, someone
who can't be bamboozled and whom the president trusts. Bush's choice
will speak volumes about how seriously he takes the new department he
didn't want to create.</TE>

<LD>The Universal Music Group and Sony Music Entertainment have finally
grasped that a 14-year-old Weezer fan can download the hit song "Dope
Nose" from the Internet as a high-quality MP3 computer file and share
it with a pal as easily as he can schedule a date on his Palm.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of unsuccessfully trying to stop people from downloading
music without paying, the companies will offer songs online at 99
cents apiece and, more significantly, will allow customers to
burn--in effect, to record--the purchased songs onto compact discs.</LD>
<LD>   This probably will not deter the kids, college students and adults
who have gleefully participated in the digital music revolution. Most
of these users left moral concerns aside long ago and take free and
fast downloads for granted.</LD>
<TE>   This new system, however, does have the potential to attract
millions of music lovers who had the scruples not to lift MP3 files
without paying.</TE>
<TE>   Though this new plan is risky for entertainment conglomerates, it
is a win for the consumer. Two industry leaders are finally offering
a fair deal to the average buyer who, for years, has paid exorbitant
prices for albums.</TE>
<TE>   In allowing customers to burn their own CDs, Universal and Sony
are conceding that MP3 files, without the cool cover art and liner
notes, are not necessarily as valuable as the same music on a
store-bought disc. Which is why whole albums will sell for about
$9.99.</TE>
<TE>   This also means that one-hit wonders such as Sum 41 will no longer
be able to produce albums with a single catchy song and expect
consumers to pay for the remaining, infuriatingly mediocre tracks.
Artists and record companies will be compelled to produce albums
worth buying and listening to.</TE>

<LD>Re "Palestinian Reforms Needed for Peace Talks, Bush Says," June 11:
It's part of his political game, and America had better wise up about
it. I'm talking about every time Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
invades Palestinian territories and then runs to pay President Bush a
visit. Every time he does that, other countries must feel that
America supports Sharon's invasion, as he comes here to get a pat on
the back for it. America should not allow Sharon to use us as a pawn
in his own war with the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   And if President Bush doesn't put a stop to it, he's only fueling
the war on terrorism with his own politics. It's making me wonder
what's really on the Bush agenda. Fighting terrorism or pleasing his
conservative voters? He can't do both with his current agenda.</LD>

<TE>   Tracy Wilkinson brought back memories of when I was 11 ("In
Growing Numbers, Palestinian Boys Are Choosing the Brief Life of a
'Martyr,' " June 10). In 1947, another nonnative occupying army was
in Palestine. The British had divided Jerusalem in three sections: A,
B and C. We lived in C.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the 11- and 14-year-old boys of today, I had no interest in
or even knowledge of being a "martyr." Instead, I would go up to the
British soldiers and ask them if I could see what was inside their
tank. And what a grand tour I got! Today, on the other hand, Israel
is creating its own unconquerable enemy. It has made the Palestinians
so crushed, so desperate, so humiliated and so nonhuman that they
have nothing to lose now, not even their young lives.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Backward Steps for Mideast," editorial, June 12: Instead of
urging President Bush to "get back on track to a plan that promises
security for both sides," The Times should be emphasizing the need
for a realistic plan that will indeed produce security for both
sides. Until Palestinian suicide bombers and their surviving
relatives stop receiving moral and financial support from influential
Palestinian groups and neighboring Arab states--and until they
abandon policies that will effectively destroy Israel as a Jewish
state--promises for security and peace are a pipe dream. Three cheers
for Bush, who seems to recognize this.</TE>

<TE>   It was most gratifying to read Dina Khayat's "Peace Happens"
(Opinion, June 9) and to know that she is a member of the executive
board of the Cairo Peace Movement. Many Israelis who have been
sensitive to the Palestinians' suffering and willing to accommodate
their aspirations are often asked if they know any Arabs or
Palestinians who are as sympathetic to Israelis' suffering or at
least show some understanding of the Israeli side. The answer is
often a perplexing "no."</TE>
<TE>   Now, thanks to Khayat, who quite genuinely supports coexistence
and its benefits for both sides, one can hope to hear more voices
like that to promote more mutual understanding.</TE>

<LD>So the government spent "hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars"
to discover that the Clinton transition team cost $15,000 in damage
("Clinton Transition Left $15,000 Damage, GAO Says," June 12). I
wonder if anyone is looking into how to prop up our stock market,
which is costing Americans hundreds of millions of dollars a day. Or
isn't that political enough, since Clinton can't be blamed for that?</LD>

<TE>   Your story failed to mention that the General Accounting Office
itself was unable to conclude whether the 2001 transition was worse
than previous ones, and that similar pranks occurred in the 1993
transition from President Bush to President Clinton. I suppose we can
expect similar damage in the next transition from President Bush to
President Clinton.</TE>

<LD>The arrest of Jose Padilla (Abdullah al Muhajir) for training to
develop "dirty" bombs in Pakistan, and the nuclear threats from
Pakistan during the recent tensions in South Asia should leave no
doubt that our foreign policy with regard to Pakistan has been flawed
and has allowed terrorists to flourish. Nuclear bombs and nuclear
scientists in Pakistan are the biggest threat to the world today
because they can easily fall into the hands of terrorists like Al
Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   We have been reluctant to take on the religious extremists in
Pakistan and governmental agencies like the Inter-Services
Intelligence agency, which trains and funds them. Why? Our foreign
policy has been short-term, focused and morally corrupt for decades.
The CIA gave billions of dollars to the ISI during the 1980s to train
the Afghanistan jihadis to fight the Soviets. After the Soviet Union
withdrew from Afghanistan, the ISI used the same funds to create the
Taliban and to start a terrorist movement against India in Kashmir.
Our government has shown a tendency to ignore terrorism against
nonallied countries. Terrorism created by Pakistan has traditionally
been targeted at India.</LD>
<TE>   It is time to realize that terrorism is not localized; it's a
global threat that will strike us with as much fury as it hits
countries like India and Israel. The U.S. government needs to change
the policy of coddling military dictators like Gen. Pervez Musharraf
and hold them accountable for shutting down conventional and nuclear
terrorism. That is the only path for peace in South Asia and for the
entire world.</TE>

<LD>I fell off my chair laughing at "Some Object to Caltrans' Re-Greening
of Freeways" (June 6). The new freeway landscaping is anything but
green. Ed Boll, Caltrans' landscape architect, comments about the
public reaction to Caltrans work: "They [residents] want a visual
screen. The loss of that visual screen is what people most object
to." Wrong.</LD>
<LD>   I object most that Caltrans did this huge landscaping project that
affects millions of people in L.A. and Ventura counties without any
public input. None! I object to this truly ugly project, the new
sprinklers that don't work and the miles of weeds that seem to be the
plant of choice.</LD>

<TE>   A million dollars per mile to tear out old growth along our
freeways and replace it with "state of the art" landscapes by
Caltrans? No way! Caltrans officials know nothing about landscaping
with native plants. They do know how to spend a lot of our tax
dollars foolishly.</TE>
<TE>   During this current drought, it's important that we not waste
water. Having said this, I'd like others who feel as I do to join
with me in monitoring this latest Caltrans project. Obviously, it
will never have to maintain what it creates.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ethnicity Colors Views of Scandal," June 10: The notion that "I
don't follow the priest but I follow Jesus Christ" may sound corny
but is as poignant as ever. As a Catholic, it is sad to hear people
using the offering as "one of the few tools I have to get my message
across," because the offering is meant to be for the church as the
body of Christ, not for the church as an institution.</LD>
<LD>   Also, even if it were for the institutional church, it is this
kind of "I, me, mine" mentality that is the root of the current
crisis in the Catholic Church in the first place. Claire Henning,
pastoral coordinator for St. Paul the Apostle Church in Los Angeles,
says, "No one really understands what the laity is now, because the
spectrum is so broad." Well, it is very simple: Go back to the church
of dusty Jalisco, Mexico, of the 1920s; don't "move ahead" with
novelty ideas to find the answer.</LD>

<LD>We have been duped again. "Some Farmers Growing Rich on Government
Crop Subsidies" (June 10) revealed that 67% of U.S. farm subsidies
paid to California farms goes to 10% of the farmers. The story
continues with, as an example, the fact that without those subsidies,
rice couldn't be grown in California because the farmer would lose
$50 to $150 per acre.</LD>
<LD>   I recently flew over Northern California's rice fields. It looked
as if the 1993 El Nino had returned--there were submerged fields for
as far as the eye could see north of Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   I imagined this water being available for humans to drink instead
of supporting a crop that loses money without subsidies. Certainly
that ground could grow another, less-thirsty crop.</LD>
<TE>   And do you know what happens to those fields after harvest? They
are burned to rid them of rice straw. The skies over Northern
California are dark with rice smoke (and later, all the Central
Valley, as prevailing winds mix it with pollutants from the Bay Area
and carry the choking scourge southward).</TE>
<TE>   The lunacy of federal crop subsidies must be ended. American
taxpayers thought they were, in 1996. Just so much political blather,
as usual.</TE>

<TE>   Let's apply the basic principles of welfare reform to welfare for
farmers--in particular, with a five-year lifetime limit on crop
subsidies. That will help end the cycle of dependency and force
farmers to stand on their own two feet and not rely on government
handouts.</TE>

<LD>A newborn girl covered in blood and dirt and left naked among shrubs
outside a Panorama City apartment building was recovering Thursday
from hypothermia, hospital officials said.</LD>
<LD>   A woman who lives in the building found the baby--a few hours old
and born premature--crying in the cold about 1:45 a.m. Thursday, Los
Angeles Police Department Sgt. Adolfo Godinez said.</LD>
<LD>   Sonia Briones, a mother of three, wrapped the infant in her shirt,
brought her inside and called police, authorities said.</LD>
<TE>   The baby had been lying face up in bushes outside an apartment at
14695 Parthenia St., Godinez said. Her umbilical cord was still
attached.</TE>
<TE>   "She's doing OK right now--she's very lucky to have been found,"
said Dr. Philippe Friedlich, a neonatologist at Childrens Hospital
Los Angeles. "Babies do not shiver. They just kind of go to sleep,
shut down to conserve energy."</TE>
<TE>   The baby was being treated in a "radiant warming bed," Friedlich
said. She will be under the care of the Department of Children and
Family Services.</TE>
<TE>   She was the second infant found abandoned in the county since
Monday, when a baby girl's battered body was found on a conveyor belt
at a City of Industry waste plant. The baby had died of blunt-force
trauma, authorities said, but it is not known when the trauma
occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The abandonment of newborns continues despite a state "safe haven"
law that allows anyone to leave an unwanted infant at a hospital
emergency room within 72 hours of birth--no questions asked and
without risk of arrest or prosecution. Friedlich said he does not
recall a single instance of an infant being left at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   An official at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center, one of the
busiest hospitals in the country, said, despite the law, no one has
ever left an unwanted baby there either.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, the county Board of Supervisors extended the
safe haven law to fire stations and health clinics.</TE>

<LD>An Encino woman and a Hollywood man have been charged with
participating in an international kidnap-for-ransom scheme that led
to the deaths of five Los Angeles-area people whose bodies were
pulled from a Northern California lake, federal prosecutors said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Natalya Solovyeva, 26, is accused of conspiring with several men
to lure two of the victims to the kidnappers.</LD>
<LD>   Aleksejus Markovskis, 32, allegedly helped guard the victims at a
Sherman Oaks house and clean up the crime scene, according to a grand
jury indictment.</LD>
<TE>   Solovyeva and Markovskis are scheduled to enter pleas on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the bodies of West Hollywood bookkeeper Rita Pekler, 39,
Beverly Hills businessman George Safiev, 37, aspiring Woodland Hills
film producer Nick Kharabadze, 29, and North Hollywood businessman
Alexander Umansky, 35, were pulled from New Melones Reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   The body of Sherman Oaks real estate developer Meyer Muscatel, 58,
was found in the lake in October.</TE>
<TE>   Three other defendants--Iouri Mikhel, 37, Jurijus Kadamovas, 35,
and Petro Krylov, 29--were indicted in February and have pleaded not
guilty.</TE>
<TE>   They are also accused of conspiracy and hostage-taking resulting
in death.</TE>
<TE>   All five defendants face a possible death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   Last week their alleged conspirator, Ainar Altmanis, 42, pleaded
guilty to participating in the conspiracy and to the kidnappings.</TE>
<TE>   Because of his cooperation with investigators, the U.S. attorney's
office has agreed not to seek the death penalty against Altmanis.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors Carole Peterson and Kim Meyer, the four
defendants charged in February--all of whom have roots in the former
Soviet Union--killed the victims even after some relatives and
business associates had paid the ransom.</TE>
<TE>   The ransom demands continued after the bodies had been thrown into
the frigid lake, the prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Muscatel was beaten, had a plastic bag placed over his head, and
when he continued to convulse, Mikhel placed a larger bag over the
victim's head and held his nose, the prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Safiev's business associates, Pekler and Kharabadze, were
kidnapped and killed in attempts to lure Safiev into a trap,
according to court documents.</TE>
<TE>   Like Muscatel and Safiev, Umansky was targeted after kidnappers
became aware of his high income, the documents state. Kidnappers
demanded that Umansky's family wire ransom to the United Arab
Emirates, and after the money was sent, they killed him and demanded
more ransom, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   The total ransom sought for all the victims exceeded $5 million,
according to documents.</TE>
<TE>   Defendants Andrei Agueev, 34, and Andrei Liapine, 41, face lesser
charges of receiving the Umansky ransom money in their bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The two men, who were living in the United Arab Emirates when
arrested, have pleaded not guilty. They face a maximum of 10 years in
prison.</TE>
<TE>   A ninth defendant, Alexandr Afonin, is charged with persuading
Agueev and Liapine to accept the ransom money. Afonin remains at
large.</TE>

<HD>4 Drug Cartel Cells Crushed; 41 Arrested</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four Los Angeles cells of the feared Arellano Felix drug cartel have
been dismantled with the arrests of 41 suspects on trafficking
charges in California and elsewhere in the country, authorities
announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The sweep concluded an intensive two-year investigation and was
part of a nationwide crackdown on the powerful Mexico-based cartel,
which imports millions of dollars worth of cocaine, heroin,
methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States every year.</LD>
<LD>   "We have seriously damaged a large, sophisticated and--I can
assure you--a very violent drug traffic organization," Los Angeles
County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley said at a joint news conference with
officials from local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.</LD>
<TE>   More than 400 officers raided 31 sites in Los Angeles, Riverside
and San Diego counties early Thursday. They seized $360,000 worth of
cocaine, marijuana and heroin, nine handguns and eight assault
rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Search and arrest warrants also were executed Thursday in
Minnesota, Connecticut, Arizona, New York and Mexico, officials said.
Authorities were still looking for 36 more suspects.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests in what authorities term Operation Vise Grip are the
latest setback for the Arellano Felix organization, the powerful drug
gang that has used violence and bribery to control drug trafficking
along the Tijuana-San Diego corridor for more than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Cartel enforcer Ramon Arellano Felix was killed in a police
shootout in Mazatlan in February. His brother, Benjamin, was seized
by Mexican army soldiers weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   The four dismantled Los Angeles cells all run independently,
authorities said. Among those arrested Thursday were Rosario Uriarte
and Juan Ramon Camacho, who authorities said are two of the city's
top drug traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   "We targeted from the highest levels of the organization down to
the street level," said interim Los Angeles Police Chief Martin
Pomeroy.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities called the Los Angeles-based probe the largest
domestic attack yet against the Arellano Felix cartel. Beginning in
January 2000, investigators from 18 states aimed at its local
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles cells are responsible for smuggling, transporting and
distributing drugs to cities as far away as Boston, New York and
Minneapolis, authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Lily Chin, 82; Son's Killing Led to Rights Drive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lily Chin, whose grief and outrage over the 1982 killing of her son
helped galvanize Asian Americans to fight for civil rights, died of
cancer Sunday at a hospital in Farmington Hills, Mich. She was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Chin was a Chinese immigrant whose only child, Vincent, was beaten
unconscious outside a Detroit restaurant by two white unemployed auto
workers who thought that he was Japanese and blamed him for American
auto industry layoffs. He died four days after the assault, on June
23, 1982.</LD>
<LD>   His assailants confessed to the crime but were never sent to
prison, despite three trials.</LD>
<TE>   Lily Chin, who had emigrated from a small village in southern
China in 1948, spoke little English but crisscrossed the country to
raise awareness about the injustice of her son's case.</TE>
<TE>   He became a martyr and she the crusader and emotional center for a
budding movement.</TE>
<TE>   "She often said, 'There is nothing I can do to bring back Vincent,
but I don't want any other mother to go through what I went through.'
She wanted justice for her son. She believed in justice," said
Stewart Kwoh, who started the Asian Pacific American Legal Center in
Los Angeles a year after the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the inspiration for many of us to get involved, not only
to track and address hate crimes but also to build strong civil
rights organizations," Kwoh said.</TE>
<TE>   Chin and her husband, David, adopted Vincent from China when he
was 6. In 1982, he was a 27-year-old engineer when he encountered
Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz, at a topless bar in the
Detroit area. Chin, who was to be married in nine days, was attending
his bachelor party when he got into an argument with the two men.</TE>
<TE>   According to the federal indictment, Ebens and Nitz called Chin a
"chink," a "nip" and other obscenities before being ejected from the
bar. Ebens allegedly returned with a baseball bat, chased Chin
outside and caught him in the parking lot of a nearby McDonald's
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses said Nitz held Chin down as Ebens smashed his skull. A
friend who cradled Chin before he lost consciousness said his last
words were, "It isn't fair."</TE>
<TE>   Ebens and Nitz pleaded guilty to manslaughter. They were handed a
$3,000 fine and four months' probation--a sentence that outraged
Asian Americans in Detroit and nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Lily Chin was well-known in Detroit's Chinese American community,
where her husband had worked in laundries and restaurants. At the
time of Vincent's death, she worked in a brush factory outside
Detroit. Her husband had died six months earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "She felt as one lone widow woman that she needed support," said
Liza Chan, one of the early attorneys for American Citizens for
Justice, a Detroit-based Asian American coalition that was founded in
the wake of Chin's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   "She really thought justice had to be sought. You have to give her
credit for that. At the time, she hadn't any notion it would turn out
to be what it turned out to be," which was the beginning of the Asian
American civil rights movement.</TE>
<TE>   Chin spoke at rallies across the country. She never spoke at
length, but her message was nearly always the same: "I want justice
for my son."</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, Vincent Chin became the first Asian American whose case
was prosecuted under the 1964 civil rights statute providing federal
penalties for hate crimes.</TE>
<TE>   During the civil rights trial, a dancer from the topless bar
testified that the fight began when Ebens told Chin, "It's because of
you little [obscenity] that we're out of work." She said Chin walked
over and pushed Ebens, then the two started swinging chairs at each
other.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys did not dispute that their clients killed
Vincent Chin. But they denied that the two men assaulted him out of
racial prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   Ebens was found guilty on one count of violating Chin's civil
rights but was acquitted on another count of conspiring with Nitz to
violate Chin's rights. Nitz was acquitted on both counts.</TE>
<TE>   A federal appeals court later threw out Ebens' conviction and
ordered a new trial. That trial, in 1987, resulted in Ebens'
acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   It devastated Chin. One of the most searing moments in the 1989,
Oscar-nominated documentary, "Who Killed Vincent Chin?" was the
filmmakers' interview with Chin, who was nearly incoherent with
grief.</TE>
<TE>   "The skin is different," she said, "but the heart is the same."</TE>
<TE>   A $1-million civil judgment in a third trial was later levied
against Ebens, but he has not made any payments.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after Ebens' acquittal, Chin announced that after four
decades in the United States, she was moving back to China.</TE>
<TE>   "She had sisters, nieces and nephews here," said Oakland
journalist Helen Zia, who was a Detroit magazine writer when she met
Chin and became involved in her fight. "But she said she cried every
night when she went to bed, she cried when she woke up. She lived in
the same house Vincent grew up in. It was really hard, being in
Detroit, seeing all the landmarks--where he worked, was chased down,
killed.</TE>
<TE>   "She said it was too sad to stay in America."</TE>
<TE>   She returned to her village in Guangdong province. She seemed
happy, said Kwoh, who visited her in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   She intended to spend her last days there, but she became ill and
decided to seek treatment in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   She will be buried Saturday in Detroit next to her husband and
son.</TE>

<HD>Caseload Swamps Guardian Office, Report Finds</HD>
<DH>Services: Grand jury study recommends adding staff, but
county officials say the tight budget hampers them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Workers in the county's public guardian office are so swamped with
paperwork they have little time to meet with the disabled residents
they serve, says a Ventura County Grand Jury report released
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Five workers track 400 conservatorship cases, each requiring
significant documentation, according to the report. The grand jury
recommends adding more staff to the office to address this "excessive
and increasing caseload."</LD>
<LD>   Residents under the county's guardianship should also be visited
at least once a month to make sure they are being cared for
appropriately, the 26-page report concludes.</LD>
<TE>   The public guardian duties are part of Treasurer-Tax Collector
Harold S. Pittman's office. The public guardian steps in when adults
are so physically or mentally disabled that they cannot care for
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   The office arranges for shelter and medical care and manages
financial assets while a person is incapacitated.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of cases has increased over the years while the
size of the staff has remained the same, leading to inadequate
record-keeping and infrequent visits, the panel said.</TE>
<TE>   "Due to the large caseload ... individual attention to each of the
conservatees is limited," the report states. "Contact with some
conservatees is by phone in many instances rather than face-to-face."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector Larry Matheney said he agrees
with the report's conclusions. But with the county facing a
$17.6-million budget deficit, he has been forced to trim the public
guardian staff even further, reducing one job to a half-time
position.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some areas that we want to do a significantly better
job," Matheney said. "But we are really strapped for resources."</TE>
<TE>   Each case must be reviewed annually by a judge. Workers spend a
lot of time preparing the paperwork for those hearings, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It requires gathering expert mental health workers' diagnoses and
opinions, together with observations by our deputy public guardian.
Typically it's a 10-page report," he said. "Keeping those things
cranked out is a big job. Then, combined with visits to these folks
to make sure things are OK, they are really under the gun."</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Officer Johnny Johnston said he would review the
grand jury's report before making any recommendations on how to
respond.</TE>
<TE>   "We will look at it to see what alternatives there are," Johnston
said. "We may have to shift resources depending on what our review
shows."</TE>

<HD>DJ Gets Prison Term in Sex Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A popular Spanish-language radio personality was sentenced Thursday
to three years and eight months in prison after pleading guilty to
charges that he committed lewd acts on two 14-year-old girls he met
through his show.</LD>
<LD>   Firmo Martin Rossetti, known as morning host Hector Rocksetti on
Century City-based KLYY-FM (107.1), originally was charged with two
dozen felony counts of child molestation, rape and oral copulation
and could have faced as much as 30 years in prison, said James
Goldstein, his attorney.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm satisfied," Deputy Dist. Atty. Natalie Adomian said of the
sentence. "He used his position as a radio announcer to gain these
kids' trust and take advantage of them."</LD>
<TE>   Bolivian-born Rossetti, 38, will almost certainly be deported
after he serves his term, Adomian said. Rossetti must also register
as a sex offender and pay restitution for the psychiatric services of
one of the girls, according to Burbank Superior Court Judge Chesley
McKay's sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Rossetti, who wore an orange Los Angeles County Jail jumpsuit and
spoke through a Spanish interpreter, has worked with the radio
station for five years and, before that, worked at other
Spanish-language stations, Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the girls were frequent callers to the radio
station. Rossetti, a Burbank resident, allegedly promised he would
help one of the girls get into the radio business. Instead, he lured
her into having an inappropriate relationship and, a short time
later, another girl said she had the same experience with Rossetti,
police said.</TE>

<HD>Builder to Help Nail Down Funds to Bring Boys &amp; Girls Clubs
to Schools</HD>
<DH>Youth: The developer pledges up to $500,000 in matching
money for the Conejo Valley campaign.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A $12-million effort to bring six Boys &amp; Girls Clubs to middle school
campuses in the Conejo Valley has received a potential $500,000
boost.</LD>
<LD>   Cal Johnston, a Calabasas developer who started the drive last
year, said he will match any donation of $1,000 or more made by local
small businesses, up to a total of $500,000.</LD>
<LD>   The money will come from his own bank accounts, Johnston said. He
hopes other business people in the greater Conejo Valley--from
Calabasas to Newbury Park--will follow suit.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't think of anything more important," said Johnston, 70, who
lives in Thousand Oaks. "We're talking about protecting our
children."</TE>
<TE>   For Johnston, a national trustee of the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of
America, part of the motivation is personal.</TE>
<TE>   He lost both parents when he was 4. He lived at the Masonic Home
for Children in Covina until he was 18. The positive, stimulating
environment there was similar to the one provided by Boys &amp; Girls
Clubs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it made a huge difference in how my life evolved,"
Johnston said. "If we hope to keep our kids from wandering the malls
or getting into trouble, they need a place they feel is their own--a
place where they belong."</TE>
<TE>   His pledge will help kick off the nonprofit group's major
development campaign, which officially begins in July, said Bob
Gross, director of fund-raising for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Conejo
&amp; Las Virgenes.</TE>
<TE>   The group plans to solicit philanthropic support from the area's
larger corporations, including Amgen and Countrywide Home Loans,
Gross said. Johnston's matching gift is intended to give smaller
business owners an opportunity to participate.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognize that businesses with fewer than 25 employees don't
have the wherewithal to come in with a $10,000 gift," Gross said. "I
think this initial lead gift is going to trigger some wonderful
things."</TE>
<TE>   A feasibility study completed this year shows there is corporate
support for the $12-million project, which calls for two $6-million
phases, Gross said.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Thousand Oaks agreed to contribute $1 million toward
construction of the four clubhouses proposed for that city, after the
youth organization raises $450,000 for each site.</TE>
<TE>   Johnston's group hopes to build two additional 10,000-square-foot
clubhouses on middle school campuses to serve children and teens in
Westlake Village, Agoura Hills, Oak Park and Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   They will be the first Boys &amp; Girls Clubs in the affluent
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to provide youngsters with a place to go during
crucial before- and after-school hours, when studies show juvenile
crime rates are highest.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a host of after-school programs and sports leagues
available to Conejo Valley youth, community leaders say there is a
void in supervised activities targeting children too old for day care
and too young to be home alone before parents return from work.</TE>
<TE>   And while homework help and other tutoring programs are available
at schools, they can cost as much as $200 a month.</TE>
<TE>   A membership in the Boys &amp; Girls Club will cost families $15 to
$20 a year.</TE>

<HD>Unit Takes Aim at Illegal Guns</HD>
<DH>Safety: A $360,000 federal grant will help pay for a
four-year task force that plans to crack down on unlicensed sales of
firearms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUFIYA ABDUR-RAHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo announced Thursday the
creation of a special unit to prosecute people who illegally sell
guns.</LD>
<LD>   The new four-year unit, to be called the Gun Prosecution Task
Force, will initially be funded with a $360,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Justice. That money will help the city attorney's
office pay for three additional prosecutors for three years,
Delgadillo said at a news conference at the North Hollywood police
station. The city is responsible for the cost of the task force's
last year, he said.</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors will work with the Los Angeles Police Department
to identify illegal gun sales. Specifically, he said, city lawyers
will check on the more than 160 gun dealers in Los Angeles who hold
federal firearms licenses to make sure they also have local police
permits, Delgadillo said.</LD>
<TE>   "Every year," he said, "there are more people killed by firearms
than cars in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a local public safety problem that deserves a local
solution."</TE>
<TE>   There are currently eight detectives in the LAPD's gun unit, but
they often run into trouble getting prosecutions due to a lack of
evidence, said LAPD Lt. Steven Nielsen. Nielsen said the addition of
lawyers to the unit should help police identify in advance the
evidence needed to win a conviction against a gun dealer.</TE>
<TE>   By working closely with specialized prosecutors, Nielsen said,
"our resources are going to be much more honed in."</TE>
<TE>   Ruett and Rhonda Foster, who lost one son to gun violence and are
still dealing with the injuries that another son suffered, joined
Delgadillo and other city officials in announcing the task force and
expressed hope that it would help curtail gun violence. The Fosters'
7-year-old boy was killed in an Inglewood shooting in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Reiss Lane, a former member of the Los Angeles Police
Commission and now the chairwoman of Women Against Gun Violence,
praised the formation of the task force as "a major effort to keep
guns out of the hands of criminals."</TE>

<HD>Judge Upholds Protection of Habitat for 2 Species</HD>
<DH>Environment: Despite a flawed study, land needed by
gnatcatcher and fairy shrimp in the region will remain off limits to
development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than half a million acres of Southern California land protected
for two imperiled species will retain its special status even though
federal officials failed to consider the economic impacts of labeling
so much property "critical habitat," a federal judge in Los Angeles
ruled earlier this week.</LD>
<LD>   In making this decision, which was made public Thursday, Judge
Stephen V. Wilson rejected the Bush administration's effort to leave
the land unprotected and open to development while the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service conducts a new analysis of the economic impact of
protection on property owners.</LD>
<LD>   The land, covered with sage scrub and shallow freshwater pools,
was deemed essential two years ago by the agency for the survival of
the coastal California gnatcatcher and the San Diego fairy shrimp.</LD>
<TE>   Wilson also ordered the Fish and Wildlife Service to complete a
new economic analysis in 10 months, less than half the time the
agency had sought.</TE>
<TE>   Federal wildlife officials declined comment, saying their
attorneys had not had enough time to review the written ruling, which
was filed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists hailed the move, saying it will prevent
wholesale habitat destruction by construction of a toll road by local
transportation agencies and of 14,000 homes by a development company,
Rancho Mission Viejo, in south Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really good news," said Joel Reynolds, a senior attorney
with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which has been involved
in litigation with the agency over the gnatcatcher for nearly a
decade.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got major developers chomping at the bit to proceed with
huge developments," he said. "Those developers are coming in here
arguing that the elimination of protection would make no difference
for the gnatcatcher. But the truth is they are here fighting the
designation precisely because they know that it does make a
difference and that's what the court recognized."</TE>
<TE>   David Smith, legal counsel for the Building Industry Assn. of
Southern California, said he felt the judge should have struck the
rule since the government conceded that it was flawed. "But I don't
think it has that much consequence either way," especially since new
rules will be in place by next summer, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most controversial provisions of the Endangered Species
Act, critical habitat is a category of protected land in which
building and other activity can be limited or even barred to ensure
the survival of rare plants and animals.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service declared more than
510,000 acres in Southern California essential to the survival of the
gnatcatcher and the fairy shrimp. Responding to lawsuits by Rancho
Mission Viejo, the Transportation Corridor Agencies, the Building
Industry Assn. and others, the Bush administration asked Wilson to
invalidate the designations.</TE>
<TE>   The administration's request coincided with a slew of lawsuits,
brought by landowners nationwide, challenging how the government
conducted its financial analyses of the impact of designating
critical habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Before designating habitat, the service is legally required to
analyze the economic consequences for developers, private property
owners, cities and others with financial interests in the land. Until
last year, nearly all those analyses had said creating critical
habitat would have little to no effect.</TE>
<TE>   Developers' attorneys said the court's underlying decision, which
Wilson reached in February, recognizes that the wildlife service
failed to take the economic impacts into account when mapping
habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope this time around the government will do a serious,
thorough analysis of all the economic impacts of the critical habitat
designation," said lawyer Rob Thornton, who represents the TCA, which
wants to build the toll road through gnatcatcher habitat in south
Orange County.</TE>

<HD>John Hope, 83; Popular Expert on Hurricanes at Weather
Channel</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Hope, a meteorologist and expert on hurricanes whose calm on-air
demeanor made him an influential presence on the Weather Channel for
more than 20 years, died Thursday at a hospital in Macon, Ga., of
complications from open-heart surgery. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Once called the Walter Cronkite of hurricane coverage--a label
that made him wince--Hope provided reports that were a staple in
homes along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico coasts during hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.</LD>
<LD>   "He popularized hurricane forecasting," said Mike Smith, founder
and chief executive of WeatherData, a Wichita, Kan.-based firm that
provides meteorological information to private industry.</LD>
<TE>   "Before that, it was seen as something very arcane, but he helped
make it something the public could understand. The importance of that
is a marked decrease in the hurricane death rate."</TE>
<TE>   John Raymond Hope's interest in weather began on the farm in
Stowell, Pa., where he was born.</TE>
<TE>   "In the '20s, you didn't have much weather information," Hope told
a reporter for the Virginian Pilot some years ago. "You learned to
read cloud formations. If you got it wrong, it could cost money."</TE>
<TE>   His career began in the Army Air Corps during World War II where
he was a weather observer and forecaster in the Pacific Theater.</TE>
<TE>   There he saw for the first time the power of tropical cyclones, or
hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Once a mediocre student, he went to college after the war with a
new sense of purpose. He was elected Phi Beta Kappa at the University
of Illinois, and earned his master's degree in meteorology from the
University of Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In 1949, Hope became a district forecaster in Memphis, Tenn., for
the U.S. Weather Bureau. In 1962, he joined the Spaceflight
Meteorology Group in Miami, which predicted weather for launches in
the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo space programs. Six years later he
helped start the National Hurricane Center, also in Miami. He quickly
became a senior hurricane specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Hurricane Camille struck the year after he began work at the
center, the only Stage 5 storm (the most severe rating) in the last
50 years.</TE>
<TE>   In those days, hurricanes were given female names in alphabetical
order by officials at the National Hurricane Center.</TE>
<TE>   Stuck for a name that started with a C, a co-worker suggested
Hope's daughter's name, Camille. Initially pleased, Hope and his
daughter were later appalled after Hurricane Camille, which struck
Mississippi, West Virginia and Virginia, left 256 dead and $1.45
billion in damage.</TE>
<TE>   Hope left the center in 1982 and became an on-air meteorologist
and coordinator of tropical storm coverage at the Weather Channel, a
cable network that has had notable success. His impact was immediate.</TE>
<TE>   "In the days of Camille, there was nothing like the Weather
Channel or the way TV weather is done today," Smith said. "John and
the modern-day TV meteorologist gave people a lifeline, the what to
do and how to do it to save their lives and minimize property loss.
John developed a close bond with his audience."</TE>
<TE>   That bond was forged by his commentary on Hurricane Andrew in
1992, when he was on the air for 24 hours straight. And it was
reflected Thursday in messages from his followers to Weather Channel
chat rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It is almost impossible to imagine watching TWC during hurricane
season and not seeing John Hope. His knowledge and expertise were
unparalleled," one viewer wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "We may not have known a lot about his life history, but we who
are interested in the science of meteorology have always felt a
kinship to him," wrote another.</TE>
<TE>   Hope's impact also was reflected in comments from Weather Channel
staffers.</TE>
<TE>   "John wanted the Weather Channel to be the best at tropical
forecasting. He made me willing to work hard to meet his high
standards.... Praise from John Hope meant more to me than anyone else
in the company. To know that you got John Hope's stamp of approval
meant so much," said Cynthia Gilley, a meteorologist at the channel.</TE>
<TE>   Hope became a highly recognizable figure off the camera as well.
Pilots stopped him in airports to say hello. People on streets in
Europe thanked him for his insightful broadcasts.</TE>
<TE>   Once, at the beach, a surfer came by to meet him, Hope recalled in
an interview with the Raleigh News and Observer.</TE>
<TE>   "He called me 'Hope Dude,' " Hope said. "I just said, 'Hi.' What
can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 55 years, Bernice; his daughter
Camille L. Hope; sons James C. Hope, Dr. Thomas D. Hope and James R.
Hope; and a brother, Leonard Hope, all of Georgia; and six
grandchildren.</TE>

<LD>Nine men were arrested Thursday, 22 hours after they allegedly
kidnapped a 26-year-old off a street in South-Central Los Angeles,
demanded ransom from his family and viciously beat him as the family
listened.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, who was hospitalized in stable but guarded condition,
was grabbed at gunpoint at 7:40 p.m. Wednesday as he parked and
locked his car in the 1300 block of East Walnut Street, Officer Don
Cox said. About half a dozen men forced him into one of two vans.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified man's family soon began receiving telephone calls
asking for "a substantial amount of money," Cox said. The kidnappers
threatened to kill him and viciously pistol-whipped him as the family
listened on the phone, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Members of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division found the man and
suspects Thursday evening at an unspecified location in the Wilshire
area. The nine are being held in lieu of $1-million bail each at
Parker Center.</TE>

<HD>Three-Peat on Parade</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stephen Allen has worked on concerts starring the likes of Paul
McCartney and Britney Spears. But the 41-year-old is most proud of
the job he performed Thursday at the Staples Center, helping prepare
for the Lakers three-peat celebration.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm gonna feel like I put on the parade," he said. "I'm
definitely proud to be a part of this thing."</LD>
<LD>   Allen was one of a small army of people who sprang into action
late Wednesday to prepare for today's parade celebrating the Lakers'
historic championship three-peat.</LD>
<TE>   The celebration will begin with a 10:30 a.m. ceremony at City
Hall, where Mayor James K. Hahn will pronounce today "Los Angeles
Lakers Day." At 11:30, the team, their families, the Laker Girls and
team officials will board double-decker buses at 3rd Street for a
procession down Figueroa to Staples Center at 11th Street.</TE>
<TE>   A rally in front of Staples Center starts at 12:50. The Lakers
will greet the crowd, Hahn will speak, and maybe, just maybe, Laker
Mark Madsen will dance. Team officials expect as many as 1 million
fans, not many of whom will appreciate that preparations for the
parade began nearly as soon as the last basket fell Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   It has taken the work of event coordinators and electricians.
Producers and stagehands. Carpenters, sound technicians and
scaffolding specialists, nearly 250 in all. Their goal: Put together
a championship parade that makes the difficult look easy, the planned
look coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   This is the second time around for many of them, the third for a
few.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time around we were pretty much feeling our way
through. The second year, we understood that we had to get even
better. This year, we had to think in terms of how to make it an even
better show," said Michael Roth, Staples Center's director of
communications, talking about how preparations for the parade have
evolved.It's a job riddled with complications. Start preparations too
soon, and an opposing team might gain motivation from your arrogance,
Roth said. Start too late, and you might run out of time to lay all
the cables that need to be laid, raise all the scaffolding that needs
to be raised.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as police hustled the last fan away from Staples Center on
Wednesday night, trucks began delivering and unloading parade
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   By midday Thursday, a 20-foot-high stage had been erected, but
there were still video screens to rig and elevators to install.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes a day and a half to build this, and we're pushing it,"
Roth said.</TE>
<TE>   Pulling it off would require a team effort that rivals anything
seen on a basketball court. Workers in smudged T-shirts and baggy
shorts huddled on a patch of blacktop, debating. A scaffolding
erected for television cameras in front of the stage was too high and
would block fans' view. Move it or lower it? They haggled back and
forth, sweating in the sun. Except for the occasional puff of
cigarette smoke, they could have been ballplayers in the neighborhood
park.</TE>
<TE>   Another crew raced to connect 80 giant speakers. By the time the
parade starts, Dirk Schubert's nine employees will have wired
together about 160,000 watts' worth.</TE>
<TE>   Schubert's audio company, Schubert Systems, worked the parade last
year. When a Laker grabs a microphone, it will be his speakers that
boom Phil Jackson's musings over much of downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Few fans will notice the new audio system and appreciate the
cleaner sound. Still, Schubert said, if his unseen contribution makes
for a better celebration, it will be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an honor just to be involved," he said</TE>
<TE>   Getting people involved in the parade, team officials said, is the
whole point of the public celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, we try to make it as exciting for fans as possible,"
said Ian Levitt, the Lakers' director of event productions and
operations.</TE>
<TE>   This year's tweaks and adjustments could fill a small notebook.
The stage will be about 30 feet closer to the fans this year, and a
hidden elevator will hoist a 12-foot foam replica of the championship
trophy.</TE>
<TE>   And if traffic stops on the Harbor Freeway when people get out of
their cars to watch the parade this time like they did last year,
what will Dirk Schubert think?</TE>
<TE>   "I'll hope they can hear it," he said.</TE>

<HD>No Consensus on Latino Vote Ruling</HD>
<DH>Politics: Some see court redistricting decision as sign of
progress. Others fear it will halt gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD and MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal court's dismissal of a challenge to part of California's
new political map highlights the gains that Latinos have made in
securing elected offices but threatens to inhibit further expansion
of that influence, some scholars and advocates said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, however, some voting rights experts said the
ruling will help undermine the notion that voters support only
candidates of their own ethnicity. While those experts argued that
voters today are increasingly willing to back candidates of all
ethnicities, others said California voting remains ethnically
polarized--and therefore worried that the ruling presumes a racially
neutral society that does not yet exist.</LD>
<LD>   Armando Duron, counsel to the California Latino Redistricting
Coalition, said the decision essentially "freezes the gains we've got
so far in place."</LD>
<TE>   "My fear is that what's going to happen is that in light of the
ruling--and the rather selfish way Latino legislators looked at
reapportionment in California--10 years from now, we may be just
where we're at," he added. "We will not have made any more gains."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some Latino leaders welcomed the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Labor official Miguel Contreras said it reflected the distance
Latinos have come in gaining political power. "It shows that the
Latino vote is beginning to develop some maturity," said Contreras,
whose union organization supported the Legislature's new political
maps.</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be Latinos only represented the Eastside of Los
Angeles.... Who would have thought a decade ago that we would have
Latinos elected out of the San Joaquin Valley?"</TE>
<TE>   A three-judge U.S. District Court panel dismissed a lawsuit
Wednesday that challenged the maps of congressional and legislative
districts drawn by state lawmakers after the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   The suit by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational
Fund argued that the maps diluted the power of Latinos to elect
candidates of their choice by dispersing them among districts.</TE>
<TE>   Although discrimination continues to motivate at least a portion
of the electorate, the court found, "whites and other non-Latinos are
currently far more willing to support Latino candidates for office
than in the past."</TE>
<TE>   In its ruling, the court noted that the portion of Latinos in the
state Legislature has grown to 22.5%. The court also pointed out that
16 of 19 Latinos in the Assembly and all seven Latino state senators
voted for the redistricting plan.</TE>
<TE>   Some Latino lawmakers backed the measure only reluctantly. State
Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), for instance, voted for the plan but
said the "boundaries could have been done better." He welcomed the
MALDEF court challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to fight these battles sometimes, if only to
clarify the law," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Registration
and Education Project and a plaintiff in the suit, called the
dismissal of the lawsuit "horrifically bad" for Latino voting rights.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that racially polarized voting no longer exists in Los
Angeles County is so ludicrous on the face of it, you almost can't
believe that somebody would actually say that with a straight face,"
said Gonzalez. "But the court did."</TE>
<TE>   Among the districts challenged in the MALDEF lawsuit was that of
Rep. Howard Berman (D-Mission Hills), who represents a large portion
of the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   MALDEF argued that state lawmakers moved thousands of Latinos out
of his district to protect him from the threat of a Latino challenger
in a Democratic primary. The other two districts at issue in the suit
were those of Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego) and Sen. Betty Karnette
(D-Long Beach).</TE>
<TE>   In each instance, critics of the redistricting charged that
boundaries were redrawn to protect Democratic incumbents at the
expense of Latino voters; the court's ruling, they argued, was
therefore good for Democrats but bad for Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "We're deeply concerned about the ruling," said Rosalind Gold,
senior director of policy research and advocacy for the National
Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.</TE>
<TE>   "It is indeed true that Latinos have made political progress, but
it's often at the point that minority groups are making progress that
efforts to dilute their power intensify."</TE>
<TE>   David Diaz, a professor of Chicano studies at Cal State
Northridge, supported the court challenge, but said that in some
respects the ruling was not a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Because the Latino population is actually becoming the majority
in L.A. County, and a substantial percentage in many other parts of
the state, it's difficult now to prove they've been effectively
gerrymandered out of districts to dilute their voting power," he
said. "Courts are going to be a little more conservative."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda), who chairs the Senate
Reapportionment Committee, called the ruling "an accurate reflection
of what's going on" in California's changing political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "Latinos should be very proud that politically they have arrived,"
he said. "They are as represented and as politically powerful as any
constituency, and probably more powerful than many, and the districts
we drew were reflective of that."</TE>
<TE>   Tony Quinn, a Republican strategist and expert on California's
political demographics, called the ruling a significant one that
reflects a shift that started in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he said, there were only sporadic cases of Latinos
being elected in majority non-Latino districts. The
perception--encouraged by Democrats and Republicans alike--was that
Latinos needed a heavily minority population to win office. That, in
turn, discouraged many Latino candidates from even trying to run, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But the "presumption of prejudice was never proven," Quinn said.
Once Latinos started running and winning crossover support from
non-Latino voters, they won elections in communities from Riverside
to Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the voters were, frankly, ahead of a lot of the political
scientists," Quinn said, "and certainly ahead of a lot of the liberal
voting rights activists."</TE>

<HD>Tollway Boards Agree to Study Merging</HD>
<DH>Transit: Uniting Foothill-Eastern and San Joaquin Hills
could save the latter agency from default.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two boards that control Orange County's largest turnpike system took
steps Thursday toward merging their highways--a move some say might
save the financially ailing San Joaquin Hills toll road as well as
plans to build another tollway south of Mission Viejo.</LD>
<LD>   The board of the successful Foothill-Eastern toll road through
eastern Orange County agreed to study a consolidation with the San
Joaquin Hills, which has failed to meet traffic and revenue
projections since it opened in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Immediately after the decision, Foothill-Eastern directors met
with the board of the San Joaquin Hills road and began the
complicated task of determining whether a merger is politically and
economically feasible.</LD>
<TE>   They established a research committee and outlined issues to be
resolved before a decision can be made to create a unified agency.
The topics include how to meld both boards into a single governing
body and whether $4 billion in bonds--the total debt of the toll
roads--could be refinanced.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the beginning of a yearlong process," said Walter D.
Kreutzen, chief executive of the Irvine-based Transportation Corridor
Agencies, which manages both toll roads. "Although we don't know yet
whether a merger will work, I don't think there is any other way to
go right now."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Transportation Corridor Agencies administers both
turnpikes, each is financed independently and has its own board of
directors selected from county and municipal government.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials are in the middle of planning the Foothill South
project, a toll road that would run 15 miles from Oso Parkway in
Mission Viejo to Interstate 5 south of San Clemente. If built, it
would complete the agency's 67-mile toll road network and be under
control of the Foothill-Eastern's board.</TE>
<TE>   Directors for both toll roads began considering a merger after an
economic analysis indicated it might be the only way to keep the San
Joaquin Hills tollway from eventually defaulting on about $1 billion
in bonds sold to build the road. Financial ratings agencies have
downgraded those bonds twice, lowering them to junk-bond status
earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   The analysis further concluded that if nothing were done, Wall
Street might further lower the ratings of TCA bonds and undermine the
agency's ability to refinance or borrow for future projects, such as
the Foothill South.</TE>
<TE>   A merger, TCA officials say, might let the more successful
Foothill-Eastern subsidize the San Joaquin Hills and improve the
prospects for refinancing all the debt of both toll roads. If the
study shows a merger is feasible, a consolidation might occur by May
2003.</TE>
<TE>   During discussions Thursday, some board members cautioned that it
is not yet clear whether a merger would make it possible to refinance
the toll roads or sell new bonds for Foothill South.</TE>
<TE>   A consolidation might lower the TCA's margin between revenue and
expenses to a level that might adversely affect its credit ratings,
officials said. If so, issuing new debt would be harder and more
costly.</TE>
<TE>   "We might not get market access to refinance," said Orange County
Supervisor Todd Spitzer, a member of both toll road boards. "If our
numbers come up too conservative for traffic and revenue, then we are
right where we are today."</TE>
<TE>   Any merger will be contingent on the results of new traffic and
revenue studies for the Foothill-Eastern and San Joaquin Hills roads.
The former is at 110% of projections for both revenue and vehicle
trips. The latter has been running between 70% and 80% of forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA is particularly concerned about a recent Irvine Co.
decision to scale back commercial and residential development
dramatically in eastern Orange County and how that might affect the
Foothill-Eastern's revenue growth.</TE>
<TE>   Though that toll road is profitable, the Irvine Co.'s action is
expected to reduce the number of daily vehicle trips in the area by
400,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer and his board colleague, Supervisor Tom Wilson, said the
merger committee should be willing to look at other options, though
they did not say Thursday what those might be. But Wilson said both
boards must study consolidation very carefully and be ready with
another scenario if it is ruled out.</TE>
<TE>   "The merger is not a slam dunk," Wilson said. "It's just another
proposal as far as I'm concerned. I don't care about all the
financial people in the audience." The supervisor was referring to
the bond attorneys, underwriters and brokerage representatives at the
meeting. Some of them have been financial advisors to the TCA.</TE>
<TE>   At the joint board meeting, opponents of the Foothill South, such
as the Sierra Club and Friends of the Foothills, criticized the
merger as a misguided attempt to save plans for an unneeded tollway
that would destroy open space and valuable wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Corcoran, a regional representative for the Sierra Club, told
board members that the proposed refinancing of the toll road bonds
would extend the debt for years, making "a mockery" of the promise
that toll roads would eventually become free to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Wall Street just wants to protect its bond sales," Corcoran said.
"Orange County's taxpayers should consider toll road finances with a
skeptical eye and a hand on their pocketbooks."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Makes Push to Lure Black Firms</HD>
<DH>Diversity: City's hosting of a two-day summit is part of a
commitment to boost multiculturalism.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a push to broaden Irvine's diversity, the city is hosting a
two-day conference that officials hope will motivate black-owned
businesses to move to a town in which African Americans make up less
than 2% of the population.</LD>
<LD>   About 500 entrepreneurs from across the state are expected to
attend the African American Business Summit, which begins today at
the Hyatt Regency Irvine and is aimed at helping small-business
owners become more profitable. Twice in its five-year existence the
summit has been held in Irvine, which city leaders are hoping to
shape into a model of multiculturalism for the suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   "They're doing a lot of things right," said Thomas Parham, a
consultant who advises public and private institutions on cultural
diversity.</LD>
<TE>   The summit will include speeches by former Atlanta Mayor Maynard
H. Jackson and workshops focusing on such matters as alternative
financing, online marketing and corporate diversity. Groups such as
Parham's 100 Black Men of Orange County, which promotes education and
economic development in the black community, are helping sponsor the
event.</TE>
<TE>   "Irvine hasn't been widely known among African Americans," said
Patricia Means, a summit founder. "But this is like laying out a
welcome mat. People are going to be far more willing to approach the
city."</TE>
<TE>   By some measures, Irvine's diversity is surprising to those who
cling to memories of the county as a mostly white community.</TE>
<TE>   About 45% of Irvine's 148,000 residents are non-white, a figure
that doesn't include about 15,000 residents of Middle Eastern
descent. According to city statistics, about 44,000 residents are
Asian and Pacific Islanders, and 11,000 are Latino. But only about
2,600 are black, less than 2% of the town's population--a statistic
that mirrors the county's, and one the city would like to double.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County has been slow to attract African Americans and
black-owned business, a fact some blame on its lingering reputation
for right-wing politics and a history tainted by racism. Others say
it's the high cost of housing that has made the county uninviting. In
Irvine, the median home price is $356,000--almost $100,000 more than
the median home price for all of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   That's going to make striking a cultural balance very difficult,
said Jennifer Wolch, co-director of the Sustainable Cities Program at
USC.</TE>
<TE>   "The housing market almost precludes it, unless the city is
dedicated to providing an adequate share of affordable housing--not
just for low-income families, but for very low-income," Wolch said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the city and the Irvine Co. have vowed to formulate
a plan to provide 1,800 homes for low- and very low-income families
within Irvine's next--and probably final--development push. And,
Wolch said, the city's effort to attract minority businesses will add
to its chances for success in reaching its goal of becoming an
American model of diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "Attracting African American businesses and families to Irvine is,
for me, a priority," Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said. "As America's
largest and most successful planned community, we have to be
concerned about much more than physical infrastructure--the beautiful
streets, parks, landscaping. We have to be concerned about social
structure as well."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the summit, the city this year held a daylong festival
celebrating the community's diversity and staged a display honoring
African American inventors during Black History Month. Three years
ago it formed a group to organize cultural celebrations throughout
the year, and the Police Department has assigned one officer the sole
task of recruiting minorities. Civic workshops are conducted to help
employees understand the beliefs and customs of other cultures.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no Little Saigon here, no Koreatown, no barrio," Agran
said. "We are all living in this community together. And that's a
refreshing and upbeat message that I'd like to get out to the whole
world."</TE>

<DH>History: Nixon library offers a sanitized view of Watergate
on the 30th anniversary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At first blush, it would seem akin to the John F. Kennedy
presidential library taking note of his relationship with Marilyn
Monroe. Or the Ronald Reagan library calling attention to the
anniversary of the Iran-Contra scandal.</LD>
<LD>   At the privately run Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba
Linda, though, the watershed event that led to the fall of the 37th
president is being embraced--the library is marking Monday's 30th
anniversary of the Watergate break-in.</LD>
<LD>   In a "media advisory" released this week, the library invited
calls on the June 17, 1972, burglary--a public outreach that struck
some, including one of the library's contact names, as a "misplaced
seeking of publicity."</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think the old man would have sanctioned [the media
alert]," said political consultant Ken Khachigian, a Nixon confidant
and member of the foundation that oversees the library. "It would
have been the last thing that he would do."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty years after G. Gordon Liddy and E. Howard Hunt planned the
break-in into offices of the Democratic National Committee, Watergate
still intrigues the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Pundits and players of the time are popping up on television gab
fests. The phone has been busy at the U.S. National Archives' Nixon
Project in College Park, Md.--so busy that officials decided to give
journalists a "one-time opportunity" to see and photograph police
evidence taken from one of the most infamous crime scenes in history.</TE>
<TE>   For two hours Thursday, journalists were treated to a rare glimpse
of the address book containing Hunt's White House phone number and
the burglars' tools.</TE>
<TE>   "There is really only one Watergate," said Susan Cooper, a
spokeswoman for the National Archives.</TE>
<TE>   But there's more than one Nixon archive. Nixon's presidential
papers are kept by the National Archives. The Yorba Linda
institution, which doesn't take taxpayer money, houses millions of
pages of documents from Nixon's years outside the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The facility, which opened in 1990, has been criticized by some
historians as little more than a tourist attraction that relies on
rental income from banquets, weddings and bar mitzvahs. With only one
full-time archivist, much of the material there has yet to be
cataloged.</TE>
<TE>   Its Watergate exhibit is in keeping with Nixon's attempt after
leaving office to convince the public he had no prior knowledge of
the break-in, didn't try to cover it up, and was hounded from office
by political enemies and journalists critical of his role in the
Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   The library's public copy of the so-called "smoking gun" tape,
which showed that Nixon tried to stop the federal investigation of
Watergate, is heavily edited and laced with added material that
attempts to explain away his words.</TE>
<TE>   "Watergate anniversaries are media celebrations," said library
director John Taylor, explaining why he was calling attention to the
anniversary. "The media see Watergate as its finest hour."</TE>
<TE>   He maintains Nixon's biggest failing was "not being sufficiently
ruthless enough cleaning house" after the burglary.</TE>
<TE>   "People should stop looking at Watergate as the moral and ethical
failure of one man and begin to look at it as the failure of a
management system," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   To historian and author Irv Gellman, who is working on the second
of his series of Nixon biographies, the library's effort to downplay
Nixon's role in Watergate is in keeping with "the whole shtick of
that place."</TE>
<TE>   "That's just odd," Gellman said of the library marking the
occasion by offering to set up interviews. "They're trying to spin
... their view of Watergate, which is that it's all a terrible
misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "Their main goal should be to run a library and be a research
source.... To say, 'If you want Nixon's point of view call us'--it's
very unusual."</TE>
<TE>   What Gellman calls spin, Nixon library spokeswoman Arianna
Barrios-Lochrie calls "balance." The library planned to run an ad in
Sunday's Los Angeles Times encouraging people to visit and get both
sides of the Watergate story.</TE>
<TE>   "There's so much negative that's been written on Richard Nixon, we
can't afford to ignore it," she said. "We're just saying people
deserve to hear both sides."</TE>
<TE>   Khachigian doesn't dispute that. He just wishes that he and other
board members were consulted about the library's invitation to the
media.</TE>
<TE>   "We should neither run from it or toward it," Khachigian said of
the legacy of Watergate. "Any anniversary of June 17th is a
watershed, and its going to be observed one way or another.... It's a
little odd to see some advisory out there saying, 'Gee, in case you
forgot....' "</TE>

board Trustee Don Garcia does not live in the elementary school
district he serves.</LD>
<LD>   Resident Duane Roberts last year accused Garcia of living in a
mansion in Corona del Mar rather than the Anaheim house he listed as
his address in campaign filings.</LD>
<LD>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Raymond Armstrong said Thursday that,
though there was strong evidence that Garcia lives primarily in
Corona del Mar, the trustee also maintains a home in Anaheim.</LD>

<LD>The police log of the Los Alamitos News-Enterprise reported that a
man was heard screaming, "I am going to kill you!" However, the
newspaper said, a subsequent investigation revealed that he "was
addressing his computer." And no jury of PC users would convict him.</LD>
<LD>   Unclear on the concept: The same police log also carried an item
about a guy who was arrested after trying to open an account with a
woman's driver's license. A bald guy.</LD>

Corona del Mar that he hasn't taken up "because the notice at the
bottom of the ad left us confused about how long we could keep it.
And what would happen if we didn't return it on time."</TE>
<TE>   Plates in motion: Mention here of a nationwide vanity plate
contest prompted Bonnie Sloane to recall seeing a vehicle that you
never want to play chicken with. The plate read COQOVAN.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds familiar somehow: After the mentions here of a hair salon

Bail Bonds on 1st Street gave away lanyards (ID-card neck cords)

<HD>Ex-Oracle Lobbyist Refuses to Testify as Panel Ends Probe
of Software Deal</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Committee's evidence, which won't include
testimony from Ravi Mehta, will be sent to attorney general for
criminal investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Oracle lobbyist Ravi Mehta refused to testify at a legislative
hearing Thursday about his role in the state's $95-million software
contract with the company, invoking his right to avoid
self-incrimination.</LD>
<LD>   At that, Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), chairman of the
Joint Legislative Audit Committee, declared the panel's investigation
to be over and announced that its massive collection of evidence and
testimony will be sent to Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer for his criminal
investigation of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Mehta appeared under subpoena Thursday after failing to attend
Wednesday and testify voluntarily as he had said he would. His
attorney, former federal prosecutor Matt Jacobs of Sacramento, called
the committee's proceedings a "Star Chamber" affair in which his
client would not receive a fair hearing.</LD>
<TE>   As Jacobs sat beside him at the witness table Thursday, Mehta
again refused to testify, even after he had been given half an hour
to read a preview of the more than 160 questions Florez intended to
ask. Many dealt with a $25,000 check he handed to one of Davis' top
information technology advisors shortly after the contract was signed
in May 2001. Davis later returned the contribution, but the staff
member, Arun Baheti, resigned under pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Florez said he also wanted to ask about a memo Mehta wrote last
January to Oracle executives urging them to make campaign
contributions to a group of legislators who had been "helpful" to
Oracle in the past or who may become friends of the company in the
future. Oracle officials said they dismissed the memo and did not
make the contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Mehta, an attorney and former chairman of the state Fair Political
Practices Commission, which enforces political reform laws, told
committee members that he had cooperated in providing documents to
the panel and "I'd like to continue cooperating."</TE>
<TE>   But, as committee members had anticipated, Mehta then asserted his
5th Amendment constitutional right against self-incrimination as well
as all other "applicable" laws, including his right to privacy and
"my right not to have this committee inquire into matters beyond its
jurisdiction."</TE>
<TE>   Florez excused him as a witness. He said that if the committee
compelled Mehta to answer even the most innocuous question, the
action likely would have the effect of granting Mehta immunity
against possible criminal charges. It also risked jeopardizing the
attorney general's investigation, he said. Mehta, whose employment
with Oracle terminated May 31, and Jacobs refused to talk with
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Lockyer, turned aside questions
about the attorney general's investigation but expressed relief that
the committee's investigation was now concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Barankin indicated that the committee's probe, which reached into
Davis' office and took testimony from top gubernatorial staffers,

investigators will now have "more flexibility" in interviewing people
and gathering evidence, he said.</TE>

2000 and 2001. He returned the funds recently when the Oracle scandal
broke, Barankin said.</TE>

<HD>Surely Those Who Picked America's 'Top Bachelors' Fell One
Hunk Short</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I couldn't have been more pleased to see that local guy Kevin
Armstrong is one of "America's Top 50 Bachelors" as chosen by People
magazine.</LD>
<LD>   Excuse me, make that Doctor Kevin Armstrong.</LD>
<LD>   It always gives me a warm glow when hometown folks burst onto the
national scene. And now, to be on a list that includes actors George
Clooney and Ben Affleck ... well, Dr. Armstrong must be quite proud.</LD>
<TE>   Not that I wanted to make the list, but I've scanned Armstrong's
bio and, quite frankly, don't understand the fuss. He's 36 with an
undergraduate degree in molecular biology from Princeton, where he
was co-captain of the football team. He graduated from UCLA's medical
school and while on a sports medicine fellowship, he was assistant
team physician for the Pittsburgh Steelers and the University of
Pittsburgh basketball team.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, he's an orthopedic surgeon and assistant clinical
professor at UC Irvine Medical Center. According to the center, he's
investigating "new innovations in posterior cruciate ligament
reconstruction."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, I bet.</TE>
<TE>   He's also the team doctor for his alma mater, Woodbridge High
School, and several other schools. Among other things, he's published
papers on knee ligament biomechanics.</TE>
<TE>   Besides all that, I've seen a picture of the guy and would
describe him as "moderately handsome with a nice smile."</TE>
<TE>   So I'm sitting here at my desk, picking sunburned skin off the
bridge of my nose from sitting in the upper deck at last weekend's
Angels series and wondering what it takes to get on that People
magazine list.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to me that Armstrong and I simply chose different career
paths and have dissimilar philosophies about spending our free time.
In his off-hours, he volunteers his services and publishes scholarly
articles. I park myself on the sofa and watch TV for hours on end.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be petty about it, but I called a People editor to see how
a guy like Armstrong is such a hot property, while certain other
bachelors in their early 50s are pretty much off the radar screen.</TE>
<TE>   "Beyond the ones in the public eye, we look for those men who have
made names for themselves in their fields," says associate Los
Angeles bureau chief Julie Jordan, who in that short sentence
invalidated everything I've tried to do in 30 years in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of word-of-mouth," she says. "We have five stateside
bureaus, and they put out feelers in the community as to who the most
eligible bachelors are. Hopefully, we'll find a few gems we can
introduce to the rest of the world."</TE>
<TE>   She seemed to stop just short of addressing me as, "You Big Fat
Loser."</TE>
<TE>   I mention to her in passing that apparently my name never surfaced
as a candidate. Nor was I aware of any tryouts for the list.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to get someone out there campaigning for you," Jordan
says.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong is one of only 16 in the Top 50 who isn't a sports or
entertainment celebrity. I ask Jordan what he brings to the dance.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole package," she says. "He takes his job seriously, enjoys
life and is looking for love."</TE>
<TE>   He said that?</TE>
<TE>   "Let's see what he said," Jordan says, reading from his dossier. "
'To be with someone and continue to grow with that person for the
rest of your life. That's the big prize.' "</TE>
<TE>   Funny, that's the last thing I say every night just before
slipping on my anti-teeth-grinding guard, then tossing and turning
for the next eight hours while enduring hellish nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   It's not my place to question People magazine editors. I venture
to say they don't really know Armstrong, and they certainly don't
know me. I doubt there's a huge difference between him and me, except
that he probably doesn't look away every time he catches a glimpse of
himself in a full-length mirror.</TE>
<TE>   To demonstrate my magnanimity, I phone Armstrong for a short chat.
He says he never expected to make the list and finds his inclusion
both comical and enjoyable. "My life is no different now than before
this happened," he says. "I just happen to be one of those who was
chosen."</TE>
<TE>   Easy for him to say.</TE>

<LD>Robbin Crosby, 42, a rock guitarist who was a founding member of the
1980s heavy metal band Ratt, died June 6 in Los Angeles of
complications from AIDS.</LD>
<LD>   Crosby announced that he had the disease in an interview last
summer on Los Angeles radio station KNAC.com.</LD>
<LD>   A native of San Diego, Crosby graduated from La Jolla High School
and moved to Los Angeles in 1979.</LD>
<TE>   He later teamed up with singer Stephen Pearcy and lead guitarist
Warren De Martini to form Ratt.</TE>
<TE>   They released a self-titled mini-album on a local label, then were
signed by Atlantic Records.</TE>
<TE>   The band's breakthrough recording, "Out of the Cellar" in 1984,
and "Invasion of Your Privacy," released the next year, both went
multi-platinum with sales of more than 2 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   In the KNAC interview last year, Crosby said he suspected that he
became infected with HIV while using heroin with the band in the late
1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had been in and out of hospitals for more than eight
years.</TE>

of Slurs</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Kenneth E. Hardy, 45, a college professor contesting his dismissal
over use of racial epithets in a classroom discussion, died Saturday
in Louisville, Ky., of lung cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Hardy taught four years at Jefferson Community College, but was
not rehired for the summer of 1998 after a black female student
complained that one of his communication classes included a
discussion of racial slurs and sexist epithets.</LD>
<LD>   Hardy sued, charging that he had been wrongly terminated for
conducting a class discussion on the power of language, including the
effect of epithets.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals cleared the suit for
trial--a ruling the U.S. Supreme Court let stand two months ago by
refusing to hear the case.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate justices said that in their opinion "the 1st
Amendment tolerates neither laws nor other means of intimidation that
cast a pall of orthodoxy over the free exchange of ideas in the
classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Adrienne Regnier, Hardy's widow and a Jefferson College philosophy
professor, said she will proceed with her husband's case.</TE>

<HD>Reiner Says Cigarette Tax Could Fund Preschools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVELYN LARRUBIA and CARLA RIVERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four years after he led the successful campaign to hike cigarette
taxes to fund programs for California children, Rob Reiner on
Thursday proposed using a chunk of those funds to make preschool
available to all 3- and 4-year-olds in Los Angeles County.</LD>
<LD>   The actor and movie director also advocated using funds from
Proposition 10, the statewide smoking tax increase he advocated, to
provide health care insurance for undocumented and low-income
children not covered by other subsidized programs.</LD>
<LD>   Reiner's staff estimated that his ideas would cost between $95
million and $140 million a year from the money generated by the
50-cent-per-pack tax approved by voters in 1998. He says those costs
can be easily covered by the $165 million allocated yearly for Los
Angeles County under Proposition 10. Statewide, about $700 million is
generated annually.</LD>
<TE>   "When I envisioned Prop. 10, I had a simple goal--to create a
broad, bold program that touches the life of every young child in
California," Reiner, 54, told the Children and Families First
Proposition 10 Commission at its meeting Thursday in downtown Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That local group, which has the sole authority to spend the money
for Los Angeles County, approved Reiner's plan in principle and asked
its staff and its planning committee to develop details of how such
an ambitious concept could become reality.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner, who heads the state group overseeing the Proposition 10
program, has never before asked any of the autonomous county boards
to take on a particular mission, according to his staff. He advocated
that full-day preschool be made available to all Los Angeles County
youngsters whose families want it, regardless of income. Such
programs would stress early reading and math skills and mainly use
existing child-care centers in both the private and public sectors.</TE>
<TE>   He offered few other details but suggested that the program start
slowly in targeted areas, where the need is greatest. Reiner's idea
won support from many local child advocates who stress the shortage
of quality child care and early education. But not all child
development experts agree that universal preschool is the answer, and
some officials are worried that it might be too ambitious to sustain.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would put Los Angeles County and California at the
forefront of an idea that is gaining attention nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia and Oklahoma are the only states to fund broadly based
access to preschool, according to education experts. Georgia's
lottery-financed program is available to any family and has enrolled
more than 70% of the state's preschoolers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an idea with a great potential to be a model for other
counties throughout the state and nationwide," Amy Dominguez-Arms,
vice president for the California child advocacy group Children Now,
said in a telephone interview. Caprice Young, president of the Los
Angeles Unified School District board, spoke at Thursday's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line for us is, you just need to start and we'll start
with you," she said. Although the overcrowded district's current
schools don't have space for expanding programs, the district would
provide room in any elementary schools it builds and would also help
design programs.</TE>
<TE>   A statewide study released this month by UC Berkeley found at
least 100,000 preschool-aged children in Los Angeles County on
waiting lists for subsidized child care.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, there was room for only 15 out of 100 children in Los
Angeles County in any day care and preschool programs. That
represented an increase of only one slot over four years.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials said they are concerned about taking on such an
expensive program.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not government, per se. I hope that we do not become the
provider of health care or preschool," said Zev Yaroslavsky, who as
chairman of the county Board of Supervisors also serves as the
Proposition 10 commission chairman.</TE>
<TE>   The commission already was working on the concept of health
coverage for those children from low-income families who don't
already qualify for other programs. Reiner's staff said his health
plan would cost between $11 million and $25 million at its peak.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner said his ideas were meant to give voters something concrete
from Proposition 10. It is intended as "a bold program that the
public can understand."</TE>
<TE>   Many experts say participation in preschool programs with trained
staff can contribute to early learning and social development.</TE>
<TE>   However, not everyone agrees it is that crucial. Although he had
not seen the Los Angeles proposal, David Salisbury, director of the
Center for Education Freedom at the Cato Institute, said such
programs provide few long-term benefits to children.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem with the education system is not occurring in the
early grades where children enter school ready to learn," said
Salisbury. "It is not until middle school or high school that
performance declines. It's the later grades where schools are not
being effective, and I argue that officials ought to be fixing the
problems where they occur."</TE>
<TE>   Salisbury argued that the child-care industry would benefit from
expanding preschool access in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Teenager Testifies Sex With Coach, 33, Was Consensual</HD>

<LD>A 16-year-old girl testified Thursday that she willingly had sex last
year with her basketball coach, and kept the relationship from her
parents and school officials to prevent him from going to jail.</LD>
<LD>   The Glendale girl told jurors on the second day of the statutory
rape trial in Los Angeles Superior Court that her friendship with
Paul Calvin Clark III first became sexual in January 2001. After
basketball practice, she said, they had intercourse on his desk at
Ribet Academy, the Los Angeles private school where she was a
15-year-old freshman and he was her 33-year-old coach.</LD>
<LD>   Various types of sexual activity continued for more than a month,
the girl testified, until the school's volleyball and softball
coaches reported suspicions to administrators.</LD>
<TE>   After the panicked couple cooled things off for a while, the sex
resumed briefly after school let out in June 2001, the girl said.</TE>
<TE>   Clark has pleaded not guilty.</TE>
<TE>   His attorney has argued that the two female coaches were
vindictive toward Clark because he took the job of athletic director
away from one of them. The women frightened and coerced the girl into
falsely reporting that she and Clark had sex, lawyer Robert M.
Bernstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Softball coach, Stephenie Little testified on videotape Thursday
(because she was unavailable to appear in person), that she and
fellow coach Kate Stoll had secretly videotaped the girl to record
her admission of a sexual relationship with Clark.</TE>
<TE>   But Little denied that they manipulated the student to punish
their colleague.</TE>
<TE>   The girl told jurors that the coaches did not coerce her. She had
denied the relationship because, "I really loved [Clark], and he said
he loved me, and I didn't want him to get in trouble," she testified.</TE>

<LD>Five Hells Angels who say they were kicked out of last year's Shasta
District Fair for wearing their group's logo have filed a federal
suit against the fair board.</LD>
<LD>   The suit alleges that law enforcement officials stopped members,
such as Michael Guyette of Redding, and told them they would be
arrested if they didn't leave.</LD>
<LD>   Fair Chief Executive Officer Trish Sciarani said the fair's policy
is not a dress code, but that fairgoers are expected to behave
politely and legally, she said. She would not say whether the members
violated that rule.</LD>

Westerfield's recreational vehicle out of the sand the day that
Danielle van Dam disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors allege that Westerfield kidnapped the 7-year-old from
her bed on the night of Feb. 1 and then went on a circuitous trip the
next morning to the Imperial Valley desert before dumping her body in
a rural area.</LD>
<LD>   They have not said whether they believe he killed the girl before
the trip or during it.</LD>

something, he said no.</TE>

<CX>   Westerfield trial--The headline on an article in Friday's California
section about the trial of David Westerfield in Danielle van Dam's
killing went beyond what was said during testimony. The headline,
"Voice From Suspect's RV May Have Been Girl's," should have stated
simply that testimony suggested that another voice might have been

<LD>Police say they have caught a man they nicknamed the "Spider-Man"
burglar because of his habit of slipping through skylights and
ventilation shafts. He is a suspect in 55 break-ins.</LD>
<LD>   Officers found Kristian Kwon Marine, 25, hiding in the crawl space
of a market Wednesday. A police spokesman said the part-time fitness
club worker stole to support a severe gambling habit.</LD>
<LD>   One building that Marine is accused of robbing required him to
leap a 10-foot span to get in. Police said he used power cords and
garden hoses to slide down to the floors of the buildings.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they believe Marine has broken into 55 buildings in
the past two months. He faces 63 charges, including burglary and
attempted burglary, as well as two counts of receiving stolen
property.</TE>

<LD>The decision to name a new elementary school after President Bush has
some school board members admitting partisan politics played a role.</LD>
<LD>   The move was approved 4 to 3 Wednesday, with all four votes for
the proposal coming from Republicans. Some residents and board
members protested, saying the president has not yet established a
legacy worth commemorating.</LD>
<LD>   In most California districts, school boards are nonpartisan.
Stockton Unified board members do not declare party affiliation when

<HD>Tijuana Plans 80-Foot Tower to Honor 9/11 Victims</HD>
<DH>Artwork: Construction on the project begins Monday and is
scheduled to be completed by the first anniversary of the terrorist
attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Civic boosters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana plan to start
construction next week on a soaring stainless steel sculpture to
commemorate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Backers of the project see it as a way to memorialize the more
than 3,000 people who were killed in the attacks while improving the
image of the gritty border city best known as a base for drug
traffickers and as a party zone for Americans too young to drink in
U.S. bars.</LD>
<LD>   The Sept. 11 memorial will feature a steel tower nearly 80 feet
tall atop a five-sided fountain, meant to signify the Pentagon, and
will be surrounded by the sculptures of 25 children.</LD>
<TE>   It will be built outside a hospital in eastern Tijuana near the
U.S.-Mexico border.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a way of expressing Mexico's solidarity with the United
States and the rest of the world for the attacks," said Jack Winer, a
Mexican sculptor and architect who is working on the project.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Committee for the New Image of Tijuana plan to
present a model of the project at a news conference today in San
Diego at the National Assn. of Hispanic Journalists' annual
convention.</TE>
<TE>   The committee, which has raised most of the $250,000 cost of the
Sept. 11 memorial, is working on a series of public art and marketing
projects aimed at improving the city's image.</TE>
<TE>   Winer designed the steel column that is the memorial's
centerpiece.</TE>
<TE>   The column has two openings, each about 5 feet wide, that will
allow light to shine through.</TE>
<TE>   Two large teardrops run down one side of the tower.</TE>
<TE>   "The verticality of the tower is meant to suggest that America is
still standing, despite what happened," Winer said.</TE>
<TE>   Winer, who lives in Mexico City and San Diego, is one of six
sculptors working on the project, named "Tower of Hope."</TE>
<TE>   The five other artists are creating the sculptures of children
that will surround the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   At least two of the others involved in the Tijuana memorial,
Jeffrey Laudenslager and Ante Marinovic, are established sculptors
who have completed other public projects in Southern California, said
Robert L. Pincus, an art critic for the San Diego Union-Tribune.</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit of the art is admirable," Pincus said after looking at
a schematic drawing of the memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the kind of abstract sculpture that is clearly intended to
appeal to a broad spectrum of people."</TE>
<TE>   Construction of the project, which will be located at the
Children's Hospital of the Americas, is to begin Monday and is
scheduled to be completed by Sept. 11, the first anniversary of the
terrorist attack.</TE>

<HD>Actor's Suit Can Be Tried, Court Rules</HD>
<DH>Law: Former member of 'Baywatch' cast sued Playgirl over a
cover he said humiliated him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former "Baywatch" actor is entitled to his day in court on claims
that he was humiliated and his career compromised when Playgirl
magazine placed his bare-chested photo on its cover, a federal
appeals court ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The January 1999 cover featured Jose Solano Jr. under the headline
"Prime Time's Sexy Young Stars Exposed," which could give the false
impression that Solano appeared nude inside the issue and that he
agreed to be so featured, the court ruled.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals
allows the actor to go to trial and reverses a February 2001 federal
district court ruling that Solano failed to show that Playgirl
knowingly created a false impression about what readers would see in
the magazine.</LD>
<TE>   Solano sued publisher Playgirl Inc., alleging that he was
portrayed in a false light and that the magazine misappropriated his
likeness, said his attorney, Jonathan Anschell.</TE>
<TE>   Although there were no nude pictures of Solano in the magazine,
the 31-year-old actor contended that by putting his photo on the
cover amid sexually explicit headlines, the impression was created
that he posed for the publication, Anschell said.</TE>
<TE>   "Jose tries to hold himself up as a role model for youth," the
lawyer said, adding that Solano comes from a traditional Catholic
family and was a Navy medic during Operation Desert Storm.</TE>
<TE>   "So when he saw himself on the cover of Playgirl, it was a slap in
the face of everything he tries to embody," Anschell said.</TE>
<TE>   The picture showing Solano shirtless, arms folded across his
chest, smiling and wearing red swimming trunks, was obtained through
a photo bank, the attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Because the magazine is sold in sealed plastic, readers couldn't
open it to see if Solano was naked, the court's opinion stated.
Inside the magazine, on Page 21, there was a brief biography of the
actor, who played Manny Gutierrez on the original "Baywatch" from
1996-99--the show's first Latino character. With the bio, there was a
photo showing him dressed.</TE>
<TE>   Playgirl executives in New York refused to comment on the decision
or a deposition cited in the opinion stating that editors instructed
staff to "sex up" the cover by implying that the issue contained more
nudity than it in fact did.</TE>
<TE>   The company's attorney, Kent Raygor, said Thursday that he had yet
to read the appellate court opinion, but added that the 1st Amendment
protects the right of the media to comment on public figures.</TE>
<TE>   "Public figures like Solano don't get to pick and choose the kind
of publications they're seen in," he said. "Part of being a public
figure means that your life is subject to public commentary."</TE>
<TE>   Lincoln D. Bandlow, a visiting media law professor at USC's
Annenberg School of Journalism, said the decision reiterates that the
1st Amendment does not protect knowingly false speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Here what the court did was say that the plaintiff's case should
not have been defeated on summary judgment, because it was a jury
issue whether or not Playgirl's speech was knowingly false," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that he simply said, 'You associated me with an icky
nude magazine,' " according to Bandlow. "They put text on the cover
and threw in interesting word choices that may have implied he's nude
in there."</TE>
<TE>   The court's decision relied heavily on a case involving actor
Clint Eastwood, who alleged that the National Enquirer used quotes
making it look as if he had granted the publication an interview,
which he had not. The decision also cited a defamation action brought
by O.J. Simpson trial witness Kato Kaelin against the Globe tabloid.</TE>

<HD>Irish Wheels of Misfortune Provide a Lift for Restorer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onlookers were green with envy as the Shamrock traveled down Emerald
Street.</LD>
<LD>   "What is that? I'd love to drive it!" exclaimed Hazel Brenner as
the car called the "Irish T-Bird" passed by.</LD>
<LD>   The Shamrock was built in Ireland between 1959 and 1962. But Irish
eyes didn't smile on it: Only one is apparently still on the road in
the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Harbor City resident Dick Midkiff plans to change that.</TE>
<TE>   Midkiff, 58, has been driving his Shamrock since 1969, when he
bought it for $100 and restored it to mint-green condition. Earlier
this year, he found the remains of a second Shamrock partly buried in
sand near the desert town of Landers. He purchased it for $200 and
plans to rebuild it too.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I just like the idea of having a car that no one else
has," said Midkiff, a mortuary company dispatcher. "In 33 years, I've
never seen another one of these coming down the road at me."</TE>
<TE>   That's because only about 50 of the four-seat, fiberglass
convertibles were ever built in Tralee, County Kerry. And only four
of them were shipped to the United States, Midkiff said.</TE>
<TE>   One car was wrecked in a crash in New York. Another ended up for a
time at the National Automobile Museum (the Harrah Collection) in
Reno before it was acquired by an unidentified private collector.
"And I have the other two," Midkiff said.</TE>
<TE>   Shamrock Motors Ltd. was run by William K. Curtis, a Los Angeles
businessman who had made his fortune manufacturing coffee-making
equipment. He planned a 40,000-square-foot factory whose 2,400
workers would produce 10,000 autos a year.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis envisioned shipping 3,000 annually to the United States,
with "the bulk of them going to Southern California," reported a 1959
edition of Motor Trend magazine that showcased the $2,495 Shamrock.
The article compared it to the Ford Thunderbird.</TE>
<TE>   The Shamrock's designers borrowed heavily from other companies in
the British Isles, Midkiff discovered when he set out to rebuild his
1959 model.</TE>
<TE>   It featured a molded, single-piece body provided by a
boat-building company. Its engine was a four-cylinder, 53-horsepower
Austin A-55, which gave it remarkable fuel economy of more than 40
miles per gallon. Brakes in the rear came from the Triumph sports
car; those in the front were from the MG. Its windshield was from the
Vauxhall. It had a heater but no radio.</TE>
<TE>   From the side, the car resembled an elongated Thunderbird. But
from the rear, its bulky, boat-builder heritage was evident. Because
of its looks--and its then-hefty sticker price--the Shamrock never
took off. Production sputtered to an end in 1962 after three years.</TE>
<TE>   Midkiff bought his Shamrock on a whim.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been driving past the driveway where it was parked every day
on my way to work, and I thought it was the ugliest thing I'd ever
seen. I finally stopped and asked the guy what it was. It had 13,000
miles on it, and running gear-wise it was OK. But the interior was
rotted and the chrome was all bad."</TE>
<TE>   Like all the original Shamrocks, the car was white. But Midkiff's
wife, Sonnie, insisted he repaint it candy-flaked green. "I'm Irish.
I have relatives in County Cork," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   Once the restoration was complete, she encouraged her husband to
show off his Shamrock at St. Patrick's Day parades and other events
with Irish themes.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the pair will drive the Shamrock in a procession
marking the 27th Los Angeles Irish Fair and Music Festival, a two-day
event at Woodley Park in Encino.</TE>
<TE>   "Once at a parade in Hermosa Beach, the fuel pump died and the car
quit. Two big Irish guys came out of the crowd to help us. We thought
they'd just push us out of the way, over to the side of the street.
But they insisted on pushing us all the way to the end of the
parade," Sonnie Midkiff said.</TE>
<TE>   Motorists routinely slow down to get a good look at the car Dick
Midkiff calls the "Green Latrine" and "The Irish Edsel" when he
drives around in it.</TE>
<TE>   "People have driven over curbs staring at us. One woman ran into
the back of the car in front of her and totaled her car while
watching us. She wasn't hurt, but she was embarrassed," said Midkiff,
who delights in telling the car's colorful history.</TE>
<TE>   So there were plenty of curious glances as the pair maneuvered it
down busy Emerald Street in Torrance this week. "What's a Shamrock?"
shouted a school boy from the sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Lucky you should ask.</TE>

<HD>Legislation Targets Steroid Use</HD>
<DH>Sports: Most pro athletes would be tested at least once a
year under the state bill.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Dismayed by new disclosures of the use of steroids in Major League
Baseball, a state senator wants to force most professional sports
teams to test athletes for performance enhancing drugs if they play
games in California.</LD>
<LD>   State Sen. Don Perata (D-Alameda) said the Legislature must do
what baseball and the National Hockey League have not: Mandate random
drug testing to ensure players do not compete while juiced.</LD>
<LD>   Unveiling his legislation Thursday, Perata called steroid use "out
of control" and said it is "not only unfair in terms of competition
on the field, but also sends a terrible message to our kids."</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very serious about this bill," said Perata, a sports fan who
listens to baseball games on the radio while gardening. "We test
[race]</TE>
<TE>   horses, for crying out loud. Why aren't we testing these players?"</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the use of steroids in athletics flared anew recently
when retired baseball slugger Jose Canseco estimated that 85% of
major-league players use the muscle-building drugs. Soon after, Ken
Caminiti, a former National League MVP who is also retired, told
Sports Illustrated that he was injecting steroids at the peak of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   Although the National Football League and National Basketball
Assn. prohibit steroids and test for them, neither baseball nor the
NHL has a screening policy.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Major League Baseball said the league is "very
concerned" about steroid use and has presented a drug-testing
proposal to the players union as part of ongoing collective
bargaining negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman Richard Levin said the league believes steroid use not
only threatens the health of players but also creates problems in
terms of the purity of competition on the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our fans to be sure we run a game that has integrity,"
Levin said.</TE>
<TE>   The Major League Baseball Players Assn., the most powerful union
in professional sports, has historically opposed random testing,
mostly on privacy grounds. Greg Bouris, a union spokesman in New
York, declined to comment on the proposed legislation Thursday,
saying only that the players see steroid testing as "a very serious
and complicated issue."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Brown, a spokesman for the National Hockey League, said, "We
don't see steroids as an issue" and declined to comment further.</TE>
<TE>   Anabolic steroids elevate the body's testosterone level,
increasing muscle mass. They are illegal in the United States unless
prescribed by a physician for medical reasons, but readily available
over the counter in many parts of Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have linked steroids to heart, kidney and liver damage,
stroke, aggressive behavior, sterility and genital dysfunction.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, their use in baseball was considered the realm of
only a smattering of sluggers. They were a more common worry in the
NFL, especially after the death of Lyle Alzado from brain cancer he
blamed on the drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Perata's bill would require any professional athletic association
with revenue exceeding $1 billion annually to establish a random drug
testing program that screens each athlete at least once a year. The
programs--testing for steroids, human or animal growth hormones and
similar substances that boost performance--would be reviewed by the
California Athletic Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Players who flunk would be subject to suspension, and leagues that
refuse to adopt a testing program would be banned from holding events
in California.</TE>
<TE>   Perata said it is the Legislature's duty to attack the steroid
problem, especially given studies by the National Institute on Drug
Abuse that show a huge jump in use of the drugs by teenage athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Maurice Williams, a 16-year-old football player at Oakland High
School, appeared with Perata and said pressure on young athletes to
"have that extra edge" and stand out is intense.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will do whatever it takes to get to the next level,"
said Williams, who dreams of playing pro football but won't use
steroids to get there. "They figure it's a lot easier to pop a pill
in your mouth than to spend a lifetime lifting weights."</TE>
<TE>   Perata already has the support of several powerful lawmakers,
including Sen. Sheila Kuehl (D-Santa Monica). Kuehl said the health
risks of steroids concern her, and added: "It seems to me that the
faith of the common sports fan is undermined when their athletes are
using substances that allow them to cheat, in a way."</TE>
<TE>   But Republican Sen. Ray Haynes of Riverside said the Legislature
has other priorities and should leave the problem to the leagues.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like drugs in sports, but if people think baseball isn't
committed to solving this problem, then they'll stop going to games,"
Haynes said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is crazy. We don't need a law on this."</TE>
<TE>   Despite such sentiments, Los Angeles Dodgers Vice President
Derrick Hall said the ballclub would probably support the Perata
bill, though he predicted the problem would more likely be resolved
through collective bargaining.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this bill just echoes the concerns that we as an industry
have about steroids," Hall said. "The sooner we have an agreement on
ways to prevent use of the drugs, the better."</TE>
<TE>   The legislative interest in Sacramento comes a day after U.S. Sen.
Byron Dorgan (D-North Dakota) announced plans to hold investigative
hearings on the use of the drug in professional sports, the Olympics
and among college athletes.</TE>

<KH>ON THE LAW</KH>
<HD>Measure Could Affect Access to Law Libraries</HD>
<DH>The facilities, run by counties statewide, are a free
resource for legal research. New bill could force cutbacks in
service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Instead of hiring an attorney, Gaile Rayfield wants to take her
ex-husband to court on her own and win higher child-support payments
for their 16-year-old daughter.</LD>
<LD>   On a Friday afternoon, Rayfield, a single mother and full-time
nursing student, walked into the Compton branch of the Los Angeles
County Law Library and researched how to tackle the legal process.</LD>
<LD>   Rayfield began by telling law librarian Helen Willis that she
needed help filing for the modification in child-support payments.
Willis pulled a blue paperback book off a shelf. She put the book,
California Judicial Council Forms, in front of Rayfield and opened it
to a page titled "Simplified Ways to Change Child, Spousal or Family
Support."</LD>
<TE>   "I can't afford an attorney. That's why I'm doing this," Rayfield
said as she took notes in a black binder, listing the forms and
procedures she needed. "This is the only place that's within my
resources."</TE>
<TE>   These days, county law libraries are seeing fewer attorneys,
because many firms have extensive collections of their own. Most
library patrons are members of the public, many of whom are planning
to act as their own attorneys in legal matters, said Richard Iamele,
director of the Los Angeles County Law Library. "I've seen people who
have taken a case all the way to appeal by themselves," he said. "It
can be done."</TE>
<TE>   But a bill expected to go before the Senate Judiciary Committee
next week has county law librarians worried that they may have to cut
back on purchases and hours, or even close branch libraries.</TE>
<TE>   When the bill was introduced in February by Assemblyman Mark
Wyland (R-Escondido), it proposed that libraries housed in
county-owned facilities pay rent for the space and cover operating
costs including utilities, phones and janitorial services. County law
libraries are funded largely through civil court filing fees.</TE>
<TE>   Law librarians feared that the smaller county branches wouldn't be
able to pick up the cost for their space in courthouses.</TE>
<TE>   The main downtown Los Angeles library wouldn't be affected because
the library's board of trustees owns the six-story building, which
was constructed in 1953 with library funds. But some of its
branches--at courthouses in Beverly Hills, Compton, Long Beach,
Norwalk, Pasadena, Pomona, Santa Monica, Torrance and Van Nuys--would
have been threatened.</TE>
<TE>   After lobbying efforts by the Council of California County Law
Librarians, the bill was amended to allow libraries to continue using
space in county buildings without charge. However, the current bill
seeks to give county boards of supervisors more oversight by
providing the power to review each library's expenditures and
reimbursement requests.</TE>
<TE>   Law librarians worry that this may create "an adversarial
relationship between individual county boards of supervisors and
county law library boards of trustees," said Annette Heath, the
council's president and director of the Kern County Law Library.</TE>
<TE>   The civil court filing fees that support law libraries vary from
county to county. In Los Angeles the fee is $14, the lowest in the
state. Iamele, of the Los Angeles County Law Library, said he would
like to see the fee increased, noting that the cost of books has
skyrocketed in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   To increase fees, library directors must win approval from their
board of supervisors, often asking for increments of $2 to $3 at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   Duane Dichiara, Wyland's chief of staff, said asking libraries to
justify their spending is meant only to be prudent budgetary
management. In the past, libraries submitted funding requests and
counties paid them from the filing fee fund without question,
Dichiara said.</TE>
<TE>   An 1891 state law requires every county to have a public law
library. California's 58 such facilities aim to provide equal access
to the law for all people, Iamele said.</TE>
<TE>   The libraries vary in size and resources. Some have their own
buildings, such as the sprawling main Los Angeles branch; others have
just a small room in a courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Some are reference libraries, but in Los Angeles, patrons are
allowed to borrow books.</TE>
<TE>   Last fiscal year, filing fees garnered the Los Angeles library
about $6.28 million, Iamele said, but the library spent about $6.3
million. Much of the difference came from parking and copying machine
fees.</TE>
<TE>   The Butte County Law Library, one of the state's smallest,
operates on a $170,000 budget, with about $160,000 coming from a $26
filing fee, said library director John Zorbas.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a poor community," he said. "What else do people have?
They have the county law library."</TE>
<TE>   Zorbas opposes Wyland's bill, saying it implies that libraries are
not adequately managing their resources. He fears that the bill will
allow the county to threaten to move the library from the courthouse,
where it is housed in a 2,500-square-foot office.</TE>
<TE>   County law libraries are designed to be "practitioner" facilities,
while law school libraries contain more theory-based materials such
as the sociology of the law, Iamele said. The L.A. facility--the
largest public law library in the nation--has extensive collections
of books on such topics as real estate, tax and immigration law.</TE>
<TE>   The Compton library is in a musty second-floor room of the
courthouse. Rayfield says the tall shelves of leather-bound law
journals amid a few worn chairs and tables give her some comfort,
making her feel closer to the laws that sometimes bewilder her.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow Compton resident Kashif Rasheed recently spent an afternoon
researching how to set up a self-directed IRA account. Rasheed uses
the Compton library regularly. A few years ago his library research
helped him to successfully sue a car dealer. "All the forms, case
law, statutes, everything--it's all here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Iamele stressed that librarians are not there to dispense legal
advice or opinions, but rather to explain how sources are organized
and how to use them.</TE>
<TE>   Rayfield, who wants her daughter's child support increased
from $400 a month to $800, said that several visits to the library have
left her mind reeling but that she would be even more lost without
the library. "I feel intimidated by the whole process--the paperwork
just baffles me," she said. "But it's my only option."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>A probate judge on Thursday ordered Richard Nixon's daughters into
face-to-face mediation, hoping to end a two-year fight over how to
spend a $20-million bequest for his presidential library.</LD>
<LD>   Miami-Dade County Judge Maria Korvick gave Tricia Cox and Julie
Eisenhower 60 days to meet with Nixon's longtime friend Robert
Abplanalp, library representatives and estate trustees.</LD>
<LD>   "No one is excused from appearing in person," Korvick said.</LD>
<TE>   In January, the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace in Yorba Linda sued a
trust created in the will of Nixon's longtime friend, banker Charles
"Bebe" Rebozo.</TE>
<TE>   Rebozo left 65% of his estate to the library on the condition that
the Nixon sisters and Abplanalp approve the spending.</TE>

<HD>Toxins, River on a Crash Course</HD>
<DH>Uranium: Slag heap near Colorado portends risk of
contaminating water source, scientists report.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A blue-ribbon science committee warned Thursday that it is a "near
certainty" that the Colorado River will someday run directly through
a massive heap of uranium slag, raising the specter of massive
radioactive contamination of the water source for 25 million people
in California and the Southwest.</LD>
<LD>   Although the slag heap is now about 750 feet from the river's edge
near Moab, Utah, rivers often "migrate," and it is a "near certainty
the river's course will run across the Moab site at some time in the
future," according to a report by the National Research Council for
the Department of Energy.</LD>
<LD>   The scientific panel said it's highly uncertain whether the
migration of the river will take years or millenniums.</LD>
<TE>   The department has responsibility for cleaning up the 12 million
tons of uranium mill tailings and contaminated soil left from a
uranium mill that shut down in 1984. The mill provided material for
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Although the committee did not pick between the two leading
alternatives--cover the heap or move the entire mess farther from the
river--it called for more study and warned of the grave dangers of
doing nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), one of several Western congressmen
who have petitioned for the Bush administration to move the heap,
said he was disappointed by the report from the National Research
Council, chief operating arm of the National Academies.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to move the site right now," said Filner. "With all due
respect to the National Academies, we know it is going to contaminate
our drinking water someday. The time for studies is long past."</TE>
<TE>   In the final months of the Clinton administration, Department of
Energy officials unveiled a plan to move the heap away from the
river, an effort estimated to cost between $300 million and $1
billion. But the Bush administration put those plans on hold, pending
further study.</TE>
<TE>   The Moab site is the "newest, the largest and potentially the most
expensive" of the uranium sites to be cleaned up by the government,
according to the committee's report.</TE>
<TE>   The committee said it is unclear whether the Colorado River will
move closer to the slag heap "over the coming millennia or in the
next several decades." If a decision is made not to move the heap,
the committee concludes, the government should consider building
barriers to keep the river from changing its course.</TE>
<TE>   Adan Ortega, an executive with the Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California, was more upbeat than Filner about the National
Academies report. The MWD has lobbied Congress to have the heap moved
away from the river, which provides more than half of the water that
MWD supplies to 17 million people in six counties.</TE>
<TE>   The report was required by legislation providing additional
funding for cleaning up the site.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a milestone," Ortega said of the report. "Now that the
study has been done, there is no excuse for not moving that mountain
of uranium tailings."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking a cue from Hollywood, this rural town of about 14,000 wants to
create a downtown Walk of Fame and seeks a volunteer to help with the
planning.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to recognize people who have made important
contributions to Fillmore and to develop another attraction for the
city's railroad property and Central Park.</LD>
<LD>   The volunteer would join a City Council member and a
representative from the city staff in selecting designs for the Walk
of Fame plaques and would help publicize the program. The appointment
is for four years.</LD>
<TE>   A Citizens Advisory Group application is available in the lobby at
Fillmore City Hall, 250 Central Ave., or on the city's Web site:
www.fillmoreca.com/cityhall/cac-apps.pdf. The deadline to apply is 5
p.m. June 26.</TE>
<TE>   For further information, contact Steve McClary at 524-1500, Ext.

<LD>Mayor Ray Di Guilio said this week he wants the city to give more
money to the arts.</LD>
<LD>   At the City Council's second budget study session Monday night,
the mayor suggested the council add $100,000 from its own contingency
fund to provide grants for the arts community.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura's proposed 2002-2003 budget also includes $580,000 of
unallocated funds the council can use to carry out 15 priority
projects, including establishing a cultural arts center, stimulating
downtown housing and enhancing tourism. The council could have
another $420,000, increasing its discretionary pot to $1 million, if
it hikes various city fees.</LD>
<TE>   A public hearing on the budget will be held during the council's
next meeting on Monday at 7 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Yang Taps Veteran Prosecutor as Deputy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In her first major move since taking office a month ago, U.S. Atty.
Debra W. Yang has tapped an experienced former federal prosecutor to
become her second-in-command.</LD>
<LD>   George Cardona, who currently serves as chief of the Los Angeles
city attorney's criminal division, will assume his new duties July 1.</LD>
<LD>   As chief assistant U.S. attorney, the 41-year-old Cardona will
help set policies and oversee the work of the office's 240 lawyers.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. attorney's office, headquartered in Los Angeles with
branches in Santa Ana and Riverside, prosecutes federal crimes in a
seven-county area of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Cardona, who joined the city attorney's office in January, said
Thursday that he decided to leave "because Deb Yang offered me the
job."</TE>
<TE>   Yang said she chose Cardona because "he was very well-regarded
when he was here. He has considerable supervisory experience and a
very keen intellect. I think his talents and his long-term vision are
essential elements to running the U.S. attorney's office."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Holliday, a veteran white-collar criminal defense lawyer and
former president of the Federal Bar Assn., also praised Cardona,
describing him as "very bright, very fair and very experienced."</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of Yale Law School, Cardona clerked for a federal
appeals court judge in Philadelphia after graduation, then migrated
to the West Coast to take a job with the law firm Irell &amp; Manella in
Century City.</TE>
<TE>   He then joined the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
as a prosecutor in Bellflower and later Norwalk.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, he was hired by the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles. After rising to deputy chief of the major frauds section, he
left to become chief appellate attorney in the San Francisco federal
prosecutor's office. He returned to Los Angeles after several months
to head the U.S. attorney's criminal division, the No. 3 job.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Cardona resigned to become a professor at UCLA Law
School, where he taught criminal trial advocacy. He was lured away
from academia late last year by newly elected Los Angeles City Atty.
Rocky Delgadillo.</TE>

<HD>2 Students Suspended Over Fliers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palmdale High School junior Garrett Anderson says he started
distributing underground fliers on campus after learning about the
radical press of the 1960s in history class.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Anderson and his stepbrother Michael Kinnon, both 16, are
serving their second three-day suspension in two weeks for handing
out hundreds of the one-page publications. The fliers complained
about dirty bathrooms and the school yearbook's focus on popular
students. They also used profanity, compared a campus security guard
to a Nazi and referred to the principal as "a tad queer."</LD>
<LD>   The Virginia-based Student Press Law Center has labeled the
suspensions unconstitutional, and the boys' lawyer said he plans to
sue the Antelope Valley Union High School District to have the
suspensions expunged from his clients' records. Anderson's father and
Kinnon's stepfather is Dennis Anderson, the editor of the Antelope
Valley Press.</LD>
<TE>   The law center and the boys' attorney, James Charlton, said the
students are protected under California's "Leonard Law," which
prohibits schools from punishing students for expressions that would
be protected off campus by the 1st Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale High Principal Michael Vierra declined to discuss the
suspensions, but said it is the school's policy to take action
against students who distribute publications that are libelous or
cause "a substantial disruption" on campus. District officials did
not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton said the first two fliers--which included the Nazi and
"queer" references--were "a little over the line." A third student
was suspended over those publications, Charlton said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the second round of suspensions were for fliers with
milder content.</TE>
<TE>   Charlton contended the boys were punished because they would not
let administrators review the fliers before distribution.</TE>
<TE>   From his home Thursday, Kinnon said he understands why
administrators were upset with the first two fliers, but that the
school should encourage underground publications that don't flirt
with libel.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's let students know their rights and where their boundaries
are," he said. "Constructive criticism of school officials is good."</TE>

<DH>Mail: City's main 93030 area will be split beginning next
month, but those affected can continue using their old designation
for a year.</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Terry Lopez received a letter notifying her that her ZIP Code
was changing, she figured it was just part of living in a growing
county and that she had better go with the flow.</LD>
<LD>   But when she learned her employer also was affected, she began to
panic.</LD>
<LD>   As the principal's secretary at Oxnard High School, Lopez had just
submitted the yearly request for letterhead stationery and
envelopes--7,000 of them--with the old ZIP Code.</LD>
<TE>   Luckily, Lopez figures she has enough time to catch the order
before it goes to print.</TE>
<TE>   The change, due to take effect July 1, splits Oxnard's main ZIP
Code of 93030.</TE>
<TE>   The change is necessary because 93030 now has 26,000 addresses,
and the U.S. Postal Service likes to cap the number at 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   About 11,000 of the current addresses--residents and businesses
along Gonzales Road and north of Gonzales Road--will be switched to
the new ZIP Code of 93036.</TE>
<TE>   While the change takes effect next month, businesses and residents
have one year to keep using 93030.</TE>
<TE>   "Theoretically, it could be a problem after that, but probably
not, since the mail will continue to be sorted out of the Saviers
[post] office," postal spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said.</TE>
<TE>   Notification letters were mailed to those affected by the change
on May 30. Bouffiou said only one complaint has been received, and
that was from someone who thought there was only a month to continue
using the current ZIP Code. Once the caller was told it was a year,
Bouffiou said, it was fine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's an indication of how accepted the change is,"
Bouffiou said.</TE>
<TE>   As office manager for Vista Ford on Auto Center Drive, Laura Ortiz
said she plans to wait out the one-year deadline before ordering new
office supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a pretty big inconvenience," Ortiz said. "It affects
me personally too, because now I have to change my bank account and
my credit cards. But I do understand that the city is growing, so
this is something you have to expect."</TE>
<TE>   Bouffiou said the change has been in the works for the past year.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Oxnard had a split was in the mid-1980s, when 93033
and 93035 were created. With this latest addition, Oxnard has seven
ZIP Codes, including three--93031, 93032 and 93034--for rental boxes
at the city's three post offices.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the new ZIP Code, the last one to be created in Ventura
County was in 1999, when Oak Park residents got their own ZIP Code.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, in 1993, Camarillo's 93010 split into 93012.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't predict how the county will be 10 years from now, but
when we are creating a new ZIP Code we try to figure the county's
growth rate into our calculations," Bouffiou said. "We think this
will be the last change for Ventura County for quite a while."</TE>

<HD>It's a Painful Victory for Indians, Gutierrez</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>Even when Ricky Gutierrez does something right for the Cleveland
Indians these days, something goes wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Gutierrez strained his left groin while scoring on rookie Chris
Magruder's triple in the 10th inning, giving the Indians a 2-1
victory over the Baltimore Orioles in Thursday's only scheduled major
league game.</LD>
<LD>   Gutierrez, a major disappointment so far in his first season with
Cleveland, drew a one-out walk in the 10th off Willis Roberts (3-2).
Magruder followed with a liner toward the right-field corner that
bounced off the rubberized warning track.</LD>
<TE>   As the ball eluded right fielder Gary Matthews Jr., Gutierrez was
waved home and scored easily, but grabbed his upper leg after
crossing home plate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a rough year for me," said Gutierrez, who signed a
three-year, $11 million this winter to replace Roberto Alomar at
second base. " ... Hopefully, I can get things turned around."</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's Chuck Finley moved past Hall of Famer Christy
Mathewson into 23rd place on the career strikeout list, fanning eight
in 6 2/3 innings to raise his total to 2,505 in 16 seasons.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL-DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Spring Series to Resume</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin; Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers and Angels are planning to resume their exhibition series
as soon as next season, restoring the original Freeway Series that
traditionally marked the final weekend of spring training.</LD>
<LD>   An exhibition series that started in 1962 came to an abrupt halt
in 1999, when the Dodgers unilaterally reduced the three-game series
against the Angels to one game so they could play host to the New
York Yankees. The Angels scrambled to fill the final weekend of
spring training with games against a college team and a Mexican
League team.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers and Angels have not met in spring training since, and
the Yankees have not returned to attract fans. Both teams drew
sparsely during the final weekend of spring training this season,
with the Cleveland Indians playing at Dodger Stadium and the Colorado
Rockies at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   "We think we can generate as much or more interest in a
Dodger-Angel exhibition game as we can with any other game," Dodger
President Bob Graziano said.</TE>
<TE>   The teams hope to resume the series next season but have deferred
any announcement until major league officials complete the 2003
schedule. If the Dodgers are scheduled to open the season on the East
Coast, they would prefer not to fly from their spring home in Florida
to California for the Freeway Series, then back to the East.</TE>
<TE>   The teams also were concerned that interleague play might diminish
the interest in an exhibition series, but the San Francisco Giants
and Oakland A's have done well playing each other in March and again
in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether we play six games in the regular season or nine games,
including the Freeway Series, I think we'll do well in all of them,"
said Kevin Uhlich, the Angels' senior vice president of business
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii (10-1) ranks third in the National
League in wins and ninth in strikeouts (73) before tonight's game
against the Angels, and the consensus in the Dodger clubhouse is that
he has considerable room for improvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I still see him as confused and not totally at ease with American
baseball," Dodger pitching coach Jim Colborn said. "But even as I say
that, he's 50 times better than he was in spring training. I just
don't think we've seen his top hand yet."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii was a wreck in spring training, unable to throw strikes and
unable to find a consistent delivery. Control problems have hounded
him all season--he ranks third in the league with 46 walks--but his
ability to pitch out of jams has put him on pace to become the
Dodgers' first 20-game winner since Ramon Martinez in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be efforts by other teams to key on him, to make
adjustments," Colborn said. "But I'm confident, based on knowing
he'll face the same things here that he faced in Japan, that he'll
know how to react. In Japan, they know every tendency pitchers have."</TE>
<TE>   Ishii's problems stem more from a lack of focus than stuff.
Saturday in Baltimore was a perfect example: He retired the first two
batters in the first inning before giving up a walk, a single and a
three-run home run. Ishii then found a groove, facing the minimum 15
batters over the next five innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii, who has a solid shot of making the All-Star game, seems at
his best in tight spots or after he gets a lead in the middle
innings.</TE>
<TE>   "His demeanor changes ever so slightly, and his stuff gets
crisper," Manager Jim Tracy said. "He gets a lead, and he knows what
to do with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortstop Cesar Izturis spent most of the first two months hitting
second, and Adrian Beltre hit second for two weeks in late May, but
it appears catcher Paul Lo Duca has settled into the No. 2 spot for
good.</TE>
<TE>   With the switch-hitting Izturis batting .212 from the left side,
Tracy could no longer afford to bat him second against right-handers.
Izturis is hitting .324 from the right side, though, so he continues
to lead off against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   "I like what we're doing from a developmental standpoint with
Izturis," Tracy said. "We have a No. 2 hitter [Lo Duca] who can drive
the ball out of the park, and we can do situational things at the
bottom of the order.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it fair to have a 22-year-old kid who is still learning to hit
from the left side [bat second]? I want to take the onus off him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger pitcher Kevin Brown, who underwent surgery on a herniated
disk in his lower back Tuesday, was released from the hospital
Thursday and was resting comfortably at home.</TE>

Aug. 2, 1997. Ortiz, the Angel right-hander, ranks among the American

batting average (.223), but he also leads the major leagues in home
runs given up with 18.</TE>

<HD>They Play It Cool in This Rivalry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What this series needs is some good old-fashioned hate. Roger Clemens
throws the remnants of a broken bat back at Mike Piazza, and all of
New York takes sides, loudly and with expletives. If you're for the
Yankees, you despise the Mets, and vice versa.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers and the Angels? Chan Ho Park and Tim Belcher did their
best to incite a local rivalry three years ago, with the Dodgers'
Park delivering a karate-style kick to the Angel pitcher and Belcher
issuing a statement calling Park's behavior "adolescent." Southern
California fans laughed at the video, chuckled at the statement and
proceeded happily with summer.</LD>
<LD>   The Freeway Series tag is cute, but it doesn't generate a genuine
rivalry, not for one weekend in the middle of a long season. There
has to be something big on the line. The Mets and Yankees faced off
in the Subway Series, in the World Series. The San Francisco Giants
and Oakland A's faced off in the Bay Bridge Series in the World
Series.</LD>
<TE>   So this year's joust between the Dodgers and Angels offers a hint
of intrigue, not for this weekend but for the hope of the birth of a
serious rivalry. Neither team has appeared in the playoffs since
interleague play began in 1997. But as the Dodgers and Angels meet
tonight at Dodger Stadium, each team is only one game out of first
place in its division.</TE>
<TE>   If the teams keep playing so well, Southern California might
finally be forced to choose sides. As a kid growing up in Tustin, the
Dodgers' Shawn Green didn't have to.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1986, I rooted for the Angels and in 1988, I rooted for the
Dodgers," he said. "That worked out pretty well."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels haven't appeared in a playoff game since 1986. The
Dodgers haven't won one since 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Said the Angels' Tim Salmon: "I wish I could sit here and say it's
this big cross-town rivalry, like with the Yankees and the Mets. I
honestly don't feel like that.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams are doing well. It's nice to see the two teams doing
well. But I don't feel any of the whatever you call it that you feel
when you play Oakland or Seattle or the Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   For the players, the motivation is not pride or bragging rights.
The motivation is to wake up on Monday in first place, or at least to
avoid waking up on Monday four games out.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't add to the rivalry," the Angels' Troy Percival said.
"It adds to the meaning of the three games. We want to get a lead on
the teams in our division."</TE>
<TE>   That is not to say that the players do not care for the games. The
Angel players enjoy an extra weekend with friends and family by
playing three road games at Dodger Stadium; the Dodgers get the same
privilege with three games at Edison Field at the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   The games will be played before large crowds, particularly in
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   The games ought to be close; four of the six games last year were
decided by one run. With Gary Sheffield gone to Atlanta, neither team
has a player prone to publicly disrespecting opponents, or his
teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a good series," the Dodgers' Paul Lo Duca said.
"It's a big deal for both of us because they have Seattle in their
division, we have Arizona in our division, we both play in really
strong divisions, we're both second in the pack and we're both still
trying to prove something."</TE>
<TE>   Said the Dodgers' Eric Karros: "Probably unfortunately for each of
us, our interleague games are against each other instead of some
teams with lesser records. I like this series.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to have interleague play, I'd rather be playing
them than Detroit or something."</TE>
<TE>   Those are hardly fighting words. Maybe the Dodgers playing the
Angels never will inspire the passion and the emotion--and, yes, the
hate--of a genuine rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "Met fans hate Yankee fans. Yankee fans hate Met fans. That's New
York. This is L.A.," the Angels' Garret Anderson said. "That sums it
up.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans back there are a different type of fan. It's personal
with them."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers' Dave Hansen grew up in Lakewood, playing Wiffle ball
in the street.</TE>
<TE>   One team was the Dodgers, the other team was the Angels, and the
kids didn't care which team they played on as long as they got to
play.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, after four decades of wishful thinking, this might be the
year the Dodgers and Angels face off in October, in a Freeway Series
that would need no hype. In Lakewood, on the block on which Hansen
grew up, the next generation of kids just might have to choose sides.</TE>

<LD>   Doctors are optimistic that the right-hander will be able to
return next season, General Manager Gerry Hunsicker said.</LD>
<LD>   Houston put Reynolds on the 15-day disabled list and recalled
right-hander Brandon Puffer from triple-A New Orleans.</LD>
<TE>   Reynolds, 34, was 3-6 with a 4.86 ERA in 13 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Puffer, 26, is 0-1 with an 8.10 ERA in 15 appearances for the
Astros. In six games with New Orleans, he is 1-0 with a 1.13 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros plan to purchase the contract of former Cal State
Fullerton right-hander Kirk Saarloos from double-A Round Rock to
start in Milwaukee on Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos would be the second player from the 2001 draft to appear
in a major league game. Chicago Cub right-hander Mark Prior was the
first, making his debut May 22.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chambliss, a former player and coach with the New York
Yankees, was hired as the New York Mets' batting coach.</TE>
<TE>   Chambliss, who had been minor league hitting coordinator for the
Pittsburgh Pirates, replaces Dave Engle, who was fired by the Mets on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Mariner shortstop Carlos Guillen was arrested for
investigation of drunken driving early Thursday, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen, 26, was stopped by police in suburban Clyde Hill for
allegedly speeding. The police said he then refused to take a
Breathalyzer test when he was taken to the police station.</TE>
<TE>   That refusal will mean automatic suspension of his driver's
license.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Shuey, Cleveland's top setup reliever, was put on the 15-day
disabled list because of a groin injury.</TE>
<TE>   The club said Shuey was hurt during a pregame, on-field workout on
Tuesday. The Indians made the move retroactive to Monday and recalled
reliever Jerrod Riggan from triple-A Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   Riggan got the win on Thursday as the Indians beat the Baltimore
Orioles, 2-1, in 10 innings.</TE>

<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>On opening day at the U.S. Open, Bethpage Black rolled out the green
carpet and welcomed the best golfers in the world to take their best
shot. The big old softy. It had rained overnight and the course
couldn't have been more friendly if it had rolled over on its back
and invited everyone to scratch its belly.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of rock-hard greens, there would be fluffy pillows waiting
to welcome golf balls. These guys were going to tear the place up
Thursday. There would be more birdies out there on the course than
buses in the shuttle lines, and as everyone here knows, there are
zillions of those. The players were going to wrap the place in a
pretty ribbon and call it Bethpage Pink.</LD>
<LD>   That was the plan anyway.</LD>
<TE>   Chances are, if there had been a day to lay waste to Bethpage
Black, the scourge of the U.S. Open, the toughest layout since they
invented misery, this would be that day.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing of the sort happened. In fact, it wasn't even a fair
fight. On the first day of the 102nd U.S. Open, the golf course won,
which is sort of what everyone was predicting when it was hot and
humid and the greens were harder than the hoods of the courtesy cars
in the players' parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Bethpage Black stuck it to the players even when it
was supposed to play easier cannot be a good sign for anyone who
shows up for work today with his sticks.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the people who want the course to play tough, the U.S.
Golf Assn. folks, are very pleased. The only thing that stops them
from growing rough as high as the grandstands is the fact that you
wouldn't be able to see the players on television.</TE>
<TE>   The last major championship to play so tough was the 1999 British
Open at Carnoustie, Scotland, where there was enough hay to make a
farm jealous, and it was all only a foot or so from the fairway.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's why it was so refreshing Thursday to see Jean Van de
Velde doing well for a while, until Bethpage Black caught up to him.
Remember it was Van de Velde who lost a three-shot lead on the last
hole at Carnoustie, but not before charming everyone he met. The pro
at Euro Disney, Van de Velde was asked what he had to do to keep his
job and he explained that his duties included testing all the rides
and having his picture taken with Minnie and Goofy.</TE>
<TE>   It must help to have a sense of humor when your heart is getting
run through a juicer.</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin is a three-time U.S. Open champion and he shot an 82.
Asked about his round, Irwin couldn't remember it, but he said his
faulty memory is entirely permissible because it falls under the
category of a senior moment.</TE>
<TE>   There were bogeys. There were double bogeys. There were triple
bogeys. Players were trying to bogey for the cycle. No, that's not
right. They weren't trying to, but it was happening without their
permission.</TE>
<TE>   This is what happens because of U.S. Open conditions, remember.
Bunkers bigger than the Mojave Desert. Enough tall grass to feed a
circus. A course so huge it needs three zip codes. Fairways so narrow
you can't walk down them unless you suck in your breath.</TE>
<TE>   Davis Love III had six threes on the front side and shot 39 on the
back. Wayne Grady had three sixes on the front and seven fives on the
back, which would have been better if he had been playing cards.
Woody Austin had three bogeys, a double bogey and a triple bogey--all
on the last nine holes. There were other similar horror tales, too
numerous to mention.</TE>
<TE>   The sky was a grainy gray and gloomy, which accurately reflected
the mood of most of the players after their experience at Bethpage
Black. Only six of the 156 who started the day managed to shoot under
par, with Tiger Woods leading the way with a 67. While this should
not be considered a surprise, it can't be encouraging news to
everyone else trying to head him off from another major title.</TE>
<TE>   Their hope was that Tiger would prove to be vulnerable here
because the fairways are so narrow and the penalties so severe. Only
three more rounds of hope remain. Woods didn't hit every fairway and
he didn't make every putt, but a three-under score looks a lot better
than that considering that very few did very little when they had the
chance.</TE>
<TE>   Woods started his round at No. 10, with two of the first three
holes he played the longest par-fours in the history of the U.S.
Open. He said it was the most difficult start he had ever experienced
in a major, but he still managed to par the first three. And by the
time Woods was done, he counted eight one-putt greens and said it was
his best putting performance since, well, since he won the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   However, Bethpage Black is not supposed to be as good to Tiger as
Augusta National is ... or to anyone else, for that matter. It is
basically rude to everyone. Yet we might not see the worst of its
manners, because rain is in the forecast and that is likely to keep
Bethpage Black from eliminating virtually everyone in the field by
nightfall.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was justifiably happy with his 67, but Colin Montgomerie was
ecstatic with his 75, the way things were going. It's not easy out
there. The USGA officials like to say that par is a good score at the
U.S. Open. They're wrong. At this place, par is a great score.</TE>

<HD>One-Sided Victory Not Enough for Brazilian Coach</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUWON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>There are not many coaches in the world who would complain after
winning a game, 5-2, but then again, there are not many coaches in
the world like Luiz Felipe Scolari.</LD>
<LD>   Scolari, Brazil's taciturn and sometimes terse mentor, was angered
Thursday by Brazil's defensive shortcomings even as it demolished
Costa Rica in a seven-goal treat that was a throwback to soccer's
wide-open days of old.</LD>
<LD>   "It reminded me of the Brazil-versus-Peru game in 1970, two teams
playing with similar styles to this, a great game, lots of goals,"
said Alexandre Guimaraes, Costa Rica's Brazilian-born coach.</LD>
<TE>   But "Big Phil," as Scolari is known, was not as easily
entertained. Even as Brazil was scoring goals with ease and
apparently at will, he was standing on the sideline, furiously
signaling his defenders and midfielders.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, when Brazil had joined Spain as the only two teams so
far to advance to the second round with 3-0 records, Scolari talked
of "mistakes" and "problems" rather than goals of glorious variety
and profusion.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making mistakes and we know what those mistakes are," he
said. "We give chances to the opponent, but this will be worked on.
They are problems we know about. We know our strengths and
weaknesses."</TE>
<TE>   It was a game that flowed from beginning to end.</TE>
<TE>   The final score might just as easily have been 7-5.</TE>
<TE>   There were chances aplenty at both ends and the woodwork was
rattled by shots that were mere inches off target.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil jumped out to a lead in the 10th minute with the first of
two goals in a span of three minutes by Ronaldo, who has four in the
tournament. The first goal, which came after a surging run,
originally had been ruled an own goal but was overturned after a FIFA
review. Edmilson's goal in the 38th minute made it 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Costa Rica was creating chances of its own but was hurt by poor
finishing. Finally, in the 39th minute, Paulo Wanchope cut into the
deficit. Eleven minutes into the second half Ronald Gomez made it
3-2.</TE>
<TE>   The Brazilians replied by shifting up a gear, and goals by Rivaldo
and Junior two minutes apart were enough to send Costa Rica spinning
out of the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   But Guimaraes was undismayed, choosing instead to see the
positives rather than the negatives in what had been a fine
advertisement for attacking soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone could have played for the tie [that would have put Costa
Rica into the final 16]," he said. "But we didn't want to do this. We
wanted to show that we are good enough to compete and play our own
game."</TE>
<TE>   Brazil, meanwhile, stays on track for the record fifth World Cup
it is seeking. With France and Argentina eliminated and other teams
struggling, Brazil is now the favorite to reach and probably win the
final on June 30.</TE>
<TE>   But Scolari isn't conceding anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that people see us as favorites, but we do not
consider ourselves as such," he said. "I keep telling the players to
be humble, that we need to go step by step. The next stage will be
hard and we are preparing for that."</TE>
<TE>   Once a curmudgeon, always a curmudgeon.</TE>

<LD>Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times couldn't be more thrilled that
the U.S. Open is being played for the first time on a public golf
course, Bethpage Black:</LD>
<LD>   "After 101 years of snooty hobnobbing at elite clubs, the Open is
stooping to the Tin Cup crowd ... where Joe Divot and his buddies can
play for $31 during the week and $39 on weekends.</LD>

<TE>   Party on: Freshman fullback Brandon Hancock says it didn't take
long for USC to make him feel welcome after his early enrollment this
spring.</TE>
<TE>   "I was immediately swept up by fraternity rush," Hancock wrote in
a diary he kept for Sports Illustrated. "I went to a party every

<TE>   Center stage: Maryland forward Chris Wilcox, a sophomore who has

<HD>Familiar Turf for the Cardinal</HD>
<DH>College baseball: Stanford is back in Omaha for the fourth
year in a row as the World Series begins.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OMAHA</DL>
<LD>Stanford Coach Mark Marquess never gets tired of Omaha in June.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinal are back at the College World Series for the fourth
consecutive year.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a thrill to be back," Marquess said Thursday. "It's never
happened when we've come four straight years. It's a special group."</LD>
<TE>   Stanford and Nebraska are the only teams back from last year's
field. Texas and Clemson played here two years ago and Rice was a
1999 participant. Georgia Tech's last appearance was in 1994, South
Carolina last played here in 1985 and Notre Dame last appeared in
1957.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an element of luck there. You don't like to admit it, but
it's there," Marquess said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinal has the most recent title of any of this year's
teams, winning consecutive championships in 1987-88. It was close to
adding another two years ago but let a three-run lead get away in the
eighth inning and lost to Louisiana State, 6-5. Last year's 12-1 loss
to Miami wasn't as much of a heartbreaker but was equally
disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we were young and inexperienced. This is a different
team," Marquess said.</TE>
<TE>   As popular as Stanford has become in Omaha, the crowd favorite
will be Nebraska. The Cornhuskers made their first trip to the Series
last June and Rosenblatt Stadium was packed for their two games.</TE>
<TE>   The trip quickly turned to disappointment as the Cornhuskers lost
one-run games to Cal State Fullerton and Tulane.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like it didn't happen because we were here and we
were gone," Nebraska Coach Dave Van Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Horn is trying to keep the Cornhuskers' emotions more level
this time. The attention the Cornhuskers received last year drained
the players, Van Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   "This time went the opposite way so nobody saw us. We tried to
just low-key everything," Van Horn said.</TE>
<TE>   Play opens today with Georgia Tech (51-14) facing South Carolina
(53-16), followed by Nebraska (47-19) against Clemson (52-15).</TE>
<TE>   "We're here and hopefully we're going to stay a little while
longer," Clemson Coach Jack Leggett said.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers played only three games when they were here two years
ago, getting knocked out by Louisiana Lafayette when the Ragin'
Cajuns scored two runs in the bottom of the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina is in the World Series for the sixth time.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia Tech's only other appearance ended in a loss to Oklahoma
in the title game. Georgia Tech's lineup that year included current
major leaguers Nomar Garciaparra, Jason Varitek and Jay Payton. This
year the Yellow Jackets feature 15 freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not playing like freshmen anymore. They had a grueling
schedule and they passed the test," said South Carolina Coach Ray
Tanner, whose Gamecocks beat the Yellow Jackets, 8-3, in February.</TE>
<TE>   Texas is in its 29th World Series, eight more than any other
school. Coach Augie Garrido led Cal State Fullerton to titles in
1979, '94 and '95.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame was the last team to qualify. The Fighting Irish's
super regional at Florida State was delayed a day by rain. The Irish
won it in three games with a 3-1 victory Monday, knocking out the
top-seeded Seminoles.</TE>
<TE>   "The understatement of the year is that we're very happy to be
here. It only took us 45 years to get here," Coach Paul Mainieri
said.</TE>

<LD>Thousands of soccer fans waving Mexican flags jumped for joy, sprayed
one another with foam and ran victory laps around Mexico's main
plazas after the national soccer team qualified for the second round
of the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to be champions!" screamed Uriel Sanchez, an
18-year-old sales clerk jumping up and down at Mexico City's Angel of
Independence monument.</LD>
<LD>   In Guadalajara, a steady rain didn't stop the celebration.
Thousands of people ran around the Minerva monument with giant flags.
Many were schoolchildren. Districts across Mexico allowed students to
arrive late for class Thursday. Some said they didn't plan on showing
up at all.</LD>
<TE>   "I had a test today, but I didn't study because of the game," said
Ricardo Garcia. "But my teacher is a fan too, so he'll understand."</TE>

<LD>Much of England's workforce may have had permission to watch the
World Cup, but some of those who didn't are now finding themselves
suspended or fired.</LD>
<LD>   Four factory workers in north England were fired after allegedly
leaving work on Wednesday to watch the national team's 0-0 draw with
Nigeria.</LD>
<LD>   That was only one of a number of incidents throughout the country.</LD>
<TE>   "Most employers have acted sensibly throughout the World Cup and

<HD>Croatia's Glory Fades With 1-0 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Penner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From third in the World Cup in 1998 to third in its first-round group
in 2002, Croatia completed a disappointing stay in Japan on Thursday
with a 1-0 loss to Ecuador in Yokohama.</LD>
<LD>   Book-ending an inspired performance in a 2-1 upset of Italy were
drab 1-0 losses to Mexico and Ecuador, previously winless in its
first World Cup appearance. The loss to Ecuador was especially
damaging to Croatia on a night when Italy tied Mexico, 1-1, finishing
Group G play with four points. With a victory over Ecuador, Croatia
would have had six points, enough to reach the second round.</LD>
<LD>   "It was quite disappointing," Croatian midfielder Mario Stanic
said. "The team could do better, but the team didn't show their
quality from the game against Mexico [onward]. It was strange, but
both Argentina and France are going home as well."</LD>
<TE>   Ecuador scored its historic victory on a 48th-minute goal by
Edison Mendez, coming off an assist by Agustin Delgado. Croatia had
four scoring chances in the final five minutes, but goalkeeper Jose
Cevallos and the Ecuador defense combined to turn each of them away.</TE>
<TE>   "We have progressed a lot," said Ecuador Coach Hernan Dario Gomez,
whose team finished 1-2-0 with three points. "We have improved day by
day and we have learned a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Alen Boksic, Croatia's veteran forward, summed up his team's
performance in the tournament aptly with his own self-assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to play better today than last match," he said.
"Unfortunately, I played even worse. I don't know why this is so. I
can't explain now what went wrong."</TE>

4:30 a.m. at Niigata, Japan
TV: Ch. 34. Delayed: Ch. 7, 12:30 p.m.; Ch. 46, 2:30 p.m
How they got here: Denmark (2-0-1) won Group A; England (1-0-2) was
runner-up in Group E
Sidelined: Denmark's Christian Poulsen (two yellow cards); England's
Owen Hargreaves (injured)
Denmark update: Striker Jon Dahl Tomasson, who has four goals and is
the tournament's second-leading scorer with Brazil's Ronaldo, might
miss the game because of a thigh injury. Tomasson is the player the
Danes can least afford to lose because other offense has been
difficult to come by. Midfielder Stig Tofting also is doubtful
because of an injured left foot
England update: A lack of offense in the flow of play has to be a
concern for the English. Michael Owen, the darling of the 1998 World
Cup, has not scored in three games. The two England goals to this
point have been on set pieces--a David Beckham penalty kick and a Sol
Campbell header off a corner kick
Outlook: Without Tomasson, Denmark's impressive run might be
finished. With him, the Danes, who eliminated France, could take out
another superpower</TE>

runner-up in Group B
Sidelined: Germany's Carsten Ramelow (red card), Christian Ziege (two
yellow cards) and Dietmar Hamann (two yellow cards), Joerg Boehme
(injured); Paraguay's Carlos Paredes (red card)
Germany update: Coach Rudi Voeller's team features the tournament's
leading goal scorer, Miroslav Klose, who has 13 goals in 15 games
overall for the national team, including five at this World Cup
Paraguay update: Coach Cesare Maldini masterminded a come-from-behind
win over Slovenia that got the South Americans here, but the hero of
that game, forward Nelson Cuevas, limped off with a suspected muscle
tear and might miss the match
Outlook: Eccentric but sometimes error-prone goalkeeper Jose Luis
Chilavert holds the key to the outcome for Paraguay, which defeated
Brazil and tied Argentina twice during qualifying to prove its
credentials. "We have a team that can knock Germany out," Chilavert
said</TE>

<LD>Victories have been hard to come by for Elaborate since his 10-1
surprise in the 2000 Triple Bend Breeders' Cup Handicap at Hollywood
Park.</LD>
<LD>   In 11 starts since, the 7-year-old gelding has only one win--a
four-length allowance victory in Inglewood on May 13, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The chestnut is among five scheduled to run in tonight's second, a
$60,000 allowance at 7 1/2 furlongs. The race is not part of the pick
six, which has a carryover of $83,426.</LD>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan, and trained by
Paco Gonzalez, Elaborate was last seen finishing third, beaten by
less than a length, by Kalookan Queen in the Potrero Grande Breeders'
Cup Handicap on March 30 at Santa Anita. Chris McCarron will be
aboard tonight.</TE>
<TE>   The compact field is completed by Nick, who won six of nine in his
native Chile; Bay Head King, a distant fourth in the Mervyn LeRoy
Handicap in his Hollywood Park debut May 12; Top Hit and High Wire
Act.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: The seventh at Hollywood Park is a wide-open turf
sprint (5 1/2 furlongs) for 3-year-old fillies running for a $62,500
claiming price.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Kevin Krigger. The apprentice won three races Thursday
and none of the winners were favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Soft Senor. The 4-year-old Senor Speedy colt, who will
run in today's fifth at Belmont Park, is 0 for 11 since the beginning
of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A trifecta keying Subpoena on top in the
fifth with Take It Outside, Cellular Call and Ancient Traveler in the
two hole and all in the third spot.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/98. Money: Previous day/meet

<DH>Lakers: Kupchak can't celebrate third consecutive title
before worrying about roster for next season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Game 4 was over, Mitch Kupchak sat in the stands at Continental
Airlines Arena, watching.</LD>
<LD>   He has run the basketball operations for the Lakers for two
seasons, and won two championships, both by touching up around
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, just as Jerry West had done before
him.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night, the seats around Kupchak emptied, leaving him
with an old friend from Long Island.</LD>
<TE>   They talked awhile about the game, the series and the three-peat.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," his friend finally said, "you've got a lot of work to do
this summer, don't you? What do you have, seven free agents?"</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been 15 minutes," he pleaded.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak allowed himself a few more minutes of satisfaction. He
walked the halls near the Laker locker room, offered congratulations
and thanks to some players, accepting them from others. He spoke to
Magic Johnson briefly. Johnson offered his help in preparing for the
draft, and they agreed they should probably talk soon.</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, New Jersey Net center Todd MacCulloch put his head
on the shoulder of a friend, who told him, "We tried. We tried," and
MacCulloch nodded sadly.</TE>
<TE>   Leaning against a cinder-block wall, Kupchak said, "We do have a
lot of work. This is the time to enjoy this. The draft is coming up.
Most importantly, Kobe and Shaquille, the core group, is going to be
with us. We face some tough decisions on players to sign back. We'll
see where we end up."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond O'Neal, Bryant and Coach Phil Jackson, there is little that
is critical, and those three will return. Jackson, in fact, would
appear to have his first real shot at four consecutive titles, after
twice having won three in succession at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   After the Bulls' first three-peat, Michael Jordan went off to play
baseball. After the second, Jackson and Jordan retired and Scottie
Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets, and the Bulls have been
awful since.</TE>
<TE>   Only the Boston Celtics, who won eight in a row from 1959-66, have
won more than three consecutive championships. Four in a row would
give Jackson his 10th title as a coach, one more than Red Auerbach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to the challenge of trying to get back here
and win a 10th," Jackson said. "I think that's the distinction."</TE>
<TE>   The complications of the summer start with O'Neal, who again is
contemplating surgery, this time on his big right toe. It is
arthritic and limited him severely for long parts of the season. Yet
Wednesday, he suggested he would not choose a course of treatment
until well into the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to enjoy the moment and take most of the summer off," said
O'Neal, who in the series averaged 36.3 points and 12.3 rebounds and
was its MVP, again. "Then I'll make a decision at the end of the
summer on what I'm going to do."</TE>
<TE>   The recovery time for surgery, depending on the procedure, is two
to three months, according to Robert Mohr, O'Neal's doctor and the
chief of podiatric surgery at UCLA Medical Center, so O'Neal's
tentative schedule could again complicate training camp and the
regular season. There is still much to decide, however, and in recent
weeks O'Neal's toe improved enough that surgery is no longer a given.</TE>
<TE>   Team doctors expect to perform exit examinations in the coming
days, and an early course for O'Neal will be determined then. If
surgery is the best option, the club would prefer O'Neal to have it
sooner rather than later, giving him time to rehabilitate and
condition himself for next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll go out, meet all the best foot doctors in the world, then
I'll make the best decision possible," O'Neal said. "Somebody to help
me with my pinkie-winkies."</TE>
<TE>   While other Lakers danced, Kupchak was reminded that not much was
easy in their three-peat, despite the sweep in the Finals. By the end
of the series, besides lauding the Lakers for their ferocity,
observers were wondering if the New Jersey Nets weren't the worst
team ever to play in the Finals. Not that it mattered to the Lakers,
of course. The sweep simply hastened the arrival of today's parade, a
14th franchise title, and an off-season that will test Kupchak's
judgment in the face of the ever-challenging Western Conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers intend to offer Bryant a three-year, $54.8-million
contract extension, the maximum allowed under the collective
bargaining agreement.</TE>
<TE>   In the third year of a six-year extension that expires after the
2004-05 season, Bryant is due $40.5 million in the next three
seasons. Then, by the same process that brought O'Neal a three-year,
$88.4 million extension 1 1/2 years ago, Bryant would be due $16.4
million, $18.3 million and $20.1 million through the 2007-08 season.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has suggested he might not accept the offer, though not
because he does not enjoy the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Including a final-year owners' option almost certain to be
exercised, the collective bargaining agreement expires after 2004-05,
the same time as Bryant's contract. He could be inclined to examine
the terms of a new agreement first.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have seven potential free agents, two--Samaki Walker
and Lindsey Hunter--with contract opt-outs. Devean George, Brian
Shaw, Mitch Richmond and Jelani McCoy, all drenched with champagne
two nights ago, are unrestricted free agents. Slava Medvedenko is a
restricted free agent, meaning the Lakers can keep him by matching
any offers.</TE>
<TE>   It would seem the Lakers would be interested in keeping young free
agents George and Medvedenko, and Shaw, who was particularly capable
at times in the playoffs. They'll wait with Walker and Hunter, and
still go into the draft and the free-agent market looking first for a
power forward and then a shooting guard or small forward.</TE>
<TE>   The club almost certainly will inquire about free agent Malik
Rose, the 6-foot-6 unrestricted free agent with San Antonio. Although
undersized, Rose is a tough defender and, probably, would be pleased
to guard someone other than O'Neal next May. Veteran Charles Oakley,
also a free agent, will be considered as well, among others.</TE>
<TE>   It appears that the Lakers are prepared to use their $4.5-million
exception to the salary cap, which last off-season went unspent
because of luxury-tax concerns.</TE>
<TE>   For one more night, however, Kupchak tried not to allow the
daunting decisions ahead to detract from his sense of accomplishment.
The Lakers, for a third consecutive season, had what it took.</TE>
<TE>   "They had such great chemistry, and it was clear they trusted each
other, and demonstrated they could win the games they had to win," he
said. "I think that's the biggest satisfaction of the whole thing.
Having said that, we almost lost the seventh game in Sacramento. So,
it's that close.</TE>
<TE>   "They just seemed to know the games they had to win."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In his two victories for trainer Dean Frey, Vising has left little
doubt.</LD>
<LD>   In his second start, the 4-year-old Arabian beat maidens by 11
lengths, then, after an ill-fated try in a stakes, the son of Virgule
Al Maury crushed an allowance field by 13 lengths.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Darley Stud Management, Vising will try to dominate again
tonight when he takes on six rivals in the fifth race, a $4,700
allowance at six furlongs.</LD>
<TE>   Adolfo Rodriguez was aboard for Vising's two victories, but Joy
Scott has the mount tonight and they will break from Post 7. The
Florida-bred could be a single for pick six players.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth race, Lodi Lou, who dominated $16,000 maidens when
dropped in for a tag for the first time on May 12, will try for a
repeat against Enjoy The Moment, Fishers Effort, Marmeta and three
other 3-year-old fillies. The 350-yard race carries a $12,500 purse.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Real Mirage. 2. Encrypted. 3. Applicator. 4. Quick
Encounter. 5. Vising. 6. Tinys Royal Hugger. 7. The Maui Cartel. 8.
Nordick Only VM. 9. Enjoy The Moment. 10. Tequiza Starlet.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Single Real Mirage in the first, use Chick On The Loose,
First Sight, Sand Mountain Tara and Encrypted in the second,
Applicator and Pass The Bolgers in the third, and Quick Encounter,
Night Lines and Hotter Than Cash in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: A Campus Chic drops in the sixth for trainer
Connie Hall. Lucks Flying High comes back at the same level in the
seventh after having been claimed by trainer Jorge Farias.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EVIAN-LES-BAINS, France</DL>
<LD>Annika Sorenstam and Se Ri Pak, winners of the LPGA's first two
majors this season, moved within a stroke of the lead Thursday midway
through the Evian Masters.</LD>
<LD>   Sorenstam had five birdies in a round of 67 and Pak had an eagle
and eight birdies in a 64 for 36-hole totals of 135, one shot behind
Karin Icher of France.</LD>
<LD>   Becoming the first French player to lead the tournament, Icher had
a six-under-par 66 for a 10-under total and stretched her streak of
bogey-free holes to 47.</LD>
<TE>   "It's easier like that," said Icher, who won her third European
title--the Spanish Open--two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tied with Sorenstam and Pak was American Leta Lindley, who
completed her round with five consecutive birdies for a 66.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't remember having five in a row before," she said. "Today I
got excited after two."</TE>
<TE>   Mi Hyun Kim, who held a one-stroke lead after Wednesday's opening
round, had a second-round 70 and was two shots behind Icher.</TE>
<TE>   Icher turned pro only 18 months ago and found it "weird" to be
grouped with Pak and Lindley for the third round.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll have to avoid falling in the trap of just watching my
partners play tomorrow," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Her second round featured a 23-foot chip-in for birdie at No. 3
and a 40-foot birdie putt at No. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Pak chipped in for eagle at No. 9. All of her birdies came on
putts of less than 10 feet.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam's 67 was one shot better than her first-round score.</TE>

<LD>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. --The New Jersey Nets' off-season will have
neither a championship nor controversy.</LD>
<LD>   One day after the Lakers ended the Nets' NBA title hopes in a
four-game sweep, the controversy that arose after the final game was
also put to rest.</LD>
<LD>   New Jersey forward Kenyon Martin acknowledged he made a mistake
questioning the heart of some of his teammates.</LD>
<TE>   "I said some things last night that I probably shouldn't have
said," Martin said Thursday. "I was a little disappointed, so the
emotions got over me a little bit. But we had a great year. We had a
good run. It's been fun."</TE>
<TE>   Martin never identified who he was talking about, but it was
obvious it was fellow forward Keith Van Horn. Martin told people to
look at the statistics, and Van Horn scored seven points in the final
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't look at it as a big deal," Van Horn said of the
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   Net Coach Byron Scott and General Manager Rod Thorn spoke to
Martin on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he was way out of line," Thorn said.</TE>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OITA, Japan</DL>
<LD>Now that this World Cup has stretched believability to the breaking
point, with France and Argentina already gone and Italy nearly run
out of the tournament by Mexico, Javier Aguirre was asked if he could
allow himself to "dream" a moment and imagine how far his
overachieving Mexican squad might be able to take this fantastic
voyage.</LD>
<LD>   Aguirre shook his head and stomped his right foot, and then his
left, loudly on the floor.</LD>
<LD>   "I won't allow myself to dream," Aguirre said after watching his
team outrun, outwork and outplay Italy en route to a 1-1 tie Thursday
at Oita's Big Eye Stadium.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a realist. I have two feet firmly on the ground."</TE>
<TE>   All right then, how about this potential reality, considered a
pipe dream when both teams first stepped on Asian soil three weeks
ago--a second-round matchup against border rival the United States?</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre's face lighted up with a wide smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd love to play the U.S.," he said. "They beat us the last time
we played. We have a great rivalry with them. It would be a great
thing for the whole CONCACAF region."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico versus the U.S. in the knockout phase of a World Cup?</TE>
<TE>   It is closer to happening than not. Mexico, in a memorable
performance against three-time World Cup champion Italy, has done its
part--clinching first place in Group G and a trip to Jeonju, South
Korea, for a second-round matchup Monday against the second-place
finisher in Group D.</TE>
<TE>   Heading into today's last set of Group D matches, the U.S. was in
second place. If the Americans can hold that position--they play
Poland and group leader South Korea faces Portugal--Mexico would be
their next opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Worth noting, Yanks: This is a drastically different Mexico team
from the one that lost to the U.S., 1-0, in an exhibition match in
Denver in early April. In fact, this is a drastically different
Mexico team from the one that scuffled to a 1-0 victory over Croatia
in its World Cup opener 11 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre didn't quite get the "perfect game" he said Mexico needed
against Italy. But the resilience, cohesion and tenacity his team
displayed, against an Italy squad desperate to avoid elimination,
rank Thursday's effort among the most impressive in Mexico's World
Cup history.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico was five minutes from its first victory over Italy, with
Italian fans nervously scoreboard-watching to track how Croatia was
faring against Ecuador, when second-half substitutes Vincenzo
Montella and Alessandro Del Piero combined on a cross-and-header that
spared Italy the indignity of losing successive group games and
having to squeak into the next round on goal differential.</TE>
<TE>   Without Del Piero's goal, Italy would have advanced, barely,
because Croatia lost to Ecuador in Yokohama, Japan, 1-0, keeping
Italy ahead on tiebreakers. The draw made qualification a certainty.</TE>
<TE>   In Italy's camp, there's always something. And more fuel for the
FIFA-conspiracy fire was ladled up when the Italians had another goal
controversially disallowed--after two being nullified in the 2-1 loss
to Croatia--when Filippo Inzaghi's 14th-minute strike appeared to be
incorrectly ruled offside.</TE>
<TE>   Francesco Totti missed an open net five minutes later and Mexico,
having withstood Italy's initial barrage, began to play its way into
a rhythm, despite numerous stoppages for Italian fouls, Italian
yellow cards (five in all) and Mexican players being carried off
after ugly collisions.</TE>
<TE>   Amid such bitter tactics, Mexico lifted the game's level in the
34th minute when Cuauhtemoc Blanco freed himself just long enough to
fire in a left-sided cross for Jared Borgetti, whose glancing header
carried over the reach of Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon and
nestled inside the far post.</TE>
<TE>   Borgetti's header was Mexico's first shot on goal, one of two for
his team in the match. Italy outshot Mexico, 13-8, with five shots on
goal, but was repeatedly frustrated by Mexico's agile goalkeeper
Oscar Perez and a disciplined defense led by captain Rafael Marquez,
who has emerged as one of the top defenders in this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Desperate, Italy Coach Giovanni Trapattoni sent on three reserves
in the second half, with Del Piero replacing Totti in the 77th
minute. His goal eight minutes later didn't technically save Italy
from elimination--Ecuador took care of that--but at the time, the
result of the Croatia-Ecuador match was still uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing that a tie would send Italy through, and clinch first
place for Mexico, both teams turned the remaining minutes into a
half-comical, half-sad exercise in running out the clock. Mexico
dropped into a virtual four-corners offense, knocking the ball around
the back, while Italy made no effort to pressure the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez called it "a great day for Mexico. We have advanced to the
next round and we should hold our composure. This is just the first
step to the top."</TE>
<TE>   That next step could be shared by an old neighbor. Mexico, against
fairly long odds, has done its part. Now, the ball is on the
Americans' side of field.</TE>

<HD>Fatality a Reminder of Racing's Dangers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Driving a race car is inherently dangerous. There is no getting
around it.</LD>
<LD>   "I know, every time I get in my race car, there is a possibility I
might not come back, but by utilizing every safety precaution I know
of, I have confidence in myself, my car and my environment," said
Wally Pankratz, a veteran of 400 U.S. Auto Club midget car and
hundreds of other open-wheel races.</LD>
<LD>   Pankratz is also an instructor at a driving school at Irwindale
Speedway, where a stock car driver was killed during a NASCAR race
Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   "There are tracks where I won't race where I feel it is too
dangerous, but I don't have that feeling at Irwindale. No track is
completely safe, but Irwindale is as safe as any you will find."</TE>
<TE>   With concrete walls.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Hoekstra, a race car engineering professor at the University
of Central Florida, said during a Performance Racing Industry
round-table discussion earlier this year in Indianapolis that Dale
Earnhardt's direct-impact speed--a complicated engineering
measurement of the car's speed had it hit head-on, not taking into
account the lateral speed--was only 43 mph when he hit the wall and
was killed in last year's Daytona 500.</TE>
<TE>   "The frightening thing is, a lot of [short track] drivers are
going a lot faster than that," Hoekstra said. "You can get hurt on a
short track just as easy as you can on a big track."</TE>
<TE>   Straightaway speeds at Irwindale range from about 125 mph for a
midget or sprint car to 120 mph for a NASCAR Southwest series car
such as John Baker was driving when he crashed last week. Even
driving-school cars go fast. Indy car driver Sam Hornish Jr. reached
112 mph in one.</TE>
<TE>   An investigation by the Charlotte Observer revealed that 270
people, 29 of them spectators, had died in racing accidents in this
country in the last 10 years. Most of them were at tracks of a
half-mile or less.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was Irwindale's fourth fatality in its four years.</TE>
<TE>   Older drivers, according to Joe Balash of the American Speed
Assn., are more likely to resist changes in safety equipment than
younger drivers.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger drivers, the ones newest to the sport, embrace the
changes more easily," Balash told the PRI gathering. "The challenge
comes from the seasoned veterans, who have been racing for a long
period of time and haven't had an incident that would make them
change the equipment they have in their vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's harder for them to relate to the new terminology, things
like "neck tension.' But then they have an accident, and they
reevaluate what they need inside their race car."</TE>
<TE>   Safety is an ongoing process, as it has been in racing ever since
Barney Oldfield first shocked Angelenos in 1903 by getting his Bullet
over 100 mph in an exhibition at old Agricultural Park.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR, which moved at glacial speed after Earnhardt's death
before mandating use of head-and-shoulder restraints for all
competitors, is taking a speedier approach to the use of "soft
walls."</TE>
<TE>   The SAFER (Steel and Foam Energy Reduction) barrier, used during
the Indianapolis 500 with positive results, will be modified for use
during NASCAR's Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis in August.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the difference in weight between 3,500-pound Winston
Cup cars and 1,550-pound Indy cars, the "soft walls" will be
thickened with additional energy-absorbing foam.</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR officials, however, rejected a request from New Hampshire
International Speedway to install SAFER walls. It was at New
Hampshire that NASCAR drivers Adam Petty and Kenny Irwin died in 2000
in separate accidents after crashing into the unprotected concrete
wall.</TE>
<TE>   "We are extremely pleased with the results at Indianapolis, where
drivers took some very hard hits without serious injuries, but we are
not yet ready to put barriers up at other tracks," said Dean L.
Sicking, director of the University of Nebraska's Midwest Roadside
Safety Facility, which worked with the Indy Racing League in
developing the soft walls. Sicking has spearheaded the program for
Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George.</TE>
<TE>   "Our next project is to develop a barrier that will be applicable
at all tracks, but our only testing has been for Indianapolis. Most
other tracks have much shorter radius turns, which creates totally
different situations.</TE>
<TE>   "In order to build walls for shorter tracks, or tracks with
sharper turns, we have to change the barrier configuration. However,
I think within three years we will have SAFER barriers designed for
use at all ovals and tri-ovals."</TE>
<TE>   Timing Is Everything</TE>
<TE>   Chip Ganassi, who has teams in both open-wheel series, was in
Laguna Seca for the CART race last weekend but was talking with some
potential sponsors for his Indy Racing League team when he turned on
the TV to watch the final laps of the IRL race Saturday night at
Texas Motor Speedway. His Target team driver, Jeff Ward, was in the
process of winning one of the most exciting races of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Ward edged Al Unser Jr. by .0111 of a second at Texas, the closest
finish in IRL history.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ward this week, "I heard that Mike Hull, who manages Chip
Ganassi Racing, was at the hotel and didn't want to leave, because
with 20 laps to go, he had a feeling we were going to win. He had to
go to the meeting with Chip, and I guess they turned on the TV and
the Target people were there and whoever else they were meeting with
on sponsorship and there, behold, we won the race.</TE>
<TE>   "He was doing back flips, so it had to be a pretty positive thing
for the program next year.</TE>
<TE>   "You couldn't do a better presentation than to have an actual race
going on and have your driver win the race when you're talking about

<TE>   Tear 'Em Up</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway should have an oversized field of demolition
derby drivers Saturday night after Irwindale Speedway canceled its
similar race the same night to reconfigure its track barriers. Just
when stock car racing authorities are searching for better and safer
ideas for cars and tracks, Saturday night's program will showcase how
to best smash, crash and pummel cars. The last driver left with a car
that can move will receive $1,000 for surviving.</TE>
<TE>   Perris will also have Figure 8 racing, which at times can be as
destructive as a demolition derby. It also is going another wild step
further with its pick-a-part cruiser class, which features two
drivers--one to control the steering wheel and brakes, the other the
accelerator.</TE>
<TE>   For purists, there will also be legitimate racing on the half-mile
clay oval with super stocks and street stocks.</TE>

<TE>   CART, apparently unable to find engine builders willing to provide
new 3.5 liter non-turbocharged engines for 2003, is expected to
announce a return to its current turbocharged engine rule for next
year. Honda, Ford and Toyota announced their intention of leaving
CART because of the change, leaving the sanctioning body with only
Judd Engineering as an engine supplier under the name MG. If CART
does an about-face and returns to 2.65 liter turbocharged engines,
they will be supplied by Ford Cosworth.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Sanchez, highly successful Miami race promoter, has been
named to the CART board of directors, replacing deposed president Joe
Heitzler.... Four-time national unlimited hydroplane champion Mark
Tate is coming out of a year's retirement to drive U-2 Miss Trendwest
in the Budweiser Unlimited Hydroplane series. The first event is
scheduled June 28-30 on the Ohio River at Evansville, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   The Sprint Car Racing Assn. will make its first appearance of the
year at Santa Maria Speedway on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Passings</TE>
<TE>   Jack DeArmond Sr., who raced sprint cars with the California
Racing Assn. in the 1960s and '70s, died Tuesday after suffering a
heart attack Saturday night at Perris Auto Speedway. DeArmond, 67,
was stricken moments after watching his son, Jack Jr., win a Sprint
Car Racing Assn. heat.</TE>
<TE>   Services for stock car driver John Baker will be held Saturday at
10 a.m. at St. Pius Catholic Church in Tucson. Baker's survivors
include his wife, Robin, and twin 16-month-old boys, John Jr. and
Jason. The family is requesting that, in lieu of flowers, donations
be made to Motor Racing Outreach, Smith Tower, Suite 405, 5565
Concord Parkway South, Concord, N.C. 28027.</TE>

<LD>While the NBA Finals got boffo ratings in Los Angeles--Game 4 got a
34.0 rating with a 54 share here--nationally the Lakers' four-game
sweep of the New Jersey Nets was a bust.</LD>
<LD>   The four games averaged a national rating of 10.2, which is the
lowest rating for an NBA Finals since the league went to a live,
prime-time format 20 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   The rating in 1981, when CBS tape-delayed the weeknight coverage
until 11:30 p.m., was a 6.7. The Boston Celtics beat the Houston
Rockets in six games that year.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, the NBA Finals have been televised live and in prime
time.</TE>
<TE>   This year's 10.2--with a 19 share--is down 17% from the first four
games of last year's five-game series with Philadelphia, which
averaged a 12.3/23. The five-game average last year was a 12.1/22.</TE>
<TE>   The four games averaged a 31.8/51 in Los Angeles, which is
slightly lower than the 33.2/54 for last year's Finals against
Philadelphia but higher than the 31.2/50 for the six-game series
against Indiana two years ago.</TE>

<HD>49ers Acquire McNown in Trade With Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Francisco 49ers think they have a good eye for quarterback
talent, and they still see something in Cade McNown.</LD>
<LD>   McNown, a former first-round draft pick who was a spectacular
failure with the Chicago Bears, was traded by the Miami Dolphins to
San Francisco on Thursday for a conditional seventh-round draft pick
in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   McNown was reviled by Chicago's fans during two tumultuous
seasons, and he never got off the bench last season with the
Dolphins. None of it mattered to the 49ers, who believe the former
UCLA star still can be a quality NFL quarterback.</LD>
<TE>   "This is an opportunity to take a good look at a player we liked a
great deal several years ago," General Manager and former UCLA coach
Terry Donahue said. "We'd like to see if that potential is still
there, and whether we could develop it."</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers also signed defensive tackle Jim Flanigan to a two-year,
$1.4-million contract that includes a $100,000 signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Donahue recruited McNown in the last years of his two decades as
the Bruins' coach, but that familiarity wasn't the reason for the
trade. The team's brain trust, including Bill Walsh and Coach Steve
Mariucci, wants to see if McNown can be effective in the 49ers' West
Coast offense.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of guys taken in the first round at that
position that haven't been successful," Donahue said. "There's lots
of reasons. Sometimes it's the player's fault, sometimes it's the
fit. I think I'll know more after Cade has had a chance to be in our
system and work with our coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Donahue left UCLA after McNown's freshman season. McNown was a
four-year starter, setting the Pacific 10 Conference record for total
offense as well as several school records.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking forward to my opportunity with the 49ers," McNown
said in a statement issued by Miami. "I know I can be a quality
player in the league, and I hope I get a chance to show that in San
Francisco."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Terrell Davis was back on the practice field, only three weeks
after knee surgery. The injury-plagued Denver Bronco running back
initially didn't expect to be back until the start of training camp
after having arthroscopic surgery on his left knee May 20. But after
running on the side without pain on Tuesday, Davis decided to test
out the knee on the fourth day of the five-day mini camp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Steelers agreed to a one-year, $775,000 contract
with Terance Mathis, a 12-year veteran who led the Atlanta Falcons in
receiving last season with 51 catches and 564 yards. The team also
gave running back Amos Zereoue a three-year contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   A police officer has been indicted on charges he interfered with
the investigation into the fatal shooting at the home of former NBA
star Jayson Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Allena, a Bridgewater Township police officer, was charged
with second-degree official misconduct and third-degree tampering
with witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   His lawyer, Steven Lieberman, said Allena was innocent and "looks
forward to proving it."</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Allena, who joined the Bridgewater force in 1998,
was suspended without pay after he turned himself in and surrendered
his weapon. He was freed after posting $10,000 bail.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say Allena, a friend of Williams, was off duty when he
went to the Alexandria Township mansion on Feb. 14, just hours after
Costas "Gus" Christofi was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutor Steven Lember said Allena got access to the crime scene
and told witnesses not to give information to investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear wide receiver David Terrell was charged with
misdemeanor simple battery after an argument with parking attendants,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell and two other men allegedly argued with parking attendants
outside a downtown nightclub and some punches were thrown, police
spokesman Ozzie Rodriguez said. One attendant was struck in the face
but did not seek medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Two men with Terrell also were charged with the misdemeanor,
Rodriguez said. Terrell posted $100 bail and was released about six
hours later, according to police spokeswoman Laura Kubiak.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lewis, fired earlier in the week after 20 years as a track
coach at the University of Pittsburgh, issued a statement condemning
what he called "racial and gender hate" and "dollar mongers" at the
school.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, who was let go Monday, joined Pitt as an assistant coach in
1982. He was the women's coach for 18 years and the men's coach for
eight, coaching three NCAA champions, 58 NCAA All-Americans and 103
Big East Conference champions.</TE>
<TE>   "The only stipulation I put on myself when I decided to coach on
the college level ... was to never be like them. Who are they? They
are the people who are insensitive to the needs and particulars of
young people. They are the greedy. They are the dollar mongers. They
are the users of flesh. They are clearly self-serving," he said in
the statement.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Sanderford resigned as women's basketball coach at Nebraska,
citing poor health and a desire to help his family and the school.
Sanderford said he was advised by his doctors that he needed to have
a change in lifestyle. He refused to comment on his ailment.... Kevin
McGuff, a Notre Dame assistant for the last six years, was introduced
as the new women's basketball coach at Xavier University. McGuff, 32,
takes over for Melanie Balcomb, who left two weeks ago to become head
coach at Vanderbilt.</TE>
<TE>   Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong maintained the overall
lead in the Dauphine Libere cycling race as Patrice Halgand of France
won the fourth stage of the competition. Armstrong, who leads
American Floyd Landis by 16 seconds, is using the competition to
train for the Tour de France, which starts July 6.</TE>
<TE>   The weeklong 683.5-mile race ends Sunday in Geneva, Switzerland.
Today's fifth stage is a 126.5-mile run from Digne-Les-Bains to
Grenoble.</TE>

<DH>NHL: After Red Wings beat Carolina, 3-1, to clinch Stanley
Cup, coach announces his retirement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Scotty Bowman kept his secret as long as he could and the best team
money could buy made sure his last game as coach won him a Stanley
Cup championship.</LD>
<LD>   "I made up my mind in February that this was going to be my last
year," said Bowman, who announced his retirement after the Detroit
Red Wings finished off the Carolina Hurricanes, 3-1, to clinch the
best-of-seven series Thursday night in front of a sellout crowd of
20,058 at Joe Louis Arena. "In other years, I was never sure, but
after the Olympic break, I knew it was time."</LD>
<LD>   Brendan Shanahan scored two goals, Steve Yzerman had two assists
and Dominik Hasek made 16 saves for the Red Wings, who defeated the
Hurricanes in five games and gave Bowman his ninth Stanley Cup
championship as a coach, which moved him ahead of his mentor Toe
Blake for the most in NHL history.</LD>
<TE>   "I have had a career that I never thought I'd ever have, and it
means a lot for me to leave on a winning note," said Bowman, 68, the
only coach to register more than 1,000 victories in the regular
season and playoffs combined.</TE>
<TE>   For the Red Wings, Thursday's victory completes a dream season,
especially for veterans such as Hasek, Luc Robitaille and Steve
Duchesne, who played on a Stanley Cup championship team for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit and its $65-million payroll dominated the league from
start to finish. The Red Wings won the President's Trophy for having
the best record during the regular season and went 16-7 in the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   After losing Game 1 at home to Carolina in the finals, Detroit won
four in a row to win its third Stanley Cup title in six years and
10th in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be up there with some of the greatest teams," said Red
Wing defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy,
awarded to the most valuable player of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think looking back at last summer when we got ... some really
talented players. It was just a matter of getting everything working
together as a team and as a group. That clicked right away. I thought
that first week in the regular season we played as a team and we have
been doing that throughout the whole regular season, and that carried
through the playoffs as well."</TE>
<TE>   After a scoreless first period, the Red Wings broke the game open
in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Winger Tomas Holmstrom knocked in his first goal of the series on
a gritty score from in front of the net. Holmstrom, who has a history
of scoring big goals in the playoffs, was in the right spot to score
off an assist from Igor Larionov at 4:07.</TE>
<TE>   With nearly 11 minutes remaining in the period, fans at Joe Louis
Arena began to chant "Hasek, Hasek, Hasek" after the Detroit
goaltender stopped several point-blank chances by the Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Carolina's Bates Battaglia seemed primed to tie the score with a
wide-open shot from the slot, but Hasek was able to recover in time
to make the save, which prompted the cheers.</TE>
<TE>   Minutes after Hasek's save on Battaglia, the Red Wings stretched
their lead to 2-0 when Shanahan scored on a power play at 14:04. The
key to the score was a pass from Sergei Fedorov, who found Shanahan
open inside the right circle. The veteran winger beat Carolina goalie
Arturs Irbe with his second goal of the series and seventh of the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Shanahan, however, also played a role in Carolina's goal. With
Detroit playing with a man-advantage, Shanahan picked up a tripping
penalty and was still in the box when the Hurricanes' Jeff O'Neill
scored a power-play goal with 1:10 remaining in the period to cut
Detroit's lead to 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Over the final 20 minutes, Detroit did not give Carolina much room
to work. Shanahan clinched the victory, scoring an empty-net goal
with 45 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "For the most part, we played with them," Carolina captain Ron
Francis said. "We played them hard. If we had a couple of breaks
early in the series, there may have been a different outcome. But
they are a great team. They are deep with a ton of skill and a lot of
playoff experience. You just don't rattle them."</TE>
<TE>   A huge part of the Red Wings' success was the play of Hasek, who
will finally get his name on the Stanley Cup after losing in the
finals with Buffalo in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "I chose this organization for two things," said Hasek, who is
considering retirement. "Because I believed that this team, with my
help, was good enough to be the best in the NHL; and the other thing
was because I wanted to go to the city where the people like hockey.</TE>
<TE>   "When Brendan Shanahan scored that third goal, I was so thrilled.
So happy. I tried to stay focused for the final seconds left.... I
have never seen such an exciting building like this for a final
minute of the game."</TE>
<TE>   For Bowman, it was a perfect ending to a Hall of Fame career.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that I probably enjoy more than the 10 Cups, nine as a
coach and the other as a director of personnel, is that I never got
fired as a coach," said Bowman, the league's all-time leader for most
wins in the Stanley Cup finals with 36.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that's my proudest moment.... I feel good about that."</TE>

<HD>Devils Fire Constantine, Hire Burns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hanging around with George Steinbrenner is starting to rub off on Lou
Lamoriello.</LD>
<LD>   The boss of the New Jersey Devils is now just as quick on the draw
as Steinbrenner when it comes to dumping coaches who don't succeed.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Constantine became Lamoriello's latest victim on Thursday,
when he was fired and replaced by Pat Burns, just over a month after
the team was eliminated in the first round of the NHL playoffs.</LD>
<TE>   "The personality of our organization is not to wait," said
Lamoriello, who hired Constantine to replace Larry Robinson in
January. "We have raised the bar. We expect to win, and that's on
everyone."</TE>
<TE>   The coaching switch is the fourth in four years for the Devils,
who won the Stanley Cup in 2000 and came within a game of repeating
the following season.</TE>
<TE>   Lamoriello said the six-game loss to Carolina in the first round
of the playoffs this year was just one factor in his decision to make
the change. He indicated Constantine did not get enough out of the
talent on the Devil roster.</TE>
<TE>   It's the same type of justification Steinbrenner used with the New
York Yankees when he had a managerial merry-go-round in the 1970s and
'80s.</TE>
<TE>   As the chief executive for YankeeNets, the corporation that runs
the Devils and New Jersey Nets of the NBA, Lamoriello and
Steinbrenner work together.</TE>
<TE>   A three-time NHL coach of the year, Burns has not been behind the
bench since being fired by the Boston Bruins eight games into the
2000-01 season.</TE>
<TE>   He takes over a club that finished sixth in the Eastern Conference
at 41-28-9-4.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is a whole lot to clean up here," said Burns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It looks like Ron Francis will be back for another season as the
captain of the Carolina Hurricanes.</TE>
<TE>   Francis scored 77 points in leading the Hurricanes to their first
Stanley Cup finals, but next season is the option year of a five-year
deal he signed in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The 39-year-old center is in line to get $2 million to play, or $1
million if he retires.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I have to talk to Jimmy, but I would like to," Francis said
Thursday night when asked if he will be back for the 2002-03 season,
which would be his 22nd.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Rutherford, the team's general manager, said the two would get
together next week to begin contract talks.</TE>
<TE>   "He said as soon as the games were done we would sit down and
talk, so that's good news, I'm glad to hear that," Rutherford said.</TE>

<KH>U.S. OPEN BETHPAGE BLACK COURSE</KH>
<HD>Woods Can Hack It</HD>
<DH>Golf: With a birdie on his last hole, favorite shoots a 67
for a one-shot lead over Garcia. Course lives up to pre-tournament
hype with average score of almost 75.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The rivalry that was supposed to have been launched three years ago
at Medinah when Sergio Garcia whacked a six-iron off the base of a
tree trunk and chased Tiger Woods down a fairway and then down the
stretch has maybe, just maybe, picked up where it left off.</LD>
<LD>   At Thursday's opening round of the 102nd U.S. Open at Bethpage
Black, Woods made a 20-foot birdie putt on his last hole, No. 9 in
the split-tee format, to take a one-shot lead over Garcia on a day
when very few golfers saw red.</LD>
<LD>   Woods finished at three-under-par 67 and could consider it almost
a masterpiece on a coarse course on which only six golfers out of 156
starters finished under par.</LD>
<TE>   Garcia, who played in the morning, shot two-under 68. It appeared
he and Woods were going to share the first-round lead until Woods
rolled in his birdie putt in the twilight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always nice to end on a birdie, I don't care how bad a day
you had," Woods said. "For some reason, you end on a birdie, you
sleep that much better.''</TE>
<TE>   The only other players who finished under par were Jeff Maggert,
K.J. Choi, Billy Mayfair and Dudley Hart, all at one-under 69.</TE>
<TE>   Among those lurking at even par were Phil Mickelson and Nick
Faldo, with 12 only four shots off the lead at one over.</TE>
<TE>   The notables at 71 include Jose Maria Olazabal, Tom Lehman, Jean
Van de Velde and Davis Love III.</TE>
<TE>   "I hung in there," said Woods, who had five birdies and two
bogeys. "I grinded my way around all day. The golf course was playing
really difficult today. I tried to stay out of trouble as much as I
possibly could and when I did I just hacked it out and tried to make
par the old-fashioned way."</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it be something if Woods and Garcia could actually make
this rivalry thing go the second time around?</TE>
<TE>   At the 1999 PGA Championship, the 23-year-old Woods held off the
19-year-old Garcia by one shot to claim his second major title.</TE>
<TE>   Since, Woods has won five more majors while Garcia still is
looking for his first.</TE>
<TE>   You still need two to tango and two to make a rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   Golf seemed desperate at the time to anoint a challenger to Woods'
dominance, but Garcia has only talked a good game since.</TE>
<TE>   With three rounds remaining, Garcia has positioned himself nicely.</TE>
<TE>   "I was able to scramble around and save some good pars," he said.
"I was happy with that. I've got to keep it going."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia may have the country karma going for him this week, as his
performance stood tall in the face of Spain's splendid play in the
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Not that Garcia has time to break down his country's dominance in
winning Group B.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not thinking about Raul's goals, or any of those guys,"
Garcia said of the Spanish soccer team. "I'm thinking about scoring
my own goals."</TE>
<TE>   You might call it a wild first day on Bethpage Black, where
players struggled to come to grips with their grips on a treacherous
course lined with 40,000 mostly boisterous New Yorkers.</TE>
<TE>   Woods had the largest following, and was somewhat shocked when he
was cheered uproariously upon emerging from a portable toilet between
the 14th and 15th holes.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Are you clapping because I'm potty-trained?' " Woods
related.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was not immune to the tough conditions, but he fought his
way to the first-round lead thanks largely to his touch on the
greens. He needed only 28 putts on 18 holes and said it was the best
he has felt near the cup since his April win at the Masters, when he
didn't three-putt until Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is certainly a difficult course," Woods said, "and you have
to stay as patient as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Woods had to do his share of scrambling. He broke his three-wood
on the practice tee Wednesday and banished it to his bag on No. 7
after hearing the supposedly repaired club rattle like a cheap toy.
Woods hit a toned-down driver.</TE>
<TE>   How tough was it out there?</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen players shot 80 or higher, while only six broke par. There
were 771 bogeys. The average score was 74.878.</TE>
<TE>   The par-four, 479-yard 16th proved to be the most difficult,
playing to an average of 4.57 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Hale Irwin, a three-time U.S. Open winner who is playing this year
thanks to a special USGA exemption, shot 12-over 82.</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, 57, said he would be back to hack out another round today.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the good part of being a senior," he said. "You forget
things real quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Justin Leonard was cruising at one under until he hit a
triple-bogey speed bump on the par-four 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Love, considered one of this week's favorites, was three under
after nine holes but soon found himself one over after three-putting
No. 15 for bogey and making double bogey on No. 16.</TE>
<TE>   You could say his round went sort of haywire, the emphasis on hay.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great golf course to get to play, and when they mow the
rough, it'll be even better," Love said.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Retief Goosen got mowed under with a 79. David
Duval shot a 78.</TE>
<TE>   Believe it or not, it could have been worse.</TE>
<TE>   Overnight showers dampened the course and softened the fairways
and greens. With little wind, Bethpage Black was as benign as it's
likely going to get.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as hard a U.S. Open as I've played, and that's given we
played in perfect conditions," said Mickelson, still seeking his
first major title. "The fairways are as tight as I've seen; the rough
is as thick and as penalizing as I've seen."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson predicted if the weather cleared and the winds started
blowing that this weekend's champion might finish at eight or nine
over par.</TE>
<TE>   The weekend weather, mercifully, is supposed to be wet.</TE>
<TE>   "Even under these conditions, over par will most likely win,"
Mickelson said.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Mickelson made the prediction before Woods closed shop
with his 67.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps only Woods will finish in the red.</TE>
<TE>   Or, better yet, maybe someone will step up to the challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio?</TE>

<HD>Teenager Tolan Has a Lot of Nerves</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE and THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FARMINGDALE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>At 16, Derek Tolan was never going to shoot his age at his first U.S.
Open, but his eight-over 78 Thursday wasn't bad for openers.</LD>
<LD>   Heck, Tolan finished four shots better than three-time Open winner
Hale Irwin.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Tolan acknowledged being as scared as a kid on his
first prom date.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't think I was going to be all that nervous, but you could
just watch the tapes, I was walking funny," Tolan said. "I was so
nervous, I forgot how to breathe. Yeah, I was real nervous."</TE>
<TE>   Tolan had eight bogeys, one double bogey, nine pars and a birdie.
He even hit eight of 14 fairways.</TE>
<TE>   Tolan had enthusiastic support from the fans following his group.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed it a ton," he said. "It helped me out a lot. It made me
concentrate a lot more too."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Golf Digest handed out "Be Nice to Monty" buttons this week in
anticipation of potential trouble between New York golf fans and
Colin Montgomerie, the often picked-upon Scot.</TE>
<TE>   But Montgomerie reported no major problems with the gallery in
Thursday's first round.</TE>
<TE>   Now, his golf game was another story. Montgomerie bogeyed three of
the last four holes for a 75.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd?</TE>
<TE>   "Fine, fine," Montgomerie said at his locker. "I wish Monty was
nicer to himself and holed some putts."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some golfers turn to their sports psychologist for advice on
handling pressure, but Sergio Garcia has the luxury of turning to his
girlfriend, tennis star Martina Hingis.</TE>
<TE>   "It does help," Garcia said. "As you all know, she's in a very
similar position to me. She knows what I'm going through.... To me,
it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to be able to talk to
somebody that understands that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been called the People's Open, because Bethpage Black is a
public course, but the 42,500 fans are finding heightened security
measures because of the events of Sept. 11 and the proximity to
Manhattan, some 35 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   No cars are allowed in Bethpage State Park except for those
belonging to players, tournament officials and security personnel.
Most of the fans are carried on buses to the site and pat-downs are a
regular occurrence. No bags, backpacks or cell phones are allowed on
the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are electronically scanned at the entrances and what seems
like miles of green fencing closes off prohibited areas.</TE>
<TE>   "The security we have in place for the week is definitely enhanced
from what we've had in the past," said Marty Parkes of the U.S. Golf
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Fleisher, who qualified for the Open by winning the U.S.
Senior Open, withdrew, a move that was criticized by another senior
player who remained in the field.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not the best way to handle it," said Irwin, who also said
Fleisher let down the senior tour players. Fleisher said before his
withdrawal that Bethpage Black was too long for him and that he
couldn't play it.</TE>
<TE>   "He can play it," Irwin said. "He is the Senior Open champion. If
the [USGA] didn't want that category [for exemption] they wouldn't
put it in there."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin, 57, didn't exactly have a banner day in his 33rd U.S. Open.
He shot a 12-over 82--his worst round in 120 rounds at the Open.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very, very long day," he said. "The end of the story.
I'm not really ready to high-tail it out of town just yet."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Irwin compared the conditions at Bethpage Black with those of
Winged Foot in 1974--considered to be the toughest U.S. Open setup of
all time.</TE>
<TE>   "The rough at Winged Foot was long and wiry, and this is thicker,"
he said. "This is just a large golf course. At Winged Foot, the
greens were a little more difficult to putt. They had more contour."</TE>
<TE>   Irwin won the first of his three U.S. Open titles at Winged Foot
with a score of seven-over 287.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Andy Miller, son of NBC analyst Johnny Miller, shot six-over 76.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad, all things considered.</TE>
<TE>   "After the first couple of holes, I felt pretty good," Andy Miller
said. "I got over my nerves. I hit the ball great."</TE>
<TE>   It was the putting "yips" that drove Johnny Miller off the PGA
Tour, and son Andy had his share of problems.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could have just avoided my three-putts, I shoot three over
and that's a good round, I'm right there," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's money in those merchandise tents. The USGA projects sales
of more than $5 million by the end of the week.</TE>

<HD>Albacore Bite Is Sporadic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Schools of albacore are being found in many areas south of San Diego,
but with class still in session, the passenger loads remain
surprisingly light.</LD>
<LD>   "Business has been so-so, not spectacular but not bad," says John
Yamate, manager of Seaforth Sportfishing. "A lot of people are busy
with graduation right now and, basically, people just aren't in
vacation mode yet."</LD>
<LD>   If any of the students get a party-boat trip as a graduation gift,
they can expect a bite ranging from slow to very good.</LD>
<TE>   Seaforth's Legend, at an area 50 miles south of the landing, was
one of the top boats Thursday, with 50 fish aboard by noon and more
biting.</TE>
<TE>   The sporadic nature of the bite is typical so early in the season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The West Coast's embattled rockfish fishery will be a top item of
discussion during next week's Pacific Fishery Management Council
meetings in San Francisco. And things don't look good for
sportfishermen.</TE>
<TE>   The council is considering various restrictions, the worst-case
being a total closure from Canada to Mexico of the fishery in waters
deeper than 60 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "If anything close to that happens, the guys won't be able to make
a living; it'll put us out of business," says John Shull, skipper of
the Pacific Dawn out of Capt. Hook's Sportfishing in Oxnard. "Next
year at this time I might have to become a dive boat, but with the
other closures they're talking about [proposed closures within the
Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary] I won't even be able to
drop anchor because even that won't be allowed."</TE>
<TE>   The council isn't expected to formally adopt new management
measures until September. The California Fish and Game Commission,
meanwhile, is expected to adopt a Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan
in late August. The NFMP will probably incorporate PFMC restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The saltwater sportfishing community is mourning the death of
Capt. Manny Silva, whose career in San Diego spanned more than 50
years.</TE>
<TE>   Silva, who started as a deckhand in 1938 aboard the Mascot III and
went on to skipper that vessel and several others, died Saturday of
cancer. He was 88.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Kathy, his son, Phil, two sisters and
a grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be held Monday at 10 a.m. at Sacred Heart Church of
Ocean Beach. The family asks, in lieu of flowers, donations be made
to the American Cancer Society.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, fishing is overshadowed by other events on the water.
On a recent charter trip to Catalina, Capt. Danny Strunk of the
vessel Pierpoint said his passengers were greeted by two humpback
whales in mid-channel.</TE>
<TE>   Strunk shut his engines down to give his wide-eyed customers some
solitude, but that was shattered when one of the whales started
breeching, or launching itself out of the water and splashing down
only 50 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   The other whale, even closer, started violently slapping its
fluke, or tail, showering the passengers with water.</TE>
<TE>   Strunk realized that the whales were after a large school of
baitfish that had taken refuge beneath the boat and decided enough
was enough.</TE>
<TE>   "They were just so gosh darned close to the boat--uncomfortably
close, so I said it was time to leave," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday off Dana Point, Strunk received a visit from a small
pod of killer whales.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A nonlethal shark attack three weeks ago off Florida--the first of
the season--had experts pulling out all the stops in hopes of
avoiding the mass hysteria generated by a media frenzy last summer
after a series of similar attacks.</TE>
<TE>   University of Florida researchers who compile the International
Shark Attack File, for example, said you're in far more danger around
the house or even in the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   In an e-mail to environmental reporters this week, the file said
that in 1996 "thousands of times more Americans got hurt by ladders
(138,894), toilets (43,687) or room deodorizers (2,559) than got
injured or killed by sharks that year (18)."</TE>

<TE>   Yosemite National Park announced it is offering interpretive
ranger-led walks and talks at no charge throughout the summer.
Details: (209) 372-0296 (voice), (209) 372-4726 (teletype terminal).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some of Yosemite's visitors are probably covering their eyes,
thanks to the dirty work of an alleged tagger.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Trevino of Riverside was charged last week with 43 counts
of trying "to destroy, injure, deface, or damage property or real
property," according to the complaint filed by park officials on June
3.</TE>
<TE>   Though cleanup efforts are underway, graffiti still stains rocks,
trees, buildings, vehicles and signs in the Camp 6 area, as well as
in the Housekeeping Camp, Ahwahnee Hotel and Camp Curry areas.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino was arraigned and released on $5,000 bond pending his next
court date.</TE>

<HD>It's More Than Sheer Thrills for Hill</HD>

<LD>Lynn Hill was 13 when she caught her first glimpse of majestic
Yosemite Valley and, by her account, the view "stunned me like no
other landscape before."</LD>
<LD>   She had no idea at the time that she would be forever drawn to
Yosemite National Park, and to other places in the world where
towering rock walls were part of the landscape.</LD>
<LD>   Nor did Hill realize that years later, in 1993, she would stun the
climbing world by becoming the only person, man or woman, to perform
a "free ascent" of the treacherous "Nose" route on the face of El
Capitan. During a span of four days, she negotiated 3,000 feet of
sheer and even overhanging rock, using only her hands and feet.</LD>
<TE>   It was an amazing feat, as anyone who has gazed up at the awesome
mass of granite might conclude. Though she had ropes and a belaying
partner to catch her if she fell, the petite woman who harbors within
a colossal amount of will and determination, made it to the top
without any support from her gear.</TE>
<TE>   More amazing, Hill returned a year later and negotiated the same
route, again using only her hands and feet, in only 23 hours. It was
an intense climb completed in the dark of night, and it left her
trembling with fatigue, spent mentally and physically.</TE>
<TE>   In her words, "My mind swirled in an otherworldly state, yet I
felt an underlying sense of peace and serenity. In my dreamlike
trance, I knew it was not possible to comprehend all that I had just
experienced on that journey. In fact, it has taken me years to fully
digest what took place that day."</TE>
<TE>   What took place was the climax of a globe-trotting career that
began not long after Hill--who grew up in Fullerton--and her family
made their first camping trip to Yosemite, when the view from the
other side of the Wawona tunnel opened her eyes to a vertical world
in which she would excel like few others.</TE>
<TE>   So implausible was her free ascent of the Nose--the route is
daunting even for experienced "aid" climbers who rely on pitons,
cams, bolts, and such to support their weight and assist their upward
progress--that Hill was left with nothing else to prove.</TE>
<TE>   So, she sat down and wrote a book.</TE>
<TE>   "Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World" (W.W. Norton,
$24.95), tells the story of a woman who became immersed in her sport
to the point where it was the driving force in her life. But it also
provides an inside look at the rock-climbing community and some of
its more interesting characters, leaving readers with a greater
understanding of an obscure sport that instills such passion among
its athletes.</TE>
<TE>   For Hill, solving problems on the rocks "has to do with feeling
more alive, doing the best we can by learning from our mistakes, and
constantly seeking to achieve a higher level of consciousness, and by
taking care of our bodies and our minds."</TE>
<TE>   She has been spider-like pretty much since birth. In her baby
diary reads a passage, "Lynn climbs the monkey bars like a pro."</TE>
<TE>   As a young teenager, having been introduced to rock climbing by
her brother and sister, Bob and Kathy, and by her sister's boyfriend,
Chuck Bludworth, Hill made her way up routes even the veteran male
climbers had trouble with.</TE>
<TE>   It was a humbling for them, in that not only was Hill a girl, she
was a bug of a girl--she eventually topped out at an even 5 feet and
weighs only 100 pounds--with no experience and perceived to be too
short to reach the holds necessary to ascend such routes.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost from the first days when 'Little Lynnie' tied into a rope,
the common refrain was, 'Who the hell is that girl?' " recalls John
Long, a renowned climber, in the foreword chapter of her book. "The
macho ones among us ... were left to watch and weep as Lynn breezed
over what often cost us several layers of skin and a few of our nine
lives.</TE>
<TE>   "We normally would have growled like wolves at having our male
luster dimmed by a woman. But Lynn shattered the gender barrier so
thoroughly that no one could put the pieces back together again."</TE>
<TE>   Hill got her start, as many local climbers do, crawling up the
faces of rocks jutting from the desert floor within sprawling Joshua
Tree National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Deeply affected by the divorce of her parents, she came to
consider her weekend forays "as a life raft, and the act of climbing
as therapy."</TE>
<TE>   The life raft supported many like Hill; they clung to it as
fiercely as they clung to the sides of 1,000-foot cliffs; they felt
more at home in such an environment than in their actual homes.</TE>
<TE>   "What began as a small group of friends expanded into a community
of people from all walks of life," Hill writes. "Quite a few were
students majoring in esoteric fields like astrophysics, math and
archaeology. There were also a lot of unemployed vagabonds, and even
a few whose lives hovered on the fringe of legality."</TE>
<TE>   Long was founder of a 1970s clan called the Stonemasters, "a loose
collective of incredibly fit, daring and talented Californians who
led the world in rock climbing during the 1970s," Hill explains. "The
name said it all: mastery over the stone, and mastery over being
stoned."</TE>
<TE>   At Yosemite's Camp Four, a seasonal mecca for climbers, collecting
aluminum cans for cash provided a meager existence that also involved
siphoning gas from cars of tourists and plucking food from abandoned
trays in the cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   The unkempt climbers were (and still are) looked at by tourists in
much the same way as Yosemite's bears: They were given a wide berth
but at the same time provided entertainment as they dangled from the
faces of towering granite monoliths.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's first trip up the Nose was an aid ascent in 1979 with Mari
Gingery, another of only a few female climbers on the Yosemite scene,
and Dean Fidelman. Loaded with pitons, carabiners, slings and ropes,
and with a stuff sack carrying sleeping bags, food and water, they
began their ascent with the plan of alternating the lead on each
pitch, a section of rock between belay points, no more than the
length of one rope.</TE>
<TE>   Fidelman developed a serious case of vertigo about 500 feet up and
chose to follow the lead of his female companions. "We slept [on
ledges] still wearing our harnesses, the rope tying us to the bolt
anchors in the wall above the ledge--just in case someone rolled
overboard or went sleepwalking," Hill writes.</TE>
<TE>   One of El Capitan's most challenging features is the Great Roof, a
smooth wave-like outcropping that seemed impassable to free climbers.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, no climber in the world imagined that such a feature
could be free-climbed," Hill explains.</TE>
<TE>   No climber, perhaps, but Hill. She was starting to imagine it as
she made her way up and over the Great Roof, resting back on her
ropes, probing narrow cracks with her tiny fingers, storing mental
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Their three-day journey was successful; it was a route Hill would
complete eight times in all, the last two being the free ascents.</TE>
<TE>   Between these ascents, Hill traveled frequently, climbing anywhere
and everywhere--the Gunks, New York; Verdon Gorge, France; Taipan
Wall, Australia ...</TE>
<TE>   During her U.S. travels, Hill worked odd jobs and enrolled in
small colleges while working toward an eventual bachelor's degree in
biology.</TE>
<TE>   In her book, which was co-authored by Greg Child, she tells of the
people who influenced her life.</TE>
<TE>   There was Bludworth, her sister's fiance, who perished climbing
Argentina's Mt. Aconcagua, at 22,000 feet the tallest peak in South
America.</TE>
<TE>   There was Long, during the '70s and early '80s one of the world's
top rock climbers, for years her boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   There was John Yablonsky, or Yabo, a troubled soul whose obsession
with Hill, who wanted to be only friends, prompted him to threaten
suicide more than once. Yabo, who survived so many daredevil climbs
on the rocks, eventually followed through on his threat.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Russ Raffa, a strong East Coast climber and the man
Hill married. They drifted apart, however, during Hill's hectic days
on Europe's World Cup climbing circuit.</TE>
<TE>   Hill dominated the World Cup, winning often enough to afford a
home in France.</TE>
<TE>   But competing on man-made arena walls eventually got stale. In
1992, the North Face climbing team member decided to return to the
U.S. and "to the cliffs that nature had made."</TE>
<TE>   There was one cliff in particular. "Freeing" the Nose of El
Capitan was the most obvious challenge. If anyone could do it, it was
Hill.</TE>
<TE>   And while the three-day ascent was fulfilling, the 23-hour ascent,
a feat that might never be matched, was overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   In the final chapter of her book, Hill recalls that for several
months afterward, "I fell into a state of post-climax depression that
left me feeling aimless and empty."</TE>
<TE>   Today, at 41 and living in Moab, Utah, the feeling is much the
same.</TE>
<TE>   "Writing this book was kind of like putting a cap on my restless
life," Hill says, with a hint of sadness. "Not that I'll ever get
over my interest to travel, or my curiosity and playfulness and
climbing itself. I'm not ever going to leave climbing behind. But I
crave more stability in my life. A home. A family. I've always
thought I'd like to have a kid or two."</TE>

<LD>Four over-the-air channels, plus Fox Sports Net, will provide live
television coverage of today's Laker celebration and victory parade
in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   A ceremony at City Hall featuring Mayor James Hahn and other city
officials will begin at 10:30 a.m., with Laker players and coaches
scheduled to arrive at 11.</LD>
<LD>   The principals then will be taken to Third and Figueroa streets
for the start of the parade at 11:30. The parade, scheduled to last 1
hour 40 minutes, will go down Figueroa to Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Eleven double-decker buses carrying the players will travel the
route, said Staples Center spokesman Michael Roth.</TE>
<TE>   The celebration at Staples Center is scheduled to begin at 12:50
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are expecting about a million fans.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 9, the Lakers' over-the-air flagship station, and Channel
7 will go on the air at 10 a.m. Channel 11 and Fox Sports Net will
begin coverage at 10:30.</TE>
<TE>   Channel 4 will join in at 11, but because NBC's U.S. Open coverage
begins at noon, the NBC-owned station will cut away for two hours
before returning for more Laker coverage at 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Radio stations KLAC (570), KXTA (1150), KSPN (1110) and KMPC
(1540) will also be providing extensive coverage.</TE>

<HD>Winek Fired as Golf Coach at Valencia</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From staff reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Winek has been fired after 17 years as golf coach at Placentia
Valencia High.</LD>
<LD>   Winek, who started the boys' and girls' programs at Valencia, said
he was told the administration wanted to change the direction of the
program.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know a whole lot, because they didn't tell me much,"
Winek said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not the best way to end. No one likes to be told they aren't
wanted any more."</TE>
<TE>   School administrators did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia won nine Orange League boys' titles in Winek's 17 years
and qualified for the playoffs 16 consecutive years. His girls' teams
won the first three league titles.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia also won a Southern Section boys' championship in 1995,
the last time a team other than Santa Barbara San Marcos, Santa
Margarita or Palm Desert won the title.</TE>
<TE>   In other personnel moves:</TE>
<TE>   * Craig Griffin, a former assistant basketball coach at Simi
Valley High, has been selected boys' coach at Simi Valley Royal, and
Bill Dishon has been promoted to softball coach at Royal after
coaching the freshman-sophomore team.</TE>
<TE>   * Tom Crowther, 23, has been chosen baseball coach at Burbank
Burroughs, replacing Jose Valle, who resigned after nine seasons.
Crowther served as an assistant to Valle and was an all-league player
at Burroughs in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   * Monique Garciaparra has been promoted from assistant to varsity
coach of the girls' soccer program at Fullerton Troy. She is the
sister of Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.</TE>
<TE>   * Gerardo Gonzalez has been promoted to coach the Fountain Valley
baseball team, replacing Ron LaRuffa, who is retiring after 13
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   * Priscilla Zuniga has been hired as girls' soccer coach at Oxnard
Santa Clara, her alma mater.</TE>

<LD>It is 4:18 a.m. Thursday and a line of horn-honking cars with men and
women hanging out open windows waving Mexican flags is crawling into
the parking lot of the Pico Rivera Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   This is a traffic jam. In the middle of the night.</LD>
<LD>   The two-lane road leading into the arena is packed tighter than
the 405 freeway at rush hour, and the Mexico-Italy game is set to
start in 12 minutes.</LD>
<TE>   The people in the cars are antsy, chanting "Mex-i-co" out the
windows and craning necks to see where the parking lot is. A
big-screen television is set high in the corner of the arena. Stereo
speakers are all around. The TV broadcast booms through the parking
lot, a pregame show in Spanish to entertain the people stuck in cars.</TE>
<TE>   It might seem like all of Southern California has been consumed by
Laker three-peat, but there is room in the sporting heart for more.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, said a factory worker from East Los Angeles, he could have
watched the game at home. "But this is sports," Jose Batista says.
"We should be together for this, you know. What fun is screaming by
yourself?"</TE>
<TE>   A couple thousand Mexico fans seem to agree with Batista. Men in
their work clothes, women pushing baby strollers, teenagers with
faces painted red, white and green, run from their cars to the
concrete seats. A roar goes up as the ball is kicked.</TE>
<TE>   And when striker Jared Borgetti heads in Mexico's only goal in a
1-1 tie that gives Mexico a Group G-best 2-0-1 record and a place in
the second round, it feels as  if Borgetti made his move  right on
the bumpy, dusty dirt down below.</TE>
<TE>   Batista is right. This is better than home.</TE>
<TE>   A firecracker explodes. Drums beat. Flashlights light up the dark
night. It seems like everybody has a flag. "Mex-i-co!"</TE>
<TE>   World Cup fever had crept stealthily into our house in the middle
of the night, and ours is not a house of soccer fanatics. We had
heard of people who were taking all their vacation time so they could
stay up all night to watch soccer, then sleep all day. What a silly
thing to do, we thought.</TE>
<TE>   It is always fun to root for underdogs, and it didn't take a
soccer expert to know that Senegal beating defending champion France
was a pretty big upset.</TE>
<TE>   But there were Laker games to watch, a resurgent Angel team to
follow, a gutsy Dodger team to check on.</TE>
<TE>   But now we turned purposely to the games every night. Now we were
setting alarm clocks to make sure we didn't miss big games. When the
U.S. took a 3-1 lead over Portugal, there were screams in our house.
Now we are addicted. We couldn't miss U.S.-South Korea and even from
television, the guttural noise from the red-clothed hometown fans
draws the hair up from our arms. When the Koreans tie the score late
and do a rude group imitation of speed skaters--homage, they said
later, to the South Korean speedskater who felt cheated out of a gold
medal by Apolo Anton Ohno in Salt Lake City--it is confirmation that
athletes everywhere can be boorish. This is refreshing--and a little
scary.</TE>
<TE>   There is a strong anti-American feeling from the Korean crowd and
it is startling. Sometimes it's hard for Americans to understand how
much residents of other countries, as much as they like American
ways, really don't seem to like us very much.</TE>
<TE>   It is why all the columnists and commentators who mock the World
Cup, proclaiming proudly that we Americans have baseball, basketball,
football, hockey, golf, tennis, etc., and don't need this stinkin'
soccer, so badly miss the point.</TE>
<TE>   The point is that we should be part of something that so consumes
the rest of the world. Prisoners in Thailand riot for the right to
have TVs to watch this. And Thailand didn't even qualify.</TE>
<TE>   Driving home from Pico Rivera after the Mexico-Italy game, I got
off the freeway in Santa Ana along 17th Street. In every little taco
stand and doughnut shop, men and women were clustered around small TV
sets or gathered on the street listening to radios. They were hearing
postgame reports and discussions on who Mexico might play in the next
round. The U.S., maybe.</TE>
<TE>   So many of our sports--basketball, baseball, even football--are
becoming global and are being embraced by fans and participants who
aren't afraid of learning about something new. Joining in can be fun.
Listen to the voices of Laker fans. Look at their faces at today's
parade. They are from Mexico and Japan and Korea. They have learned
about the NBA and now they love it.</TE>
<TE>   If Mexico does play the U.S. in the next round, it wouldn't be
terrible to find out where Batista and his buddies decide to watch
the game and join them.</TE>

<HD>Steroid Use Is Growing Concern</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Health officials are worried statements by
Canseco, Caminiti may cause young athletes to turn to drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Public health officials are worried that admissions by two former
baseball league most valuable players about steroids will cause more
young athletes to risk dangerous side effects for a shortcut to a
career in professional sports.</LD>
<LD>   "Kids are seeing how, in the great American sport, home runs are
getting very long and pitches are getting faster because of steroids,
and they figure, 'Hey, why not use?' " said Gary Wadler, a New York
University medical professor noted for his ground-breaking work on
drug testing.</LD>
<LD>   Wadler said recent revelations by former sluggers Jose Canseco and
Ken Caminiti--who both said they used steroids during high points of
their careers--should be a strong incentive for major league owners
and players to quickly agree on random testing for steroids.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a baseball issue that has become a public health issue,"
Wadler said.</TE>
<TE>   Health officials say there is precedent for concern. The White
House Office of National Drug Control Policy reported that sales of
androstenedione, an over-the-counter steroid hormone marketed widely
as a dietary supplement, spiked fivefold after Mark McGwire
acknowledged taking the supplement during his record home run season
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Scientific tests have yet to conclusively rule on the safety of
androstenedione, but a consensus of the medical community is that
injecting or swallowing steroids in large doses or over long periods
of time can lead to several serious ailments, including liver tumors,
infertility, enlargement of the heart, depression and tendon
ruptures.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes use steroids to build muscle mass and help them recover
from strenuous workouts. They are illegal in the U.S. except for
those that have been prescribed--usually to cancer or AIDS
patients--for testosterone replacement. Other professional leagues,
including the NFL and NBA, prohibit steroids and test for them. Major
League Baseball does not.</TE>
<TE>   Calls for baseball to take steps toward eliminating steroid use
gained momentum from politicians this week. State Sen. Don Perata
(D-Oakland), is calling on the legislature to mandate random testing
of pro athletes who play in California. Also, Sen. Byron Dorgan
(D-N.D.) said he will hold a congressional hearing to explore the use
of steroids in baseball and other sports.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows how damaging use of these steroids are to
athletes' health," Dorgan said. "We've got an issue to face as a
country."</TE>
<TE>   Kate Malliarakis, director of demand reduction for the White House
Office of National Drug Control Policy, hopes the hearing, which
could be held as early as next week, helps educate.</TE>
<TE>   "This is absolutely a public health issue," she said. "There's no
one that is more of a hero to some kids than a sports role model.
This is a competitive society and athletes are looking for an edge.
[Steroids are] an edge, but it's a heck of a price to pay."</TE>
<TE>   Canseco in 1988 became the first major league player to hit 40
home runs and steal 40 bases in a season. Caminiti was the National
League MVP in 1996. Both are retired from baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Wadler and others hope active major league players are willing to
become role models for steroid policy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was done in the Olympics," said Wadler, whose work on testing
earned him the International Olympic Committee President's Prize.
"The elite athletes wanted their sport cleaned up and they applied
growing pressure until it was. This has to be a players' decision,
where they are saying, 'I don't want to risk shortening my life or
damaging my health and I want to play fair and square.' They should
aspire to play in a sport in which games are determined by skill and
ability, not by what drugs or cocktails of supplements are being
used."</TE>
<TE>   Testing for steroids is being discussed as part of baseball's
labor negotiations. Rob Manfred, baseball's executive vice president
for labor relations, said testing was mentioned twice within the last
week during collective bargaining meetings with the Players'
Association.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, owners submitted an 11-page policy plan to the union,
calling for all players to submit to three mandatory tests a year for
steroids and androstenedione.</TE>
<TE>   The Players' Association is weighing several factors, such as more
definitive information about steroid effects from the medical
community, an opinion on testing from the players, civil liberty
concerns, and the specific wording of the owners' proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The players' most pressing questions: Who tests, who has access to
the results, what is the punishment, and will there be a test for
human growth hormone, a muscle-building drug some players say already
is used in the league?</TE>
<TE>   A top union source said the players will be open to testing if two
things happen: They must be assured testing is confidential, and
first-time offenders cannot be suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Wadler said bringing major league owners and players together on a
testing plan might be complicated, but added, "In my opinion the game
is being defamed and there is rampant innuendo about who is using and
who isn't. There is only one way to know--test."</TE>
<TE>   Of particular concern to Wadler is that teenagers might get the
message that steroids help ease the path to a lucrative professional
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers say there is some evidence that effects on adults are
reversible when steroid use is stopped. But for adolescents, some
experts say there is an additional risk that can't be reversed:
Stunted growth caused by the premature closure of the growth plates
in long bones.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Stein, deputy director for the office of science policy at
the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said annual national surveys of
high school students since 1998 have highlighted two alarming
trends--a 50% increase in steroid use, and a 10% decline in the
perception of risk.</TE>
<TE>   "Why that is ... is not something we can comment on," Stein said.</TE>
<TE>   Top players such as Scott Moore, the Cypress High shortstop who
was the eighth player picked June 4 in baseball's draft, and
Camarillo High outfielder Delmon Young, widely considered the top
junior prospect in the nation, said they are not steroid users nor
are they aware of use by teammates or opponents.</TE>
<TE>   But steroids are a raging topic, even on high school fields.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone should be putting an asterisk next to the recent
records because of steroids," said Ryan Braun, Granada Hills High's
shortstop. "Something needs to be done. If they can turn an average
player into an All-Star, then I think a lot of players may do
steroids."</TE>
<TE>   Said Adam Simon, a UCLA-bound pitcher from La Puente Bishop Amat:
"[High school players] see how great a player [Caminiti] was when he
was on them. Why wouldn't they be able to perform the way he did if
they were on them? They might use him as a model."</TE>
<TE>   That's a concern of many--even the pros.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to put myself in the shoes of a 19-year-old and think,
'If everyone else is doing it and if I want to be a major leaguer, I
might have to do it,' " Baltimore Oriole catcher Brook Fordyce said.
"If high school kids start doing it, then they're going to think they
need to stay on it in college, and they're going to be on it for a
long time.</TE>
<TE>   "You put something in your body, you have to be educated.
Hopefully, these kids are smart enough to realize they're putting
poison in their bodies and giving themselves a chance to get real
sick."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay catcher John Flaherty, a representative to the union,
was a teammate of Caminiti and Canseco. He found their confessions
troubling but is happy it's led to a dialogue."If you're a college
kid and hoping to get drafted, unfortunately there's a decision for
you," Flaherty said. "If you do this, your chances might be greater.
If you don't, your chances might be less. So at a very young age,
you're asking them to make a very tough decision. You're not just
talking about getting drafted, you're talking about becoming an
instant millionaire.... The root of this problem goes deeper, to
finances and just getting yourself in the door to play this game."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger first baseman Eric Karros said he's disturbed by the
suggestion that steroid use by major leaguers will create a
cause-and-effect spike in use by younger athletes.</TE>
<TE>   "If people make decisions based on something they've read or what
a sports figure says, if that's solely how they make decisions, then
there's obviously a lack of parenting and a lack of a lot of other
things," Karros said.</TE>
<TE>   Major league players on their team's 40-man active roster are
protected from random drug testing, but minor leaguers are not. Angel
minor leaguers are tested twice a year and the club reports positive
tests are "less than 1%," with no repeat offenders.</TE>
<TE>   "If you've got nothing to hide, you shouldn't be worried about
it," said Angel reliever Lou Pote, who spent 10 seasons in the
minors.</TE>
<TE>   Canseco and Caminiti estimated that at least half of major
leaguers used steroids. But when The Times questioned a dozen players
about steroids during the last week, almost all said those figures
were grossly exaggerated.</TE>
<TE>   As for random testing, there were mixed reactions. Six were for
it, one was against it and four were undecided. For another, the
subject already was taboo. Angel designated hitter Brad Fullmer
refused to discuss steroids, saying, "I'm tired of talking about it."</TE>
<TE>   Angel outfielder Garret Anderson is against testing, even though
he says he has been unjustly the target of speculation that he used
steroids. He was told by a teammate during his career-high 35-homer
season in 2000 that an opposing pitcher had asked, "Does he take
steroids?"</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he laughed it off. He weighs 228 pounds, 38 more
than he did as a rookie in 1995, but says the weight has come
naturally with age.</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel Manager Mike Scioscia: "Garret has a real fluid swing
and it's very common for a hitter like that to work his way into
power."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson said he's an example of why testing isn't needed. "I
don't use [steroids] and my numbers are right there with the best in
the game over the last couple of years," he said. "I don't think it's
tainting the game."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Giles, the Pittsburgh Pirate outfielder who has averaged 37
home runs and 111 runs batted in the last three seasons, doesn't feel
strongly either way about testing. He credits hard work in a
conditioning program for his success.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you have to be in great shape for a 162-game season
and the guys that are putting up the biggest numbers are the guys in
the best shape," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Angel outfielder Darin Erstad said he would support any plan that
would place "everybody on a level playing field."</TE>
<TE>   Karros is in favor of testing for a simple reason. "I'm not saying
it's good or bad--but it's illegal, so test for it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fordyce, the Oriole catcher, said players should be tested for
their own protection. "What's the point of a guy having a great
career if two or three years later he's sick or dying?" he said. "I
think the union owes that to the players."</TE>
<TE>   Within the next few weeks, union chief Donald Fehr is expected to
consult with team player representatives for their assessment of the
owners' proposal. Several players interviewed said they had not yet
been polled.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Conine, a first baseman and designated hitter for the
Orioles, is in favor of testing and is confident that baseball will
soon have a testing program if the majority of players agree with
him. "They work for us," he said of the union leaders. "If we want
something done, they do it."</TE>
<TE>   Flaherty agreed, noting the union arranged for the Devil Rays to
attend a seminar on steroids in New York last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Salaries have gone through the roof, home runs have gone through
the roof," Flaherty said. "Hit home runs, salaries go up. The union
likes that. If attendance goes up because a few guys are bombing
balls into the seats, then maybe the owners want to turn their cheek
a little bit. I'm interested to see who jumps to the forefront on
this thing."</TE>
<TE>   Some are concerned that it will take a worst-case scenario before
the owners and union are able to forge an agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone dies, there's a problem," Angel pitcher Scott
Schoeneweis said. "If someone dies years down the road, after they're
done playing, there's a problem.... Until that happens, maybe nothing
will be done."</TE>

<HD>Indian Wells Gains Stature in Expansion</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Men's draw will go from 64 to 96 players in 2004
and prize money will increase in 'Grand Slam-type' event.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAUREN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The men's draw for the $2.95-million Pacific Life Open tennis
tournament at Indian Wells will be expanded from 64 to 96 players
beginning in 2004 in accordance with a new 50-year agreement between
tournament and ATP tour officials, it will be formally announced
today.</LD>
<LD>   With the agreement, the top-tier tournament played the first two
weeks of March will become one of only two multiple-week, combined
men's and women's events in professional tennis, other than the four
Grand Slam tournaments. The other is another Tennis Masters Series
event, in Miami, and also in March.</LD>
<LD>   "I think it's going to bring Grand Slam-type tennis to the West
Coast. It will develop into that," said Charlie Pasarell, Pacific
Life tournament director.</LD>
<TE>   Previously, the Pacific Life tournament was a joint men's and
women's venture with $5.1 million in prize money, but play was
staggered because the men's portion was a one-week competition while
the women's 96-player draw played 10 days over two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like tennis needed more combined events," Pasarell said.
"Now we're 100% combined."</TE>
<TE>   The larger draw means the number of night sessions will increase
from the current five to eight. Night sessions will be played on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday of the first week in addition to the
usual Monday-Friday schedule in the second week.</TE>
<TE>   Prize money for the men's competition currently is $2.95 million
overall, with a winner's purse of nearly $400,000.</TE>
<TE>   The purses are expected to increase, to as much as $600,000 for
the winner, and by as much as $3 million overall over the next six
years, according to Pasarell.</TE>
<TE>   The combined tournament will be worth more than $8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Changes have been considered for some time, and are part of a push
by tour officials to eventually bring to four the number of non-Grand
Slam events that are combined and two weeks in length.</TE>
<TE>   Pasarell, a member of the ATP board of directors, said tennis
officials probably will look to Europe in considering other venues
for two other similar events.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a race, and subject to availability of a good
facility," Pasarell said.</TE>
<TE>   A key impetus for ATP sanctioning of the changes in the Pacific
Life tournament occurred in 2000, with the completion of a
$70-million, 16,000-seat stadium at Indian Wells Tennis Garden.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way they would sanction an event like this otherwise,"
said Pasarell.</TE>

<LD>Pete Sampras hopes the scene of his greatest triumphs will help
revive his sliding career.</LD>
<LD>   His latest try to halt the slump that has dropped him out of the
top 10 for the first time since 1990 ended in a 6-4, 6-3 loss
Thursday to Germany's Nicolas Kiefer at the Gerry Weber Open.</LD>
<LD>   It was a premature end to Sampras' grass-court preparations for
Wimbledon, where he hopes the revival will begin in less than two
weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "It brings back some good memories, some fortunate moments,"
Sampras said of Wimbledon. "Hopefully it'll happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Sampras acknowledged that his 66-minute loss to the 64th-ranked
Kiefer was a huge disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big week for me, I needed to reach the final," he said.</TE>

<HD>Milutinovic's Job Done After China's 3-0 Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chinese won't have Bora Milutinovic to kick around with anymore,
but the former national team coach of Mexico, Costa Rica, the United
States, Nigeria and most recently China, isn't about to quit soccer
just yet.</LD>
<LD>   After China had ended its first World Cup campaign with a 3-0 loss
to Turkey before 43,605 in Inchon, South Korea, on Thursday, "Milu,"
as he had become known to millions throughout China, said he would
seek a sixth country to lead to the 2006 World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "Now I am finished with the Chinese team," Milutinovic said. "I
was very happy to work with them. Now I need a rest and will see what
is my future. If I retire, I am going to die."</LD>
<TE>   Turkey's victory, after the disappointment of a close and
controversial loss to Brazil and a tie with Costa Rica, put the Turks
into the second round for the first time and sent tens of thousands
of fans onto the streets of Ankara, Istanbul and other Turkish cities
in celebration.</TE>
<TE>   Defeating China was never going to be a problem for the Turks,
however, and goals by forward Hasan Sas and defender Bulent Korkmaz
in the first nine minutes made sure that Turkey did not slip up.
Midfielder Umit Davala scored the third with five minutes left.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy we kept our promise to the Turkish nation,
first by qualifying for the World Cup finals and then qualifying for
the second round," said Turkey's Coach Senol Gunes. "Today we got a
deserved victory."</TE>
<TE>   The Turks finished behind Brazil but ahead of Costa Rica on goal
difference in Group C. China finished fourth, without a victory, a
point or even a goal.</TE>
<TE>   Milutinovic, whose brand of "happy soccer" changed the face of the
game in China, was upbeat, however.</TE>
<TE>   "Our team is very young," he said. "I am sure they have a future.
It was good to make the first step to the finals. It would have been
nice to have got the second step."</TE>

<HD>This Comeback Worth Voicing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was less than five years ago that Marv Albert's broadcasting
career appeared over. Now he is in demand everywhere, picking up jobs
left and right.</LD>
<LD>   He may have worked his last NBA Finals, because ABC begins
carrying them next year. But don't feel sorry for him.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday, Turner Broadcasting announced Albert would be TNT's
lead NBA play-by-play announcer next season, and as such he'll be
announcing the Western Conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, Albert officially became Westwood One/CBS Radio's
play-by-play announcer for Monday night football, paired with Boomer
Esiason.</TE>
<TE>   Albert also announces about 55 New York Knick games a season for
the Madison Square Garden Network.</TE>
<TE>   It's estimated the three jobs will pay him between $3.5 million
and $3.8 million a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very fortunate," Albert said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   That's an understatement. His comeback may be one of the greatest
in sports history.</TE>
<TE>   It was in September 1997 that he was fired by NBC after pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge three days into a trial filled
with lurid allegations about his sex life. He was fired because he
told his employers he was innocent.</TE>
<TE>   He became the butt of jokes, and not only on late-night
television.</TE>
<TE>   These days, he's the subject of glowing praise, particularly from
television executives who hire him and revere him.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Joel Hollander, Westwood One president and chief
executive, called Albert "one of the legendary voices in all of
broadcasting."</TE>
<TE>   He said once it became apparent Albert was available, "It was an
opportunity we could not pass up."</TE>
<TE>   Falling victim to Hollander's eagerness to hire Albert was Howard
David, one of the best football play-by-play announcers anywhere.
Hollander said if Albert hadn't been available, David would have been
retained.</TE>
<TE>   David was informed of the change last week. He said from his home
in Boca Raton, Fla., that he didn't see it coming.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Mike Pearl, Turner Broadcasting's executive producer,
said, "If you were to blindfold somebody and turn on the television,
if you were a broadcaster and there was one voice that you would want
associated with your brand and for people to know that, 'Hey that's
the NBA and in this case TNT,' the voice you would want to hear is
Marv Albert's.</TE>
<TE>   "In my day, when I listened to the news, there was a certain thing
when you'd hear Walter Cronkite say something. It gave weight to it.
When you hear Marv Albert call a game on television or radio, there
is a certain weight to it. You don't need anything else. It's just
hearing his voice that gives the importance to the event."</TE>
<TE>   But there's more to Albert's comeback than simply a distinctive
voice and a professional style. There's also a pleasing personality.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Weisman, former NBC Sports executive producer who remains
close to Albert, said, "He's self-effacing and low key and that makes
him very likable. Not only are people who work with Marv aware of
that, but I also think the public senses it."</TE>
<TE>   Popular Analyst</TE>
<TE>   One of the most popular analysts in sports television is NBC's
Johnny Miller, at least with the public. The key is his honest
approach.</TE>
<TE>   He talked about that this week from Farmingdale, N.Y., where he's
working the U.S. Open and also watching his son Andy compete.</TE>
<TE>   Of his broadcasting style, Miller said, "The bottom line is that I
was brought up with the adage to 'be true to yourself.' And be 'true
and honest.' As an announcer, I try to be very observant with what is
going on and I try to show the finite details that a lot of people do
not see."</TE>
<TE>   Initially, that led to a bluntness that didn't go over with
everyone.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the players are pretty much at ease with what I am doing
now," he said. "For a while they were not quite sure, and there may
have been somewhat of a shock factor because before I came on the
scene I think there was a softer approach to the</TE>
<TE>   game.</TE>
<TE>   "I am trying to be very honest from a pro's eyes. I am not trying
to cover up anything, like saying a wedge shot is a 'great shot' when
it is 20 feet from the hole. I am willing to talk about a shot even
though a player might wish that I ignored or forgot about it."</TE>
<TE>   Injustices</TE>
<TE>   With New York Yankee pitcher Roger Clemens scheduled to bat
against the New York Mets on Saturday, that's the game most people
want to see. But Fox, with its regional coverage, is giving the West
Coast Oakland at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's time for Fox to go with a national game of the week,
plus a backup game in case of a rainout. That's the way it was in the
old days.</TE>
<TE>   One incentive for Fox: lower production costs.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, English soccer fans were hoping to see live
English-language coverage of their team's World Cup game against
Denmark at 4:30 a.m. Saturday. But ABC has taken that game away from
ESPN and will show it at 12:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   At least ESPN planned to show U.S.-Poland live at 4:30 this
morning. ABC will replay that game Saturday at 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Ratings Game</TE>
<TE>   The NBA Finals may have been a ratings bust, but that wasn't the
case with NBC's Triple Crown coverage. Saturday's Belmont Stakes got
a national rating and share of 7.6/21, the highest since 1989, and it
pushed the three-race average to 6.8/18, the highest since ABC
averaged a 7.5/21 in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   ABC has been getting decent ratings for the Stanley Cup finals--a
3.3 for Saturday's Game 3 marathon and a 3.5 for Monday's Game 4. The
3.5 is a 52% increase over the 2.3 for Game 4 last year.... When it
comes to impressive ratings, the 9.0 Channel 34 got in L.A. for
Saturday's Mexico-Ecuador World Cup game is amazing. The game was on
at 11:30 p.m., resulting in a 32% share of the L.A. television
audience at the time.... The 1.62 national rating for Sunday night's
U.S.-South Korea World Cup game made it the most-watched soccer game
ever on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   CBS has landed Coca-Cola as a sponsor for 22 NCAA championships,
including basketball. The 11-year deal has a value in excess of $500
million.... The Dodgers and Spanish- language station KWKW (1330)
have reached a new five-year agreement in which the Dodgers control
all sales and marketing efforts.... Where's Andres Cantor? His famous
"goooooooal" call is only heard on radio--KWKW in L.A.--during the
World Cup. That's because he left Univision, which owns U.S.
Spanish-language broadcast rights, for Telemundo two years ago, and
is calling games for the Futbol de Primera radio network. Cantor,
from Southern California, is one of the founders of the network....
"World Soccer Weekly," with Steven Cohen and Nicholas Geber, which
has been on KXTA (1150) Saturdays, 7-8 a.m., has moved to KMPC
(1540), where it will be heard Sundays, 7-9 a.m. And there are plans
to expand to show to Sporting News radio affiliates in New York and
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Recommended viewing: Sammy Sosa, whose story is one of the most
uplifting ever in baseball, is featured in "Beyond the Glory" on Fox
Sports Net Sunday at 8 p.m.... "Arli$$," featuring Robert Wuhl as a
sports agent, begins a new season on HBO Sunday at 9:30 p.m. A guest
star on the first episode is James Coburn, who plays a crotchety

DeAngelo Collins will be examined on "Outside the Lines" Sunday on

<KH>NBA FINALS * OTHER VIEWS</KH>
<HD>Jackson's Critics Go Up in Smoke</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY MARIOTTI</AU>
<BD>Chicago Sun-Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His only request was a cigar. So here it is, Phil Jackson, a
beautiful and robust stogie, big enough to blow smoke rings up the
nostrils of every critic who ever called you lucky, weird,
hypocritical, Zen-daffy, a coattail rider or a Montana monk who runs
off into the woods and eats berries.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't get one Fed-Ex'd to me by Red," he said with a satisfied
smile, referring to No. 1 critic and noted cigar-sucker Red Auerbach.
"Looks like I'm going to have to get my own cigar out of my briefcase
in the locker room and light it up. It's remarkable I'm sitting here
in a situation that I never dreamed of."</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, what he has won is a three-peat three-peat. And if
that isn't enough to convince the rest of Planet Hoops that we are
observing the most accomplished pro coach ever, then pity the fools.
There were times in Chicago, I admit, when Jackson seemed like just
another fortunate soul benefiting from a place in Michael Jordan's
orbit. But as the Jerrys tumbled into lotteryland, Scottie Pippen
flamed out and the other Bulls faded, Jackson ventured to Los Angeles
with the not-so-easy challenge of making Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant compatible and championship-correct.</LD>
<TE>   He did it. Not once, not twice, but three times now, giving him
nine NBA titles in nine Finals as a coach and defining himself as an
all-time great who has completely broken free of Jordan to create a
niche almost as prominent. As the Lakers put away the
gnats-on-the-monument New Jersey Nets, the only hint of Jordan's
presence Wednesday was the famous No. 23 jersey worn by Bryant before
the game, his latest replica statement in a prestigious line. But it
all points to Jackson.</TE>

<LD>When you hear Rick Fox popping off at the Finals about his Lakers
coming back stronger next season specifically to put a cork in
whatever it is that's still open and spewing around King-land, you
know you're onto something. Whatever keeps L.A. motivated, go with
it.</LD>
<LD>   The risk of this budding rivalry always has been obvious: That
just as the Kings approached an apex of talent and confidence, the
Lakers would get all fat and sassy and generally uninterested in
going after anything more. After this season, they will have matched
Phil Jackson's Chicago teams in terms of three-peat ability, and
aside from wondering what dance Mark Madsen might launch into at the
victory parade, what more is there to ask?</LD>
<LD>   But if Fox is telling the truth--and it bears note that, so far,
he's pretty much the only guy doing the squawking--the Lakers remain
chafed by Sacramento's repeated assertions it had the Western
Conference stolen from it by a hideous or corrupt (or both)
officiating crew in Game 6. They are irritated that Rick Adelman
continues to plead his team's case--nationally--long after losing a
Game 7 that was the Kings' to win.</LD>
<TE>   And, says Fox, the Lakers are already setting up the 2002-03
season around the concept of doing something about all of that.</TE>
<TE>   You know what? It may be the only thing that works.</TE>
<TE>   When Shaquille O'Neal grunted something about Adelman in the wake
of the Lakers' Game 2 victory over New Jersey, he provided a
wonderful glimpse into the world of high-stakes motivation. Even at
this level, even with this money at stake, you'd be surprised at what
tiny slights will be co-opted and transformed into things Worth
Playing For, even by the elite.</TE>
<TE>   But the objective truth is that the Lakers probably will never be
better than they were a year ago--that O'Neal, in particular,
probably will be fighting foot and ankle problems for the rest of his
375-pound career. The feeling even among the L.A. faithful is that
this Laker team is a slightly diluted version of the last two
champions--wonderful still, and no doubt still possessed of the
world's two best players, but diluted nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings as yet have no claim on that territory, of course; you
ain't won nothin' until you've won something. But 11 months from now,
next season's conference finals may well begin between a Sacramento
team still in its ascendancy and a Los Angeles team that is beginning
to lose a step.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Lakers will still have their bulletin
board. If that is enough to help keep this thing on nearly equal
footing for a while longer, it'll be worth every last drop of sour
grape juice.</TE>

<LD>The Lakers have now played 12 NBA Finals in the last 23 years and won
eight of them, and you have to know they have become every single
thing in basketball that the Yankees are in baseball. They won a
championship one night when a 20-year-old Magic Johnson went to
center because Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was hurt. Then they won more with
Magic and Kareem and James Worthy and even a guard named Byron Scott.</LD>
<LD>   Now they have won with Shaquille O'Neal, three titles in a row and
three MVP awards in the Finals, a center as great as any to ever play
the game. People who don't want to put him with Russell and
Chamberlain and Kareem are blinded by the past. And Shaq is as big a
star as the Finals have ever seen. That puts him with Michael Jordan.
In the three Finals Shaq and Kobe Bryant have won, they have lost a
total of three games. This is the way the Yankees went through the
World Series when they were winning three in a row for Joe Torre.</LD>
<LD>   On the court in New Jersey where the Lakers finished off the Nets,
Magic Johnson kept talking about the Yankees and Lakers.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got Phil," Johnson said. "They've got Joe Torre. The both
of them just sit there with their legs crossed and make all the right
moves and then watch their teams win."</TE>
<TE>   Always when we talk about the great dynasties of sports, we start
with the Yankees, then get to Vince Lombardi's Packers and the Boston
Celtics and the old Montreal Canadiens. Too often, we forget the
Lakers. But there is a magic to them, in all ways.</TE>

<LD>Forget about Wednesday night. That's over. What about next year? And
the next? The Lakers, after winning their third consecutive NBA
championship, are going to win a few more. With their roster, there
is no way to stop them....</LD>
<LD>   Argue if you want about NBA greats. Shaquille O'Neal is not the
best player ever, or even the best center. But he was the most
overwhelming in a Finals series. Or so it says here.</LD>
<LD>   Next season should be more of the same, though O'Neal clearly
needs to lose weight if he hopes for a longer career. In his postgame
remarks, he vaguely hinted about an early retirement, though no one
is taking the possibility too seriously. But it's true O'Neal was
bothered by toe problems throughout the season.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm going to go out, meet all the best foot doctors in the
world," he said. "Then I'll make the best decisions possible. I want
somebody to help me with my pinkie-winkies."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers are rooting hard for the pinkie-winkies.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing is staying healthy," said Bryant, speaking of
future title runs. "I don't know what Shaquille is going to do with
his toe this summer. But I talked to all the guys and got everybody
on the same page as far as working out. Because, you know, some other
teams have had two months or a month and a half off. They're
plotting. They're waiting. I'm sure Sacramento's working out right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Not hard enough. If O'Neal is back next season in good shape, the
rest of the NBA is in bad shape. Period.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Man Held in Series of Robberies</HD>
<DH>Arrest: Police believe the suspect is the 'tennis-elbow
bandit,' wanted for 36 holdups of banks and stores, mostly in the
Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man believed to be the "tennis-elbow bandit," wanted for robbing
three dozen banks and stores across Los Angeles County during the
last two years, has been arrested, Los Angeles police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Terrance Lynn Miller, 47, of Los Angeles, was taken into custody
by detectives from the Los Angeles Police Department's North
Hollywood Division about noon on Wednesday at a Ralphs supermarket in
Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   Miller, who faces state charges of bank and commercial robbery, is
being held at the Parker Center jail in lieu of $1.4-million bail. He
is to be formally charged in court today.</LD>
<TE>   "Detectives ... observed Miller, who they believed resembled the
suspect," said LAPD robbery homicide division Capt. Jim Tatreau.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later "a stop was conducted and the detectives
observed an air pistol on the floorboard of the car and recovered
other significant evidence related to the crimes," Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is suspected of robbing 36 banks and retail stores in
Burbank, Glendale and Los Angeles between July 7, 2000, and May 31 of
this year, Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   He was given the nickname "tennis-elbow bandit" because he wore an
athletic bandage over his right elbow, though authorities believe it
served to cover a tattoo on his arm.</TE>
<TE>   Described as the "the guy-next-door type," the robber typically
would hand tellers notes demanding several thousand dollars in $100
and $50 bills. In the bank heists, he suggested he was carrying a
gun, but never drew one. The bandit did display a weapon in the store
robberies, Tatreau said.</TE>
<TE>   In November, a task force made up of members from the FBI and the
Los Angeles, Burbank and Glendale police departments released grainy
surveillance photos showing a 30- to 40-year-old white man, about
5-feet-8 and 180 pounds, who often wore sunglasses on his head or
above the brim of a baseball cap, investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of the crimes took place in San Fernando Valley areas
patrolled by the LAPD.</TE>
