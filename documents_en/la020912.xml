<DH>Academics, journalists move the Web's raucous alternative
newsletters toward the mainstream</DH>

<LD>The rants are pulsing through the blog-o-sphere again, which, on most
days, would mean that the online community is in its usual state of
trippy high drama. Except that, this time, the topic is a radical
expansion of the blog-o-sphere itself, one that would include a
contingent of--quick, bottoms up on the Red Bull--traditional
journalists (the ones who write, as the lexicon has it, dead-tree
pieces).</LD>
<LD>   In the quirky world known as the blog-o-sphere, hundreds of
thousands of ordinary individuals run Web logs, or "blogs,"
interactive newsletters of sorts with bite-sized chunks of copy
updated daily, or, in some extremes, several times an hour. On the
personal Web sites, bloggers post tidbits of commentary and host
unfiltered public forums in which rumors fly, news is weighed and the
blog-o-sphere's stars (known simply as Dave, Meg or Evan) are
pondered. The most popular bloggers build a sense of community by
linking to each other and writing in a voice that cartwheels off the
page, as a distinct alternative to what they see as the distant,
establishment voice of newspaper journalists and others. Hence, the
latest angst-filled question: Whither the blog-o-sphere, not to
mention the future of the news media as we know it?</LD>
<TE>   Recently, there have been unmistakable signs that blogs are
seeping into the popular consciousness. In July, for instance, New
York Times language watcher William Safire wrote a column on the use
of the word "blog, " noting that the term came into vogue three years
ago. "Blog" also is under consideration as a new entry in no less an
authority than the Oxford English Dictionary.</TE>
<TE>   And consider: This fall, UC Berkeley is offering a class on Web
logs for the first time--through its highly regarded Graduate School
of Journalism. Since spring 2000, journalism students at USC's
Annenberg School for Communication have produced a Web log. This
semester, at Cal State Stanislaus, an assistant communications
professor is teaching an undergraduate class on the history of
journalism that will cover "blogs as a new journalistic form."</TE>
<TE>   The blog-o-sphere already includes members of the traditional
media, such as MSNBC and the San Jose Mercury News, which have staff
journalists who write Web logs for their organizations' sites.</TE>
<TE>   Though no official statistics exist, unofficial estimates put the
number of blogs at 200,000 to 500,000. Blogs have "achieved critical
mass," said David Weinberger, author of "Small Pieces Loosely Joined:
A Unified Theory of the Web" (Perseus, 2002). Most news organizations
eventually will be forced to respond to the influence of the
blog-o-sphere, predicted Weinberger, a technology commentator for
National Public Radio's "All Things Considered."</TE>
<TE>   "You can go with a well-researched, vetted, authoritative voice.
Or you can find 50 voices [on a blog] that are wildly, hugely
passionate, often one-sided and frequently wrong, but presenting a
wider spectrum of viewpoints. That is frequently a better way of
getting at the truth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Blogs have been thriving since late 1999, when free software
became available that made it easy for anyone to create and update
the sites and become an "amateur publisher." Some blogs are little
more than online journals. Others have themes--for instance,
www.popculturejunkmail. com, which covers "trashy TV, British
royalty, the 1980s, toys" and more, is written as an independent
undertaking by MSNBC's travel editor.</TE>
<TE>   The best bloggers have signature voices in print, spinning news
and musings the way a Rush Limbaugh does, or an Oprah Winfrey, and
with the same sort of loyal followings. Until Sept. 11, though, even
the most well-known blogs still were being read in relatively tight
circles and largely ignored by the journalistic establishment.</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the terrorist attacks, when masses of people logged
on to the Internet for information, the Web sites of major news media
either crashed or failed to provide timely updates. Bloggers noted
huge upswings in traffic to their sites and in e-mailed comments from
the public (e-mails are posted instantly in a forum that has been
likened to an infinite and unedited letters-to-the-editor page). As a
result, bloggers, who typically have day jobs, turned into
"do-it-yourself journalists ... seeking out sources and sometimes
assembling these ideas for others," noted a study on Sept. 11 and the
Internet released last week by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life
Project.</TE>
<TE>   In one chapter, Internet expert Alex Halavais noted that blogs
often published first-person accounts of the terrorist attacks, some
of which were compilations: "Many of these accounts do not follow the
canons in fact checking, seeking out alternative or opposing views,
or attempted impartiality. They are necessarily more socially
constructed, and read more like rumors...." Still, wrote Halavais, an
assistant professor at the University at Buffalo, State University of
New York, "growing numbers of Americans seem to want to supplement
the material they get from traditional media." And these days,
universities and colleges are giving the blog-o-sphere the sort of
widespread legitimacy that bloggers are so very fond of dissing.</TE>
<TE>   "Just when it was getting good," wrote a reader on the Daily
Pundit blog, "the academics show up to suck the marrow from an infant
art and bind its feet so that it limps about like some rich man's
bride from China." Added another reader in an English-challenged
entry: "Berkely J-school ... looks like the parties over."</TE>
<TE>   On the blog Slashdot, a reader bemoaned the change: "For those of
us old enough to remember, the [core] blog phenomenon could turn into
an amusing rerun of the mainstreaming of sixties hippie culture by
seventies marketing weenies.... We're gonna need a new buzzword
pretty soon that means 'painfully lame yet expertly produced
synthetic blog.' "</TE>
<TE>   Following the blog-o-sphere's credo of referencing each other's
works, the co-creator of Berkeley's new course, veteran journalist
Paul Grabowicz, lists a selection of other reaction through links on
www.journalism.berkeley.edu/prog ram/newmediaclasses/weblogs/,  the
class' home page.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the course, students will produce a Web log exploring
intellectual property issues that arise in areas such as Napster and
copyrights on the Internet, said Grabowicz, director of the
journalism school's New Media Program.</TE>
<TE>   Grabowicz, who is co-teaching the course with Wired magazine
co-founder John Battelle, said he understood, but doesn't agree with,
the angst over the possible co-opting of the blog-o-sphere by major
media. Instead, Grabowicz sees an expanded community populated by
bloggers and by journalists applying the profession's basic
principles of accuracy, fairness and integrity. "The journalists can
still do what journalists do in a Web log format and work with the
people who are responding to that stuff [via an online airing]," said
Grabowicz, "....Out of that comes maybe not a better story but a
different story with hopefully more collective knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   The bloggers-versus-journalists distinction already is hard to pin
down. News of Berkeley's course, Grabowicz pointed out, was first
reported in a blog and then picked up by traditional media. In a
wager outlined on www.longbets.org/bet/2, in fact, pioneer blogger
Dave Winer, who runs Scripting News, bet New York Times Digital CEO
Martin Nisenholtz that in 2007, in a Google search of that year's top
five news stories, Web logs will outrank the newspaper's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   At USC this semester, journalism students in online classes will
study the Web log phenomenon, said Larry Pryor, director of the
Annenberg Online Program. "Web logs are now a very important form of
communication," said Pryor, a former Los Angeles Times journalist.
"The only question is, are they all journalism? I'm not going to
answer that one.... I think our Web log, onlinejournalism.com, is
clearly journalism. It's done by students. They receive training.
It's edited before it goes up. It's timely. It's objective and
informative."</TE>
<TE>   So do bloggers have to contribute original stories, rather than
simply commenting on links, to be considered journalists? USC's
bloggers, who cover the world of online journalism, are writing their
own stories, said graduate student Melissa Milios, the site's
managing editor. "You're not getting the source firsthand, you're not
getting the quote firsthand," she acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   But reporters might rewrite a story, giving credit to the original
source, and emphasize another aspect, while adding a perspective in
their own words. "It is journalism," Milios said, "but it is a
hybrid.... I think that journalism is original writing and reporting,
so that would be my definition. I think we're doing the original
writing, and we're reporting that this obscure African Web site is
reporting 'this,' a journalist in Zimbabwe wrote 'this.' To that
extent, we're reporting."</TE>
<TE>   Berkeley's Grabowicz said he isn't sure if such a hybrid will
catch on. "Whether [blogs] are going to sweep the nation and world,
and ... transform the way we communicate, it's way too early to
tell."</TE>

<LD>THE PARTLY CLOUDY PATRIOT</LD>
<LD>   By Sarah Vowell</LD>
<LD>   Simon &amp; Schuster</LD>
<TE>   198 Pages, $22</TE>
<TE>   An essay called "Tom Cruise Makes Me Nervous" ought to concern one
of those strange maladies Oliver Sacks recounts. But the person of
science in this case is Sarah Vowell, the trenchant writer and radio
essayist who is out with a new collection of essays and humor pieces
called "The Partly Cloudy Patriot."</TE>
<TE>   Vowell has a refreshing way of sizing herself up. "I'm two parts
loner, one part joiner," she writes.</TE>
<TE>   Or, to describe her nerdy devotion to big moments in American
history: "I have set my alarm so I wouldn't miss a C-Span morning
live remote from the house of the Revolutionary War pamphleteer
Thomas Paine."</TE>
<TE>   In "Tom Cruise Makes Me Nervous," she says: "As a white,
middle-class American moviegoer who graduated from high school during
the Reagan administration and subscribes to more than one cable film
channel, I've seen every film Tom Cruise ever made, some many more
than once, without even trying." That sentence is chilling on several
levels, but Vowell is like Joan Didion without the gloomy foreboding,
and her book is full of little comic treasures that both derive from
and illuminate otherwise unexplained cultural phenomena.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, while I have been trying to articulate for years why Cruise
makes me nervous, too, I will now refer skeptics to Vowell, who
manages to illustrate his cyborg tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   "When the cute little kid in 'Jerry Maguire' gave Cruise a hug,"
she writes, "my first reaction was parental. I wanted to grab the
child away, scolding, 'We don't do that. We don't touch burning
stoves, strangers' candy, and we do not touch Tom Cruise.' "</TE>
<TE>   Vowell grew up in Oklahoma and Montana, and she has Cherokee
roots. She has lived in Chicago and now resides in New York, where
her friends include Dave Eggers, editor of the literary magazine
McSweeney's, where her writing has appeared.</TE>
<TE>   She is also a regular contributor to the public radio program
"This American Life," hosted by Ira Glass.</TE>
<TE>   Vowell has been duly recognized, then, for her indie-spirited
prose. Those who've heard her on the radio (the voice like an
eggshell showing cracks) will readily hear her tone in these pages.</TE>
<TE>   As she glides around her overarching points, there are great
throwaway lines, drolly delivered (" ... every domestic flight
requires a middle-aged man with a Stephen Ambrose book in his
carry-on luggage--it's an FAA regulation").</TE>
<TE>   Much of the book, her second collection of essays, concerns
politics--and not just the politics of George W. Bush and Bill
Clinton, but of Lincoln, Jefferson and Eisenhower.</TE>
<TE>   Because Vowell, a self-described nerd and history buff, has an
abiding interest in civics--then, now and always.</TE>
<TE>   So while cafe liberals bemoan the death of democracy in the wake
of the 2000 presidential election, Vowell is proactive, seeking
solace in the Emancipation Proclamation. And she attends Bush's
inauguration, planning to protest but ending up weepy.</TE>
<TE>   "Ike Was a Handsome Man," meanwhile, is part travelogue, part memo
to Clinton, during whose scandalized presidency Vowell served as
"your crabby little cheerleader." Now she gets to the dicey little
business of the planning of Clinton's presidential library in Little
Rock, Ark. For a frame of reference she tours the Kennedy Library in
Boston, the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, the Eisenhower Library in
Abilene, Kan., and the Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, picking out
little pieces of wisdom.</TE>
<TE>   Of how Clinton might address the Lewinsky scandal without
whitewashing it, Vowell suggests an opportunity to be exploited in
Clinton's having given his paramour a copy of Walt Whitman's "Leaves
of Grass." "Perhaps your exhibition designers can do something with a
line or two from 'Song of Myself,' " she says. "The best description
of you I've ever read was published in 1855:</TE>
<TE>   'Do I contradict myself?</TE>
<TE>   Very well then I contradict myself,</TE>
<TE>   (I am large, I contain multitudes.)' "</TE>
<TE>   Vowell contains her own multitudes. In the book's title essay, she
examines the meaning of patriotism post-Sept. 11 and cuts through the
clutter of the media's largely bathetic coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Of the ubiquity of the American flag, and the seeming demand to
stand behind one's country in the current time of crisis, Vowell
writes: " ... like any normal citizen, I prefer to make up my mind
about the issues of the day on a case by case basis at 3 a.m. when I
wake up from my 'Nightline'-inspired nightmares."</TE>

<HD>Luxury Sheet Lovers Will Cotton to This</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JANET EASTMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who are concerned about wrinkles in bedsheets or the time it
will take to iron them smooth can finally unfurl their foreheads.</LD>
<LD>   A new technology makes it possible for cotton sheets to be pulled
from the dryer crinkle-free.</LD>
<LD>   Many polyester sheets achieve permanent-press status by undergoing
a treatment that uses formaldehyde resin, which health experts and
environmentalist dislike because it can be toxic.</LD>
<TE>   And comfort hounds who insist on sleeping on fine Egyptian cotton
sheets turn their noses up at polyester's smell and feel.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the only way to have smooth cotton sheets was to drag
out the ironing board or hand them over to be professionally
laundered.</TE>
<TE>   "Inventing a no-wrinkle, no-iron Egyptian cotton sheet without the
toxin is a breakthrough," says Beth Edwards, vice president of
Between the Sheets, the only stores in the U.S. that carry the new
sheets.</TE>
<TE>   At $500 a set, they are comparable in price to other fine Egyptian
cotton sheets. Luxury bed linens are judged by the quality of the
cotton used, the thread count (the higher the better), and the
workmanship in the spinning, weaving, finishing and dying process.</TE>
<TE>   The German mill that makes the chemically untreated bed linens
won't reveal its process, but the outcome is soft, durable
425-thread-count sheets.</TE>
<TE>   After dressing a bed with these pricey sheets, plain-Jane accent
pillows may seem out of place.</TE>
<TE>   One option: a personal pillow hand-painted with an image you hold
dear. Between the Sheets stores have commissioned artists to take a
customer's photograph of a loved one and transfer it onto a Dupioni
silk pillow.</TE>
<TE>   From the time of order, it takes two weeks to immortalize Mom,
Fluffy or your constant companion--yourself. The cost is $350 for an
18-inch-square pillow.</TE>
<TE>   Between the Sheets stores are at Fashion Valley, 7007 Friars Road,
Suite 691, San Diego, (619) 299-9300; the Gardens on El Paseo, 73545
El Paseo, Suite G1704, Palm Desert, (760) 779-8500; Fashion Island
Shopping Center, 401 Newport Center Drive, Suite A220, Newport Beach,

<TE>   Ah, Shucks</TE>
<TE>   Like those who take comfort in them, pillows have an inner life
and an outer one. They have been filled with everything from feathers
to foam. But corn syrup?</TE>
<TE>   Not exactly, but a new pillow on the market makes use of that
Midwestern staple. Cargill Dow LLC of Minnetonka, Minn., has found a
way to ferment corn sugars to create a polylactic acid, which is spun
into a fiberfill it calls NatureWorks. The company says this process
uses 20% to 50% less fossil resources than conventional ways that
require petroleum.</TE>
<TE>   The result? A $25 pillow developed by Pacific Coast Feather Co. of
Seattle, Wash., that has the practicality of polyester synthetic and
is hypoallergenic. The filling is also used in comforters. The
bedding line is at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond stores. Call (800) 462-3966;

<LD>The Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising faced an image
problem. Its new Orange County campus was to be housed in a gray
warehouse on a dull street in Irvine. The uninspired building defied,
rather than helped define, the edgy, design-conscious instruction
that would take place inside.</LD>
<LD>   Fast-forward nine months to its official opening two days ago, and
the former factory has been reborn to match the function and flavor
of the college's course work.</LD>
<LD>   But the transformation didn't arrive without compromise. Architect
Clive Wilkinson and his design team, which included Stephen Lesko,
wanted passersby to be instantly clued in that this was a center of
creativity. They envisioned sail-like fabric screens wrapping the
front of the 53,000-square-foot building. Painted onto the screens
would be bold polychromatic patterns.</LD>
<TE>   The idea, however, didn't fly with the Irvine Co.'s design review
board, which only approved bare screens to quietly shade windows. The
architectural team was disappointed but not undaunted, and like a
rebellious teenager restricted to his bedroom, the group came up with
an interior that is really, really loud.</TE>
<TE>   The floor of the reception area is awash in Pepto-Bismol pink, and
building-block couches are upholstered in iridescent yellow-ochre
polyester. Flat-screen TVs that run fashion shows nonstop are tucked
into cushioned boxes or attached to walls. A stainless-steel plaster
mesh "ceiling" exposes the air-conditioning and heating ducts above
it, and hanging sheets of vinyl that are splashed with wild floral
abstracts serve as room dividers.</TE>
<TE>   "Exuberant expression"--Wilkinson's words--explodes throughout the
building. Angled walls, 24-foot-high skylights and towering lofts
force eyes upward, while openings carved into exterior and interior
walls and a glass atrium that flows into a courtyard push the
dimensions out. A circular pathway on the concrete floor, marked by
magenta epoxy paint and mustard-colored carpet, connects the
academic, administrative and social centers inside the sprawling
space.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-based architectural firm also took a
nontraditional approach to a routine matter. Instead of hiding
telecommunication wires inside the walls, aluminum cable trays are
mounted a few inches below the ceiling and look like an overhead
conveyor belt. The cases add a decor energy, complement the
industrial-looking interior and provide a practical perk: Walls won't
have to be opened when more wire is needed to accommodate
ever-increasing high-tech demands in classrooms, offices, digital
labs and conference rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Furnishing throughout the space is a blend of designer
classics--such as Philippe Starck's conical tables and Vitra plastic
rocking chairs--and amoeba-shaped upholstered seating created by the
architectural firm.</TE>
<TE>   The campus' 400 students also needed a soothing zone for intense
study as well as a lively place to hang out. Wilkinson provided both
with a library--its soft birch bookshelves hold bins of
swatches--which is adjacent to a bustling student's activity center
outfitted with a pink concrete counter bar that spills outside.</TE>
<TE>   The Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising campus, which
offers tours of its facility, is at 17590 Gillette Ave., Irvine. For

<LD>The Clavering Children</LD>
<LD>   Before cameras were invented, people would hire artists to paint
themselves and their families. These artists were called
"portraitists," and it was a status symbol to hire certain ones to
paint your picture. One of the most successful portraitists in London
was George Romney. He lived from 1734 to 1802.</LD>
<LD>   Romney painted this portrait of a brother and sister in 1777. They
were the children of George Clavering of Greencroft, England. Thomas
was 6 when this portrait was made. His sister Catherine was two years
older.</LD>
<TE>   Notice how the brother and sister look almost like 18th century
grown-ups. Thomas is shown as the figure of authority, in charge of
the action; Catherine is motherly and protective, caressing the puppy
as if it were a newborn baby. The boy is unbuttoned and tousled; the
girl is gentle and demure. The children had six sittings with the
artist, meaning they posed for him on six separate occasions in order
to have this portrait made. Catherine never became an adult; she died
as a teenager in 1785, but her brother lived to be 82.</TE>
<TE>   Starting Sunday and continuing through Dec. 1, the Huntington
Library will be the only American location for a major showing of
work by Romney, one of the most important British painters of the
late 18th century. You can see "The Clavering Children," which is in
the Huntington's permanent collection, as well as many other
paintings by this esteemed artist. For more information about the
Huntington, visit www.hunt ington.org or call (626) 405-2100.</TE>

<TE>   * My favorite dinosaur is the ankylosaurus. It is my favorite
because it did not eat other dinosaurs. It was a plant-eater.
Ankylosaurus stood a good chance of walking away from an attack. In
fact, this plant-eater was a model example of armored dinosaurs. It
was more than 33 feet long, almost 4 feet high and lived 70 million
years ago during the late Cretaceous Period. It had very large jaws
but small and weak teeth.</TE>

<HD>Getting Her Secrets in Writing</HD>
<DH>Carolyn See's new book addresses regimen, structure and
yes, networking</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNELL GEORGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The flowers are here--long-stemmed exotics drifting out of grand
vases. So are the crudites, the pates and cheeses. There are bottles
of wine--two reds and two whites. And a waiter in vest, dark pants
and starched shirt, looping around the perimeter of Dutton's
Brentwood Books' deep courtyard.</LD>
<LD>   The friends are here. Old colleagues and new. Family--immediate
and extended. So are the students with fresh notebooks. Here too is a
steady rain that falls uncharacteristically from a heavy,
early-September sky.</LD>
<LD>   The surprise evening shower is the only thing that isn't on writer
Carolyn See's checklist of what should be a part of a working
writer's arsenal. Her response:</LD>
<TE>   "Let's get rolling!" See cranks her right arm in the air and winds
through Dutton's covered breezeway. She threads through the
thickening crowd, her black tunic and jacquard slacks flowing after
her.</TE>
<TE>   Her face set, focused, she'll will the drops away. She strides to
a table nestled beneath an overhang, already draped with bouquets,
handwritten notes and brochures announcing upcoming readings, names
starred and dates circled.</TE>
<TE>   As the book signing begins, See inscribes each title page with her
black felt-tipped pen, closing each greeting, " ... xxxx, Carolyn."</TE>
<TE>   "I just love your little notes!" enthuses one lean, sun-baked man,
who looks as if he could have climbed from one of the pages of her
novels. Another in seersucker and stingy brim Panama jumps the line
bellowing: "Can I have a kiss, Carolyn?! Come on, Carolyn!" All this
could be a scene straight out of Chapter 5 of See's new book "Making
a Literary Life: Advice for Writers and Other Dreamers."</TE>
<TE>   "Every writer needs an entourage ... so that when your book comes
out and you start having signings, you won't be quaking with terror."</TE>
<TE>   She squints as camera flashes fire, dabs her eyes when a face
calls up a memory. But she's quick to keep the line moving, with a
light hand on shoulder and an "Enjoy yourself, dear." There is order
to all of this spontaneity. There is business to this art. She has
built this willfully, piece by piece. And indeed, somehow, when no
one was looking, the rain paused, as if between thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   In "Making a Literary Life" (Random House), See, a hardy L.A.
daughter, takes a detour from her long string of L.A. novels--most
recently "The Handyman" (Random House, 1999), and "Making History"
(Houghton Mifflin, 1991)--and departs as well from the realm of the
straight-shooting memoir, "Dreaming: Hard Luck and Good Times in
America" (Random House, 1995) to tackle the prosaic realities of the
hard and hardly glamorous work of writing.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be easy" to convey what she knows about
writing, says See, on another afternoon, padding around her sunny
Pacific Palisades home. "It was terrible. I thought at first that the
book should write itself, but, really, in fact, [writing is] like
driving a stick or talking about how adrenaline functions or looking
after your child." Easy once you know how to do it, harder to
explain.</TE>
<TE>   Often when eager readers pick up a writers' handbook, they come
looking for the basics, plot basics, say, or dialogue tips. They may
want exercises to unblock the block, or more to the point, a list of
agents or magazines that might eagerly await a fat 9-by-12-inch
envelope.</TE>
<TE>   See's volume contains some of that. There are humorously
instructive chapters on writing regimens, point of view, scene
building and the importance of a clear-eyed rewrite. "Often it's very
hard to sit in one place and read your own cruelly imperfect work.
Tomato soup and red wine can dull the impulse to jump up. Pretty soon
you don't care how awful the draft is."</TE>
<TE>   But what separates this guide from others of its ilk is the
plain-spoken and at times unconventional advice she imparts about
nudging the universe. She would have a writer refine the art of
throwing her own party, cultivating contacts, making himself visible.
("Write charming notes" to people you admire!) She presses the
importance of taking a more active role in the work's destiny rather
than hoping the book "succeeds on its merits."</TE>
<TE>   She counsels confronting the business of writing, or as she
softens it "the writing life"--understanding the balance, and finding
ways to have a family life that "glitters as it is stable."</TE>
<TE>   The book, says See, who is also a UCLA English professor, a
contributor to The Times and a book critic for the Washington Post,
spun out of an all-too-familiar exchange: "The thousandth time
someone called me up and said, my book is dying and I don't know what
to do. You walk them through it. They are very obdurate, you know.
And they are sulky and crabby, and it's your fault. But if you don't
know, you just don't know. But it's not like it's arcane. "</TE>
<TE>   This advice, says See, is intended as cheering section for people
who wanted to write but somehow got sidetracked by life, or "folks
who live in parts of the country where the idea of writing is as
strange as crossbreeding a tomato and a trout," she writes. "It's
about making your literary life wherever you live, whoever your
family and friends may be."</TE>
<TE>   Much of it is about setting the intention (that would be Chapter
5, "Pretend to Be a Writer") says See, winding through a neat, bright
home alive with impressionistic glowing paintings of L.A.'s past and
present--the old Dolores Drive-In and MacArthur Park Lake. Books to
judge or review and books to simply linger through are separated in
stacks. Those of her late partner, the scholar and writer John Espey,
who knew the beauty of books, line the floor-to-ceiling shelves.</TE>
<TE>   Stacked on a dining room sideboard are mailing lists, envelopes
and invitations to upcoming book parties (that would be Chapter 6,
"Hang Out With People Who Support Your Work"). Every flat surface
seems filled with the encouraging faces of her children and
grandchildren. She settles onto her balcony, which overlooks a sweep
of hills that, as the light changes, could be in Greece or Spain or a
backdrop for some fictional place she's yet to fix on the page.</TE>
<TE>   Being a writer, in See's definition, is as much about integrating
writing into your lifestyle--say, 1,000 words a day, five days a
week--as it is about writing a charming note to a literary figure you
admire. And doing such things for the rest of your life. It is about
cultivating an image, seeing yourself as a writer, but not requiring
those around you to suffer through your aspirations and
proclamations, chapter and verse.</TE>
<TE>   Though she says that "I started out as a writer with a chip on my
shoulder ... a woman in a very bad mood," her advice comes in a voice
as lambent as morning sun. It can also be as blunt and revealing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's my experience," writes See, "that you first feel the impulse
to write in your chest .... It's like falling in love. Only more so.
It feels like something criminal....So think when you feel the
overpowering need to go out and find some unspeakable wild sex, do
you rush to tell your mom about it? Keep your longing to yourself."</TE>
<TE>   To help keep everything--from self-doubt to ego--in check, the
book provides recipes for "magic" and prescriptions for surviving
rejection that sound like Lucy Ricardo schemes--until you get to the
punch lines. Several pieces sent to Atlantic Monthly editor C.
Michael Curtis prompted an irritated reply: "Dear Miss See, I think
that by now you've sent us everything but your family photograph
album. I should think it would be evident that we're not interested
in the kind of things you write."</TE>
<TE>   Winded by the blow, she righted herself, then mailed a series of
photographs of her grubby Topanga brood. A meeting and assignment
soon followed. She now refers to Curtis as "Mike."</TE>
<TE>   Some might find parts of her advice hokum. See understands why. "I
wouldn't say you could make or have a literary life just by stringing
together affirmations," she says. "That chapter on magic can be taken
in a frivolous way. But in the real world the chances of making it as
a writer ... are as good as making it as a tap dancer, a magician or
a movie star. To be a writer, you just don't go through realistic
channels. Reality is when you pay the rent. Get caught in traffic or
your car breaks down. Really it's an AM/FM sort of thing. You've got
reality and then there's the miraculous and the transcendent. And
once you start, time stops."</TE>
<TE>   Being a writer is being grounded in both worlds. It is as much
about self-invention as conjuring back-story, interiors and the
well-drawn characters that inhabit your work.</TE>
<TE>   Those charming notes? Well, they become your calling cards when
you make your first trip to New York. That bracing rejection slip you
received? Pop a thank-you note in the mail, she advises. Tell that
editor you'll write again. And do. "They say: No. I'm not dead yet,
thank you very much." Will they think you daft? "So what. So what. So
what."</TE>
<TE>   All this, she knows, is blasphemous to some ears: "Carolyn cares
more about the writing life than writing," See says, serving up the
scuttlebutt she's overheard.</TE>
<TE>   Students often groan at the notion of the "charming notes," she
says. I know I did when she mentioned them in a class I took from her
years ago at Loyola Marymount University. As an undergrad given to
epic daydreaming, the idea of thinking about writing notes to
strangers--networking!--didn't fit into my back-lit, soft-focused
definition of "writer." But students were--still are--assigned to
trundle out to her readings (it was mandatory). Her teaching style
requires students to become organized self-starters. And somehow, all
the pieces--inner work and outer--fit together.</TE>
<TE>   What See wants to impart is just that. That the writing life can
be as much about serendipity as it is about strategy: all of it
poetic.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, she too finds herself at times beset by "What's the use?"</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult protecting your heart as a writer. It's even harder
to survive the mountain of rejection on top of the workings of fate
and luck. The competing voices indeed get awfully loud--financial
crises, critics, pulped books, mortality.</TE>
<TE>   She tries to take her advice, "but of course it's hard."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, shortly after "Making a Literary Life" arrived on the
shelves, a reviewer gave it a particularly scathing critique. It
rocked her, she admits. But after the smarting settled some, she put
on her game face. "I sent him a dozen roses." She won't even
speculate at the reaction. "So what. So what. So what."</TE>

<HD>In Eagle Rock, a Jungle Land</HD>
<DH>Elmer Lorenz has grown subtropical plants in his expansive
backyard for 53 years. Now he's caretaker of 6,000 species.</DH>

<LD>"Don't duck, just push your way though," suggests Elmer Lorenz from
somewhere up ahead. The narrow path I'm following is choked with
bamboo palms, gingers, anthuriums and other subtropical treasures,
which have been growing happily in this Eagle Rock backyard for 53
years.</LD>
<LD>   Lorenz explains why his garden is such a jungle. "I've always been
interested in the tropics and in jungles but figured I'd never get to
travel there," he says, still buried in the vegetation, "so I decided
to grow my own." Because so many of these plants grow under trees in
their native jungles, Lorenz has covered half his property with shade
cloth, though I hardly notice it overhead as we fight our way though
the leafy vegetation.</LD>
<LD>   I can barely keep up with him because I keep stopping to look.
There is so much to see, like the huge staghorn fern that's firmly
attached to a palm trunk. Not only is this epiphytic fern holding
tight, it is strapped to the truck by the aerial roots of a
Philodendron 'Evansii' that grows above it. It's like being in a
Tarzan movie. I could probably grab onto one of those roots and swing
across the garden.</LD>
<TE>   Lorenz originally had a whole acre to play with but the California
Department of Transportation swiped half of it for a freeway offramp.
Bummer, I think, but he quickly adds, "Too bad they didn't take
more," only half-jokingly. Caring for a jungle, it seems, is hard
work.</TE>
<TE>   The octogenarian does most of the work, repotting, moving plants
around, weeding, watering large areas by hand, strengthening the
shade structure. Shirley Kerins, who's in charge of the Huntington
Library and Botanical Gardens' plant sales, beams when she talks
about Lorenz. He volunteers there every Friday, helping with
preparations for the sales. "He's so amazing," she says, "he's in
charge of the shade plant section, which means he schleps all the
plants, and he's 88 years old!" She doesn't stop there. "He's one of
the most devoted plantsmen. He's a treasure!"</TE>
<TE>   Lorenz was a founding member of the Bromeliad Society and a past
president of the group and the Southern California Horticultural
Society. He was a member of the legendary Leafeaters, a group of
plant fanatics that included UCLA's Mildred Mathias, designer Midge
Davis and other horticultural notables. As we walk, he stops to pinch
back some coleus that are trying to bloom because letting them flower
at the end of summer will quickly end their stay in the garden. He
points out all the work that needs to be done this fall, including
the replanting of entire areas. It makes me tired just thinking about
it.</TE>
<TE>   I keep stopping for closer looks, this time at the long sprays of
tiny Encyclia tampensis orchid blooms that arch into the path at this
time of year. He has a number of unusual and really lovely hybrids.
Lorenz says he prefers small-flowered orchids like these encyclia,
and he has quite a collection. Most are hardy outdoors in his Sunset
Zone 21 banana-belt garden, including this species from Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Lorenz recently dismantled a large greenhouse but there is another
smaller one for those plants that can't take the cold of winter. The
temperature once dropped to 29 degrees. "I begin to get a little
nervous when it drops to 32 or 31," he says. While all of the orchids
spend summers outside, a few must be brought into the greenhouse in
cold weather, and little red plant labels sticking out of the pots
remind him which need protection in winter.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the plants are from subtropical jungles like those found
in Australia and Costa Rica, so they can take a little cold. The
majority of plants are grown for their dramatic, tropical-looking
foliage, which he is especially fond of, and this is why it's so hard
to see very far. I stop again to look at some handsome and incredibly
long and narrow leaves on two kinds of anthurium, growing in hanging
pots. Their flowers are not much to look at but the leaves are like
nothing I've ever seen. They must be 3 feet long and only a few
inches wide.</TE>
<TE>   He says one problem with a jungle garden is forgetting about
individual plants. "I'll make a mental note to see the flowers on
something, then forget all about it until the blooms are past." So he
has set up a display area, next to a small patio, where he hangs some
of the orchids that are flowering so you don't have to go searching
for blooms.</TE>
<TE>   His half-acre is home to an astounding 6,000 plant species. Years
ago he began a list of "accessions," as newly acquired plants are
called at botanic gardens, and he now has an inch-thick stack of
sheets on a severely strained clipboard with the thousands of
entries. "I don't know how he remembers all the names," said his wife
Joyce, though Lorenz claims he doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   Along the path, I spotted accession No. 5921, an interesting fern
with super-curly fronds that Lorenz hadn't gotten around to planting.
It's a polypody named 'Green Wave' that he recently found for $4.39
at a Trader Joe's, of all places. "I've actually found some really
interesting plants there," and at Home Depot, he says.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not where he found his latest acquisitions, an
exquisite black ginger named 'Midnight' or the Chlorophytum amaniense
'Fire Flash,' which is a relative of the common spider plant but
infinitely more sophisticated, with broad leaves that have steaks of
red and coral on the stems. These two came from growers of rare
plants in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Among all these plants, he doesn't have particular favorites--"I
can't insult all the others," he says. He does have two favorite
families, however, Begoniaceae and Bromeliaceae, so there are plenty
from both.</TE>
<TE>   His first loves were begonias but he's had disease and pest
problems with them through the years, so it's been an on-again,
off-again thing. Now, many are covered with those nasty white
filaments made by the giant white fly. He is hoping that the tiny
predatory wasps that have recently been released by the state will
get the upper hand. He is not spraying or even blasting off the white
flies, less he accidentally destroy the wasp larva too. It obviously
pains him to see his beloved begonias so covered with this pest, but
he leaves them alone.</TE>
<TE>   So he takes comfort in the bromeliads, which are virtually
problem-free. He's especially fond of the Neoregelia clan because
their foliage is so colorful, but he also likes Guzmania for their
long-lasting flower spikes. Right outside the backdoor, bromeliads
with colorful foliage hang at varying heights to make a screen that
looks like a huge stained-glass window. He carefully positioned the
plants so the sun shines though the leaves, making them glow red and
orange and green.</TE>
<TE>   To grow the polypody and other ferns, the gingers, begonias,
bromeliads and other shade-requiring plants, Lorenz built a large
lath house just after building the main house in 1948. Through the
years, he's kept adding to this garden structure, changing to shade
cloth when that became available. The vegetation is so dense you
hardly notice it, and the posts are painted green so even they
disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Few trees shade the property because his soil is quite
shallow--not what trees like or need. A few big palms, some towering
cussonias, and some firewheel tree, grow in pockets of deeper soil.
When he and his wife Joyce built their house, the grading contractor
got carried away and scraped off the top of the little hillock while
making a building pad, leaving only a few inches of decomposed
granite to garden in.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, jungle plants don't need a deep soil. In tropical and
subtropical forests, soils are often surprisingly shallow--a few
inches of leaf little on top of impenetrable clays. Lorenz has added
things to his decomposed granite to make it more like topsoil,
homemade compost at first, and most recently, spent potting soil that
he brings home from the Huntington and works into the dirt.</TE>
<TE>   There are sunny spots, even a rock garden, filled with tiny little
plants like a dwarf cotoneaster or a little natal plum named
'Humphrey Variegata' growing among small boulders that he received as
Christmas and birthday gifts. "When my family was in doubt, they
could always get me a ton of rocks for a present," he says.</TE>
<TE>   He also likes cactus and succulents, though he favors the
subtropical types, such as the succulent euphorbias and gesterias,
which fill a couple of beds and benches, or the most uncactus-like
rhipsalis, that grow overhead in hanging containers, thread-thin
branches dripping almost to the ground. It's hard to believe they're
in the cactus family. Several succulent Pachypodium with their
swollen trunks have grown quite large through the years, though they
are still in their little pots, which gives them an almost comical
look of spiny telephone poles sticking out of bowler hats. "But I'm
not about to repot them," says Lorenz, staring at the big thorns.</TE>
<TE>   The retired civil servant has been able to travel to jungles,
after all, in Australia, Southeast Asia and Costa Rica. And people
have come to visit his jungle. As I pushed my way onward, I tried to
picture Roberto Burle Marx, the late, legendary Brazilian landscape
architect--considered one of the most important landscape architects
of the last century--and a big fan of tropical plants, fighting his
way through the garden.</TE>
<TE>   On a speaking trip to California, Marx was brought here by the
late Paul Hutchinson, who owned Tropic World Nursery in Escondido.
Lorenz modestly says it wasn't really a visit, just "a bathroom
break" as they traveled up the coast. But Lorenz and Marx did
correspond over the next few years, and Lorenz still wears a T-shirt
silk-screened by Marx, as he works in the garden.</TE>

<LD>Kaci went home and alerted her mother, who said she would find Nya.
Then the girl got dressed and rushed off to school. Though she was
still worried, she figured she had to put losing Nya out of her mind.
(My mom is so smart. She'll find that puppy, Kaci thought.)</LD>
<LD>   When Kaci got back home that afternoon, her mom had left a note.
It said, "I found Nya. She was hiding under Mrs. Collins' porch.
She's now your responsibility. If you can't handle her, you probably
can't handle a dog of your own."</LD>
<LD>   Kaci didn't even waste time to change her clothes before she ran
next door. She had to see Nya. The dog was chomping happily on a
biscuit when Kaci approached. But then she wagged her tail, jumped up
and licked the girl when she opened the gate. (Am I a human Slurpee?
Kaci asked herself.) "Down, girl!" Kaci called out.</LD>
<TE>   "If I put some water in your bowl, will you stop licking all over
me?" Kaci asked the dog. Kaci filled the water bowl from the faucet.
But Nya jumped on her before she could get the bowl to the ground.
"Down, girl!" (I guess I'll have to bring the water hose to her, Kaci
thought.) She attached a hose to the faucet, turned on the water, and
then spent the next 10 minutes trying to catch the water hose that
danced around on the ground like a drunken snake, spewing water all
over Mrs. Collins' yard. Nya ran through the water, over the bag of
dog food, onto the flower patch and back onto Kaci, until the girl
was a soggy, muddy mess.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will the trouble ever end?</TE>
<TE>   Dolores Johnson especially likes writing stories that recall the
adventures and misadventures of real little girls and boys. This
story will be on The Times' Web site at www.latimes.com/kids.</TE>

<LD>The Dixie Chicks' "Home" album remains on top of the nation's pop
sales chart, giving a country stamp to the No. 1 spot that may
continue through much of the fall.</LD>
<LD>   The female trio's album sold 367,000 copies last week to bring its
two-week total to 1.1 million, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Faith
Hill and Shania Twain, two other female country mega-sellers, will
release albums on Oct. 15 and Nov. 19, respectively, and both likely
will enter the chart at No. 1.</LD>
<LD>   The remaining positions in the top 10 this week were claimed by,
in order, Eminem, Avril Lavigne, Nelly, Bruce Springsteen, Norah
Jones, Coldplay, Volume 10 of "Now That's What I Call Music," Eve and
Clipse.</LD>

<LD>   Some who care about the language will cringe when they hear the
theme of the 80th-annual Los Angeles County Fair: "Kinder. Simpler.
Funner." Regardless, the fair is a family-friendly extravaganza.
Besides educational, art, horticulture, agriculture and livestock
displays and competitions, the fair will also offer all kinds of
entertainment, including 10 grandstand concerts by such artists as
Travis Tritt, War, Peter Frampton, Al Green, Creedence Clearwater
Revisited, Tower of Power and others. Plus horse racing, monster
trucks, pig races, other contests and all kinds of food.</LD>

<TE>   French filmmaker Anne Fontaine, who explored human desire in "Dry
Cleaning," looks at father-and-son issues in the metaphorically
titled melodrama "How I Killed My Father." Charles Berling plays a
Versailles gerontologist whose sterile, closed-off life is invaded by
the return of his father (Michel Bouquet), who had abandoned him as a
child. Natatcha Regnier also stars.</TE>
<TE>   "How I Killed My Father," unrated, opens exclusively at Landmark's
Cecchi Gori Fine Arts Theatre, Beverly Hills; Laemmle's Town Center

<TE>   Who said Tom Green's career died when he and Drew Barrymore split?
In "Stealing Harvard," he plays second banana to
skateboarder-turned-Kevin Smith regular Jason Lee in a farce about a
medical supply store worker forced into a life of crime in order to
secure tuition for his college-bound niece. Leslie Mann and Megan
Mullaly co-star. Maybe Green will be the Tom Arnold of the 21st
century? Maybe he'll get his own crass cable show? Oh, wait, he
already did that.</TE>

<LD>   The streets of L.A. have long inspired L.A. artist--and current
Gap model--Ed Ruscha; they continue to do so in Ruscha's latest
works, which go on view Saturday at Remba Gallery. In the new
minimalist Mixografia prints, entitled "Petro-Plots," the artist
takes a selection of Los Angeles intersections and integrates the
grid into the surface of a stone. Whether perpendicular as in
"Hollywood / Vine," or undulatory like "Pacific Coast Highway /
Sunset Boulevard," the works comment on life in L.A.</LD>

<LD>   In the ancient Hindu epic "Mahabharata," a great hero weighs the
moral costs of a just but catastrophic war in a celebrated passage
called "Bhagvad Gita." This extended meditation on the devastating
consequences of power politics couldn't be more relevant to the
current debate on a U.S. war with Iraq, but it might also seem the
most unlikely subject imaginable for a dance drama. However,
choreographer Viji Prakash and her locally based Shakti Dance Company
are adapting "Bhagvad Gita" into a narrative to be danced in one of
the oldest and most revered classical idioms of India, Bharata
Natyam. Guests Ajit Bhaskaran Das of Malaysia, Harikrishnan of India
and vocalist Lakshmi Shankar are featured in the production, which is
also scheduled to be seen in San Francisco, Bakersfield, San Diego,
Houston and Vancouver.</LD>

the band's folk-music heart, but Robert Plant's new album,
"Dreamland," brings those roots fully into the light, with versions
of songs by Bukka White, Bob Dylan and Tim Buckley, along with a
couple of Plant originals, rock nuggets ("Hey Joe") and cult-hero
obscurities (Skip Spence's "Skip's Song"). Its restrained intimacy

Draftsman,'' a new show devoted to drawings by an 18th century artist
that opened earlier this week at the J. Paul Getty Museum. A survey
devoted to Jean-Baptiste Greuze--arguably one of France's best
draftsmen--will feature drawings in multiple media, including chalk,
ink and pastel. The focus will be on Greuze's favorite topics: the
drama of family life and the human expression. Or: the agony and the
ecstasy.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're calling it "electroclash," "techno-punk," "nu wave" and
"synth-core," a fresh blend of electronic musical mash-up that gives
everyone at Club Synthetic dance fever. Synthetic's promoter/DJ Jason
Lavitt is like the Wizard of Oz, the guy behind the curtain
instigating this boogie-down production.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since the new music hit L.A., propelled by dance club hits
out of London and New York, it's sparked a frenetic frenzy that clubs
such as Cherry, Echo and the Parlour have quickly added it to their
aural menus. Lavitt, one of the musical gurus behind such hot clubs
as Tiger Heat, Bang!, Make-Up and Beat It!, has adopted the
electronic old-meets-new sound with a vengeance at Synthetic. The
month-old Friday-night dance club takes place at the newly reopened
7969 club on Santa Monica Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   In part, Club Synthetic jumps off because teenage energy helps
fuel the floor. Synthetic is an 18-and-older club and it's all about
easy access--just like the first spot that became your own when you
started clubbing. Pay the $7 cover charge and kick it in the spacious
old burlesque club, formerly known as Peanuts. The first thing to
grab your attention is a big-screen video montage of eye-popping
European newspaper clippings, then you'll notice how friendly the
people are. From the mod set to the nerd-core kids, everyone's drawn
together to check out this new nu wave.</LD>
<TE>   The youthful crowd may also take you back to your younger days,
when the music that's laying the foundation for the new art form was
all the rage. Much of electroclash borrows from the early '80s
archives of bands such as Soft Cell, the Cure and New Order. You can
almost hear the ghost of Human League--or wait, that's a remix! Sho'
nuf, it's Human League's "All I Ever Wanted's" alter-ego remix. The
club's weekly DJs are really the stars, as they bring the music to
the masses. The DJs include Lavitt, his partner, DJ Liz, and such
guest stars as Dragstrip 66's Paul V.</TE>
<TE>   "Electroclash is exciting because it's the new 'punk' on a lot of
levels," says Paul V, who spins at Dragstrip 66 and Spit. "And it's
an awesome antidote to waaaay too much faux rage-rap-rock and the
banal pop shtick out there."</TE>
<TE>   And it doesn't stop there. Many of the songs played at Synthetic
also have a hard industrial edge, making it also feel very
contemporary--like they're turning it out for the "Y2-AK47"
generation.</TE>
<TE>   All we know is they can call it whatever they want, but ultimately
it's a fresh new sound reminiscent of the first bloom of rap. And
regardless of where your musical roots lie, Club Synthetic offers an
interesting trip back in time with a cool postmodern whip. It might
just be the dance-floor "Wham"-my you've been waiting for.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Wild, eclectic art crams the walls at Lares--nudes, flowers, faces, a
spill of golden liquid from a tequila bottle. They're bold and
brazen, painted with a strong palette.</LD>
<LD>   They hint at what you are about to eat. Lares' food is
assertive--big, meaty versions of Mexican dishes with boisterous
sauces, the plates loaded with bulky food. The Santa Monica
restaurant can be boisterous too, when margarita-happy customers join
in with strolling mariachis.</LD>
<LD>   You can wait for friends upstairs by the big, ornately carved
wooden bar guarded by figures of Bacchus and strung with (imitation)
margarita glasses. The long, airy room runs from the tall windows at
the front, where the bar is located next to a TV always turned to
some sports event in progress, to booths and a garden-lined glass
wall at the back. The dining room downstairs is dark, almost
claustrophobic, in comparison.</LD>
<TE>   This is not a funky, carelessly casual place. The table salsa is
excellent. The flowers on the tables are fresh. Starchy white napkins
are carefully folded into the water glasses. The tables are covered
with two cloths, pale green over white (you feel a little guilty
spilling anything).</TE>
<TE>   Waiters address longtime customers by name, and kids and families
are as welcome as smart, young Westsiders.</TE>
<TE>   The food suits this crowd. It's not what you would find deep in
Mexico--think of it as some sort of hitherto unknown regional
variation. One example: camarones a la diabla, big shrimp wrapped in
bacon and coated with enough spicy sauce to swamp the boiled beans
alongside (pinto beans with shrimp seems a bit odd). Though based on
chipotle salsa, so many other ingredients have been added that it's
more like American barbecue sauce than anything Mexican. That doesn't
mean it isn't good, though.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the Sr. Maclovio especial. Waiters confess they have
no idea who Senor Maclovio is or was, but it's obvious he liked meat.
And he wanted the finest: filet mignon. The steak has been
butterflied, filled with ham, folded, wrapped with bacon and grilled.
The tomato-cilantro sauce that covers it is equally robust: tomatoes
in big chunks combined with whole cilantro sprigs.</TE>
<TE>   There's still more beef in a fried taco on the plate. You get
beans too, but they aren't served loose--they're wrapped in an
enchilada blanketed with Jack cheese.</TE>
<TE>   The costillas de puerco are the sort of crusty, meaty spareribs
you might cook at home, covered with a powerful, complex tomato
sauce. They're garnished with long, thin slices of nopales (cactus),
which could be mistaken for green beans. Vermicelli soup (sopa de
fideo) is supposed to come with this plate. One night the restaurant
was out of fideo and served me a broth with a meatball in it instead.
Like the sauce, the broth was powerful, perhaps too highly seasoned.</TE>
<TE>   Savanitas--thin slices of beef--arrive drenched with a
tomato-chile sauce that is more like meat gravy than salsa. The beans
on this plate are seasoned with spicy chorizo sausage. A few slices
of avocado give your palate relief from all this strongly flavored
food.</TE>
<TE>   Lares makes excellent chile verde. The flavors of the pork and
tomatillo sauce are subtly blended--they don't fight for attention.</TE>
<TE>   The American touch is obvious in carne asada, an American-style
steak, rather than the thin-cut beef that is grilled in Mexico.
However, the meat is good enough to make you consider ordering a
steak dinner. Lares serves New York, top sirloin and filet mignon
steaks with salad and so forth. There's even surf and turf (steak and
shrimp).</TE>
<TE>   Next to the steaks, the simplest dish you could have would be
carnitas. The chunks of pork are meltingly soft inside their crisp
crusts. To achieve this effect, large chunks of meat are deep-fried,
then cut up and finished on the grill.</TE>
<TE>   Lares also serves enchiladas, tacos, tostadas and burritos, and it
takes care of vegetarians with potato tacos and vegetarian fajitas.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant opens at 8 a.m. for breakfast, serving French
toast, omelets and pancakes as well as huevos rancheros and
chilaquiles.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, yes--that wild art on the wall is mostly for sale, so you
could leave with a painting as well as a thoroughly satisfied
appetite.</TE>

<LD>When Lynn Noto, a 36-year-old from Los Angeles now completing her
doctoral studies in psychotherapy, was traveling around India in
1997, she was seeking not enlightenment, mind you, but 10 minutes of
clarity in her life. That, and a cup of hot chocolate, which she
found at a restaurant in Dharamsala.</LD>
<LD>   There, serendipity intervened--she ran into actor Richard Gere, a
well-known practitioner of Buddhist meditation, who told her about a
philosophy and meditation course he had just completed with the Dalai
Lama.</LD>
<LD>   Her curiosity piqued, Noto signed on for an introductory course on
meditation, then spent seven days sitting in silence at an institute
run by Buddhist monks in Bodhgaya. "It was a beautiful introduction
to Buddhism and meditation," says Noto, who has been meditating ever
since; she says the practice helps her in dealing with her clients.</LD>
<TE>   Far from a flowery flight of fancy, her first experience with
meditation was grounded in reality. Construction noise rang through
the monastery. Even a full-blown crisis exploded. "We broke silence
when a band of robbers attacked the place with handmade guns," Noto
recalls. For most of us, it's not bandits and guns, but hurtling at
what seems to be 100 mph through a city of freeways and smog in an
era when time and security are scarce commodities and stress is a
relentless stalker. All of which helps explain why the practice of
meditation has gone mainstream in Los Angeles. Ordinary Angelenos are
discovering in this ancient restorative practice a mechanism for
coping.</TE>
<TE>   No longer an escapist refuge or the esoteric pastime of poets,
meditation has emerged as a tool to deal with the inexorable reality
of L.A. gridlock: traffic, professional and personal. And the trend
is national: According to a 2000 finding by the Journal of the
American Medical Assn., 10 million American adults meditate
regularly.</TE>
<TE>   For those who seek personal improvement, who want a way to soothe
a broken heart or merely hope to explore their own minds, the city
offers a smorgasbord of meditative choices. Angelenos can sit in
quiet contemplation in Buddhism meditation centers, connect mind and
body in yoga or tai chi studios, embark on meditative quests in the
wilderness, stroll labyrinths designed onto floors or walkways or
attend contemplative prayer sessions held in Catholic churches.</TE>
<TE>   With meditation, practitioners testify, it matters little where
you begin, or how--as long as you begin somewhere.</TE>

<TE>   When Wendy Egyoku Nakao began meditating in 1975, it was not
because she was looking for anything but because someone dared her to
sit still for a week. "They bet me $50. They said I couldn't do it. I
couldn't resist the challenge, and so I said, OK. I just stuck to it
the whole week, and I haven't stopped meditating since," she says.
Today, the petite 54-year-old is a Zen priest and the abbot of the
Zen Center of Los Angeles. Her infectious laugh erupts at the
slightest provocation. "And what was activated in me was a deepening
of this question of what is the nature of life."</TE>
<TE>   For those unlikely to enlist under the banner of organized
religion, meditation has provided a way of working with the sense of
danger in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in very harsh and frightening times," says Johanna
Demetrakas, a filmmaker who is also the director of Shambhala Center
Los Angeles; it teaches a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice called
shamatha, aimed at creating a more enlightened society. "Most of us
come here because we want to live in a saner and more compassionate
world. We feel the pressure of losing our humanity, in gross and
subtle ways."</TE>
<TE>   Pamela Gold Bothwell is a mediator and former attorney who has
practiced meditation since 1973. She is also an instructor at the
Shambhala Center. "People want a sense of community," she says. "They
want a sense of guidance from a philosophical perspective that can
actually address the level of aggression in the society in a
meaningful way."</TE>
<TE>   Since the mood of the entire nation turned contemplative last fall
in the days after Sept. 11, the demand for titles like "Where Is God
When It Hurts?," "The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living" and
"Anger: Wisdom for Cooling the Flames," which recommend meditation as
a problem-solving tool, has run high.</TE>
<TE>   Books like "Meditation for Dummies" are now on the New York Times'
bestseller list for self-help guides. At the Bodhi Tree Bookstore,
L.A.'s 32-year-old center for spiritual literature, "How to
Meditate," by Lawrence Leshan, sold hundreds of copies this last
year, says store co-owner Phil Thompson. Thirty years ago, this abode
started by three aerospace engineers on a sleepy stretch of Melrose
Avenue was just about the only place where you could find these
books. Now most of them are available at chain bookstores.</TE>
<TE>   The discipline of yoga in general has surged in popularity in
recent years, making meditation an option for a lot of people who
would have not considered it otherwise. Many students who initially
learn yoga to treat achy limbs or develop agile, wiry bodies, see the
discipline deepen into a meditative practice.</TE>
<TE>   One popular yoga studio in Los Angeles is Golden Bridge Yoga,
where owner and principal instructor Gurmukh guides students through
a patented blend of meditation and Kundalini yoga.</TE>
<TE>   A form of yoga with a pronounced devotional bent called Kriya yoga
is the meditative practice favored by members of the Self-Realization
Fellowship, a religious organization with a network of temples around
the city and the country.</TE>
<TE>   That many celebrities swear by its benefits has perhaps enhanced
the appeal of meditation, as have several medical studies over the
years, which have established a correlation between the practice and
lower levels of stress, cholesterol and decreased blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Meditation has also become an important adjunct to traditional
forms of psychotherapy. It is increasingly used, says Dr. Lobsang
Rapgay, assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA, not only
to alleviate stress and anxiety but also to address severe
psychiatric conditions, including personality disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Rapgay, a onetime Tibetan monk who spent several years in a
monastery immersed in the study of Buddhism, runs the Behavioral
Medicine Clinic at UCLA, using what he calls "mindfulness" in tandem
with conventional behavioral therapy to treat patients for headaches,
insomnia, depression and chronic pain, among other afflictions.</TE>
<TE>   "My chiropractor, my yoga teacher and my therapist all say the
only motivation for any of their clients is pain," says Fred Miller,
57, a yoga and meditation instructor at the Center for Yoga in
Hancock Park. The students who turn up at Miller's Sunday morning
classes, in which a sequence of yoga poses is offered as a moving
meditation, "are not currently associated with an established
religion," the instructor says.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many people in churches on Sunday and Saturday morning,
more than there are in yoga classes or in the gym," Miller says. "But
there are an awful lot of people who are separated from the religion
of their youth. And those people are looking for their own
spirituality, and you can translate that into peace of mind and
comfort of living."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When she was 24, Kelsang Lekma was toiling in marketing and
television and not at all happy. "I was irritable, rude, frustrated:
all these horrible traits that I could see developing in me were
dependent on, it seemed, stress and pressure," says the 36-year-old
Buddhist nun, now the director and principal teacher at the
Khandakapala Buddhist Center in Silver Lake.</TE>
<TE>   A traditional spiritual practice, a more obvious choice for many,
was not an option for the British-born Lekma. "I went to a Catholic
convent when I was growing up and left there thinking, 'No religion
ever again,' " she says with a big laugh.</TE>
<TE>   When she first joined a co-worker at a Buddhist meditation class,
it all made a lot of sense to her: It was logical, it was practical.
"I wasn't looking for it, but I knew that I needed it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Practitioners say that mediating equips them with the means to
recognize their emotions and diminish their grip, and that's what
Lekma found. At the meditation center she runs, practitioners focus
on a series of meditations that originated in Tibet and are
specifically designed to turn adversity in life into a positive
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "The beautiful thing about meditation is that it really helps you
understand why you get upset, why you get unhappy," she says. "We
often think, 'I shouldn't be angry,' but we don't have any method of
not being angry."</TE>
<TE>   The premise of meditation is careful observation of thoughts,
feelings and behaviors outside a judgmental framework. The goal is
often to bring the activity of your mind in perfect sync with your
body, "being in the zone" in lay parlance.</TE>
<TE>   "Meditation is meditation. It is paying attention to what you're
doing, whether it's living your life or sitting quietly and praying
in a church or out in the woods someplace. It's connecting with
whatever it is you're focused on," says Miller. "A friend of mine is
a gymnast, and he says his gymnastic practice is a spiritual
experience for him, because he is totally involved with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Under the umbrella of formal meditation practices, there are
myriad techniques, rooted in just as many traditions. There are the
moving meditations of yoga, as well as the sitting meditations of
Tibetan and Zen tradition, which involve resting on a cushion for
hours and observing and labeling your thoughts. Techniques also
include focusing single-pointedly on your breathing; chanting;
repeating a mantra; and visualizing a particular image or concept and
training your mind on it. Prayer, regardless of one's religious
denomination, can be a form of meditation too.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what technique--or non-technique--is at work, the
foundation of meditation is stilling the mind. That in and of itself
sounds good to those accustomed to mentally juggling a million tasks
every day.</TE>
<TE>   But beyond that, dedicated practitioners say that meditation gives
them techniques to remain calm in the face of adversity. It helps
them become less reactive, less likely to succumb to flailing
emotions. It gives them a teeny bit of space away from everyday
duties and concerns, in a sort of sealed-off container where they can
be just who they are. It enables them to be in the moment.</TE>
<TE>   With meditation, many people find they blossom and change--they
become more patient, more open. The benefits needn't be spiritual,
although many practitioners say that those who practice meditation
long enough inevitably acquire a sense of interconnectedness with
other people and with their surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   The most vivid recognition for practitioners of Buddhist
meditation, according to meditation instructor Pamela Gold Bothwell,
is to realize "how much clinging to hope and fear color your daily
experience. And that it's possible to experience a bigger world than
the world we are churning out from moment to moment on the basis of
what we hope will happen or what we're afraid will happen."</TE>
<TE>   For Noto, "integrating meditation into my life has made me ever so
slightly more connected to people, and there is a certain intimacy
that can be gained by that connection."</TE>
<TE>   Noto, who began work with clients last year, found that meditation
taught her the discipline of being able to just sit, listen and be
present. "No theories of Freud have helped me as much as meditation
has in terms of dealing with my clients," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Linda Cruz, a 42-year-old meditation practitioner and partner
at a downtown law firm, says meditation has helped her leave her work
at the office. "There are so many things you can't control in law--a
ruling you don't like from a judge, for example. Instead of focusing
on the negative aspects of that ruling, through meditation, I'm
starting to be able to think, when something bad happens, 'OK. This
is an opportunity.' "</TE>
<TE>   Such benefits are tangible. But how about being in the moment?
What is that going to do for you?</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's Rapgay says meditation helps with the tendency to be driven
by what you have to do and what you should do: "It offers an option
to define yourself in other ways than doing: by learning to be where
you are at, whatever you are doing, whether you are writing, whether
you are having a thought."</TE>
<TE>   And that is why meditation ultimately enables one to more
judiciously manage energy and regulate emotions. Consider the task of
studying for an exam, Rapgay suggests. A lot of energy is consumed if
you think, I have to read this book, I have to read it fast. After I
finish this book, then I have to mow through the next one. "That's
not living quite fully in the present experience. And if you're never
in the present experience," Rapgay says, "you really never get a
sense of yourself."</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to some popular beliefs, relaxation is only superficially
what meditation is all about. Blissing out is not the name of the
game, dedicated practitioners testify. Yes, meditation slows one
down. Yes, the mind isn't rambling as much, and that is relaxing.
Sometimes it can be a joyful, fulfilling feeling. But other times
it's just banal, because a person can spend time, for example,
straining to focus on breathing and at the same time be thinking,
"I'm not supposed to be thinking but focusing on my breath."</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes meditation turns into the most serious endeavor one
has ever tackled, making it a crucible of sorts. The essence of Zen
meditation, explains Nakao of the Zen Center, "is always to realize
the nature of life and death."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if most people consciously come here for that
initially. But for those who stick it out"--and by her rich laughter,
one can only imagine that practicing Zen is no walk in the
park--"sooner or later they settle into an investigation of this
great matter of life and death."</TE>
<TE>   Whether you are interested in examining larger philosophical
issues, or simply seeking another strategy for coping with the stress
in your life, meditation may help. So close your eyes, take a deep
breath and consider spending some quiet time in the company of your
own mind.</TE>

<LD>In the late 1960s, three aerospace engineers quit their jobs to open
a store dedicated to spiritual literature in a small house in West
Hollywood. Thirty-two years later, the store--named after the Bodhi
tree under which, the legend goes, the Buddha attained
enlightenment--is a destination of choice for Angelenos in search of
rare tomes on meditation, Buddhism, yoga and magic.</LD>
<LD>   Customers come in pilgrimage to the Bodhi Tree to stroll through
50,000 volumes in an environment smelling of incense and blissfully
quiet, save for the tinkle of wind chimes. They sip the Bengal spice
tea always brewing on a hotplate and peruse books ranging from "The
Tao of Pooh" to "The Bhagavad Gita" and the "The Complete Poetry and
Prose of William Blake." They can take a Zen meditation class, then
bag some Nag Champa incense, lilac-scented massage oil, a string of
prayer beads or a 27-inch-tall brass statue of Buddha.</LD>
<LD>   "In the past, people used to devour the classics, authors like
Helena Blavatsky, the Vedas, the Upanishads," says co-owner Phil
Thompson. "Nowadays, many prefer contemporary writers, people who
live in the real world and write in a more accessible idiom."</LD>
<TE>   But the Bodhi Tree still stocks all the Hindu scriptures and other
arcana. Says Thompson: "We keep books that we might sell once a year,
because that's what we set out to do."</TE>
<TE>   At right are several titles on meditation that Thompson says are
"quite good how-to books for the lay reader."</TE>

<LD>If you decide to meditate in a formal setting, Los Angeles offers a
vast array of options--from contemplative prayer to the Zen practice
of sitting meditation. To find the perfect technique for you,
seasoned practitioners suggest sampling meditations from several
traditions and sticking to what suits your personality and best
complements any already-existent spiritual practice. Experiment from
among the following:</LD>
<LD>   Zen Center of Los Angeles, 923 S. Normandie Ave., L.A . An oasis
of calm in a neighborhood where police helicopters often circle
overhead, the center is nicknamed by habitual practitioners "The
Normandie Mountain." Classes, retreats, talks and additional
activities are regularly scheduled every month. The grounds include
the zendo--an immaculate hall covered in tatami mats with stark,
black-and-white decor where practitioners sit on small black cushions
and meditate in silence; a library, a kitchen where post-meditation
meals are cooked, and a garden with chimes that sing gently in the
wind.</LD>
<LD>   An introductory class to the Zen techniques of meditation is
offered Sundays from 8:30 to 10:30 a.m. For class and event schedule,
call (213) 387-2351 or go to www.zcla.org</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Center for Yoga, 230 1/2 N. Larchmont Blvd., L.A. The center is
one of the oldest and largest yoga studios in Los Angeles and offers
some 80 classes every week. Gentler forms of the discipline that
emphasize the meditative element, like Vini yoga, are taught
alongside vigorously physical ones. A guided meditation class is
offered on the first Sunday of the month. For class schedule, call
(323) 464-1276 or go to www.centerforyogacom</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Golden Bridge Yoga, 5901 W. 3rd St., L.A . Studio owner and
founder Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa teaches meditation techniques specific to
Kundalini yoga during classes offered here several times a week. The
emphasis is on breath control, and the asanas, or yoga postures, are
completed with the eyes closed. Cardamom and ginger-spiced yogi tea
and cookies are served after each class. For class schedule, call
(323) 936-4172 or go to www.goldenbridgeyoga.com</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shambhala Center Los Angeles, 8218 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles. In
this airy, well-lighted meditation space squeezed between a
restaurant and pet grooming parlor, practitioners alternate sitting
on yellow and red cushions in silence with pacing around the room in
a circle. Tibetan prayer flags called tangkas adorn the ceiling and
the walls. The center belongs to a network of 165 similar
institutions around the world that popularize meditation techniques
rooted in a particular body of Tibetan Buddhist doctrines.</TE>
<TE>   Besides meditation and Buddhism, disciplines like ikebana (the art
of flower arrangement) are taught in various classes. Meditation
instruction is available free of charge. For an introduction to
meditation techniques and the philosophy behind them, first-time
meditators can attend an open-house session on the last Sunday of the
month. For class and event schedule, call (323) 653-9342 or go to
www.shambhala.org /center/losangeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Khandakapala Buddhist Center, 1492 Blake Ave., L.A. Housed by an
old church on the fringe of the Silver Lake neighborhood, this center
teaches a particular sequence of meditation techniques derived from
Tibetan Buddhism, which are intended to aid practitioners to
transform adversity in life.</TE>
<TE>   Guided meditation classes and a variety of events are scheduled
every month at the center and at satellite branches in Pasadena,
Santa Monica, Hollywood, Studio City, West Hollywood and Thousand
Oaks. An introductory class consisting of a short explanation,
chanted prayers and a 20-minute guided meditation is offered Sundays
from 10 to 11 a.m. For class and event schedule, call (323) 223-0610
or go to www.meditateinla.org</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Church of the Good Shepherd, 505 N. Bedford Drive, Beverly
Hills. A contemplative prayer session is held on Tuesdays at 7 p.m.
at this Catholic parish near the glitzy stores of Rodeo Drive. For
additional information, call (310) 285-5425.</TE>

<HD>Please Do Touch the Animals at This Pint-Size Aquarium</HD>
<DH>The kid-friendly UCLA Ocean Discovery Center at sthe Santa
Monica Pier offers hands-on encounters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN PATRICIA SCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tucked under the boardwalk, directly beneath the floorboards of the
carousel at the Santa Monica Pier, is the UCLA Ocean Discovery
Center, one of the best-kept secrets on the Santa Monica Bay.</LD>
<LD>   "I never knew this place was here!" repeats public programs
coordinator Jodi Low, laughing about the most common response she
hears from visitors who find their way to the facility for the first
time. But the center's mission to put children and their families in
touch--literally--with sea life is easily accomplished once people
make it through its doors. The place is family focused, adds Low,
saying, "We're small enough that we're manageable for families with
younger children."</LD>
<LD>   And small it is. Only a couple of rooms, the facility hardly
stacks up to most animal parks or commercial aquariums. The center's
hardwood floors and schoolroom ambience says: This is no theme park
or game arcade. There are no flashing lights or high-tech thrill
rides. But while a full-sized aquarium may have tens of thousands of
gallons full of exhibits, the appeal of this half-pint facility is
that it is specifically designed on a kid-sized scale.</LD>
<TE>   Children of elementary school age, even toddlers, will be drawn in
by the hands-on access to marine animals. And though science
education courses are provided for school classes and groups
throughout the year, the center is given over to families--100 to 250
people every Saturday and Sunday afternoon throughout the fall and
winter.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors begin with a self-guided tour of the facility. At each of
the tanks full of animals from the Santa Monica Bay, they're greeted
by trained volunteers who are eager to share the fun facts and
anecdotes about their tank's occupants.</TE>
<TE>   There are 10 tanks in the facility, including three touch tanks
and a shark tank. Besides the sharks, the center has an octopus and a
variety of fish and animals from the inner tidal zone. But the
center's long, low open-topped touch tanks are the main attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Children can plunge their hands into the water of a tankful of sea
cucumbers, kelp crabs and sea urchins. The red sea urchin with its
soft "quills" actually seems to grasp a visitor's fingers. "We like
to say it's giving you a hug, but the animal is actually trying to
see what is touching it," Low explains. There are tanks full of sea
stars, skates and sea anemones. And the shark tank--with horned and
swell sharks--is low enough to allow close inspection of the animals.
For obvious reasons, this is not a touch tank.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the animals, there are arts and crafts--child-size tables
are set with scissors, crayons, cutouts, paper and glue sticks, all
of the supplies necessary to make the center's ever-popular sea lion
puppets. And there are puzzles, books and outdoor activities as well.</TE>
<TE>   Older children will find a challenge in the computer lab, where
the computers are loaded with slide shows of marine life and a
virtual tide pool and even a computer game, Plankton TV, created by
center volunteer Alan Shimoide. Next to the computers are the
microscopes; one is connected to a video monitor that magnifies the
dizzying paths of a petri dish full of brine shrimp. Another
microscope stands ready to give visitors a magnified look at
seashells, algae or sand samples.In addition to the animals, media
room and arts and crafts activities, the center shows films on marine
life every hour on the half-hour. Visitors with young children are
encouraged to arrange their arrival to catch story time at 2:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   And everyone enjoys feeding time at 3 p.m. Volunteer Stan Whitman
and other volunteers prepare the animals' food. Whitman uses a simple
recipe--no breading, no butter. "It's one-third smelt, one-third
anchovies and one-third shrimp."</TE>
<TE>   He cuts the pieces according to the bite size of the fish--chopped
fine for smaller fish, chunky for the larger fish. Children are
spellbound by the swirling frenzy as the occupants of the tanks
battle over the morsels of food.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the center can easily take two to three hours or more.
And most children, as well as their parents, leave with the memory of
a good time, a little knowledge, and most important a new connection
to marine life in Santa Monica Bay.</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>
<HD>Tim Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Story is the director of "Barbershop," a comedy set in a South
Side Chicago barbershop starring Ice Cube, Eve and Cedric the
Entertainer. The film opens Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Final cut: I usually get my hair cut on Saturdays, and I like to
go early before the big crowd starts coming in. The barbershop is
always a great place to hang out, and Ice Fade City on Slauson Avenue
in Inglewood is the main one I like to go to. It's like 'Cheers,'
where everybody knows your name. A lot of old guys hang out there,
and the conversation can get pretty ridiculous. There are so many
barbershops along Crenshaw it's amazing. There's the one called
Millennium where the whole place is like a Lakers court. The
customers wait in "bleachers" and the chairs are in "locker rooms."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Film buff: I always have to go to the movies on Friday night. And
the Bridge over in Westchester is the only place. It's just awesome.
My girl likes to go there early and watch all these kids running
around. You see these cliques here and there, and it's a real
reminder of what high school was like. The Inglewood-Westchester area
has never had a state-of-the-art theater before, and the sound and
the screens are just perfect. Being a movie buff, I have to sit in
the middle of the theater, and you can get reserved seats there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Playin' around: The best place to go after breakfast and a haircut
is the Magic Johnson's Starbucks over in Ladera Heights, where I get
a caramel Frappuccino. That really kicks my day off. It's like a club
over there, with all the guys playing chess and reading the paper.
And on Saturday nights it is just crazy over there with the Starbucks
and the Magic Johnson's T.G.I. Friday's. It's like going to a
football game, with all these barricades and people hanging around
their cars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   People watching: One of the things I love to do is hang out on
Melrose and just people watch. There is literally every walk of life
down there. Guys with girls. Girls with girls. Couples fighting. I
look for different kinds of characters that might inspire me. We walk
up and down a lot, but the best place to watch folks is Johnny
Rockets. You can't beat it.</TE>
<TE>   Running around: I want to be in shape, and my girlfriend is all
about getting me to go to the beach with her. We always go to Playa
del Rey and run on the beach. But my best Sunday is when I get to go
play golf out at Robinson Ranch in the Santa Clarita Valley. Lots of
industry folks play out there. I'll run into Don Cheadle, Cedric the
Entertainer, all sorts of people.</TE>

attending to the process of grief while the government was issuing
dire warnings about new potential dangers, there was a particularly
reassuring quality in the duo's reminders of the enduring relevance
of sensitivity, wit and humor.</LD>
<LD>   Their joint appearances usually include a few songs--some
co-written--performed together as they face each other across the
vista of two grand pianos. On Tuesday, it was the newly written,
characteristically whimsical "Money," as well as Frishberg's
now-familiar cry for clarity in their order of appearance, "Who's on
First" (with its brief reference to Abbott &amp; Costello's classic
skit), and a jaunty sendup of a classic Babs Gonzalez bebop line
(with impressive scatting from Dorough).</LD>
<TE>   The bulk of the set, however, was devoted to individual numbers.
Dorough, opening the solo segment, displayed the poignant
undercurrent that is almost always present in his music, especially
in the ballad "But for Now," as well as in the atmospheric,
autobiographical images coursing through "In Arkansas." He wrapped
with a tune he described as a "new blues," "Wily, Wily Woman," in
which Frish- berg joined him instrumentally while adding a few potent
backup-singer-like lines.</TE>
<TE>   Frishberg has an enormous body of work, but anyone expecting him
to simply repeat familiar favorites such as "My Attorney, Bernie" is
likely to be disappointed. For this show, he offered "The Hopi Way,"
a hilarious take on two conflicting cultural points of view,
following with the music he "might have written" for "Jaws," had he
received the assignment. Too bad he didn't, since his laugh-a-line
lyrics thoroughly illustrate why he often has been called the "Woody
Allen of song."</TE>
<TE>   Dorough and Frishberg finished by asking the moderate-sized
audience to suggest possible encore selections. For Frishberg, it was
"Another Song About Paris"--a tune that miraculously manages to be
both nostalgic and sardonic and does so via a brilliant stream of
perfectly rhymed phrases, accurately depicting what he meant when he
told New Yorker writer Whitney Balliett that "good lyrics should come
up to the edge of poetry and turn left."</TE>
<TE>   The audience selection for Dorough was "Baltimore Oriole," the
strangely metaphorical song by Hoagy Carmichael and Paul Francis
Webster.</TE>
<TE>   Dorough has made the number his own over the years, and in this
performance he once again grasped the story of a "lady" Baltimore
oriole dragging her feathers through the snow, transforming it into a
quintessential jazz expression.</TE>
<TE>   *Dave Frishberg and Bob Dorough at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms
Ave., Culver City. Shows at 8 and 9:30 p.m. Admission: Tonight and
Sunday, $25. Friday and Saturday, $30. (310) 271-9039.</TE>

<HD>Getting Ready for a Gathering of Rebels</HD>
<DH>Keith Morris of the Circle Jerks will be one of the
performers at this Saturday's celebration of all things punk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Keith Morris is wondering whether being included as one of the
patriarch acts on a show marking 25 years of punk rock might have
some negative implications.</LD>
<LD>   "Is that 25 years too looong?" he asks, eating a Caesar salad on a
restaurant patio in his Silver Lake neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   The lead singer of the Circle Jerks raises his eyebrows above his
round glasses and under his long dreadlocks as if daring a retort
that perhaps it has been too long.</LD>
<TE>   Well, it is long enough that the daylong concert on Saturday at
the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion will encompass a complete
generation turnover. The bill runs from the Sex Pistols, who set the
U.K. punk standard in 1977 with spitting fury and spiked-hair and
safety-pin styling, to Los Angeles' new keeper of the flame, the
Distillers, whose leader, Brody Armstrong, wasn't even born when Sid
Vicious died in 1979.</TE>
<TE>   It's long enough that it doesn't seem incongruous that the show's
very title bears both the name of a corporate sponsor ("Don't forget
the word 'Levi's,' " Morris sneers on first mention of the show) and
a catchy tag title ("And don't forget the words 'Inland Invasion,' "
he adds).</TE>
<TE>   It's long enough that the once-rebellious music is safely
entrenched in the mainstream, with such bands as the Offspring and
Blink-182 (who are both playing Saturday) having sold millions of
albums, and long enough to have spawned sub-genres, sub-sub-genres
and sub-sub-sub-genres.</TE>
<TE>   And it's long enough that Morris himself has gone from his
late-'70s days of singing with the first version of Black Flag in
whatever South Bay hole they could talk their way into, to recently
getting a job in the very music business that he once disdained--and
that disdained him.</TE>
<TE>   Today he's a talent scout for V2 Records, the company owned by
Virgin founder Richard Branson.</TE>
<TE>   But too long?</TE>
<TE>   It isn't too long to prevent Morris from attending the show not
just as a performer, but also as a passionate fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there are 17 bands on the bill, and I'm a fan of 15 of
them," says Morris, whose severe health problems due to adult onset
diabetes a few years ago has dimmed neither his wit nor his
enthusiasm. "I've seen the Sex Pistols twice and they're amazing. I
saw the Buzzcocks three times--they're brilliant. I saw the Damned a
bunch on the Warped tour and they're amazing."</TE>
<TE>   And it's not only the older acts that attract him.</TE>
<TE>   "The Distillers are a great band," he says. "I liken Brody to a
punk-rock version of Janis Joplin."</TE>
<TE>   Morris hardly will be alone. The show has sold more than 40,000
tickets to the open-air San Bernardino County amphitheater, more than
Ozzfest recently drew to the same location.</TE>
<TE>   The lineup has few holes. There is heavy presence of both the
English old guard and the Jerks' fellow Southern California
first-generationers ranging from urban bohemians X to thoughtful
aggressors Social Distortion and Bad Religion to '80s Orange County
skate-punk icons the Adolescents, TSOL and the Vagrants. And at least
most of the newer bands follow in the progenitors' traditions, if
sometimes only superficially.</TE>
<TE>   And the sponsorship?</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't one of those scenarios where I have to say something
politically correct and put down Levi's, is it?" he says. "I've heard
all these kids complaining. But the Buzzcocks did commercials. Iggy
Pop had 'Search and Destroy' in a Nike ad. I'd rather hear that on TV
than some new band I don't care about."</TE>
<TE>   What bothers Morris is not commercial tie-ins, but commercialism
at the core of music, something that troubled him about some of the
younger bands he saw when the Circle Jerks joined the Warped tour
this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Few of these acts, he felt, had any sense or appreciation of the
social circumstances and political issues that fueled punk in the
first place. "They're boy bands with guitars," he scoffs. "If they
were in car crashes and had severed limbs, they'd still be out there
smiling. It's as if they don't have any real-world experiences."</TE>
<TE>   It's just the sort of thing the Circle Jerks made a career of
spoofing and deflating. Combining cutting sarcasm and furious,
economical aggression (the band's first album, 1980's "Group Sex,"
spewed its eight songs in just 16 minutes), the Jerks' music has
always been marked by a guileless immediacy and a refusal to mince
words.</TE>
<TE>   For Morris' tastes, many of today's bands seem only concerned
about business affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't pay attention to any of that--Billboard charts, sales,"
Morris says. "We were just happy to be playing music, to load up the
van and get out of town. We weren't interested in the business
aspect."</TE>
<TE>   And it's not that different now that he's in the business.</TE>
<TE>   "I work for Jon Sidel out of his house," he says, referring to
V2's West Coast head of A&amp;R. "The idea is, let's keep away from the
creeps. And when I say creeps, it's us vs. them, that mentality."</TE>

<LD>DVD</LD>
<LD>   Slammin' Sammy: The Sammy Sosa Story. Urban Vision Entertainment.
60 minutes. DVD: $19.95 (VHS: $12.95). Ages 6 to 12.</LD>
<LD>   The story of a poor shoeshine boy from the Dominican Republic who
became a major league baseball superstar and a dedicated
philanthropist is the subject of this colorful animated video for
children, crafted with care to deliver meaningful messages about
teamwork, family and community.</LD>
<TE>   Written by Jennie Trias, the tale shows 9-year-old Sammy Sosa
working hard to help bring in some money after his father dies;
finding his way to baseball (despite his preference for boxing) and
working his way from the minor leagues to the majors--twice--before
becoming a star player for the Chicago Cubs. To get there, though,
Sosa must overcome his cocky, know-it-all attitude and remember his
family roots.</TE>
<TE>   Vivid background art, realistic baseball action scenes mixed with
some real-life film footage, and sympathetic characters enliven this
cut-above biographical cartoon, as does its good heart. Extras
include an interview with Sosa and a trivia quiz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mickey's House of Villains. Walt Disney Home Entertainment. 70
minutes. DVD: $29.99 (VHS: $22.99). Ages 5 to 11.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing about this minor effort--an early Halloween-themed
release--is some of the older Disney cartoon shorts that are
interwoven into less interestingly animated and drawn new material.
The premise is that all the Disney villains--Cruella De Vil, Captain
Hook, Jafar, Maleficent, etc.--attending a Halloween show at Mickey's
"House of Mouse" theater, are plotting to take over the place.
Several short cartoons later, the coup occurs, but it is short-lived
thanks to Mickey, his "Fantasia" wizard's hat and Aladdin's magic
lamp.</TE>
<TE>   Extra material includes a "Reel of Misfortune" and "Hidden
Villains" games and a collage of scenes from many Disney cartoons
with music and sound effects.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Seuss: The Cat in the Hat. Sony Wonder. 30 minutes. DVD:
$12.98. Ages 3 to 6.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Seuss' classic tale from the original Beginner Book series,
with Seuss' illustrations enlivened by unobtrusive, minimal
animation, makes for entertaining-true-to-Seuss viewing, but it's no
substitute for the book, which was designed for beginning readers.
There are no extras, but the release includes a second nicely
presented Seuss story, "Maybe You Should Fly a Jet! Maybe You Should
Be a Vet!"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Audio</TE>
<TE>   Bob the Builder: The Album. Koch Entertainment. CD: $17.98. Ages 3
to 9. www.kochint.com</TE>
<TE>   Adults may reach their limit after a few noisily exuberant tracks,
but small fans will undoubtedly go wild for these British-flavored
pop songs from the smash hit preschooler show about a little
construction worker and his pals.</TE>
<TE>   Among the original and adapted songs extolling the joys of tools,
heavy machinery, jolly teamwork and friendship is the golden oldie
"Crocodile Rock" with Elton John. The enhanced CD includes music
video version of the show's theme song, "Can We Fix It?" and a
"Bob"-revised "Mambo No. 5."</TE>

<HD>Actors Fill In Gaps in 'What I Did for Love'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Acting opens floodgates that can be difficult to close again. When
emotions are sent surging forth night after night on stage, they tend
to do the same at home. An actor's life, as a result, can become one
big drama.</LD>
<LD>   Joe Pintauro takes a look at this tendency to treat the world as a
stage in six short plays, collectively titled "What I Did for Love,"
at McCadden Place Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The stories are written with insight and wit--qualities that help
explain why Pintauro's plays, such as "Raft of the Medusa" and "The
Dead Boy," are presented so regularly in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Yet points aren't clearly made and resolutions are left dangling
in this often frustrating and unsatisfying program.</TE>
<TE>   The better tales include "$20 Drinks," in which an effusive Oscar
winner (Carolyn Hennesy) gradually lets an old friend (Laura Skill)
see the vulnerability beneath her glamorous veneer.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Priscilla Barnes, playing a once-famous actress in
"Meeting Toby," exposes the enormous reserves of emotion that
underlie her seemingly psychotic behavior during a dinner with her
ex-husband (Lee Ryan) and his new girlfriend (Jenifer Kingsley).</TE>
<TE>   In the still better "Serious Drama," an actress (P.B. Hutton,
replacing the regular Patty McCormack at the performance under
review) has just been savaged by a prominent critic and informed that
the show will quickly close.</TE>
<TE>   So she's feeling blue when she reports for her day job screening
candidates for a performing academy.</TE>
<TE>   The first applicant turns out to be a priest (Brian Coughlin),
whom she's ready to send packing until his enthusiasm for the
profession begins to restore her lost faith.</TE>
<TE>   In this story as in the others, fine performances--under Geo
Hartley's nurturing direction--fill in some of the gaps in the
writing. The other actors are Rod Britt, Kyle T. Heffner, Juliette
Jeffers, Jay Lacopo, Dolorita Noonan, Justine Reiss and Nick
Salamone.</TE>
<TE>   The play shares its set (by Daryl Latter) and scene-change music
(by Max Baxley) with the musical "Twisted," which takes over the
stage on Friday and Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "What I Did for Love," McCadden Place Theatre, 1157 N. McCadden
Place, Hollywood. Thursdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 29.
$15. (310) 275-9887. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes.</TE>

<LD>   Punk Rockers Score Big on Hall of Fame Ballot</LD>
<LD>   Musicians who emerged during the punk explosion of the late '70s
made a strong showing for the second straight year on the list of
nominees for induction next year into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</LD>
<TE>   The Clash, the Police and Elvis Costello became eligible for the
first time under the rock hall's rule requiring 25 years to pass
since an artist's first recording, while the Sex Pistols are making
their second bid at induction. Punk poet-singer Patti Smith appears
for the third year on the ballot, which was sent to voters last week.
Last year, the Ramones and Talking Heads became the first
punk-generation bands inducted into the hall.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the only other act making the list in its first year of
eligibility is the R&amp;B-disco group Chic. Other previously eligible
performers nominated for the first time include ABBA, the Righteous
Brothers, Steve Winwood, MC5 and Kraftwerk. Previous nominees
returning to the ballot also include AC/DC, Black Sabbath, the Dells
and Lynyrd Skynyrd.</TE>
<TE>   Winners will be announced in December and feted at the hall's
annual induction ceremony next year in New York.</TE>

<TE>   THE ARTS</TE>
<TE>   Two Buildings Irk Designer Herzog</TE>
<TE>   Jacques Herzog, the highly regarded designer of London's Tate
Modern museum, lashed into two of the venue's international
competitors during a seminar at this week's Venice Architecture
Biennale, the London newspaper the Independent reports.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Museum of Modern Art is driven by a cynical and elitist
strategy, said Herzog, claiming that the institution is emblematic of
those portraying art as decoration for charmed lifestyles.</TE>
<TE>   Herzog also targeted Frank Gehry's much-touted Guggenheim Museum
in Bilbao, Spain, which he called a "very bad example for museums in
the future." The gleaming, titanium-clad building is "just
superficial ... like an alien," he maintained.</TE>
<TE>   Though Daniel Libeskind, designer of Berlin's iconic Jewish
Museum, defended Gehry's vision, architecture commentator Charles
Jencks sided with Herzog. Since the Bilbao structure came into being,
"the game is about competitive buildings," Jencks said. "It's a
dangerous game and it's getting more dangerous. In America alone,
there are currently more than 50 museum expansion projects worth a
reported $5 billion."</TE>

<TE>   Works by Goya, Gris Retrieved in Spain</TE>
<TE>   Police say they've cracked Spain's biggest art heist in recent
years with the discovery of 20 stolen artworks by Francisco de Goya,
Juan Gris and others in a home in the Spanish resort town of Playa
D'Aro.</TE>
<TE>   Police suspect that the paintings and antiquities--stolen last
year from the Madrid apartment of one the world's wealthiest women,
Esther Koplowitz--were bound for the collection of a Colombian drug
baron.</TE>
<TE>   The artworks--which included Goya's "The Donkey's Fall," valued at
$9.5 million, and Gris' "Guitar on a Chair"--represent about half of
the estimated $47 million in art stolen from Koplowitz's apartment
while she was on vacation. The other half was recovered in June, when
two of those involved in the robbery tried to sell the pieces to a
police informant in a Madrid hotel.</TE>

commanding lead voice, but amid lush melodies, pristine harmonies and
meticulous orchestration, there isn't a single number that would
spoil a late-summer sunset. The colorful landscapes of "Make Love's"
straight-ahead balladry come to life in the gently churning

<LD>* New this week: Juan Jose Campanella's "Son of the Bride" is a warm
and affectionate Argentine film of wide appeal that was an Academy
Award nominee in the foreign-language category this year. It stars
Ricardo Darin as the 42-year-old proprietor of an upscale Buenos
Aires restaurant, and reunites Hector Alterio and Norma Aleandro,
stars of the 1985 Oscar-winner "The Official Story," as his parents.
Campanella is not interested in plot as much as evoking the everyday
lives of his people and how they interact and affect each other. The
depth of his concern for them and the loving good humor with which he
views them gives his film an infectious emotional richness.</LD>

Life'</HD>

<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A level of garage theater so unfettered as to suggest divine
intervention distinguishes "The Phacts of Life," playing Thursdays at
the L.A. Gay &amp; Lesbian Center's Renberg Theatre to screamingly funny
effect.</LD>
<LD>   Under Christian McLaughlin and Tom Booker's shrewd direction, the
bare-bones sendup has a shark-like drive beneath the adolescent
concept: three episodes of the 1980s NBC sitcom "The Facts of Life,"
presented in their entirety.</LD>
<LD>   From the opening tableau accompanying the theme song, everyone
involved painstakingly replicates the Teflon-coated cadences of the
young ladies of Eastland School, the pride of Peekskill, N.Y.</LD>
<TE>   Here is spoiled heiress Blair (Sam Pancake), diametrically pitted
against streetwise Jo (Steve Sobel). Their younger coevals,
impressionable Natalie (Julie Brown) and excitable Tootie (Daniele
Gaither), function as buffers for these combustible forces.
Overseeing them and scattered guest stars is doting housemother Mrs.
Garrett (Madeline Long).</TE>
<TE>   "Phacts" alternates two sets of message-laden episodes weekly; the
reviewed performance featured "Best Sister," a two-part offering
originally airing in 1983, and "Cousin Geri Returns" from 1981.</TE>
<TE>   "Sister" finds Blair's semi-sibling Meg (Kate Flannery) revealing
she has entered a convent, with Jo's decision to become a bride of
Christ resulting in more than one Danny Thomas-style water-spitting
take.</TE>
<TE>   "Cousin Geri" concerns another Blair relative, the "handicapable"
stand-up comic (Terrence Michael), whose flirtation with French
teacher Mr. Palmer (Jason Ginsberg) elicits typical Eastland School
misunderstandings.</TE>
<TE>   The formulaic scripts have ample risibility factor, but it's the
winking self-commentary supplied by the cast that elevates this to
camp Valhalla.</TE>
<TE>   Long's perfect mimicry of Charlotte Rae's plum-pudding tones grows
more unintelligible with each entrance and/or snort from her flask.
Pancake has Lisa Welchel's twangy Blair-isms down cold, exploring
infinite hilarious variations, especially the lesbian undercurrent
with Sobel's fearlessly hirsute salute to Nancy McKeon's tough girl.</TE>
<TE>   Gaither runs her spot-on Kim Fields portrait through the deadpan
wringer, and Brown makes mincemeat of Mindy Cohn's squinting mien,
with both actors supreme at the "Sister" crisis involving Jo's
artwork.</TE>
<TE>   The second program promises Mink Stole and John Pardee in
"Different Drummer" (Blair and mentally challenged admirer);
"Runaway" (in which Tootie does just that); and a Cousin Geri encore.</TE>
<TE>   Though anarchistic and conceivably incendiary to those sweet souls
who actually revere the television series, the decibel levels of
audience enjoyment indicate that some cagey investor stands to make a
bundle by steering this demented crew into "Real Live Brady Bunch"
territory.</TE>

Sept. 14 through Sept. 29 in venues across Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The first L.A.-based festival took place in 1999 in response to a
call from the Dalai Lama of Tibet, who recognized that just as
religious zeal has the power to divide communities through bloody
fundamentalist conflict, it also has the power to unite them through
mutually respected traditions of worship. Festivals are now
envisioned every third year.</LD>
<LD>   This year's incarnation has expanded to the extent of asking: What
is the sacred? Is it prayer to a deity beyond? Is it touching the god
within? Is it tradition and ritual? Or simply pure beauty?</LD>
<TE>   With more than 200 different acts at 55 events at scores of
locations across the region, the festival is a fascinating experiment
in touching a spiritual chord common to many Angelenos. What follows
are the performances that most intrigued a panel of The Times' music
and dance writers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rahat Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan: It was Rahat's uncle, the late Nusrat
Fateh Ali Khan, who opened U.S. pop ears in the '90s to the
passionate Pakistani vocal style known as qawwali, thanks largely to
a series of concerts in which he offered the most compelling mix of
charisma and passion of any world music figure since reggae king Bob
Marley. Qawwali is the devotional music of Sufi Muslims, but its
spirit, like American gospel music, is so rich with purity and
conviction that it easily crosses language and other boundaries.
Rahat continues the tradition with a deep passion and dedication that
is gloriously liberating. (Saturday)</TE>

<TE>   Voyage of the Black Madonna, Sacred Music of Italy with Alessandra
Belloni and the Our Lady of Lourdes Choir: Singer, dancer and
tambourine virtuoso Alessandra Belloni weaves together an aural
tapestry referencing the cycles of life, women and nature. Backed by
East L.A.'s Our Lady of Lourdes Choir, Belloni will drum as well as
perform a selection of chants from Mexico, Brazil, Portugal, Spain
and France, to one of the most sacred icons of the Catholic Church:
the Black Madonna, said to offer both physical and spiritual healing
powers. Belloni, one of the most famous and revered voices in
Southern Italian music and dance today, has designed a signature
series of tambourines, some of which she will utilize during an
evening that begins and concludes with a candlelight procession
honoring Our Lady of Guadalupe. (Sept. 20)</TE>
<TE>   Lynell George</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nels Cline/Gregg Bendian, "Interstellar Space Revisited": Recorded
just months before his death in 1967, John Coltrane's "Interstellar
Space" became the tenor saxophonist's grand, parting glance. The
Impulse! recording, a sinuous, bracing paring with drummer Ali
Rashied, again challenged the definitions and borders of jazz.
Screeching solos, octave leaps, Coltrane pressed the expectations of
how a saxophone might sound; Rashied reinterpreted the role of
percussion--a pulsing torrent of sound. A spiritual quest? A final
wail? Coltrane's piece was as grand as it was inscrutable. In 1999
guitarist Nels Cline and drummer Gregg Bendian released their
interpretation of the Coltrane classic: "Interstellar Space
Revisited." While respectful of the essence of the original, Cline
and Bendian build their own sonic edifice full of jutting angles and
startling drops. The suite will be performed outdoors at the historic
Shindler house. (Sept. 20)</TE>
<TE>   Lynell George</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mare Tranquillitatis: Performance and visual artist Hirokazu
Kosaka will open a window on a multitude of traditions during his
harvest celebration staged outside in downtown L.A. The event
welcomes the Japanese gods of the sun and moon with bonfires and
gives a nod to U.S. history (Mare Tranquillitatis, Latin for Sea of
Tranquillity, refers to the crater on the moon where astronauts first
set foot). The staging will incorporate references to Noh theater,
and the performers will include a Zen archer, an er hu player (that's
a Chinese stringed instrument), a gagaku ensemble (playing
traditional Japanese court music), and troupes of Hawaiian and
Buddhist chanters. (Sept. 21)</TE>
<TE>   Susan Brenneman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Art of Drumming: There's something both haunting and
mysterious about the freedom and fervor of sacred drumming that can
be as transporting as anything you'll hear on a stage. The lure Sept.
21 is Najite and a drum corps that connects West African and
Afro-Cuban rhythms. To make it all more enticing, the Afro-Cuban
dance ensemble Umbalaiye will also perform. The Sept. 22 fare, too,
is enticing with master drummers and bands including Poncho Sanchez,
Francis Awe and the Nigerian Talking Drum Ensemble scheduled to help
lift your burdens. (Sept. 21-22)</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sacred Music of Duke Ellington: Known for his lush,
suit-and-black tie concert hall or nightclub arrangements, jazz
composer and bandleader Duke Ellington occasionally infused his
recordings with hints of his religious undergirding. (As a child
growing up in Washington, D.C., he often attended two church services
on Sundays: one at his mother's Baptist church and another at his
father's AME Zion.) During the last decade of his life, after writing
a liturgical work for San Francisco's then-new Grace Cathedral, he
turned further inward and began to explore the sound of his faith.
The Luckman Jazz Orchestra, under the direction of flutist James
Newton, will interpret Ellington's work. (Sept. 21)</TE>
<TE>   Lynell George</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Philharmonic, Mozart Requiem: Mozart's has become the
unofficial requiem of choice for remembering the victims of the Sept.
11 attacks. Verdi's may be more theatrical, Faure's more ethereally
beautiful, but Mozart found the perfect combination of drama and
understatement. Mozart doesn't ask for tears, or even reflection.
Instead, he invites us to enter into what, if the circumstances are
right, can feel like a state of grace. The circumstances surely will
be right, atmospherically speaking, for the performance by the Los
Angeles Philharmonic and Master Chorale on Sept. 27, in the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The acoustics probably won't be
ideal; large churches can sound like caverns. But any composer who
communicates as well as Mozart does across the ages shouldn't have
too much trouble getting his message across. (Sept. 27)</TE>
<TE>   Mark Swed</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cudamani: If Bali is, as it is often called, the morning of the
world, then its wake-up call is the gamelan. This "orchestra" is a
metal-orgy of bells, xylophones and brass gongs, all elaborately
decorated and played in patterns of overlapping melodies and rhythms
intended to make its audience and performers feel marvelous. Every
gamelan is unique, often the individual product of a village or
family (or here in the West of a university music department).
Cudamani, which appears for the first time in the U.S. Sept. 28 at
the intimate Wilshire Ebell Theater, is a professional company of
musicians and dancers who live and work together but participate in
part of a larger community. They will be something new to nearly all
of us. (Sept. 28)</TE>
<TE>   Mark Swed</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whirling Dervishes of Damascus: Music is believed to possess
remarkable spiritual powers in the Sufi tradition. Those powers,
described as sama (listening), are associated with meditation,
ecstasy and the achievement of a state of grace. One of their most
impressive visual manifestations is displayed in the extraordinarily
colorful, trance-producing dances of the Whirling Dervishes of
Damascus. Rotating in nonstop unison, skirts flying, left hand
lowered, right hand raised to symbolize the connection between heaven
and Earth, their performances are mesmerizing expressions of the
spiritual essence of music and dance. (Sept. 29)</TE>
<TE>   Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lifou Island Dance Theater: The explorers and missionaries who
nearly destroyed so many native cultures across the Pacific were less
thorough when they reached the far reaches of Melanesia. Which means
you can still find unadulterated native rites in places like Lifou
Island, New Caledonia. The country is best known for its amazing
marine biodiversity, but the 16-member Lifou Island Dance Theater is
reputed to be another spectacular natural resource. With costumes
made from plants and makeup that evokes the animal kingdom, this
intense performing company, making its U.S. debut, may well give
festival-goers a glimpse of the wild untamed Pacific that existed
before "discovery." (Sept. 29)</TE>

<LD>With little more than bootstrap determination and their own
imagination, people across the country are taking to their own
backyards to stage wrestling events not entirely dissimilar from
those on network and cable TV nightly.</LD>
<LD>   Some cling to hopes of achieving stardom, some exorcise inner
demons and some are just looking for a little fun before settling
into college and a career. In a way, it's not that different from
being in a band or playing pickup baseball, except for the barbed
wire, shattered lightbulbs and blood.</LD>
<LD>   Screening on Saturday and Sunday as part of this year's Silver
Lake Film Festival, director Paul Hough's documentary film "The
Backyard" discovers there are as many motives to engage in these
displays of amateur showmanship and theatrical bloodletting as there
are participants.</LD>
<TE>   These groups of spirited youngsters (mostly male, mostly under 25)
put on the shows for each other and for the benefit of an informal
network linked by public access TV and the Internet. Think of it as
"Jackass" crossed with "Fight Club."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A native of London, Hough, 29, came to the U.S. 10 years ago when
he used the proceeds from a script sale to finance his film school
education at NYU. Following graduation, he directed a short-lived
chat show on the Fox Sports Network. A fan of pro wrestling since the
heyday of "Wrestlemania," Hough moved on to direct some wrestlers'
entrance videos and eventually landed at the show "Women of
Wrestling." It was there he saw his first backyard wrestling tape
after some kids sent it in as an audition.</TE>
<TE>   Fascinated, he searched the Internet and uncovered hundreds of
backyard "federations." Two brothers invited him to their home
outside Reno to witness their "Three Stages of Hell" match.</TE>
<TE>   Attending mostly out of curiosity, "I didn't really know what to
expect," says Hough. "And I got great footage of their barbed-wire
cage and a burning pit. Then their mum turns up. I expected her to
yell at her sons--'How could you do this?'--but she was more
concerned with whether they'd had a good match. At that point, I
realized it was a world I didn't understand."</TE>
<TE>   Traveling throughout Nevada, California, Arizona, New York and
even to England, Hough found an underground of colorful characters
with names that varied from the serious, such as Chaos, Scar and
Heartless, to the satiric, such as ADD Dave, Big Mac and With Spork.
A few of the wrestlers he encountered have since moved on to the
regional professional circuits.</TE>
<TE>   In compiling more than 50 hours of footage, it initially was
tempting to strike a poise of ironic superiority, but he felt such
sympathy for their dedication that he decided to maintain a more
level-headed approach. He also wanted to avoid any accusatory
finger-pointing, though he does include the anguished plea of one
parent begging her child to stop mid-match.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most surprising things in "The Backyard" is how
supportive many wrestlers' parents are. Hough says he saw no one get
"really, really" hurt during shooting, but concedes that there has
been at least one reported death on the backyard circuit. Even in
that case, he says, the parents accepted responsibility for what
happened and did not blame the others involved.</TE>
<TE>   Another surprise is the diverse opinions within the ranks of
backyard wrestlers as to just how far is too far. "Extreme Death
Match" is regarded by many as giving wrestling a bad name. Death
Match wrestlers--as emblematized by the Arizona wrestler Chaos, whose
signature move is stapling a calling card to the forehead of his
defeated opponents--believe the more technical wrestlers just can't
take it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So far the film has been a success on the festival circuit,
including three recent screenings at the Edinburgh Film Festival,
while gaining some interest from distributors both in the U.S. and
abroad. At a sold-out screening at this year's South-by-Southwest
Film Festival in Austin, Texas, a viewer passed out from the sight of
one particularly bloody match. Although he was there, Hough didn't
hear about it until the next day, when the theater manager asked him
if it was a publicity stunt.</TE>
<TE>   Other reactions have run the gamut from support to shock.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody brings in their own opinions," says Hough. "Before a
screening in Atlanta, someone sent me a death threat through the
e-mail, claiming to be a professional wrestler and that he would kill
me if he ever saw me. And after that screening I got another message
from the same person apologizing and saying how much he liked the
film."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's screening, the film's West Coast premiere, will be a
full-on event, featuring a musical performance by Seth Jordan, who
did the film's score, and an introduction by Barry Blaustein,
director of the popular pro wrestling documentary "Beyond the Mat." A
question-and-answer session with some of the film's wrestlers,
including Scar and the Flying Lizard, will follow.</TE>
<TE>   The world of backyard wrestling is not for the faint of heart, but
there is something undeniably inspirational in the inventiveness and
determination of its participants. As one of the Gates brothers, the
amateur grapplers from Reno who first got Hough involved, puts it, "I
would do just about anything to be a [wrestling] superstar. As long
as it wasn't seriously illegal or didn't involve eating people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Backyard" will be shown Saturday at 5 p.m. at the Vista
Theatre and Sunday and 11:15 a.m. at the Los Feliz Theater 3. (323)
993-7225.</TE>

<DH>Latino Museum opens its temporary site with Ramses Noriega
works viewing everyday emotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PAGEL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Latino Museum of History, Art and Culture has inaugurated its
temporary home on a sunken courtyard of the Los Angeles Mall with an
exhibition of 60 works by Ramses Noriega. Including etchings,
drawings, watercolors, oils, acrylics, serigraphs and laser prints
made between 1963 and 2001, the hit-and-miss survey reveals the
Fresno-based artist to be a dedicated dabbler, a casual draftsman
whose love of line unifies a modest body of work that is all over the
place in terms of style, subject and media.</LD>
<LD>   The title, "Ramses Noriega: From Politics to Spirituality," is
misleading. It suggests that Noriega's art developed along thematic
lines; but although politics and spirituality are touched on by about
a third of the works, handsomely installed in the former offices of
the City Ethics Commission, the majority depict figures whose
relationship to those topics is peripheral.</LD>
<LD>   As an artist, Noriega appears to be driven by the desire to
capture the emotional lives of ordinary folks. His most captivating
works fuse elements of portraiture with aspects of landscape, melding
inner and outer worlds in evocative blends of abstraction and
representation. Line is the glue that holds everything together,
tracing jittery gestures or following bold strokes that clearly
divide figure from ground.</LD>
<TE>   The two earliest works, from 1963, are conventional portraits that
pay homage to Van Gogh and Cezanne. Imagine what the Dutch painter's
potato eaters would look like if they were tidied up, given long
lashes and big doe-y eyes. This gives you idea of the sweetness at
the heart of Noriega's art.</TE>
<TE>   Stark pen-and-ink studies and wiry, acerbic etchings dominate the
rest of the works from the 1960s, which often depict surrealistic
figures set against bare backgrounds that are as vacant as the void.
Picasso's multi-faced femme fatales appear to have influenced Noriega
(perhaps a bit too literally), as have Francis Bacon's mutant
humanoids (whose flesh seems to be melting) and Wifredo Lam's spiky
hybrids (whose animal impulses are barely held in check by their
desire to be civilized).</TE>
<TE>   Through the 1960s, Noriega's figures began to merge with their
surroundings. "Cain and Abel" (1969) links the battling brothers in a
grid of frantic cross-hatching.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '70s, the influence of Pop art gave Noriega's
increasingly all-over compositions a cartoonish, jigsaw-puzzle
quality. In "Bajito" (1973) and "La Goulie" (1974), people, cars,
bulls and musical instruments are entangled in urban settings. It's
difficult--and pleasurable--to follow the meandering lines of the
postcard-size drawings, figuring out where one object ends and
another begins.</TE>
<TE>   Chicano street posters had an even greater impact on Noriega's
art, whose graphic punch increased dramatically. Five prints,
advertising protests, rallies and concerts, form the show's political
component.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, Noriega delivered his best works. Paintings such as
"Faces" (1986), "The Soul Carrier" (1986) and "Justice" (1988) use
acrylic on canvas to combine the vividness of his early works with
the all-over expansiveness of his small drawings from the '70s. Even
more striking are his mixed-media drawings. "Lluvias" (1987), "The
Professor" (1988) and "San Felipe Fishermen" (1988) create the
impression that you're in the presence of aged figures who carry the
past with them.</TE>
<TE>   Where Noriega's early drawings and etchings embrace vigorous,
sometimes violent gestures, and rely, for their effect, on shocking
mutations, more recent pieces appear to have mellowed with age. The
crevasses in the wrinkled faces of their figures resemble weathered
desert landscapes across which much has been written.</TE>
<TE>   Some of this seasoned ruggedness haunts a handful of his works
from the 1990s, but most abandon such hard-won toughness for
platitudes about peace, love and contentment. In vapid pastels, like
"Praying Hands" (1999), and cliche-ridden laser prints, like "Jesus I
Offer You My Heart" (1998) and "God's Love" (1999), Noriega replaces
the unsettling anxiousness of his best works with harmonious
resolution so bland it's toothless.</TE>
<TE>   The religious or spiritual subject matter is not the problem. The
way Noriega has pictured it is. Compare "Adam" (1993) and "From
Communism to Jesus" (1998). Both page-size images depict a solitary
figure reading a book. The first shows a man crouched on the ground.
The self-doubt that riddles his anxious, Cubist-inspired face is
nowhere to be found in the laser-printed pastel, in which a man in a
baseball cap reads a book from which light spills in abundance.</TE>
<TE>   "Adam" embodies uncertainty; you feel it in your bones. In
contrast, its counterpart merely illustrates the idea of happiness.
Visually, "From Communism to Jesus" lacks the impact of the earlier
work. Its contentment is too self-satisfied to be contagious.</TE>
<TE>   But all is not lost. In "Fishermen and Fish" (1996) and "El
Southwest" (1999), Noriega flaunts his skills as a draftsman,
depicting grizzled old-timers and a mythical satyr, all of whom
appear to be trapped in a landscape that is anything but alien.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Still at a peak of enthusiasm and camaraderie after a three-week tour
of festivals in Lucerne, Edinburgh, London, Brussels and Helsinki,
the Los Angeles Philharmonic gave its first home concert Tuesday at
the Hollywood Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   It was a warm family affair in several ways. Martin Chalifour, the
orchestra's principal concertmaster, was the splendid soloist in
Bruch's Violin Concerto No. 1. Yasuo Shinozaki, the assistant
conductor, was masterly in leading his second Bowl program of the
season, which also included works by Beethoven and Tchaikovsky.</LD>
<LD>   While the orchestra might have played well for any conductor at
this point, there was something special about Shinozaki. The
30-year-old conductor hasn't learned the meaning of routine. Music is
still a journey of discovery. Continued exposure to him breeds
increased respect and affection.</LD>
<TE>   In a well-paced account of the Overture to Beethoven's "Fidelio,"
which opened the program, he found its subtlety and nuance as well as
its quicksilver energy and darting accents.</TE>
<TE>   In Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, which closed the program, he
combined sophistication and freshness over a vast canvas. He
envisioned the work as a tight unit, taking the briefest of pauses
between the first and second and between the third and fourth
movements, thereby revealing a continuity of structure and effect.</TE>
<TE>   The amplification system assisted by clearly conveying the
orchestra's rhythmically crisp and alert playing, with the mid-voices
richly supportive.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying Chalifour in the Bruch Concerto, however, Shinozaki
revealed some lacks. He remained very intent on just maintaining the
beat. The lyrical give-and-take necessary for such romantic music
emerged--erupted, actually--only in the purely orchestral sections,
which soared.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, soloist and conductor seemed to be deferring to each
other. Chalifour sounded freest and most expansive in those portions
in which he could flower alone. While there was nothing lacking in
his ardor, power and eloquence, a closer match by the orchestra would
have been welcome.</TE>

<LD>No. 5 for the Goodells: Whist restaurant in Santa Monica may be the
hot reservation in town, but Tim and Liza Goodell are already on to
their next venture. The couple's fifth restaurant is called the
Lodge, and it opened in mid-August in a Costa Mesa shopping center
called the Camp.</LD>
<LD>   The Lodge serves comfort food in a setting complete with antlers
on the wall. The menu includes a roast turkey dinner with Tim's
mother's wild rice stuffing, lots of steaks, chicken pot pie and
onion rings. The smell of the kitchen's mesquite wood-burning grill
wafts through the dining room. The prices are moderate, with dinner
entrees $10 to $20.</LD>

<HD>DeMille's 'Cheat' Gives Festival a Lift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Silver Lake Film Festival, running tonight through Sept. 21 at
the Vista Theater and other venues, will present a mix of films old
and new, traditional and unconventional, that mirror the community
and its colorful past and present. There will be some raunchy and
bizarre offerings, to be sure, and the festival will close with Cecil
B. DeMille's delightfully sensational interracial melodrama "The
Cheat" (1915), starring Sessue Hayakawa and Fannie Ward, a stage
veteran of the era and famed as an early enthusiast of the face lift.</LD>
<LD>   The festival opens tonight at 7 at the Vista with "Letters of the
Underground," in which 15 filmmakers contribute vignettes inspired by
the correspondence, diary entries and journals of innovative artists
ranging from Jack Kerouac, Andy Warhol, Patti Smith to Luis Bunuel. A
couple were available for preview, and Todd Hughes' take on Gertrude
Stein (Dominique Dibbell) and Alice B. Toklas (Jamie Tolbert
Franklin) is exquisitely original .</LD>
<TE>   Iva Svarcova's "When Grandpa Loved Rita Hayworth" (Vista, Sunday
at 1 p.m.) is a bittersweet Czech comedy, a warm family chronicle in
which giddy, even sitcom-like moments collide tellingly with the
painful twists and turns of history. It takes place between the moon
landing in 1969 and the astronauts' return to Earth, and during that
time 13-year-old Hannah (Karen Fisher) and her parents and little
sister have undergone their own adventurous journey. With the tragic
end of the "Prague Spring" with the Russian invasion, Hannah's
parents decide they must flee the country, but only West Germany will
take them.</TE>
<TE>   For the father, Kuba (Vladimir Hajda), it means a return to the
land in which he was once a concentration camp prisoner. For his
wife, Lida (Ewa Gawryluk), West Germany becomes a consumer's
paradise. While little Maruska (Veronika Albrechtova) grows silent,
the resilient Hannah is open to new experiences and copes well. The
film is a tribute to family solidarity in the face of adversity.</TE>
<TE>   Film lovers lament the terrible loss of old movies on nitrate film
stock. The occasional disintegrating image on a newly preserved film
usually creates a sense that it has been rescued in the nick of time.
Bill Morrison's imaginative experimental feature "Decasia"
(Micheltorena School, Saturday 11:15 a.m.)--the title is a play on
"Fantasia"-- flies in the face of that sentiment. A collage of
disintegrating--or made to seem disintegrating--found footage set to
Michael Gordon's symphony, "Decasia" discovers beauty in decay, and
images that seemed to be licked by flames or attacked by fungus
possess an alternately lacy and cobwebby quality that elicits the
feeling that we are watching the past fade before our very eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Along with many sidebar events the Silver Lake festival offers an
array of significant classics and revivals, such as Allison Anders,
Dean Lent and Kurt Voss' "Border Radio," as well as "Chinatown,"
"Toll of the Sea," "Eyes Without a Face," "Johns" and a tribute to
Shirley Knight composed of "Dutchman" and "The Dark at the Top of the
Stairs." Among worthy films resurfacing from ecent local festivals
are "Better Luck Tomorrow," a satirical look at a ferociously
ambitious Filipino American high school senior, Paul Cox's
venturesome, Impressionist "The Diaries of Vaslav Nijinsky," the
good-natured "Tattoo: A Love Story" and "Night Train," a noirish
thriller set in Tijuana. (323) 993-7225.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Laemmle Theaters Documentary Days series continues at the
Sunset 5 Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. with one of its most
extraordinary offerings, Monteith McCallum's "Hybrid." The filmmaker
presents a portrait of his grandfather, Milford Beeghly, set against
a poetic evocation of the Iowa farmlands where Beeghly has spent his
life. Muted black and white give McCallum's images the look of steel
engravings, and they provide a sharp contrast to a remarkably sturdy
old man. Milford Beeghly was a pioneer in the crossbreeding of corn,
a man who married late and was so obsessed in his experiments and
promoting his superior seeds that he had little time for his wife and
children. Yet McCallum clearly developed a rapport with his
grandfather, who has mellowed a bit with age and a happy second
marriage following the death of the mother of his children. With his
deep voice and flat Midwestern drawl, Beeghly speaks with the quiet
force and clarity of a biblical patriarch as he reveals a profound
spiritual connection with the land. Beeghly, approaching his 100th
birthday, emerges as a man as warm and humorous as he is heroic in
stature. (323) 848-3500.</TE>
<TE>   "Hybrid" screens at 11 a.m. on the weekend only Sept. 21 and 22 at
the Monica 4-Plex, (310) 397-9741; Sept. 28 and 29 at the Playhouse
7, Pasadena, (626) 844-6500; and Oct. 5 and 6 at the Fallbrook, West
Hills, (818) 340-8710.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The International Documentary Assn.'s DOCtober in September
Showcase runs Friday through Thursday at the Monica 4-Plex. Among the
films screening is Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe's "Lost in La Mancha,"
which was supposed to record Terry Gilliam's fulfilling a 10-year
dream of filming his "The Man Who Killed Don Quixote," in which
Johnny Depp is an advertising man time-warped into the past where Don
Quixote (Jean Rochefort) mistakes him for Sancho Panza. Instead, it
is an account of a nightmare in which flash floods on location in
Spain plus Rochefort being felled by a double-herniated disc halts
production after only six days. It is a portrait of a group of film
professionals struggling to overcome adversity but realistically
accepting defeat. The tantalizing little that Gilliam was able to
shoot, however, suggests that he is right to try to resurrect the
project so appropriate to a filmmaker who has tilted at his own
windmills.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Van Vleet's "Terror from Within" makes an engrossing,
persuasive case that Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols did not act
alone in the Oklahoma City bombing. One has to wonder how Van Vleet
got hold of so much footage of paramilitary activities at various
far-right enclaves that McVeigh seemingly had far greater contact
with than is generally known. In any event, Van Vleet puts it to good
use in a chilling account in which he accuses the FBI of failing to
grasp information that might have prevented the bombing and of
subsequent cover-ups. All films in "DOCtober" screen seven times.
(213) 534-3600.</TE>

<TE>   The American Cinematheque is bringing back to the Egyptian today
through Sunday Neil Marshall's horror film "Dog Soldiers," which
finds a group of British soldiers on exercise maneuvers in a remote
area of the Scottish Highlands where people tend to disappear. Before
one can say "The Blair Witch Project," scary stuff starts
happening--scarier (and gorier) than in the low-budget 1999
phenomenon. Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd and Emma Cleasby star. (323)
466-FILM.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With "Low Heights," which opens a regular run Friday at the Music
Hall, Iranian filmmaker Ebrahim Hatamikia has taken the hoary
plane-hijacking plot and given it a brave political twist.
Unfortunately, while airborne it is weighed down with an excess
baggage of histrionics, messages and protracted running time. He
started with a terrific premise: An impoverished man, Gasheem (Hamid
Faroknejad), desperate to emigrate to give his family a better life,
hijacks a plane from Ahwaz, a town 40 miles from the border with
Iraq, on a 20-minute flight to the city of Bandar Abbass. Hatamikia
is critical of the lot of the poor in Iran and of government policies
that make immigration so difficult for ordinary citizens. (310)
274-6869.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fans of ABC News' straight-talking "Nightline" program can check out
the show's kookier cousin tonight at 10 on KCET.</LD>
<LD>   "Life 360" is going after a younger, hipper demographic by slicing
and dicing a single topic each week and then jazzing up the results
with humor, computer graphics and a heaping helping of attitude.
"Nightline" veterans Dan Morris and Michel Martin are on hand as
executive producer and host, respectively, but what they've come up
with is at best a mixed bag.</LD>
<LD>   With "Money" the topic tonight, the show examines the inner
workings of a kids' lemonade stand and takes us behind the scenes of
an ad agency's marketing campaign. The latter segment purports to be
a look at creating demand, but it's more about how to shoot a TV
commercial. An interview with a financial expert, conducted in a
pitch-black studio a la Charlie Rose, and a comedy sketch with the
usually funny Jake Johannsen also fall a bit flat.</LD>
<TE>   But correspondent Robert Krulwich's trip to a Las Vegas pawn shop
just about saves the day. The owner has become a millionaire by
servicing the short-handed as well as the truly desperate. He also
possesses a mind-set only a pit boss could love.</TE>
<TE>   "My son says I'm the only living heart donor," he admits with a
chilly chuckle. "And they didn't put one back in."</TE>

<HD>Screenwriters Get Their Due on DVDs</HD>

<LD>Screenwriters finally get their due on the digital editions of two
recent releases: "Changing Lanes" and "The Count of Monte Cristo."</LD>
<LD>   Screenwriters often get short shrift in the film community and
that has been the case on most DVDs--the director and the stars are
usually interviewed while the scribe is barely mentioned. But on the
DVDs of "Changing Lanes" (Paramount, $20) and "The Count of Monte
Cristo" (Touchstone, $30), the writers are actually given their own
featurettes.</LD>
<LD>   Both Chap Taylor and Michael Tolkin, who penned "Changing Lanes,"
discuss the film, which stars Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson. And
the very funny Jay Wolpert talks about the trials and tribulations of
adapting "Monte Cristo," Alexandre Dumas' 19th century tale of
revenge, for modern audiences.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Francis Ford Coppola's son, Roman, makes his directorial debut
with the disappointing "CQ" (MGM, $27), a film-within-a-film set in
1969 about the turbulent problems surrounding the production of a hip
sci-fi film. The sci-fi film itself, "Codename Dragonfly," is a lot
of fun, but the "real" story about the making of the film is a
snooze.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes literate commentary from Coppola--who is a real
film buff--and his cinematographer, Robert Yeohman; an amusing
"Chronique D'un Cineaste," which is Coppola's own visual diary of the
production; and the revealing "Ellie--On the Set of 'CQ,' " mom
Eleanor Coppola's documentary on the production. The most enjoyable
extras on the DVD deal with "Codename Dragonfly," including a
behind-the-scenes documentary, audio commentary, a cut of the film
and the trailer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Several documentaries about the Sept. 11 attacks are currently
available on both video and DVD: Paramount's "9/11: The Filmmakers'
Commemorative Edition" ($15 each for VHS and DVD) is an expanded
version of the CBS special that features 20 minutes of previously
unseen footage and an extra 50 minutes of interviews on the DVD;
HBO's "In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01" ($20 for each format)
incorporates visual material from more than 100 people in and around
New York City; and Artisan's "Operation Enduring Freedom: America
Fights Back" ($15 for each format); "World Trade Center: Anatomy of
the Collapse" ($15 for VHS; $20 for DVD); and "New York Firefighters:
The Brotherhood of 9/11" ($15 for both formats).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Before he died in July at age 72, John Frankenheimer directed one
of his best films, HBO's "Paths to War," and recorded an audio
commentary for one of his favorite films, the 1969 melodrama "The
Gypsy Moths" (Warner, $20). Listening to the colorful, authoritative
director is akin to taking a directing class at a film school.</TE>
<TE>   Critics gave mixed reviews to "Gypsy Moths," starring Burt
Lancaster, Gene Hackman and Scott Wilson as men who travel the
Midwest doing parachute stunt shows. Though it's not up to the par of
such Frankenheimer classics as "The Manchurian Candidate," he says it
was one of his two or three personal favorites because it fell into a
genre he loved--character-based action movies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anchor Bay has resurrected Kathryn Bigelow's stylish 1987 thriller
"Near Dark" ($30). This quirky, inspired vampire western focuses on a
young man who suddenly finds himself a member of a truly bizarre
vampire family after a beautiful young woman bites him. Adrian
Pasdar, Jenny Wright, Lance Henrickson and Bill Paxton star.</TE>
<TE>   The two-disc set features commentary from Bigelow, deleted scenes
with commentary, original storyboards and a comprehensive new
documentary on the making of the film.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Has there ever been a series as smarmy as "The Bachelor"? The ABC
unscripted series became a water-cooler hit earlier this year as
viewers tuned in for six weeks to discover which one of 25 single
gals bachelor Alex would pick for his one and only.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD of the series (Warner, $20) features all the episodes plus
extra goodies, including a phone conversation between Alex and
teary-eyed runner-up Trista, and Alex and Amanda's secret weekend
getaway in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The latest series from Aardman Animations, the creators of
"Chicken Run" and the Oscar-winning Wallace &amp; Gromit shorts, is "Rex
the Runt," a clay-animated comedy about four domesticated Plasticine
dogs. The animation is terrific, but "Runt's" story is a bit puny.
A&amp;E has imported both seasons of the series on VHS and DVD ($30 for
each format).</TE>

<HD>Summer's Close Heralded by Opening of College Galleries</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A sure sign of the new art and culture season in Ventura, and
summer's end, comes with the opening of the art galleries at Ventura
College.</LD>
<LD>   The spaces usually showcase artists visiting from outside the
area, giving us something fresh to look at and think about.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, the gallery doors opened on two very different shows,
in Gallery 2 and New Media Gallery.</LD>
<TE>   Painter Emigdio Vasquez's work in Gallery 2 represents what he
calls "Chicano Social Realist" art, descending from the historical
lineage that includes the Ash Can School and the Social Realists of
the Depression era. Orange-based Vasquez documents the daily life and
urban landscapes of Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   With these paintings, Vasquez shows a frank and compassionate eye
for the texture of life in the barrio. He chronicles telling scenes,
with an almost photo-realist style. In "Operation Gatekeeper,"
crestfallen would-be immigrants in handcuffs hang their heads,
appearing the very picture of dejection.</TE>
<TE>   "Day Laborers" finds men lying in wait, seeking work, like figures
in suspended animation propped up in an intentionally static
composition. Orange pickers in a grove in "Las Piscadores" also
appear wooden, in a theatrical way, as if worker drones in a
too-orderly composition. He also depicts people basking in the
sublime "trivial" slices of life.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the human element, Vasquez is intrigued by storefronts and
surface effects, whether the shadow-draped, pulpy pink wall in "The
Orange Deli" or the optical trickery of reflective shop windows in
"La Calle Cuatro."</TE>
<TE>   As a diversion to this composite portrait of a culture, Vasquez
also pays respects to a Mexican art icon by including a portrait of
Frida Kahlo.</TE>
<TE>   Realism, of the social or other variety, is the last thing on Pat
Merrill's mind. The Cal Poly-based artist's mixed-media print works
in the New Media Gallery wrestle with male archetypes and gashes in
America's psychosocial fabric.</TE>
<TE>   A common thematic element in his works is a recurring image of a
man, depicted in the expressionistic medium of woodcut, contorted and
struggling within a box. The gashing, rippling surface effect
suggests exposed sinew, which simultaneously evokes vulnerability and
superhuman strength.</TE>
<TE>   A dark comic aspect is evident in Merrill's approach. In one
piece, our literally muscle-baring man is surrounded by smaller,
floating images of comic book superheroes, with a subtle text
delivering a message at the bottom: "the hero as source of
legitimization of male dominance."</TE>
<TE>   More often than not, images of conflict filter into the work, in
terms of personal and global instability. We find, in the margins, an
image bank referring to the World Trade Center tragedy, stills from
violent Hollywood films and American landmarks, which, post-9/11,
seem to suggest fragility as much as grandeur.</TE>
<TE>   Glints of hope shine through too, as in an image with the central
male figure surrounded by bouncing, blissful infants.</TE>
<TE>   * "Emigdio Vasquez: Life in the Barrio" and "Pat Merrill:
Printmaker," Ventura College galleries, 4667 Telegraph Road, Ventura,
end Sept. 27. Call for hours: (805) 648-8974.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish Songstress: Ojai's pearly voiced Perla Batalla has long
been one of the reliably stirring musical figures calling Ventura
County home. Her resume, which includes work with Leonard Cohen, k.d.
lang and the Gipsy Kings, has expanded to a solo career in the past
decade that has benefited the cause of mixed-culture mestiza music,
blending Mexican traditions and pop sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   When she kicks off this season's Pieces of the World performance
series, Saturday in the Oak Grove Pavilion in Ojai, she'll have her
latest musical field report in tow.</TE>
<TE>   Her new CD, "Discoteca Batalla," is an impressive, mostly acoustic
forum for her rich and evocative vocals and her roots in Latin music.</TE>
<TE>   The title refers to her parents' record store in Los Angeles, a
second home as she grew up, soaking up diverse sounds and gaining a
sense of cultural belonging.</TE>
<TE>   A mixed feast of material from Mexico and then some, the album is
a fresh, sonorous treat and even includes a cool, new,
percussion-driven take on "Guantanamera."</TE>
<TE>   Check it, and her, out.</TE>
<TE>   * Perla Batalla, Oak Grove Pavilion, 220 W. Lomita Ave., Ojai,
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Advance, $18; $20 at the door. (805) 646-8907.</TE>

<HD>Argentina's Bankers Still Cautious</HD>
<DH>Economy: Government is bullish about a move to ease the
banking freeze, but political problems leave some wary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURENCE NORMAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentina's bankers sounded a cautious note Wednesday after the
government partially eased a 9-month-old banking freeze, allowing
savers to withdraw billions of pesos from their deposits.</LD>
<LD>   Economy Minister Roberto Lavagna announced Tuesday evening that
Argentines would be allowed to withdraw as much as $1,940 from
higher-rate, longer-term accounts, known as term deposits, as of Oct
1.</LD>
<LD>   Banks also will let savers withdraw as much as $2,770 from their
term deposits. Lavagna said the new measures would let 60% of funds
in term deposits be removed from the banking freeze, which was
introduced in December to stem a run on deposits.</LD>
<TE>   Lavagna also offered savers the chance to swap the deposits that
will remain frozen in the banking system for 10-year government bonds
or private bank debts--the second part of a bond-for-deposits swap
begun in July.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday, Cabinet Chief Alfredo Atanasof dismissed fears that
Argentines quickly would convert freed-up pesos into dollars. Such a
move would weaken the already devalued currency, fuel inflation and
rattle the nation's shaky banks.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the government was bullish about the effects of easing
the restrictions, bankers were cautious.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the government wants to see what direction Argentines
take with their cash ... if they'll turn to buying dollars or buying
goods," said Jose Barrionuevo, director of Emerging Market Strategy
at Barclays Capital. "Money is going to leave the banks. The question
is, where will it go?"</TE>
<TE>   The government believes there are economic signs that Argentines
won't use the money to buy dollars.</TE>
<TE>   First, the currency has held steady at 3.60 pesos per dollar for
three months, despite losing 70% of its value from January to May.
Recently introduced exchange controls could firm up that stability.</TE>
<TE>   Second, since mid-July Argentines have put more money into banks
than they've withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   But Mario Vicens, president of the Argentine Banking Assn., said
that while easing the banking freeze could be the first step in
rebuilding Argentina's financial system, success hinges on how the
government handles other political challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "If things remain calm ... and all the players in the current
situation act responsibly, then this will end successfully," Vicens
told local news agency Diarios y Noticias.</TE>
<TE>   But Argentine politics haven't been calm of late.</TE>
<TE>   Daily street protests by those with money trapped in the banks,
feuding in President Eduardo Duhalde's Peronist party ahead of March
elections and threats by lawmakers to impeach Supreme Court justices
created a volatile political situation.</TE>
<TE>   Argentina has been in recession since 1998. The economy is
expected to contract about 15% this year, according to private
studies, and the unemployment rate stands at 21.3%. In December, the
country defaulted on a record $141-billion public debt.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Terminates Goldman Contract</HD>
<DH>Investing: The pension fund says the outside manager of
stock investments has under-performed the benchmark.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KAHN</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>CalPERS has fired Goldman Sachs as a fund manager for $663 million in
U.S. stock investments after the Wall Street firm under-performed a
customized benchmark over four years, a spokesman for the biggest
U.S. public pension fund said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as
CalPERS, made the disclosure in an annual review of the $11.7 billion
in U.S. stock investments it entrusts to 11 outside fund managers.</LD>
<LD>   The decision to terminate the Goldman Sachs contract was made at
an Aug. 19 meeting of the CalPERS investment board and came after the
large-cap growth fund under-performed its benchmark starting with the
boom market of 1998 and ending June 30.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS data showed Goldman Sachs fund managers lost 27.3% over
that period, after fees.</TE>
<TE>   By most measures, large-cap growth stocks led the market with
double-digit returns in the mid-to late 1990s, only to be replaced by
small-cap value stocks in 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Goldman Sachs' investment process did not show the ability to
outperform the benchmark in any market environment," CalPERS' staff
wrote in the fund's annual review.</TE>
<TE>   As a group, CalPERS' outside fund managers lost 17.8% in the in
the 12 months ended June 30, somewhat better than the 18% loss in the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 but worse than the 17.4% decline in the
specially designed benchmark index the pension employs.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for Goldman Sachs, whose New York office lost the
CalPERS business, said the firm does not comment on client moves as a
matter of policy.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Pacheco, a spokesman for CalPERS, said the fund could not
discuss when the assets that had been entrusted to Goldman would be
shifted from the firm.</TE>
<TE>   He said they typically would be returned to an index-tracking
fund.</TE>
<TE>   But Goldman Sachs Asset Management, based in Tampa, Fla., remains
a CalPERS fund manager for a different portfolio. Goldman Sachs Asset
won that contract, along with Franklin Advisors, in May.</TE>
<TE>   CalPERS' investment committee approved the moves in May as part of
a effort to increase its exposure to better-performing small-cap and
mid-cap stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Staff at CalPERS also recommended that the pension fund's
investment committee renew the contracts for the remaining managers
for one year. Those contracts allow for a 30-day notice of
termination.</TE>
<TE>   Slumping equity markets hit the pension fund's overall portfolio,
which fell 5.9% in the last fiscal year from a peak of $172 billion
two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The pension fund's staff also recommended that CalPERS renew the
contracts with all 15 of its international equity managers for a
year, who together oversee a portfolio of about $8.5 billion.</TE>
<TE>   While these assets declined 7.7% over the last fiscal year, the
international money managers still beat the benchmark by 1.1
percentage points, CalPERS said.</TE>

<HD>Calpine Wins OK for Hayward Plant</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calpine Corp., the owner of power plants in 23 U.S. states, received
approval from California regulators to build a plant in Hayward,
Calif., that could light up to 480,000 homes.</LD>
<LD>   The California Energy Commission voted 5-0 to permit construction
of the 600-megawatt Russell City Energy Center about 15 miles
southeast of Oakland. The natural gas-fired plant is scheduled to
begin producing electricity in mid-2005, a Calpine spokesman said.
One megawatt is enough power for 800 typical U.S. homes.</LD>
<LD>   "This facility is necessary to improve energy reliability in the
Bay Area," Gov. Gray Davis said.</LD>
<TE>   Millions of Californians endured six days of blackouts last year
when demand for power outstripped supply. Two days of blackouts in
January 2001 affected only Northern California because power-line
bottlenecks prevented generators in the southern part of the state
from transmitting energy north.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of San Jose-based Calpine rose 10 cents to $3.85 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Former Critical Path Exec Sentenced</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN GULLO</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Critical Path Inc.'s former vice president, Timothy Ganley, was
sentenced Wednesday to six months in federal prison in connection
with insider trades he made related to a plan to inflate the e-mail
software company's revenue.</LD>
<LD>   Ganley, who faced a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $1-million
fine, is the first former Critical Path executive to be sentenced
after a criminal investigation of the scheme. Three other former
managers at the company, which saw its shares trade as high as
$116.75 in March 1999, also face criminal charges.</LD>
<LD>   Insider trading cases have attracted additional attention from
prosecutors in recent months as a congressional committee studied
Martha Stewart's sale of ImClone Systems Inc. shares.</LD>
<TE>   Ganley, 46, sold shares "at a time when he was aware the software
company was recording false revenues," federal prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge William Alsup sentenced Ganley to six months
in prison plus two years of supervised release, the U.S. attorney's
office in San Francisco said. Ganley pleaded guilty in April to
participating in a plan to improperly book sales.</TE>
<TE>   In a civil case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Ganley was ordered to pay $107,908.</TE>
<TE>   William Keane, an attorney for Ganley, didn't respond to a
voicemail message. Ganley will begin serving his sentence Jan. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Ganley sold 1,300 shares of Critical Path stock in January 2001
knowing that the company wouldn't meet sales predictions.</TE>
<TE>   The shares, worth $24 each when Ganley sold them, were worth less
than $4 each a month later, after the company publicly disclosed the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Critical Path shares rose 8 cents to 73 cents in Nasdaq trading
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In February, Critical Path's former president, David Thatcher,
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud for directing
the company to overstate revenue in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan A. Beck and Kevin P. Clark, former sales executives, were
charged last month with insider trading.</TE>

<HD>Loan Delinquency Rate Climbs to 8-Year High</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Loan and lease delinquency rates at U.S. banks rose to their highest
levels in eight years in the second quarter on climbing late
commercial and industrial loan payments, according to recent Federal
Reserve data.</LD>
<LD>   The delinquency rate at all banks climbed to 2.76% in the three
months ended in June, the Fed said in a report on charge-off and
delinquency rates on loans and leases at commercial banks. The last
time the rate of delinquencies was higher was in the second quarter
of 1994, at 2.84%.</LD>
<LD>   Late commercial and industrial loan payments rose to a rate of
3.99% in the quarter, the highest rate since 4.2% in the first
quarter of 1993.</LD>
<TE>   Delinquent loans are 30 days past due.</TE>
<TE>   Delinquency rates for commercial bank loans crested above 6% at
the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991, when the U.S. economy was
in recession. The level of late loans at commercial banks has been
below 3% since early 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The delinquency data come as mortgage bankers report that the rate
of mortgage foreclosures surged to its highest level in at least 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America reported Monday that 1.23%
of mortgages were in foreclosure in the second quarter, the highest
level in the 30 years the trade group has tracked the number. In
addition, 4.77% of mortgage borrowers were delinquent, in the second
quarter, the group said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed the rise in foreclosure rates to climbing
unemployment and other factors.</TE>

<HD>Disney Investor Calls for Meeting</HD>
<DH>Media: Providence Capital wants institutional shareholders
to discuss the company's corporate governance issues, including the
board's makeup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tapping impatience among some investors in Walt Disney Co., New York
investment banking company Providence Capital is calling a meeting
next week of institutional shareholders to discuss "critical issues"
surrounding the entertainment company's performance.</LD>
<LD>   Providence Capital, headed by well-known corporate activist
Herbert Denton, said the Tuesday meeting will focus mainly on
corporate governance issues, including the remaking of Disney's board
and a succession plan for Disney Chief Executive Michael Eisner.</LD>
<LD>   "In view of Disney's recent stock performance, we believe the
board would welcome the views of its largest stockholders prior to
instituting changes in the company's governing body," Providence said
in a statement.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting will be held a week before Disney's board of directors
is scheduled to meet to discuss, among other things, various steps to
reform the company's board. In August, Eisner said that Disney will
shrink its board, reduce the size of its committees and strengthen
its independence by year's end. In a government filing last month,
the company disclosed that three board members have relatives who
were employed by Disney.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe we have a good sense of how our major shareholders
feel about the company," Disney spokesman John Spelich said. "We
welcome input from all our shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   Eisner and Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs also will hold what
the company described as routine meetings with investors and analysts
Friday in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The meetings come as Eisner faces heavy pressure from investors
and some influential board members to bolster the company's stock
price and improve the company's earnings, which have been hurt by
sagging theme park attendance and weak ratings at its ABC television
network. Disney's stock price, which lost 7 cents on Wednesday to
close at $16.18 on the New York Stock Exchange, fell to an eight-year
low last month.</TE>
<TE>   "The company is clearly reaching out to investors and that's
good," said analyst Jordan Rohan of Wit SoundView.</TE>
<TE>   Denton wouldn't say how many shares Providence owns, but described
his company as a small shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   Providence bought shares in the company in late summer when
Disney's stock traded at around $13 a share, believing the company
was undervalued.</TE>
<TE>   Providence is an activist investor that has waged fights with ICN
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Aetna Inc. and Tyco International Ltd.
Providence has two or three meetings like this a year. Providence has
advised the California Public Employees' Retirement System, among
others.</TE>
<TE>   Denton has faced criticism for accepting fees from companies that
he has targeted. He called such criticism a cheap shot. "We're not
looking for any fees from Disney," he said.</TE>

<HD>Fed Report Says U.S. Growth Has Slowed</HD>
<DH>Economy: Manufacturers are less optimistic than they were
earlier this year, and companies aren't adding employees, the 'beige
book' says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. economy slowed in the last six weeks, limited by sluggish
factory production and little or no gains in employment, the Federal
Reserve said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Although increases in auto and home sales supported the recovery,
manufacturers are less optimistic than they were earlier this year
and companies aren't adding workers, the Fed said in its latest
regional economic report card, known as the "beige book."</LD>
<LD>   The report "mirrors a lot of the themes we have seen in the
economic news lately that growth is uneven," said James Glassman, a
senior economist at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. in New York.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed's regional economic report card suggests the central bank
may keep its target for overnight lending between banks at a 41-year
low until growth accelerates. The Fed's policy-setting Open Market
Committee meets Sept. 24 to decide whether to change the benchmark
U.S. interest rate from 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan testifies about the economy today
before the House Budget Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The beige book was compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis using information gathered after the third week in July and
before Sept. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The report, a collection of anecdotes reported to the regional Fed
banks from local businesses, gives central bankers an idea of
economic developments beyond what statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Reserve bank in San Francisco found modest growth in
the region, with limited increases in wages and prices. Businesses
"noted solid consumer demand for automobiles and other big-ticket
items, but sales of other retail trade and service items generally
were flat to down."</TE>
<TE>   The beige book report found "little change" in labor markets since
July. Employers in the Chicago area indicated a "downward trend," and
Kansas City companies showed "little interest" in hiring until the
economy picks up.</TE>
<TE>   Wages were flat, with virtually no reports of upward pressure, the
Fed said.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's comments run counter to Labor Department statistics
showing the unemployment rate fell to a five-month low of 5.7% in
August from 5.9% in July.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed's report confirmed that factories still are struggling.
"Reports of manufacturing activity indicate that there was little to
no growth in July and August," the report said. "Manufacturers have
become less optimistic than they were earlier in 2002."</TE>
<TE>   The central bank said retail sales were "mixed for the nation as a
whole." In some districts, discount stores are registering strong
sales compared with general merchandise stores, the Fed said.</TE>
<TE>   "All districts noted that retail inventories are in line with
expectations, although a few heard that retailers are maintaining
leaner inventories than in the past," the Fed said. "Retailers are
cautiously optimistic about the fall, expecting sales to be flat or
slightly up from their 2001 levels."</TE>
<TE>   Prices for goods and services have remained unchanged, the Fed
said. Still, there's increasing concern about the rising cost of
health insurance, "which is leading some businesses to have higher
labor costs," the report said.</TE>
<TE>   Demand for residential mortgages and new-home construction was
strong, while commercial real estate activity in many Fed districts
remained soft, the Fed said.</TE>
<TE>   Banks report strong demand for mortgage loans, "although business
lending continued to be weak across the board," the Fed said. "Credit
quality was described as good and delinquency rates as either stable
or declining."</TE>
<TE>   At its last meeting Aug. 13, the Open Market Committee held rates
steady and changed its outlook, saying risks to the recovery were
weighted toward additional weakness rather than excessive strength
and inflation.</TE>

<HD>Fed Official Urges Execs to Trim Their Pay</HD>
<DH>Salaries: William McDonough says overcompensation is bad
business as well as a 'bad social policy.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A senior Federal Reserve official Wednesday used a Sept. 11 memorial
service on Wall Street to excoriate U.S. corporate executives for
paying themselves too much and called on the business leaders to cut
their own compensation.</LD>
<LD>   Quoting the biblical admonition to "love thy neighbor as thyself,"
William J. McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank
and a possible successor to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, said
executive pay has ballooned beyond all reason and threatens public
support for free-market institutions.</LD>
<LD>   "Sadly, all too many members of the inner circle of the business
elite participated in the overexpansion of executive compensation,"
McDonough told an audience at Trinity Church near the World Trade
Center.</LD>
<TE>   The piling-on of stock options and bonuses, which was justified as
aligning the interests of top executives with those of their
stockholders, has proved woefully misguided, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is reasonably clear now that this theory has left a large
number of poorer stockholders--especially including employee
stockholders--not only unconvinced but understandably disillusioned
and angry," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough is not the first financial leader to criticize executive
pay--Greenspan and Goldman Sachs Chairman Henry M. Paulson Jr. made
somewhat similar comments earlier this year. But by linking the issue
to Sept. 11 and framing it in moral terms, rather than as simply a
business decision, McDonough may have raised the stakes in the debate
over who runs America's corporations for whose benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's surprising that a Fed official would wade into these
waters," said Gregory D. Hess, an economist at Claremont McKenna
College. "I assume he's just trying to reflect the popular opinion"
that executive pay has gotten out of hand.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough apparently was motivated by the seemingly incessant
disclosures of corporate scandal and greed.</TE>
<TE>   On top of Enron Corp.'s and other debacles earlier this year,
there has been a recent rash of disclosures about corporate figures
such as former General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jack Welch
winning cushy consulting contracts and receiving perks, including the
use of corporate jets even after retirement.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing you hope for from leaders of the business community
is that they realize markets don't run on money, but trust and a
sense of fairness," said Nell Minow, a veteran shareholder activist.
"That trust has been destroyed this year.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't believe anybody anymore. You don't believe the
executives about what they are really paid, or the accountants about
what the numbers really are, or the stock analysts about what's
really going on."</TE>
<TE>   McDonough, 68, has headed the New York Fed, the most powerful of
the 12 Fed banks around the country, since July 1993 and is vice
chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. central
bank's chief policymaking body.</TE>
<TE>   McDonough's comments appeared to follow on those of Greenspan, who
startled the business community this summer by telling a
congressional committee that the recent stock crash and corporate
scandals were the product of "an infectious greed" and by calling for
stiffer criminal penalties for executives who break the law.</TE>
<TE>   But Greenspan stopped well short of demanding any fundamental
change in the way American companies are run, or calling for curbs on
pay. By contrast, McDonough went straight to the issue of salaries.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed official cited a recent study that showed the average
chief executive was making 42 times as much as the average production
worker 20 years ago and now the same business leader makes nearly 500
times the average employee's income.</TE>
<TE>   "I find nothing in economic theory that justifies this
development," McDonough said. "I am old enough to have known both the
CEOs of 20 years ago and those of today. I can assure you that we
CEOs of today are not 10 times better than those of 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   He said the spectacular increases in executive pay turn out to
have been not only bad business but also "terribly bad social policy
and perhaps even bad morals."</TE>
<TE>   "Looked at from the vantage of the commandment 'love thy neighbor
as thyself,' there are some clear questions: Is not my fellow worker
my neighbor? Are not other members of the community--such as the
widows and orphans of 9/11 victims--my neighbors? Are not the
homeless my neighbors?"</TE>
<TE>   McDonough continued: "It is important for those of us who have
lives of great comfort and success that we recognize that the reasons
for our good fortune, and the reasons for the relative lack of
success of the neighbors I have just described, have very little to
do with our own virtue....</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we deserve some credit," he said. "But we should remember
that two [of the] most attractive virtues are realism and humility."</TE>
<TE>   McDonough said "any notion of moral balance" requires business
leaders to take "corrective action."</TE>
<TE>   The action he recommended: "Beginning with the strongest
companies, CEOs and their boards should simply reach the conclusion
that executive pay is excessive and adjust it to more reasonable and
justifiable levels."</TE>
<TE>   The average chief executive of a major American corporation made
$10.78 million in 2000, or more than 300 times the wage of an average
worker, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a Washington
think tank that based its figures on a slightly different study than
the one cited by McDonough.</TE>
<TE>   "In other words," EPI economist Lawrence Mishel and co-authors
concluded in the latest edition of the organization's biennial
publication "The State of Working America," "a CEO earned more in one
workday ... than an average worker earned in 52 weeks."</TE>
<TE>   McDonough's salary last year was $297,500, according to the Fed
annual report.</TE>

<HD>Communication Is Key in Avoiding Foreclosure</HD>
<DH>Mortgage: Delays and modified terms may be available, as
long as lenders are informed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home mortgage foreclosures are running at a pace not seen in 30
years. But strapped borrowers who confront their problem head-on may
be able to avoid losing their homes to foreclosure.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a number of things we can do," said Thomas Johnson,
director of default at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. "We can do anything
from allowing the borrower to work out another repayment plan to a
loan modification where we cut the interest rate. Our object is to
keep this person in the home."</LD>
<LD>   The first thing overextended borrowers need to do is call their
lender. Too often, people who have lost their jobs or find themselves
drowning in debt hide from their lenders--and hide the facts from
their families--because they're too humiliated to admit the truth,
said Ralph Roberts, president of Ralph Roberts Real Estate in
Detroit.</LD>
<TE>   By the time they come clean, they are already drastically behind
on their payments and potentially past the point where they can
recover, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people go into denial and they don't do anything," Roberts
said. "But every day it gets harder. Try not to get in the jam where
you've already missed a payment. You have to communicate with your
bank like you are supposed to communicate with your spouse."</TE>
<TE>   If the problem is temporary--you've lost a job but expect to get a
new one; you have an illness in the family or are in the midst of a
divorce--the bank has several options:</TE>
<TE>   * Payment moratoriums. The bank can suspend your loan repayment
for a set period of time, said Johnson of Wells Fargo. Payment
moratoriums--also called forbearance--can last three months to a
year, experts say, depending on the borrower's situation. The missed
payments can be added to the balance of the mortgage, or they may be
segregated into a separate debt.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, lenders will charge interest on the missed
payments. However, if the loan is backed by the Federal Housing
Administration, the back payments may be interest-free and collected
only after the first loan is repaid or the house is sold, said Laurie
Maggiano, director of asset management and disposition at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the payment hiatus can give a borrower with a
temporary problem enough breathing room to resolve it or sell the
home.</TE>
<TE>   * Modification of loan terms. Lenders often will refinance the
debt to a lower interest rate for borrowers who can't quite meet
current payments but could if the monthly amount were somewhat lower,
Johnson said. Loans that are guaranteed by the Federal Housing
Authority also may be modified by stretching out the repayment term,
Maggiano said, thus lowering the monthly payment.</TE>
<TE>   * Payment plans. Borrowers who have missed a payment or two may be
able to work out a repayment schedule if the economic difficulty that
put their loan in arrears is now resolved, Johnson said. For
instance, Wells Fargo may divide up the amount of the missed payment
and let the borrower catch up over 18 months by adding an extra
amount to the monthly payment.</TE>
<TE>   On FHA loans, HUD will lend the borrower the amount needed to get
current without interest.</TE>
<TE>   Borrowers also should take a close look at their budgets and see
where else they can pare expenses, said Matt Coffin, president of
LowerMyBills.com, a Santa Monica-based Web site.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediately look at income and expenses and prioritize your
debts," Coffin said. "Keep in mind that your mortgage is key to
keeping a roof over your family's head. Credit cards and other
unsecured debts can be put off to pay the mortgage."</TE>
<TE>   Cut out luxuries and bargain-hunt for the necessities so you can
show your lender the substantive steps you're taking to get on track,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If unsecured debt is part of your problem, seek assistance from
nonprofit credit counselors," Maggiano said. "They can put you on a
budget, and they are often successful in negotiating with creditors
to reduce your debt."</TE>
<TE>   If a borrower realizes that the financial difficulty causing his
mortgage delinquency is not temporary, he needs to consider the best
way to get out of the home, Roberts of Ralph Roberts Real Estate
said.</TE>
<TE>   If you have substantial equity and are in a strong real estate
market, which currently applies to many parts of the country and
certainly to Southern California, the best option is to list the
house for sale, he said.</TE>
<TE>   But if you have little equity--or owe more than the house is
worth--you would, again, want to discuss the situation with your
lender.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders have two options: They can allow you to do a so-called
short sale, which involves selling the house on your own for whatever
it's worth. In these deals, the lender agrees to take that
amount--even if it is less than the loan amount--and not pursue the
borrower to pay more.</TE>
<TE>   Or the borrower can turn over the house through a so-called deed
in lieu of foreclosure. In this case, the borrower turns the deed
over to the lender in exchange for eliminating the mortgage debt.</TE>
<TE>   The transaction will put a black mark on the borrower's credit
report, Johnson said, but it's not quite as damaging as a full
foreclosure, in which the lender seizes a borrower's home outright
for nonpayment of the mortgage.</TE>

<HD>Indexes End Lower in Shortened Session</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: An early rally is lost as investors reflect on
the terrorist attacks. The overall market is mixed, with oil gaining
and gold falling.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major stock indexes finished lower in a quiet, abbreviated session
Wednesday as traders went half-heartedly about their work during a
day dominated by painful memories of last year's terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "Today is a day of reflection," said Alan Ackerman, a market
strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co. "People don't feel concerned about the
market, but about the turmoil and tragedy we experienced a year ago."</LD>
<LD>   An early rally that saw the Dow Jones industrials jump almost 125
points faded as the day wore on. A late burst of selling, sparked in
part by news reports of an incident aboard a Dallas-bound airliner,
pushed the major indexes into negative territory for the day.</LD>
<TE>   Also casting a pall on the market was one more reminder of the
soft economic recovery. U.S. economic growth slowed in recent weeks,
although activity varied widely by sector, the Federal Reserve
reported in its beige book.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow ended down 21.44 points, or 0.3%, at 8,581.17. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index slipped 0.13 of a point, or less than
0.1%, to 909.45. The Nasdaq composite index shed 4.64 points, or
0.4%, to 1,315.45.</TE>
<TE>   While the major barometers ticked lower, the overall market was
mixed. Winners outnumbered losers by 9 to 7 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and were about even on Nasdaq. Volume was very light. Both
the NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock Market delayed the opening of trading
to mark the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   There is hope that the market will advance now that the
anniversary has passed, but some strategists see little scope for a
significant run-up.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a wall of money coming in.... The market needs to be
cheaper before people will come in and buy stocks aggressively," said
Michael O'Sullivan, a pan-European equities strategist at
Commerzbank.</TE>
<TE>   Another factor likely to limit the upside in the short term is
President Bush's speech to the United Nations today, when he is
expected to attempt to drum up support for an attack on Iraq. Also,
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony on the U.S. economy before
the House Budget Committee today will be scrutinized.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading Wednesday, gold prices dipped while Treasury
yields rose for the third day in four. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note rose to 4.06% from Tuesday's close of 4.00%.</TE>
<TE>   After opening strongly, the dollar closed slightly higher against
the yen and was unchanged against the euro. Bond and currency trading
ended early. Oil rose 4 cents to $29.77 a barrel in New York trading.</TE>
<TE>   Among the day's other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * European stocks rallied, helped by Wall Street's strong opening.
Key indexes rose 3% in France, 0.8% in Britain and 2.6% in Germany.
Stocks rose for a third straight session in Japan, where the Nikkei
average gained 1%.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks eked out gains after rising most of the session,
in contrast to the battering they received when the markets reopened
after the attacks a year ago. The S&amp;P index of airline stocks edged
up 0.1%, reflecting gains in Delta Air Lines, up 14 cents at $17, and
American Airlines parent AMR, which rose 8 cents to $9.25.</TE>
<TE>   * Conglomerate Honeywell International ended down $1.68 to $28.52
as investors worried about the company's liability for asbestos
claims in a trial in Illinois in which plaintiffs are seeking about
$100 million in damages.</TE>
<TE>   * Topping Nasdaq's list of most active stocks, Cisco Systems added
14 cents to $13.57. Microsoft lost $1.21 at $48.58.</TE>
<TE>   * Financials finished lower. Citigroup lost 73 cents to $30.14 and
American Express fell 21 cents to $34.79, both weighing on the Dow.</TE>
<TE>   * Local telephone companies gained as some investors said their
declines this year and dividend yields make them attractive in a bear
market. Verizon Communications, which has a dividend yield of 4.9%,
rose $1.23 to $31.77. SBC Communications, which yields 4.2%, advanced
97 cents to $25.85.</TE>
<TE>   * Comverse Technology fell 36 cents at $7.93. The communications
software company posted a quarterly loss, excluding one-time items,
and said it would post a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss due
to the telecommunications slump.</TE>
<TE>   * Technology consultant Inforte rose 33 cents to $6.95 after it
raised its third-quarter revenue and earnings estimates after
receiving new orders.</TE>

<HD>Analysts Are Skeptical of McDonald's Strategy</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: Dollar menu could lower customer checks, and
money for make-over may be better spent elsewhere, many say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will the dollar menu lift sales at McDonald's?</LD>
<LD>   That question is on many Wall Street analysts' minds as they await
McDonald's Corp.'s mid-quarter update Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Worried by several straight quarters of sluggish sales in the
United States, McDonald's has gone on the defensive with an ambitious
plan to drive sales in its biggest market through a nationwide dollar
menu and an overhaul of its older restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   The Oak Brook, Ill., company said Friday that it would provide
more details of its strategy in its interim update.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of being reassured by the company's new resolve, many
analysts expressed skepticism that McDonald's aggressive strategy
would be enough to increase sales in its core U.S. market, and said
it could even eat into future earnings.</TE>
<TE>   That would further fuel investor dissatisfaction with the world's
No. 1 restaurant chain, which has disappointed Wall Street with its
lackluster results and under-performing stock price over the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   Though McDonald's has billed the launch of the dollar menu--which
offers eight items such as its signature French fries for $1--as an
initiative to drive traffic, many analysts expressed doubt that
discounting food would be enough to attract customers.</TE>
<TE>   About half of its 13,223 restaurants in the United States now
offer a dollar menu. Other chains such as Burger King have long
relied on discounting prices to attract customers.</TE>
<TE>   "The everyday low-price menu is not that novel of an idea. The
initiative may lower the average check, which may offset traffic
gains, and margins," Lehman Bros. analyst Mitch Speiser said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, McDonald's shelved an everyday value menu in Los
Angeles because it led to sharply lower average customer checks and
sales in outlets open for at least a year, a key measure of
restaurant performance, Speiser said.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe agreed and advised clients not to
buy McDonald's stock before Tuesday's update.</TE>
<TE>   "We do not believe the promotion will be a significant traffic or
profit driver in the near term," Ivankoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of McDonald's closed Wednesday up 4 cents at $21.34 on the
New York Stock Exchange. They have dropped about 19% this year,
compared with a nearly 8% decline in the Standard &amp; Poor's restaurant
index.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's also is expected to provide earnings guidance for the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The average estimate of 16 analysts polled by market research firm
Thomson First Call is 42 cents a share. A year earlier, McDonald's
posted net income of $545.5 million, or 42 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the dollar menu, McDonald's is expected to give more
details next week on its proposal to remodel or rebuild many of its
older outlets.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's said it did not know how much the physical improvements
would cost because financing would be decided on a case-by-case
basis.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts worry that financing a sweeping overhaul of
restaurants would cost hundreds of millions of dollars, requiring
several years to complete.</TE>
<TE>   That would divert cash from share buybacks--which is how
McDonald's has managed to eke out earnings growth amid tepid sales in
the last several years--and lead many analysts to cut their forecasts
for earnings growth.</TE>
<TE>   In the first six months this year, McDonald's said it spent $466
million to buy back shares.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been buying back stock like there's no tomorrow," said
CIBC analyst John Glass, who noted that McDonald's increased its
earnings last year by about 3% largely through stock buybacks.</TE>
<TE>   Although refurbishing older restaurants is a positive step, buying
back stock does not improve McDonald's underlying business and will
not sustain long-term earnings growth, Glass said.</TE>
<TE>   "They will have to make some hard choices about where to spend
their capital: building new stores, remodeling existing ones or
buying back stock. It's unlikely that they can do all at once," he
said.</TE>

<HD>FCC Ready to Act on Wireless Licenses</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Sources say the agency may allow some carriers to
opt out of bids as the court battle with NextWave continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Communications regulators are considering letting mobile telephone
companies opt out of a $15.9-billion sale of wireless licenses still
mired in a lengthy court battle, people familiar with the situation
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Communications Commission may propose allowing
carriers including Verizon Wireless Inc. and Deutsche Telekom's
T-MobileUSA to opt out of the bids made last year--and a decision
could come soon, the sources said.</LD>
<LD>   The agency auctioned the licenses to the carriers in January 2001
for a record $15.9 billion, but an appeals court five months later
ruled that the licenses belonged to NextWave Telecom Inc., which is
in bankruptcy proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   Carriers have gone to Congress and beseeched the FCC to allow them
to withdraw from the auction without penalty because of the
unexpected lengthy legal wrangling and the financial overhang the
auction is putting on them because they have not obtained the
licenses for use. Allowing the companies to back out could remove the
massive financial overhang, freeing cash for them to expand and
improve services.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said the commission also could propose canceling the
obligations outright or seek public comment on what to do about the
carriers' desire to pull out, though these are less likely scenarios.</TE>
<TE>   FCC officials declined to comment, as did representatives of the
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Since late last year, the wireless industry has seen a slowdown in
customer growth and an increase in competition after years of
double-digit gains. Fears about the industry have been exacerbated by
bad corporate news and concerns about heavy debt loads.</TE>
<TE>   Hawthorne, N.Y.-based NextWave in 1996 bid $4.74 billion for
dozens of licenses, but entered bankruptcy protection in 1998 after
paying the FCC only $500 million. It has vigorously fought in court
to keep the licenses.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC tried to repossess the licenses from NextWave because the
company failed to pay for them on time. The case is pending at the
Supreme Court but even if NextWave were to lose there, the company
has indicated, it would go back to the appeals court to challenge
other parts of the case.</TE>
<TE>   While the litigation is pending, the FCC agreed to give back $2.8
billion in down payments to the carriers but refused to eliminate the
obligation that they must acquire the licenses should the court rule
in favor of the FCC.</TE>
<TE>   The agency held 3% of the total amount bid, or about $500 million,
which would be the penalty assessed if the carriers were to withdraw
their winning bids.</TE>
<TE>   Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc.
and Vodafone Group, bid about $8.5 billion for scores of licenses
while a partner of AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc., Alaska Native
Wireless, bid $2.7 billion for 28 licenses.</TE>
<TE>   When Verizon received its deposit back earlier this year, it used
the $1.5 billion to repay debt.</TE>
<TE>   T-MobileUSA, formerly known as VoiceStream, and its partner bid
$777 million for 19 licenses and a partner of Cingular Wireless bid
$2.15 billion for 30 licenses, among other bids.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional lawmakers were considering legislation that would
release the carriers from the obligations to acquire the licenses.</TE>

<HD>NYSE Pauses to Reflect</HD>
<DH>Exchange observes day amid controlled emotion</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Outside, the New York Stock Exchange appeared grim and fortress-like
Wednesday, with rows of police barricades guarding its entrance.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, the scene on the normally hectic trading floor was one of
relative calm and controlled emotion.</LD>
<LD>   On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, traders were gripped by the
horror unfolding just blocks away at the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   And six days later, when the exchange reopened, the mood was
fearful and apprehensive--reflecting both concern about another
attack and about an anticipated wave of selling by investors.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the tone was somber but clearly reflected the
passing of a year.</TE>
<TE>   Traders last year returned in part out of a sense of national
duty, but they privately had to deal with raw grief and anxiety. They
trooped through acrid air, many wearing surgical masks, to get to
work as the rescue and recovery efforts continued at ground zero.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody on Sept. 17 did not want to be here physically, and
everybody fought through their emotions," said Joseph Cangemi, a
broker at Francis P. Maglio &amp; Co. But that was not the case
Wednesday. "This is not a duty. This is a celebration."</TE>
<TE>   The day generated a range of emotions. Traders were relieved to
get past the anniversary, but many said it caused them to relive last
Sept. 11 in their minds.</TE>
<TE>   The tension was heightened by a government warning Monday that new
attacks were possible this week, though the warnings did not single
out New York as a potential target.</TE>
<TE>   "The day, of itself, rips the wound wide open," said Kenneth
Polcari, managing director of a small floor brokerage. Polcari's
headquarters were on the 55th floor of the trade center's south
tower, and he would have been there when the first plane hit if not
for an 8:30 a.m. meeting at the exchange that day.</TE>
<TE>   As did most others on Wall Street, many NYSE traders knew victims
of the attack. Some people took Wednesday off to be with family or
friends.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange opened 2 1/2 hours late, at 12:01 EDT, to accommodate
the memorial service at ground zero. Traders generally supported the
delay, and some thought the exchange should have been closed all day.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't have opened at all, just out of respect," said
Theodore Weisberg, head of Seaport Securities Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But others said opening on Wednesday was just as vital as on Sept.
17. "You have to open because you have to send a clear message,"
Cangemi said. "We're here to do business as usual."</TE>
<TE>   On hand for the start of the session were New York Gov. George
Pataki, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt.</TE>
<TE>   Stock prices immediately bounded higher at the open--traders cited
investor relief that no attacks had marred the memorial
services--before falling back.</TE>
<TE>   NYSE trading had been scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. but was
delayed as the memorial service ran long. The exchange's arch rival,
the electronic Nasdaq Stock Market, launched trading at 11 a.m.
Nasdaq's computers already were programmed and could not be reset at
the last minute, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wall Street, life for many traders has been a struggle over the
last year. The emotional aftermath of the attacks has been compounded
by the stock market's woes, as share prices overall have continued to
slide and financial firms have retrenched with a series of grinding
layoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The NYSE building was not damaged by the attacks on the World
Trade Center, which was about a five-minute walk away. But
communication lines and transportation systems were damaged, and the
NYSE chose to stay closed for the rest of that week to avoid
hindering recovery efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The four-day closure marked the exchange's longest shutdown since
the bank holidays of the 1930s. The resumption of trading the next
Monday was hailed as a symbol of the country's financial and economic
resilience, even though share prices dived initially.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have had a lasting effect on the expansion plans of
the world's biggest stock exchange. Before the disaster, the NYSE had
planned to build a larger trading floor across the street from its
current site.</TE>
<TE>   The plans included a 35-story office tower to be leased to private
tenants. The city would have helped subsidize construction, recouping
its outlays through a higher tax assessment on the improved site.</TE>
<TE>   After the attacks, however, the NYSE scrapped the idea of
expanding in Lower Manhattan, in part out of concerns about erecting
a marquee and potentially vulnerable tower there.</TE>
<TE>   The exchange now plans to create a second trading floor within New
York state but outside the city's financial district. The two sites
would run simultaneously, thus splitting the Big Board's operations
for the first time. NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso has said he expects
the new site to be up and running within five years.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has generated consternation among some traders, who
say they understand the need to disperse amid terrorism fears, but
worry that a companion floor in a borough or suburb would increase
their daily commutes if they are assigned to the new facility.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand the concept," said Arthur Cashin, director of floor
operations for brokerage UBS PaineWebber. But "if it triples my
commute, should I be crazy about it?"</TE>

<HD>Adelphia Withholds Severance From Rigas</HD>
<DH>Scandal: The company reportedly will rescind its
$4.2-million package for the former chairman, who faces fraud
charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp. won't make $4.2 million in payments to
John J. Rigas under a severance agreement reached when the cable TV
systems company founder and former chief executive stepped down in
May, according to a person who has been briefed on the situation.</LD>
<LD>   No payments had been made yet under the severance agreement, said
the person, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. The
company has been operating under bankruptcy protection since late
June.</LD>
<LD>   The reversal comes as WorldCom Inc. weighs rescinding the
severance of former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia agreed to a three-year package for Rigas in May, two
months after the company disclosed that it had guaranteed $3.1
billion in loans to partnerships controlled by his family. Since
then, Adelphia, with $20 billion in debt, has filed for bankruptcy
protection and filed a racketeering suit against the Rigases.</TE>
<TE>   On July 24, Rigas, two of his three sons and two other former
Adelphia executives were arrested on bank-and securities-fraud
charges. Federal prosecutors allege that Rigas and his family used
the company as a "personal piggy bank," according to court papers.</TE>
<TE>   "The greater the separation between Adelphia and the Rigas family
the better," said Steve Pfeiffer, an analyst at Columbia Management
Group, which sold its Adelphia shares and bonds shortly after the
cable company disclosed the loans. "Every dollar Adelphia is not
paying out to someone else is a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Executive compensation has come under more scrutiny since energy
trader Enron Corp. and long-distance telephone provider WorldCom
filed for bankruptcy protection amid accounting scandals.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's board is considering rescinding a severance package for
Ebbers that includes a $1.5-million lifetime annual pension and a
$408.2-million loan, said Stuart Pierson, an attorney for board
member Stiles Kellett.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia, now headed by interim Chief Executive and Chairman
Erland Kailbourne, last month nominated Rod Cornelius, a former vice
chairman of Renaissance Cable, and Anthony Kronman, the dean of Yale
Law School, to the board.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more than disturbing when anyone, including a corporate
board, would decide to breach a contract presumably signed in good
faith," said Peter Fleming, Rigas' attorney. Adelphia spokesman Eric
Andrus declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas was to get annual severance payments of $1.4 million for
three years. He was promised office equipment and a secretary, use of
company jets in an emergency and health-care coverage for him and his
wife, Doris, for life, according to a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   In return, the Rigases agreed to contribute cash flow generated
from their cable-television properties and to forgive about $567
million in convertible debt. The family also placed its stock in a
voting trust controlled by the board.</TE>
<TE>   Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia has since asked a federal
bankruptcy judge to block the Rigases from selling property it says
was purchased with company funds. The cable operator argued that such
sales would violate bankruptcy law provisions that protect assets of
a company reorganizing under Chapter 11.</TE>
<TE>   Rigas and his three sons resigned before allegations surfaced that
they had used company funds to pay loans, buy stock and bankroll
extravagances such as an African safari and luxury apartments. The
disclosure of the guaranteed loans to family partnerships prompted
investigations by federal prosecutors in two states and by the SEC.</TE>

<LD>A unit of Bank of America Corp., the third-largest U.S. bank, has
asked federal regulators for a license to market and trade
electricity.</LD>
<LD>   The Charlotte-based bank would join Morgan Stanley, UBS and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as financial firms with power-trading desks
in the U.S. Bank of America filed the application with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission on Sept. 3.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America has been trading natural gas and oil since 1989,
spokesman Jeff Hershberger said. In late July, it began trading
electricity derivatives, or contracts linked to power prices that
don't involve physical delivery.</LD>
<TE>   It has hired seven electricity-derivatives traders in New York in
the last several months, bringing its number of energy-commodity
traders to about 60 in New York, London and Singapore.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America does not own any power plants, transmission lines

<LD>DaimlerChrysler said its Global Electric Motorcars unit is profitable
and won't stop selling battery-powered small cars, after Ford Motor
Co. decided to halt Think electric-car sales.</LD>
<LD>   Global has annual U.S. sales of about 5,000 cars, which resemble
golf carts and have a top speed of 25 miles per hour, said Larry
Oswald, vice president of hybrid and electric vehicles at the auto
maker's Chrysler unit and head of Global. He declined to give a
profit figure, saying Global sells slightly more cars a year than its
break-even point.</LD>
<LD>   Ford on Aug. 30 said it would stop selling Think cars, including
the low-speed Neighbor, because of lack of demand.</LD>

<LD>Antitrust staff at the Federal Trade Commission recommended that the
agency not oppose the acquisition of P&amp;O Princess Cruises by either
Carnival Corp. or Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Even though either deal would reduce the number of competitors in
the cruise business, the FTC's competition bureau told the agency's
five commissioners that the companies would be unable to raise prices
as a result, one source said.</LD>
<LD>   The final decision requires a vote by the commission. Either deal
would combine two of the world's top three cruise lines.</LD>

<LD>Enron Corp. shareholders say they will use part of a recent
$40-million settlement to pursue incriminating documents in the
possession of the energy trader, its investment banks and other
defendants.</LD>
<LD>   Investors plan to finance a document depository in Houston and
reimburse their lawyers for about $3 million in expenses with their
share of a $15-million fund carved out of a settlement with Andersen
Worldwide, a defendant in the Enron suit, lawyer William Lerach said.
He is the lead counsel for shareholders and bondholders who claim
they lost $30 billion from Enron's misstatement of income.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the settlement, to be shared with employees who lost about
$3 billion on Enron stock held by their pension funds, will pay
investigators, Lerach said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co. said it resumed production after its
main parts supplier ended a boycott over unpaid bills that had
threatened to disrupt a joint venture with General Motors Corp.</LD>
<LD>   But Korea Delphi Automotive Systems said further talks were needed
with the country's No. 3 auto maker and its creditors to settle the
unpaid bills for parts supplied before Daewoo Motor filed for
bankruptcy in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Korea Delphi, which provides about 20% of Daewoo parts, stopped
deliveries in August along with other suppliers, which say they are
owed hundreds of millions of dollars. The other suppliers ended their
boycott last week.</LD>
<TE>   Daewoo said the boycott forced it to halt production of about
2,000 vehicles a day, costing the company $12.5 million.</TE>

<LD>Novartis' sale of a generic form of GlaxoSmithKline's antibiotic
Augmentin in the U.S. will be investigated by the International Trade
Commission, the agency's Web site said.</LD>
<LD>   Glaxo, Europe's largest drug maker, asked the U.S. agency last
month to block its Swiss rival from importing a generic form of the
medicine, saying the bacteria used to develop it was stolen by a
former Glaxo employee.</LD>
<LD>   The British company is trying to stop Novartis' cheaper version
from taking market share from its second-best selling product. Glaxo
shares have lost about a quarter of their value since a U.S. judge in
May invalidated its patents for the product, which accounted for
about $2 billion in annual sales.</LD>
<TE>   The agency is investigating Glaxo's claim of "misappropriation of
trade secrets and unfair competition," it said on its Web site. The
International Trade Commission weighs the effect of imports on U.S.
companies and U.S.-based subsidiaries of foreign companies.</TE>

<LD>Higher, more volatile oil prices will loom this winter if OPEC
refuses to boost crude production as major importing countries head
into the peak heating oil season, an industry report warned.</LD>
<LD>   A decrease last month in crude exports from Iraq has squeezed
supplies and contributed to a dwindling of U.S. inventories. Global
demand, meanwhile, is forecast to rise by a robust 1.6 million
barrels a day in the fourth quarter, the International Energy Agency
said in its monthly oil market report.</LD>
<LD>   Markets face a challenge similar to that in 1999, when a plunge in
oil inventories paved the way for a spike in prices and extreme
instability, it said.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Hitachi Ltd., Japan's biggest electronics maker, issued a profit
warning for its fiscal first half ending Sept. 30, confirming recent
market fears of an earnings setback in Japan's high-tech sector.</LD>
<LD>   The company blamed the revisions on currency swings and isolated
problems at a few divisions, but the firm made it clear that the
business environment had worsened in the current quarter and
uncertainty loomed for the second half of the year.</LD>
<LD>   "The April-June quarter was good, but July-September was tough
across the board," Hitachi Executive Vice President Yoshiki Yagi said
at a news conference.</LD>
<TE>   Although the company left its full-year targets unchanged, Yagi
left open the possibility that they could be cut when official
first-half numbers are announced at the end of next month.</TE>
<TE>   "We still can't tell how the second half is really going to shape
up.... We'll be back here again in a month, and I think we can

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Electronic Data Systems Corp., the world's second-largest computer
services seller, asked a court to force WorldCom Inc. to return $14.7
million it says the telecommunications company owes local telephone
companies.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom received the money to pay local carriers that handled
services for Electronic Data in areas that WorldCom's long-distance
network doesn't reach, EDS said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   WorldCom, the No. 2 U.S. long-distance company, kept the money
instead, EDS said. WorldCom provides long-distance phone service to
EDS customers under a 1999 agreement. EDS runs WorldCom's computers.</LD>
<TE>   EDS spokeswoman Kristin Dobrowolski said service has not been
interrupted as a result of the disagreement with WorldCom. Julie
Moore, a WorldCom spokeswoman, said she didn't know when the company
would respond to EDS' claim.</TE>
<TE>   EDS set aside $101 million in the second quarter to cover payments
it doesn't expect to get from WorldCom, which in July filed for
bankruptcy protection.</TE>

<HD>AT&amp;T Canada Expects to Miss Bond Payments</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Canada Inc., the money-losing phone and Internet-service
provider that is 31% owned by AT&amp;T Corp., will miss $51.2 million in
bond payments this month as the company tries to conserve cash amid
slowing demand.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T Canada said it has a 30-day window to make the two interest
payments, which are due Sunday and Sept. 23. The company has enough
cash to meet that deadline, spokesman Ian Dale said.</LD>
<LD>   The Toronto-based company is in debt-restructuring talks with
bondholders, bank lenders and AT&amp;T, and is aiming to win an agreement
by year's end, Dale said. AT&amp;T Canada has said it will cut more than
1,000 jobs and trim capital spending 23% this year to keep from
running out of cash. The company's debt was $2.9 billion as of June.</LD>
<TE>   AT&amp;T Canada posted a second-quarter loss of $850 million after
writing down the value of assets.</TE>
<TE>   The interest payment due Sunday is $47.8 million. The one due
Sept. 23 totals $3.4 million. AT&amp;T Canada said it had about $253
million in cash Aug. 31 and expects to receive $151 million from the
exercise of employee stock options.</TE>

<HD>Tyco Hires Finance Chief From UTC</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: David FitzPatrick replaces Mark Swartz, who
had been questioned about accounting. The firm's stock price jumps
12%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tyco International Ltd., its shares battered by accounting concerns,
Wednesday replaced its chief financial officer in a move cheered by
investors as a big step toward mending fences with Wall Street.</LD>
<LD>   Tyco appointed United Technologies Corp. Chief Financial Officer
David FitzPatrick, 48, to replace Mark Swartz, who had been
aggressively quizzed about Tyco's accounting during long conference
calls with investors and analysts.</LD>
<LD>   "Tyco is getting a highly respected CFO in FitzPatrick," said John
Boland, an analyst and fund manager at NL Capital Management.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a tremendous coup."</TE>
<TE>   Tyco shares rose 12% on the New York Stock Exchange, closing up
$1.90 at $17.80 after the announcement was made.</TE>
<TE>   The hiring of FitzPatrick marks the second executive coup by Tyco,
which in July lured Motorola President Edward Breen to become its
chairman and chief executive after former CEO Dennis Kozlowski
resigned in June.</TE>
<TE>   FitzPatrick had served as UTC's finance chief since 1998. Before
that he held top finance posts at Eastman Kodak  Co. and General
Motors  Corp.</TE>
<TE>   UTC makes products ranging from Black Hawk helicopters to Otis
elevators.</TE>
<TE>   "The reputation of Mr. FitzPatrick along with that of United
Technologies is the kind of reputation that Tyco is seeking," said
Paul Nisbet, an analyst at JSA Research Inc.</TE>
<TE>   FitzPatrick joins a company that's being investigated by lawyer
David Boies and several government entities, including Manhattan and
New Hampshire prosecutors. They are investigating whether Tyco
corporate funds were used improperly to enrich senior executives and
board members.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission also is reviewing Tyco's
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Details from Boies' internal investigation are expected next week.</TE>
<TE>   As Tyco's chief financial officer since 1995, Swartz was a key
advisor in Kozlowski's decade-long acquisition binge that built Tyco
into one of the world's largest conglomerates. Tyco products range
from trash bags to ADT burglar alarms.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz suffered from his close ties with Kozlowski, who has been
indicted on charges that he avoided paying sales taxes on artwork.</TE>
<TE>   Swartz ranked as the highest-paid chief financial officer in the
United States last year, according to research firm Equilar Inc. He
collected nearly $47 million in compensation.</TE>
<TE>   Kozlowski resigned in June, just before his criminal indictment.
Tyco announced last month that Swartz would leave the company as soon
as a successor was found.</TE>
<TE>   Before Wednesday, Bermuda-based Tyco's stock price had plunged
about 73% this year amid persistent worries about accounting and
strategic problems, as well as Kozlowski's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have called for the resignation of most of Tyco's board,
which has been criticized for being lax during Kozlowski's tenure.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, United Technologies announced that FitzPatrick will be
succeeded by Steve Page, 62, who served as chief finance officer for
the Hartford, Conn.-based manufacturer from 1993 to 1997.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Gets Offer for Its Publishing Division</HD>
<DH>Media: Buyout firms led by a BNP Paribas unit propose $2.9
billion to $3.4 billion for assets including Houghton Mifflin,
sources say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACQUELINE SIMMONS and MARK LAKE</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal received an offer of $2.9 billion to $3.4 billion
for its publishing unit from buyout firms led by BNP Paribas' private
equity arm, people familiar with the matter said.</LD>
<LD>   BNP's PAI Management has proposed buying 35% of the unit, which
includes Houghton Mifflin Co. Among the firms that would split the
rest of the publishing business are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.,
Apax Partners Inc., Bain Capital Inc., Blackstone Group and Thomas H.
Lee Partners, sources said.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi aims to sell assets worth almost $10 billion within two
years as the world's No. 2 media company reverses the $77-billion
expansion by former Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier. Struggling
with $18 billion in debt, Vivendi already has slashed prices for a
French publisher of trade journals and its pay-TV business.</LD>
<TE>   "Vivendi needs the money to guarantee its survival," said Matthieu
Giuliani, who helps manage $1.95 billion at San Paolo Asset
Management and owns Vivendi shares.</TE>
<TE>   Mia Carbonell, a spokeswoman for Paris-based Vivendi, declined to
comment on the sale, as did spokesmen for KKR, Thomas H. Lee, Bain,
Apax and Blackstone. Michael Sandler, a spokesman for PAI Management,
also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi shares rose 39 cents to $13.76 on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock has lost 74% of its value this year.</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin, the Boston-based publisher of J.R.R. Tolkien's
"The Lord of the Rings" and the "Curious George" children's books, is
worth $1.4 billion to $1.7 billion, Morgan Stanley analyst Sarah
Simon said. The rest of the publishing unit is worth about $2
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi bought Houghton Mifflin for $2.2 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Vivendi have lost a quarter of their value since
Jean-Rene Fourtou replaced Messier on July 3 and began talks with
lenders. When he joined, Fourtou said the company was "on the verge
of default."</TE>
<TE>   After getting a $980-million loan, Vivendi is in talks for an
additional $1.95 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A sale "would certainly give Vivendi much needed cash and
alleviate worries of a cash crunch, at least until March," said Hank
Forsyth, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in London.
"They still have a valuable group of assets."</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi Universal is in negotiations over the sale of its pay
television technology business to French electronics company Thomson
Multimedia for some $194.6 million, sources close to the talks said.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations with Thomson over Vivendi's Canal Plus Technologies
unit are at an advanced stage, sources said. Thomson Multimedia
already owns 3% of Canal Plus Technologies but previously had ruled
itself out of the running.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi plans to sell Canal Plus Technologies as part of a breakup
of its pay-television division.</TE>
<TE>   A sale of Vivendi's publishing business may be opposed by the
government, some analysts said. France's minister of culture,
Jean-Jacques Aillagon, said over the weekend he was concerned about a
sale to foreign buyout funds.</TE>

<HD>Escrow Closes on Warner Purchase</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Douglas Emmett Realty is believed to have paid
$335 million for six office towers in Woodland Hills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD BERTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Escrow has closed on Douglas Emmett Realty Advisors' purchase of the
Warner Center Plaza office towers in the heart of the Warner Center
commercial complex in Woodland Hills.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Monica company, which owns and operates commercial and
residential buildings on behalf of private investors, is believed to
have paid about $335 million for the six glass-skinned high-rises on
Oxnard Street.</LD>
<LD>   Douglas Emmett principal Jordan Kaplan declined to disclose the
price paid for the high-profile real estate. He said the acquisition
"helps round our strategy" to secure a significant share of the
Valley's Class A office market, adding that he looks forward to
tackling opportunities in the Warner Center district.</LD>
<TE>   Douglas Emmett bought the buildings, totaling 1.8 million square
feet, from AH Warner Center, which took title to the high-rises and
adjacent Warner Center Business Park low-rise complex in 1995. Warner
Center pioneer Robert Voit and various partners developed the
buildings from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. and Harvard University's endowment
fund make up the AH Warner Center group. Boston's AEW Capital
Management is the group's asset manager. The sellers listed the
portfolio for sale last year through Secured Capital Corp., a West
Los Angeles real estate investment banking firm.</TE>
<TE>   Kearny Real Estate Co., a real estate investment group in Century
City, has agreed to purchase Warner Center Business Park for a
reported $55 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Warner Center Plaza deal marks the largest investment to date
for Douglas Emmett, whose Southern California office portfolio in
recent years has expanded from the Westside to San Fernando Valley's
Ventura Boulevard corridor. The firm has converted the former Sherman
Oaks Galleria enclosed regional mall into a mostly open-air retail,
entertainment and office center.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Emmett representatives didn't return calls seeking a
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Valley real estate professionals said the new owner could boost
Warner Center Plaza's value by renovating buildings and finding
tenants for the 20-story tower vacated this year by Health Net Inc.</TE>
<TE>   About 465,000 square feet was available within the Plaza at the
end of August, according to the complex's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Safai, a real estate investment broker with Madison Partners
in Brentwood, said the acquisition should be good for Douglas Emmett
and its clients because they bought the signature towers at a price
far below what it would cost to build them.</TE>

<HD>Hong Kong Exchange's Owner Eyes Amex Stake</HD>
<DH>Deals: Bankers involved in the sale say the firm, which is
looking to create a 24-hour trading network, is among six potential
bidders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The American Stock Exchange, put up for sale by its parent, the
National Assn. of Securities Dealers, said Wednesday that it has six
potential bidders. Bankers involved in the sale said the parent of
Hong Kong's exchange is among them.</LD>
<LD>   "We have half a dozen parties that have expressed interest," said
Robert Rendine, spokesman for the Amex. "We are still in the initial
phases and we have had no direct talks with anyone."</LD>
<LD>   The NASD is selling the Amex--the No. 3 U.S. exchange, far behind
the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market--three years
after buying it.</LD>
<TE>   The NASD also is spinning off the Nasdaq market. Once free of its
exchanges, the organization will focus on its role as a market
regulator.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd. is interested in buying part
or all of the Amex, analysts said. "Hong Kong Exchanges is trying to
deploy some of its cash," said Stephen Kam, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore Exchange Ltd. and a venture capital firm also are
considering bids, according to published reports.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Hong Kong's stock exchange declined to comment.
A Singapore Exchange spokesman also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong Exchanges wants to create a 24-hour trading network by
linking with other exchanges, analysts said. Exchanges worldwide are
consolidating and forging alliances as investors demand access to a
wider range of securities on one trading platform across many time
zones.</TE>
<TE>   The Amex, established in the early 19th century, lists 600 mostly
small and mid-sized companies. The NYSE has about 2,800 companies and
Nasdaq almost 4,000.</TE>
<TE>   Far more important than company stock trading at the Amex is
trading in "put" and "call" options and activity in baskets of stocks
known as exchange-traded funds.</TE>

<HD>Stilwell Plans to Change 9 Berger Fund Managers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stilwell Financial Inc. said it expects nine of 13 Berger Funds to
change portfolio managers after the company consolidates its
investment advisory business under the Janus brand late this year.</LD>
<LD>   The biggest of the nine funds is Berger Growth Fund, which has
$506 million in assets, said Berger spokeswoman Elizabeth Stout in
Denver. The funds' trustees have begun discussing options for a new
advisor. Once the trustees pick an advisor, they will put it to a
vote by fund shareholders, Stilwell spokeswoman Peggy Landon said.</LD>
<LD>   Stilwell is folding the funds' current advisor, Berger Financial,
and Stilwell's other investment advisory units into the new Janus
Capital Management Inc. on Dec. 31.</LD>
<TE>   Some Berger growth funds may be merged into similar Janus funds,
said Mark Whiston, who will head the new Janus. But he said the
decision is up to Berger trustees.</TE>
<TE>   The nine Berger funds expected to change managers are Berger
Growth, Berger Large Cap Growth, Berger Mid Cap Growth, Berger Small
Company Growth, Berger Balanced, Berger International, Berger
International Core, Berger International Equity and Berger
Information Technology.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Yahoo.com's home page was devoid Wednesday of its usually vivid
colors, its white background replaced with gray. Amazon.com carried
drawings, essays and poetry from New York City schoolchildren.</LD>
<LD>   "I've learned that you should always leave loved ones with loving
words," eighth-grader Stephanie wrote. "It may be the last time you
see them."</LD>
<LD>   The Internet, already home to poignant electronic archives, marked
the Sept. 11 anniversary in its own way.</LD>
<TE>   Some Web gathering spots emphasized the medium's power for instant
reaction to galvanizing events. Others stressed reflection, not
expression.</TE>
<TE>   Slashdot, a site frequented by techies, reran messages from its
stunned readers a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The online auction site EBay draped a flag over its home page and
opened a temporary discussion board about the anniversary, while
White House, Lycos and other sites replaced their front pages with
tributes.</TE>
<TE>   Most sites had their regular materials accessible through a link.</TE>
<TE>   But Topica, which sends more than 50 million messages a day to
about 4,000 corporate and community discussion lists, took down its
site and suspended service for most of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Zornosa, the company's president and chief executive, said
Topica worried that some messages, particularly commercial
advertising, could be seen as inappropriate or insensitive on a day
of reflection.</TE>
<TE>   "E-mail is just such a powerful medium," Zornosa said. "We really
saw that a year ago with how well it was used as a tool to keep
people connected."</TE>
<TE>   Banner ads at AOL Time Warner sites were replaced with pictures of
candles and links to a site where visitors could learn about
opportunities to give money, volunteer and remember, as well as
obtain information on discussing issues with children.</TE>
<TE>   The online greeting-card site Blue Mountain featured
anniversary-themed cards in categories such as "Thinking of You" and
"Thanks to the Troops."</TE>
<TE>   The Web site MemorialsOnline lets visitors light a virtual candle
and offer a word of tribute.</TE>
<TE>   At the e-mail and Web community board Craigslist, users shared
details about vigils and other events offline.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago, while major news Web sites were jammed as people
craved details on the attacks, the Net proved its mettle as a
communications facilitator.</TE>
<TE>   People who found telephone voice circuits clogged were able to
send "I'm OK" e-mail messages to their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Web journals, known as blogs, emerged as forums for trying to make
sense of the events.</TE>
<TE>   Some sites found the best way to mark the anniversary was to keep
doing what they have been doing. Wednesday was business as usual at
the InstaPundit blog, run by University of Tennessee law professor
Glenn Reynolds.</TE>
<TE>   "Fancy memorial pages aren't what I'm good at," Reynolds said on
his journal. "So while I'm going to post a couple of retrospective
items, I plan to spend today thinking about today and tomorrow--not
last year."</TE>

<HD>The Power of the Presidency Has Come Full Circle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT DALLEK</AU>
<BD>Robert Dallek's latest book on presidential history,
"An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963," will be published
in 2003 by Little, Brown.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Propelled by economic depression and war, the presidency became the
uncontested center of American political life in the 30 years after
Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. In the almost 40 years since John
F. Kennedy's death, however, the institution has suffered a slow
decline. Lyndon B. Johnson's credibility gap, revelations about White
House abuses of power and the end of the Cold War made the country
less inclined to look to the Oval Office for leadership.</LD>
<LD>   The Reagan administration represented a temporary pause in the
process, but George H.W. Bush's undistinguished term and Bill
Clinton's impeachment signaled the rise of an imperial Congress and
diminished faith in presidential regard for the majority's needs as
opposed to special interests. The 2000 election contest between two
of the most lackluster candidates since the vacuous Warren G. Harding
defeated the forgettable James M. Cox in 1920 gave no comfort to
anyone eager for a resurgence of presidential influence.</LD>
<TE>   Although George W. Bush's first eight months in office gave little
indication that he would reverse the trend, Sept. 11 opened the way
to a turnaround. As Theodore Roosevelt believed, nothing serves
presidential standing as well as war. Bush's response to the attacks
gave him and the presidency a greater hold on public approval. Bush
struck all the right notes in his speeches, unleashed the U.S.
military against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and promised
an unrelenting war against terrorists. He reminded Americans of FDR's
rallying cry after Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's high approval ratings were evidence not only of national
unity in response to an unprecedented challenge to the nation's
domestic tranquillity but also of genuine feeling that the country
could rely on him to see us through the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Events in the last six months, however, have weakened these
convictions. Bush has been learning the truth of Abraham Lincoln's
lament: "I claim not to have controlled events, but confess freely
that events have controlled me."</TE>
<TE>   Osama bin Laden's disappearance and the amorphousness of the enemy
have made it difficult to focus national attention on the war. There
is nothing that serves presidential leadership as well as having an
identifiable adversary: Woodrow Wilson versus the kaiser; FDR and
Winston Churchill against Adolf Hitler, Hideki Tojo and Benito
Mussolini; Harry S. Truman battling Josef Stalin; Kennedy versus
Nikita Khrushchev. Despite recent administration efforts to associate
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein with the terrorists, neither the American
public nor the international community has been persuaded.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also has been unlucky in the events that have recently roiled
the economy. Corporate corruption, stock market downturns, mounting
deficits and fears of recession have made the war on terrorism a
lesser priority. Concerns about a nuclear war between India and
Pakistan and the seemingly incessant bloodletting between
Palestinians and Israelis, for which the administration has had no
convincing answers, have added to the doubts.</TE>
<TE>   The threat of future terrorism in the U.S., the uncertain state of
the economy and an eagerness for peace in the Middle East make the
country eager for a reinvigorated presidency--a chief executive who
not only uses the office as a bully pulpit to rally the nation
against terrorism and corporate malfeasance but also identifies
policies that can assure a renewed march toward greater prosperity at
home and long-term stability abroad.</TE>
<TE>   These challenges will not be easy. Though no one expects miracles,
the country always hopes that its leader will make at least
incremental advances toward the nation's highest ideals. Sept. 11 has
given renewed urgency to American dreams and the desire for
presidential leadership to achieve them.</TE>

<HD>We Cried and Remembered, Together</HD>
<DH>North Tower, South Tower, E-Ring, Shanksville were our
battlefields.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD>James P. Pinkerton writes a column for Newsday in New
York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"That's a wonderful expression we hear all the time--Americans all
together." That was from Peter Jennings, born a Canadian. The ABC
anchorman hosted a program Wednesday, "Answering Children's
Questions," part of a daylong remember-athon. And I loved every
minute of the whole fest.</LD>
<LD>   The twin towers may no longer be standing, but for one more day,
at least, Americans were all standing together. But like any bright
shining moment, the feeling will fade as patriotism yields to
partisanship and disillusionment.</LD>
<LD>   What united us was the universality of Sept. 11. "They were our
neighbors, our husbands, our children, our sisters, our brothers and
our wives," said New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg at ground zero.
Indeed, the preferred style of public mourning these days is to
remember each and every victim. And so it was that former Mayor Rudy
Giuliani and nearly 200 other readers--politicians, celebrities,
victims' families--tolled through 2,801 names of those who died at
the World Trade Center.</LD>
<TE>   Across the nation, shrines were visited and dedicated. In San
Francisco, memorializers laid out some 3,000 little flags on a lawn,
under big banners reading "NYPD" and "FDNY." In that city, Mark
Bingham, the gay man remembered as one of the heroes of United
Airlines Flight 93, has assumed a mythic status. "Out" gays and
lesbians might not be allowed to fight in Afghanistan, but they can
and did fight the terror war at home.</TE>
<TE>   And that's a further lesson in togetherness: All Americans are in
this fight together, if only because most of the fatalities occurred
on the first day, Sept. 11. Places where civilians died--North Tower,
South Tower, E-Ring, Shanksville--now have the resonance of
battlefields, alongside Lexington, Gettysburg, Omaha Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But we keep a special place in our hearts for the firefighters
who, in the emblematic act of Sept. 11, went running up when everyone
else went running down. The A&amp;E network honored Battalion Chief Ray
Downey, his two firefighter sons remembering him proudly. One said,
"Nothing like running down a smoking hall with your dad."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, amid the warm pride it was a day for chills and goose-bumps.
Cameras lingered over the shrines: the steel girder-cross found in
the rubble, the sculptured sphere that survived nearly intact, the
new eternal flame.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly it was an occasion for thinking about what was gone. On
MTV, Moby said that he once had a view of the trade center from his
roof deck. Remembering that morning, he added: "For the first time in
my life, I saw New York as vulnerable, as something to be cherished."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if it's honest and unironic emotion, then that's the
cue for country and western. And the twanging of steel guitars and
invoking of simple emotions could be heard nationwide. Country Music
Television got right to the point in its electronic programming
guide: "Patriotic." And definitely the kind of patriotism that
unites. An old Charlie Daniels song, "In America," was in rotation:
"Cause we'll all stick together/And you can take that to the
bank/That's the cowboys and the hippies/And the rebels and the
Yanks."</TE>
<TE>   Most remarkable was another CMT tune, a Brooks and Dunn cover of
the Youngbloods' 1967 hit, "Get Together." At the time, the lyrics to
that song--"try and love one another right now"--were seen as
anti-Vietnam War. That once-controversial context has been forgotten;
the new mood is unity--cowboys and hippies loving the same country.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to musical reconciliation, there was visual
reconciliation. A loop of red, white and blue ribbon was seen not
only on CMT but also on MSNBC. That looped-ribbon shape was first
used by AIDS activists. Now it's an American flag ribbon, for all of
us, no matter who or what we are.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, George W. Bush exemplified just that sort of
earnestness, that heart-on-sleeve plain-spokenness. He emphasized
tolerance as he visited a mosque, but he made it clear that we would
find its future as one nation, not many. He was, in the words of A&amp;E,
"the president who found his voice in the rubble." And the people
rallied to his blunt confrontation with "evildoers." Yet, as ABC's
Claire Shipman observed Wednesday, "for a while, his moral clarity
lined up with the world's moral clarity. But the world has to some
extent moved on." She added: "It will be interesting to see how the
president adapts to this change."</TE>
<TE>   It will indeed. The last year saw victory over the Taliban but not
the capture of Osama bin Laden. And now the country's security
condition has worsened a notch--or a color. As the terror war enters
its second year, Bush's go-get-'em specificity is being lost in
generality. In his speech at Ellis Island on Wednesday night, the
president mentioned neither Bin Laden nor Al Qaeda. What was voiced
instead were the unmistakable signs of "mission creep"--toward war
with Iraq, away from the consensus of Americans, even further away
from international alliance. In fact, Bush seemed to want to solve
all the world's problems, as when he said, "Ours is the cause of
human dignity: freedom guided by conscience ... the hope of all
mankind."</TE>
<TE>   It would be hard for anybody to argue with any of that, but of
course what Americans want most is assurance of no more 9/11s.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, as the first anniversary slips away, Americans
can at least treasure the all-together unity of that tragic yet
uplifting day. The memory of Sept. 11 will always be with us,
haunting and inspiring, like mournful moonlight through the window.</TE>

<HD>With the Media, We Get What We Ask For</HD>

<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a New York writer and a senior fellow
at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up
after Sept. 11 to study terrorism. Web site: www.norahvincent.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last weekend, when I got the idea for this column, I was going to
call it "Enough Already on 9/11." I was going to say that I, who for
months watched and smelled and tasted the towers burning, was now
9/11ed out. I had binged on tears. There were no more in me. I'd had
it with all the gearing up for pageantry and the ostentatious hyping
of grief.</LD>
<LD>   Last weekend, this seemed like an original thing to say.</LD>
<LD>   But as this week has worn on, everywhere I've looked, alongside
all the anticipatory memorializing, there has arisen a strain of
distaste among the public and, more surprising, media commentators.</LD>
<TE>   Everybody, it seemed, had been getting as sick of it as I was. The
media had, like haywire kangaroos, started boxing themselves to the
point where the mea culpas about coverage were almost, at times,
eclipsing the coverage.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday morning, for example, WNYC radio host Brian Lehrer
practically talked his listeners out of listening. He suggested the
unthinkable: Limit your media intake on Sept. 11, he said. Don't
overdo it. Don't get numb. Then, in what I can only suppose was a
reversion to type, he added that those who felt overloaded by the
network coverage could always find solace by calling in to his show.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, National Review columnist Jonah Goldberg advised us to
get the mute button ready, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
television critic John Levesque opined that "piling on the 9/11
programming is an odd way to pay respect."</TE>
<TE>   It was starting to look as if the media bashing was going to tell
us a lot more about what Sept. 11 had done to the media than what the
media had made of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this blame-the-media-first jeremiad has been going on
long before Sept. 11, 2001, and it has some validity. Back in 1996,
for example, in his book "Breaking the News," Atlantic Monthly
national correspondent James Fallows made the stunning claim that
what the public thinks on a range of subjects "depends on what
journalists tell us." This is undeniable. Fallows also may have been
right when he damned "the values of journalists" and "their current
practices," which he said undermine press credibility.</TE>
<TE>   But this isn't the whole story.</TE>
<TE>   As much as we depend on the media, the media depend on us. Because
of the sheer scope of the 9/11 attacks, the media are on the
defensive now for their purported excesses. But whose excesses are
they? Theirs or ours? After all, as much as they inform, the media
also hold the mirror up to nature. Far from choreographing current
events and attitudes, media outlets also scrabble for ratings, a
sport that caters entirely to us.</TE>
<TE>   If the networks don't give us what we want, or at least more of
what we want than their competitors, they flop.</TE>
<TE>   So what are we really decrying here--the media's relentless
juggernaut of coverage, or our own morbid curiosity? We're overdoing
it, fueling the glut every bit as much as they are, rubbernecking the
whole mess all over again and disliking ourselves for it. Hence the
louder outcry.</TE>
<TE>   The media have always been reflections of our twisted
sensibilities. We simply haven't been willing to recognize them as
such. The sheer magnitude of Sept. 11 and its redux changed all that.
How could we help but acknowledge our own greed for footage when the
world was coming down around us?</TE>
<TE>   By what they choose to show us and how they slant the news, the
media, to a large extent, tell us what to think. But we, in turn,
tell them what we are able to hear. The relationship is symbiotic,
the need reciprocal.</TE>

<HD>The Next Chief of Police Should Be, First and Foremost, a
Cop</HD>
<DH>The leader of the LAPD must know firsthand what makes
officers tick.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY WACHTEL</AU>
<BD>Jay Wachtel, an assistant professor of criminal
justice at Cal State Fullerton, spent 25 years in law enforcement.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As The Times recently noted, "over the last 10 years, the Los Angeles
Police Department has had three chiefs, all of whom left under fire."
Each time, community leaders winnowed through a pool of candidates,
looking for that one charismatic leader who could single-handedly
negotiate Los Angeles' political and social minefields, boost officer
morale and lift a supposedly foundering agency out of a quagmire--all
without costing an additional cent.</LD>
<LD>   Again, we're playing the same tune. Again, will we hit a sour
note?</LD>
<LD>   At the woefully underfunded LAPD, the pressures of business are so
intense that doing a good job as a patrol officer is measured by how
quickly one "clears" calls for service. Many detectives cannot
remember the days when "investigation" meant something more than
picking up the telephone.</LD>
<TE>   After decades of chronic short-staffing, time and attention are
luxuries reserved for the most aggravated crimes. Worse, with
sergeants tied up on internal investigations and paperwork, and
senior lead officers distracted by other tasks, supervision--a
difficult enough thing to accomplish in the decentralized atmosphere
of police work--has disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   When essential resources are in short supply, attributing
difficulties only to poor "morale" or weak leadership is simply
ridiculous.</TE>
<TE>   Lacking the money or political will to fix the real problem,
exasperated officials have turned to an endless stream of remedies.
One of the better known is "community policing." This is an appealing
but frustratingly vague strategy that has generated volumes of
overblown rhetoric, supported the careers of many academics and
created a fat bureaucracy in Washington. Still, as its implementation
would require many more officers, not fewer, it is hard to see how
this expensive fix could play in cash-strapped L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Reforming "police culture" is another enticing, feel-good fix.
Stripped to its essence, it promises something for nothing: that we
can produce a kinder, gentler, more responsive police force by having
officers take a few classes or recline on a couch for therapy. But
occupational cultures do not spring up in a vacuum. Police are shaped
by their surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   Want nicer cops? Breed nicer citizens. Achieving that end calls
for a dynamic social and economic agenda, something far beyond the
ability of even the most enlightened police leader to implement.</TE>
<TE>   Still, if the money isn't forthcoming, morale is important, if for
no reason other than to keep the few cops we have left. LAPD officers
have always been in demand by smaller agencies, which offer less
stress, shorter commutes and the luxury and autonomy of
single-officer patrol cars.</TE>
<TE>   So we return to the question: Who should be chief?</TE>
<TE>   To earn the respect of the line, it must be someone who is deeply
invested in the craft of policing. Moving through the ranks of larger
agencies takes so long that ambitious employees often spend little
time on the street.</TE>
<TE>   Those who rapidly rise to administrative sinecures have sent a
clear message: They are not that interested in the real work of the
police.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft was created and continues to be led by talented
engineers with an intimate knowledge of product and place. There is
no difference here. A chief must know what makes cops tick. To
energize a police organization and nudge it in the appropriate
direction requires someone who understands the sensibilities of
officers and the environment in which they operate. These
characteristics are most likely present in candidates with a strong
background in patrol and detective work, both as a line officer and
first-and second-level supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Policing is an honorable occupation. Its troubles are
fundamentally troubles of the street. We need a chief attuned to its
nuances, who knows enough to be skeptical of easy solutions, who can
resist being co-opted by the troops while still recognizing there is
a difference between working mistakes and willful misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD has many experienced captains and commanders who could
rise to the occasion. Don't look for a big name. Look for a big
heart.</TE>

<HD>Film Agency Flubs Its Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The agency that issues film permits in Los Angeles County starred in
its own drama last week. Prosecutors searched its offices and the
home of its president as part of an investigation into questionable
spending that included more than $200,000 to political campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   The plot turned to farce when the agency president, his attorney
and their co-stars--politicians who created the Entertainment
Industry Development Corp., sat on its board and pocketed its
contributions--started quibbling over whether the agency was public
or private, barred from making political donations or not.</LD>
<LD>   Legality aside, they muffed their lines. They forgot the key word:
"wrong."</LD>
<TE>   Worried about film production (and jobs and tax revenues) fleeing
the county for more hospitable settings, Los Angeles city and county
governments created the film agency in 1995; the board's 45 members
include the City Council and county Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   The mission was and is a valid one: wooing film companies and
making life easier for them by having one agency handle permits,
street closings, police and fire services and all the other headaches
that go with turning real streets, buildings and homes into movie
sets. It's the means that are under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   A county audit of the film agency turned up such extravagances as
100% tips at fancy restaurants (subsidies for actors-in-waiting, no
doubt) and a $3,000 initiation fee and $200-a-month charges for
agency President Cody Cluff's membership in a Beverly Hills cigar
club.</TE>
<TE>   But even more misguided were the political contributions,
including donations to more than a dozen politicians who now serve or
once served on the agency's board. That's right, many of the
politicians who created and were supposed to be shepherding the
agency accepted and even solicited donations, as though the film
agency needed to convince them that filmmaking should stay in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody knows that promotion costs money; no one is quibbling
with the wining-and-dining part of the job, showoff tips excluded.
But board members need to get rid of agency executives who can't tell
when marketing crosses into misuse of public money, including those
who spend $3,000 to puff cigars.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, voters need to elect City Council members and county
supervisors who understand that a quasi-public film agency has no
business donating public money to politicians, themselves included.
That kind of sleazy "generosity" invariably leads to kickbacks,
cronyism and other forms of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   It's also stupid. Los Angeles politicians who are not already
working to keep the tinsel in this town don't need campaign
contributions. They need to look for another job.</TE>

<HD>Florida Ballot Blues Redux</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Florida, Florida, Florida. Glitches in Tuesday's primary forced Gov.
Jeb Bush to declare a state of emergency and keep polls open an extra
two hours. Suddenly, long-repressed images of hanging chads popped
into our heads, along with all the reasons it's imperative for
Congress to pass the election reforms it has mired in partisan
bickering since that last fiasco.</LD>
<LD>   The disputed 2000 presidential election revealed how antiquated
the American voting booth had become. Congress vowed to modernize it.
Although individual states made changes--California voters approved
counties' replacing punch cards with ATM-style voting
machines--Congress has accomplished nothing.</LD>
<LD>   Punch card equipment from the 1960s is what caused many of
Florida's election problems in 2000. In May 2001, the Florida
Legislature came up with $32 million to buy new machines, fund voter
education and train poll workers. The touch-screen machines keep
ballots from getting damaged or mis-marked. They also enable counties
to issue ballots in foreign languages.</LD>
<TE>   But as the spectacle of gubernatorial candidate and former U.S.
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno forced to wait outside a polling station to
vote shows, it's vital that poll workers be properly trained to use
the equipment. Voters also need guidance. Somehow, that didn't
happen.</TE>
<TE>   In Duval County, as The Times' John-Thor Dahlburg reported
Wednesday, poll workers didn't boot up the machines until they
realized that technicians weren't going to come to do it. Some
retirees in South Florida had difficulty operating the machines and
forgot to press a button that casts the ballot. Amid all the
finger-pointing among Florida state officials, it seems clear that
they failed to educate both voters and poll volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   A systematic federal effort directed at improving voting would go
a long way toward ending a voting system that made the U.S. an
international laughingstock in the last presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   In August, President Bush axed from a spending bill $400 million
for new machines and educating voters and poll workers. An election
reform bill spearheaded by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) that
has passed the Senate contains a $3.5-billion grant program. It
mandates a number of changes: a new federal agency with a four-member
bipartisan commission to administer funds for machinery and training,
statewide computerized voting systems and foreign-language
accessibility for voters with limited English.</TE>
<TE>   No bill is going to be perfect, given the fights between Democrats
and Republicans over issues including what kind of identification
some first-time voters should be required to produce. But the mess in
Florida should remind Congress to resolve these disputes quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Florida voters--like Bill Murray in "Groundhog
Day"--will be stuck on repeat.</TE>

<HD>The Man to Send to Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He is not a career diplomat, but Tony Garza knows so much about
Mexico and the United States that even Democrats in the Senate were
impressed with his performance during a hearing Sept. 4 before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate should promptly
confirm him as the next ambassador to Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Once on the job, Garza's biggest challenge would be to persuade
his friend President Bush to at least occasionally return his foreign
policy focus to Mexico. Six days before the 9/11 attacks, in
welcoming that nation's president, Vicente Fox, to the White House,
Bush said that "the U.S. has no more important relationship in the
world." Then came the war on terrorism. Mexico is still waiting by
the phone.</LD>
<LD>   Born and raised in the Texas border town of Brownsville, Garza was
shaped by overlapping forces of American and Mexican cultures, and by
four Mexican grandparents. When he was 28, Cameron County elected him
judge. In 1995, then-Gov. Bush appointed him Texas secretary of
state. Three years later, Garza won a seat on the Texas Railroad
Commission, the key regulatory body governing the state's oil and
natural gas industry--an experience he would find useful as the
United States and Mexico work together to meet current and future
energy needs.</LD>
<TE>   Living on the border, Garza has seen the importance of the 1994
North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and subsequent $230
billion in goods that flow back and forth annually, making Mexico the
United States' second-largest trading partner--ahead of Britain,
France, Germany and Italy combined. Border life also has allowed
Garza to witness the serious environmental problems plaguing the
2,000-mile line dividing the two countries. He knows why safe and
orderly immigration is critical.</TE>
<TE>   At the Senate hearing, Garza said of the challenge: "I'm committed
to getting it right." Which won't be easy. Mexico is one the United
States' largest diplomatic missions. Its Mexico City embassy houses
30 U.S. agencies, and the ambassador also is responsible for nine
consulates and 13 consular agencies.</TE>
<TE>   During Jeffrey Davidow's tenure as ambassador, the two countries
developed a mature and open dialogue based on shared responsibility.
But Mexico is at a historic watershed, with Fox unable to deliver on
the changes he promised. These include fiscal reform and a meaningful
immigration agreement with the United States, including a guest
worker program and--here's the hard part--some form of legalization
for Mexicans already here. A hostile Mexican Congress and the effects
of the United States' anti-terrorist border-tightening on Mexico's
economy have made the task that much more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Garza's up to it.</TE>

<LD>Silly me! I thought any unsolved murder was newsworthy, implying both
a family that cannot have peace and the existence of a killer in our
midst. So why does Lee Gardner (letter, Sept. 10) dismiss further
investigation into the death of Tupac Shakur as "drivel" (Sept. 6-7)?
The only possible reasons are that Shakur was an artist and a black
man.</LD>
<LD>   The prevalence of this kind of attitude in our country makes me
wonder why I should care who killed all those cops and stockbrokers
(clearly, no friends of mine!) in New York last year.</LD>

<LD>I read "Israelis Adapt to Annoying Searches, Ubiquitous Guards"
(Sept. 9) and heard their complaints loud and clear. If it was not
truly sad it would be very funny. My advice to them is to spend 24
hours in the occupied territories navigating the checkpoints and the
torn-up roads, all at gunpoint. It is guaranteed to make them feel
better.</LD>

<HD>Drawing 9/11 Parallels on Freedom</HD>

<LD>Diane McWhorter's Sept. 9 commentary drawing parallels between the
9/11 terrorist attack on our country and the Titanic disaster is a
self-serving, ridiculous analogy betrayed by her conclusion that
somehow our country has failed by not using the attack as some sort
of impetus to inspire an anti-capitalist, anti-corporate movement.
There is nothing to tie 9/11 to "corporate greed." Neither the twin
towers nor the Titanic were "gaudy monuments" to "crass materialism."</LD>
<LD>   The Titanic was a big ship that, through engineering errors and
operational errors, struck an iceberg and sank. More than
three-quarters of those on board died--rich, poor and in between. The
twin towers were engineering marvels that simply functioned as places
of business, places for many ordinary citizens to work.</LD>
<LD>   To imply that somehow MTV and the twin towers themselves deserved
or invited attack is to diminish the responsibility of the
coldblooded fanatics who committed the crime. These same fanatics
would put McWhorter under their thumbs in a burka, covered head to
toe and cowering in their presence.</LD>
<TE>   Tying the whole episode to her condemnation of U.S. corporations
is equally juvenile. No, 9/11 stands on its own. It has no parallel
or correlation to any political point of view.</TE>
<TE>   We were attacked. Thousands were killed. It was because they hate
our free system. You and I can both criticize aspects of our system,
most of which can be chalked up to the foibles of human nature. The
U.S. has responded. We provided an opportunity for freedom to an
entire country, Afghanistan. Freedom will win even if freedom
includes MTV and corporate, personal and political greed.</TE>

<TE>   Thank you, Diane McWhorter, for saying so beautifully what so
badly needs saying. While our so-called leaders would send us to the
mall, our grief aches to have us serve the causes of justice,
fairness and equality and an inclusive spirituality, to have honest
conversation with each other and with the world, to truly listen and
be listened to. Wallowing in a sea of misspent, maldistributed
dollars in a ship with watertight compartments only for those who can
afford the price of a politician will not assuage our deep longing to
work for the good, the true and the beautiful.</TE>

<TE>   McWhorter spouts a tired moral equivalency argument and states
that "what the jihadists hated about us was ... the trash culture
that is our most visible global export." Really--trash culture. This
from terrorists who, among other heinous acts, promote the utter
degradation of women. I would rather hear a stoned rapper than hear
about the stoning to death of a young Muslim woman.</TE>

<TE>   In all the volumes written about 9/11 and the meaning it should
have for us as a society, no one captures it better than McWhorter.</TE>
<TE>   I think she speaks for many of us who deplore our continued drift
toward the meaningless pursuit of excess and its trash culture.</TE>
<TE>   What will it take for us to heed the message of "the better angels
of our nature"? God forbid, not another 9/11.</TE>

<LD>Re "Rights and the New Reality--Congress, Courts: Step In,"
editorial, Sept. 9: Ignoring the Constitution seems to be in vogue
these days. So few Americans have ever read or understand the
importance of our marvelous document. If we allow our legislative and
executive branches to ignore it, then we will lose our democracy.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush acts as if he can do anything he wants with regard
to a war against Iraq. However, the Constitution clearly grants
Congress the power to declare war and to control the money in any
war. The Constitution placed war power in Congress for good reason:
Tyrants had ruled people's lives for millenniums. Our new government
was to change that with a system of balanced power.</LD>
<LD>   Citizens need to become well informed about our constitutional
form of government and their civic responsibilities. It is the people
in this government who are sovereign, and it is also they who pay in
lives and money for the actions of their elected officials. A new,
deep and lasting patriotism can result with our nation committed to
learning about its greatest treasure--a constitutional government.</LD>

<LD>Re "Threat by Iraq Grows, U.S. Says," Sept. 9: Do we really have to
barge through the front door with our military tactics blueprinted
Web-wide to dispose of Saddam Hussein? If the CIA can read a license
plate in real time with surveillance satellites, pray tell why can't
it insert a spook in range of Hussein and kill him? One man, survival
unlikely, versus countless American boys dying and billions of
dollars.</LD>
<LD>   No United Nations approval, no congressional chitchat and leaks;
just take the SOB out. Game over. Where's (author Robert Ludlum's)
Jason Bourne when we need him?</LD>

<TE>   I read through Jonathan Last's Sept. 8 Opinion piece, "Political
Peril Aplenty if Congress Gets to Vote," wondering when he would get
to the part where Congress and the Senate weigh such concepts as how
a moral society behaves. What will be the long-term consequences of a
war with Iraq, and what efforts are being made to represent the will
of the American people?</TE>
<TE>   Alas, those ideas are not part of the debate. The debate is not
about our representatives searching their consciences for the
decisions that will bring the greatest degree of health, safety,
dignity, freedom, prosperity and hope to the greatest number of
people. To the detriment of us all, it is about playing their cards
right to get reelected. I fear many will suffer for their lack of
vision and courage.</TE>

<TE>   The Bush "go" versus our allies' "no go" opinion on attacking Iraq
now is clearly a question of who is taking the greater risk. You can
be sure that Hussein's initial target for a weapon of mass
destruction will not be Canada, France, Germany or Russia. Since U.S.
citizens will be the targets, and our intelligence community remains
clueless, we must be prepared to "go it alone" if the president so
chooses.</TE>

<TE>   The following dichotomy, often appearing on the pages of your
newspaper, deserves comment. On the one hand, we have people calling
for radical change in our way of life on the flimsiest evidence that
man is responsible for a global warming portending catastrophe for
our planet. On the other hand, most of these same people, in the face
of powerful evidence of the inhumanity of Hussein toward his people
and in the face of strong indications that he would wreak havoc on
his neighbors and the rest of the world if he had the means to do so,
call for inaction. God save us from the elitist intellectual agenda!</TE>
<TE>   Tristan Krogius</TE>
<TE>   Monarch Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. should not wage a war on Iraq to replace Hussein. First,
there is no solid proof that Iraq is building weapons of mass
destruction. Second, many countries around the world, including
Israel and the U.S., have weapons of mass destruction. It is actually
illegal and immoral for the U.S. to interfere in the affairs of other
nations. The U.S. should not wage a war on every country it disagrees
with. Nor is it up to the U.S. to change the leaderships in other
countries.</TE>

<LD>I don't disagree with Gary Swearingen (letter, Sept. 7) that elderly
drivers should be retested from time to time. Where we do disagree,
I'm sure, is that I believe Swearingen and others his age (and
younger) should also be retested. When I see a car tailgating me at
the speed limit (or over) or someone cutting in and out of traffic
lanes to gain a few car lengths, it is always someone younger.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I agree that elderly drivers should be retested. Some kind of law
should require it before tragedies occur. Elderly drivers should be
tested psychologically and neurologically as well; we seem to give
driver's licenses to just anybody these days without really
considering the danger that may lurk. I think that by the age of 75,
at least, hearing and vision should be checked regularly.</TE>
<TE>   There are so many drivers on the road today who should not be
there. They are thoughtless and irresponsible, mostly trying to drive
and talk on the phone and not paying attention to traffic. They are
rude and inconsiderate--and some of them are not elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Toni Jacobson</TE>
<TE>   Monterey Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I have recently been put in the position of having my driver's
license revoked because of failing the DMV driving test. Losing my
license to drive was like being sentenced to jail by a prosecutor
with a limited ability to defend myself. The test is very strict. It
can screen out many satisfactory drivers who have limited
alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the additional driving test and doctor exams
mentioned, I suggest that DMV driver competency hearings include a
driver's representative (like a recent driving instructor who gave
the "accused" lessons), and that prior to losing one's license an
older driver could be given a conditional driving license for
daylight driving only, or be limited to local driving within five or
10 miles of home. This would provide the elder driver some dignity
while allowing family members or neighbors an anonymous way to
encourage the DMV to request another driving test for the individual.
Many elderly drivers realize their limitations and are more willing
to comply when other options are available. I feel like I am a young
man at 71. I walk every day and often run two miles (which I have
been doing for 30 years).</TE>

<HD>Jerry Boyd, 72; Boxing Trainer Wrote Gritty, Lauded Fiction</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Boyd, a veteran Los Angeles boxing trainer and ringside "cut
man" who battled rejection slips for 40 years before becoming a
literary sensation at age 70 with a collection of boxing short
stories written under the pen name F.X. Toole, has died. He was 72.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd, a Redondo Beach resident, died Sept 2 of complications after
heart surgery in a Torrance hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Boyd surprised the regulars at the L.A. Boxing Club near the
Olympic Auditorium two years ago when "Rope Burns: Stories From the
Corner" was published by Ecco Press, an imprint of HarperCollins.</LD>
<TE>   They had no idea that the tall, lean trainer with the white,
brush-cut hair, trim white beard and round, dark-rimmed eyeglasses
was a writer.</TE>
<TE>   But Boyd, a rough-and-ready guy who once had a chunk of his right
ear chewed off during a street fight with a man he found ransacking
his British sports car, preferred to keep his writing separate from
his day job.</TE>
<TE>   A latecomer to boxing, Boyd didn't begin his career as a trainer
and cut man, whose job it is to stop the bleeding of battered
fighters between rounds, until his early 50s.</TE>
<TE>   By then, he had held a succession of jobs, including bartender,
cement truck driver and vat cleaner at a Good Humor Creamery. He even
had a stint as a bullfighter in Mexico in the 1950s, during which he
was gored three times.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades, with no formal training other than being an avid
reader, Boyd wrote--everything from short stories and novels to plays
and screenplays.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike boxers who experience at least the occasional triumph,
Boyd knew only disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   Rejection slips, he'd say after they had ceased being a concern,
are worse than getting knocked out in boxing.</TE>
<TE>   "For years I'd say ... I don't have any talent. I'm not going to
do it anymore," he told the San Francisco Chronicle after his book
was published.</TE>
<TE>   But then, like a bloodied fighter who manages to raise himself up
after being driven to the mat, he would start writing again.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd's change of literary fortune began in 1999 when he made his
first sale--a short story about a cut man who seeks revenge on a
scheming boxer--to Zyzzyva, a San Francisco literary journal.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd had sent the story in cold, plucking the literary magazine's
name out of Writer's Market.</TE>
<TE>   He celebrated the $50 sale by eating three dark chocolates and
drinking a glass of single-malt scotch.</TE>
<TE>   To keep his boxing and writing lives separate, Boyd chose the
pseudonym F.X. Toole, an amalgamation of Francis Xavier, the 16th
century teacher, philosopher and Jesuit saint, and British actor
Peter O'Toole.</TE>
<TE>   New York literary agent Nat Sobel, whose clients include James
Ellroy, read a copy of the short story "The Monkey Look" in the
literary journal and offered to represent Boyd.</TE>
<TE>   Ecco Press reportedly paid a "high five-figure" advance for the
collection of five short stories and a novella that became "Rope
Burns," plus a future boxing novel.</TE>
<TE>   "I read a page and I knew I was going to buy the book," recalled
Daniel Halpern, Ecco's editorial director. "The style was so
unpretentious, so clean, so muscular, and the stories were so clear
in their intent.</TE>
<TE>   "They have, which so much fiction does not have, subject matter
that feels very lived in. And the characters just exploded off the
page."</TE>
<TE>   Ecco Press gave "Rope Burns" a 50,000-copy first printing--large
for a collection of short stories by an unknown author--and, Halpern
said, it sold well.</TE>
<TE>   "People loved the book," he said, "because it was the real thing."</TE>
<TE>   Critics agreed.</TE>
<TE>   A review of "Rope Burns" in The Times called it "a book of
chillingly authentic short stories about fighters and fighting
written from as far inside as you can get."</TE>
<TE>   Ellroy, author of "L.A. Confidential," called the collection "the
best boxing short fiction ever written." And Joyce Carol Oates told
the New York Times that F.X. Toole is "a born storyteller who uses
the language of the ring."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd's son, Gannon, said his father "was very humble" about the
critical response to his book and the widespread media attention it
brought him.</TE>
<TE>   "He was excited that people had finally started reading his work
and appreciating it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The son of an Irish immigrant father and a mother raised in
Ventura County, Boyd was born in Long Beach and grew up in Gardena,
where he worked in gambling clubs as a shoeshine boy during World War
II.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd, who began acting in Gardena High School, studied drama at
Los Angeles City College and while stationed in Brooklyn in the Navy
Reserves in the early 1950s, he studied briefly with acting teacher
Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse in Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   But Boyd quickly discovered that acting wasn't for him. Inspired
by reading Ernest Hemingway's bullfighting book "Death in the
Afternoon," he took off for Mexico City, where he studied at the
university and trained to be a bullfighter.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd was working as an L.A. bartender in the late 1970s when he
began frequenting boxing gyms to get in shape.</TE>
<TE>   "Boxing opened up to me, and I was good at it," he told Newsday
two years ago. "All of a sudden I was in the middle of something that
I adored being in the middle of."</TE>
<TE>   Dub Huntley, a professional boxing trainer, began training Boyd
and, a few years later, Boyd started helping Huntley train fighters
and became Huntley's cut man.</TE>
<TE>   The two men traveled to fights as far away as Paris and South
Africa. But through all their years together, Huntley recalled
Wednesday, Boyd never mentioned that he was a writer.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd dedicated "Rope Burns" to his longtime friend.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerry is a guy, I don't care what would happen--he could have
made a million dollars with that book--and he'd still be the same
Jerry," Huntley said. At the time of his death, Boyd was preparing to
turn in the manuscript of his boxing novel, set on the Texas-Mexico
border. Halpern said he hopes to publish it.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son, the thrice-married and divorced Boyd is
survived by two other children, Ethan of Tustin and Erin of Rancho
Palos Verdes, and three grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>The True Spirit of Patriotism Resides in the Voting Booth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>People say they are more patriotic now. But fewer people are voting.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't track.</LD>
<LD>   Supporting America means supporting democracy. That means voting.
Freedoms aren't only preserved on the battlefield. They're also
preserved through the ballot box.</LD>
<TE>   You'd think patriots would do more than wave flags; they'd
exercise their freedom to participate in democracy.</TE>
<TE>   End of lecture.</TE>
<TE>   What grabbed my attention was a recent statewide survey by
pollster Mark Baldassare for the Public Policy Institute of
California.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that of the California citizens who are least
likely to vote on Nov. 5, roughly three-fourths said they planned to
"display the flag or other American symbols" on the one-year
anniversary of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been looking at what effect 9/11 has had on voting around
the nation," Baldassare says, "and the answer is none."</TE>
<TE>   In California's March primary, only 24.6% of voting-age citizens
turned out. A historically low 34.6% of registered voters cast
ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Baldassare polled the Central Valley. Two-thirds of the
nonvoters reported feeling "more patriotic" after the attacks; 42% "a
lot" more.</TE>
<TE>   "Patriotism didn't seem to make a difference in voting," the
pollster notes.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Gale Kaufman agrees:</TE>
<TE>   "In focus groups, there's a real ambivalence about this particular
election cycle that I haven't seen before. As much as there's a
feeling of patriotism, people say, 'There are really more important
things I can do with my patriotism. Something in my community. Just
get up and go to work.'</TE>
<TE>   "I can't explain it. People are feeling much more patriotic. But
their concern about the country doesn't translate into paying more
attention to voting."</TE>
<TE>   Offhand, you might think people don't vote because they're unhappy
with their choices. But many nonvoters don't even bother to find out
what their choices are.</TE>
<TE>   The other day I phoned some of the nonvoters Baldassare surveyed
after the primary. All had reported becoming more patriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "I just vote when there's a presidential election," said Bonnie
Mendoza, 21, of Dinuba. She's a mother of two and a community college
student. "I don't have time to keep up with everything. With two
small kids, I really don't get to watch TV."</TE>
<TE>   David Cataline, a Modesto delivery driver, was at a Dodgers-Giants
game in San Francisco, but a stepson explained his ballot boycott.
"He's disgusted with politicians. You can't trust them," said Mark
Smith, echoing a familiar refrain. "And politicians are just using
9/11 to get into office."</TE>
<TE>   Frances Everett, 22, said, "I have a very busy life. I live way
out in the country"--in Shingletown, east of Redding.</TE>
<TE>   I asked how she squares increased patriotism with not voting. "You
have to have certain priorities in life," she replied, "and sometimes
you have to do things that need to be done right now.</TE>
<TE>   "I work on a llama ranch. We have 45 head."</TE>
<TE>   The most noteworthy nonvoter, of course, is the Republican nominee
for governor, Bill Simon. The investor missed several elections
before he became a politician. He has admitted the mistake and
apologized.</TE>
<TE>   There are moves underway to make voting more interesting and more
convenient.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature has passed a bill to return the statewide primary
to June, the traditional time in California. March voting was
ludicrously premature. Every four years, there'd be a separate early
presidential primary.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, by Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), is on Gov. Gray Davis'
desk. The governor has not signaled a position. But his political
guru, Garry South, likes the idea--"speaking for myself."</TE>
<TE>   "Holding a state primary in March is like trying to sell Halloween
costumes in May," South says.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson asserts that the closer the primary is to the general
election, the more likely it is that people will become interested.
He notes that 11 states, including New York, held primaries Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   There's also Proposition 52 on the November ballot. That would
allow citizens to register to vote at their polling place on election
day. Now, the registration deadline is two weeks before the election.
Polls point to a possibly close vote on this measure.</TE>
<TE>   On Davis' desk is a bill by Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza (D-Long
Beach) that would permit new citizens to register right up until
election day.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in March approved a $200-million bond issue to move
California into touch-screen voting by 2004.</TE>
<TE>   You can now obtain permanent status as an absentee voter.</TE>
<TE>   The goal in all this is to make voting almost as easy as flying a
flag from the roof of a speeding car. It always has been more
important.</TE>

<CX>   Voting technology--George Skelton's Capitol Journal column in the
Sept. 12 California section said that voters approved a $200-million
bond issue "to move California into touch-screen voting by 2004."
Although many counties plan to use the money for that purpose, it
also could be used for other voting technologies.</CX>

<HD>Anaheim Chief Sued by Latino Activist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Latino activist who has sued Anaheim's police chief over an
internal background report that he claims defamed him and violated
his civil rights, said Wednesday he hopes the action will serve as a
wake-up call to police departments everywhere.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this was tremendously dishonorable," said Amin David,
chairman of the Latino rights group Los Amigos of Orange County, who
filed the lawsuit last week along with two other residents. "We are
deeply hurt about it and hope there will be very strong admonitions
by city councils to watch police agencies that are doing this."</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, naming Police Chief Roger Baker and the city, asks
for unspecified damages for Baker's alleged attempt to "discredit and
defame" the three residents in a confidential report presented to the
City Council during a closed meeting in 2000. The report caused
"damage to their personal, political and professional reputations,
emotional distress, loss of earning capacity and humiliation," the
lawsuit contends.</LD>
<TE>   Joining David in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in
Santa Ana, are Francisco Ceja and Jessica Castro, acting on behalf of
the estate of the late Josie Montoya.</TE>
<TE>   Baker was out of town Wednesday and could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Baker has characterized the background check as a "snapshot in
time" designed to improve the Police Department's relationship with
the Latino community. "There's nothing secret here," he said last
year.</TE>
<TE>   The problem began when David and the others filed complaints
alleging police misconduct, the lawsuit says. Rather than
investigating their complaints, it contends, the department prepared
a 36-page report on their backgrounds, including detailed
biographical information and intricate family trees showing their
links to each other and, allegedly, to individuals with "known
criminal records or gang affiliations."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a criminal," David said Wednesday. "I'm very offended. I
really am."</TE>

<LD>As thousands around Southern California gathered Wednesday to mark
the first anniversary of 9/11, others chose to ignore--or defy--fears
of another attack by spending the day at presumed terrorist targets
such as Disneyland.</LD>
<LD>   Many even boarded airliners, the weapons used a year ago in terror
attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I picked today on purpose to show support for our country and to
show that [the terrorists] don't scare me," said Betsy Beloud of
Auburn, Calif., who wore a stars-and-stripes ribbon Wednesday at John
Wayne Airport. "There's going to be so many prayers today that I feel
safer than I did when I flew in."</LD>
<TE>   Though figures were unavailable, officials at John Wayne said
passenger volume was well below normal for this time of year. Lines
were practically nonexistent at the ticket counters, which were
strewn with American flags and red, white and blue bouquets.</TE>
<TE>   Beloud, flying back to Sacramento after a visit with a friend in
Downey, said her husband had qualms about her flying home on Sept.
11. They called each other daily while Beloud was away and made a
point of talking Wednesday morning before she headed to the airport.
"I told him I loved him and I would see him at 4:20," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Traffic was also sparse at Los Angeles International Airport,
although officials said it wasn't down much more than it would
typically be on a Wednesday after Labor Day. Still, about 110,000
travelers chose, on the first anniversary of the skyjackings, to use
the only commercial airport in the nation that has been openly
targeted by terrorists. Many said they believed traveling on Sept. 11
would be safer, pointing to beefed-up airport security mandated by
federal legislation passed in the wake of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to let them get to us," said heart valve salesman
Chris Romeo, 43, who flew to LAX from Newark International Airport on
Wednesday morning. "My family was more nervous than I was."</TE>
<TE>   At Disneyland, another location often mentioned as a potential
terrorist target, some visitors conceded apprehension about visiting
on the anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared to go today," Cicily Fleming of Stockton said. "But
it's my vacation and we can't stop our lives and stop having fun.
Because if we did out of fear and panic, then the terrorists have
gotten the best of us."</TE>
<TE>   Eyeing her two young children seated next to her, Fleming added:
"And I feel happy being here today, because my kids are happy."</TE>
<TE>   At San Onofre State Beach, in the shadow of the San Onofre nuclear
power plant, surfers were more concerned with high waves kicked up by
the tail end of a Baja hurricane than with terrorist attacks. The
plant has greatly increased security in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hardly celebrating today, but life goes on," said surfer Mike
Lisch of San Juan Capistrano, who works at the plant as an equipment
operator. "I'm glad I have the opportunity to do this."</TE>
<TE>   The anniversary was also on the minds of visitors to sites
infrequently named as potential terrorist targets.</TE>
<TE>   Guests waiting to enter SeaWorld in San Diego cheered as employees
hoisted the flag and the National Anthem was played on loudspeakers
following a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   "That was really something," spokesman Bob Tucker said. "You could
hear a pin drop for a full minute throughout the park, and then we
heard a large cheer from our guests outside. It was a nice feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Shoppers at South Coast Plaza found distraction at the massive
Costa Mesa mall.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the terrorists really want to scare us so we would change
the way we live our lives," said Jonathan Stamboli, 23. "I'm treating
today like any other day. What's the point of being scared?"</TE>
<TE>   Mike St. Agne, 21, visited the mall to avoid the onslaught of
anniversary coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew today would be all about Sept. 11, and I didn't want to
turn on the TV. You're constantly bombarded with the repeat of events
over and over again, as if the people's pain were being exploited.
It's overkill. I feel numb to it," said the Upland resident. "I
didn't want to get depressed over the repeat of events all over
again. I don't want to have to think about it."</TE>

<HD>John P. Frank, 84; Attorney Won Key Decision in 1966
Miranda Case</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak to an
attorney, and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If
you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at
government expense.</LD>
<LD>   --Miranda rights</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   John P. Frank, the constitutional scholar, professor and lawyer
whose defense of Ernesto Miranda before the U.S. Supreme Court helped
etch those words into the vocabulary of arresting officers, ensuring
the civil rights of all criminal suspects, has died. He was 84.</TE>
<TE>   Frank, a staunch civil libertarian and key advisor in an earlier
U.S. Supreme Court case mandating school desegregation, died Saturday
in a Scottsdale, Ariz., hospital after a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent lawyer for 62 years, Frank wrote or delivered
arguments many times before the high court. One client in the 1950s
was the state of Arizona, which was trying to preserve its share of
the Colorado River from "our great neighbor to the west [California]
who is trying to get all the water in the river." A 1970s client was
the State Bar of Arizona, which was trying to block advertising by
attorneys. Frank argued that advertising by a member of any
profession was inherently deceptive, only to acknowledge a decade
later that marketing was a necessity even for his well-known Phoenix
firm of Lewis &amp; Roca.</TE>
<TE>   But Frank's most famous client was Miranda, who was arrested in
1963 on charges of raping an 18-year-old woman. Picked out of a
lineup, Miranda confessed, was convicted and was sentenced to 20 to
30 years in prison. The Arizona Supreme Court rejected his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union recruited Frank and his partner
John J. Flynn, to take the case to Washington. Frank wrote the brief
and told Flynn to argue it, adding: "This case will make your
reputation. I've already argued before the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   The Miranda decision written by Chief Justice Earl Warren and
announced June 13, 1966, became a hallmark of the Warren court's
record of expanding individual rights. The court adopted Frank's
proposed standard requiring all law enforcement authorities to read
suspects a list of civil rights that was already provided by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was immediately vilified by several police officials
and prosecutors and has been the subject of continuing debate and
litigation. The Supreme Court upheld the decision in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Frank did not save Miranda, who was retried, convicted and given
the same 20-to 30-year sentence minus the time he had already served.
When he was released, he returned to the streets and died of knife
wounds in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   But Frank helped establish the legal requirement, which placed a
printed card in police officers' pockets so they would remember what
to say.</TE>
<TE>   "Miranda was a capstone to a vast cross-cultural pressure," Frank
said in 1986, "that led to law enforcement in this country becoming
more civilized."</TE>
<TE>   After the decision was upheld two years ago, Frank told the
Business Journal that he had originally agreed to take the case
because: "I believe very earnestly that forced confessions are a very
bad thing. The Constitution says no person should have to be a
witness against themselves, and we obey the Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Appleton, Wis., Frank earned his undergraduate and law
degrees at the University of Wisconsin and a graduate law degree from
Yale. He clerked for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo L. Black, about
whom he wrote a 2000 biography, and he taught civil procedure at
Indiana University and Yale.</TE>
<TE>   It was during his teaching stint at Yale in the early 1950s that
he was brought in as an advisor to the NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, which was taking Brown vs. Board of Education
before the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Frank had written briefs in other key desegregation cases and
became a major advisor on constitutional arguments for NAACP lawyer
Thurgood Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Frank moved to Phoenix in 1954 to practice law, remaining a key
consultant for civil rights lawyers across the country. He was an
attorney for the Democratic Party of Arizona for 30 years, and an
advisor on legal issues with nationwide political implications.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, Frank uncharacteristically defended conservative Judge
Clement F. Haynsworth Jr. in Senate hearings when he was nominated
for the court by President Nixon. Convinced that Haynsworth was
innocent of accusations of conflict of interest, Frank called the
55-45 defeat of his nomination "legislative murder" and wrote a book
in 1991, "Clement Haynsworth, the Senate, and the Supreme Court."</TE>
<TE>   Later, Frank opposed two Supreme Court nominations, testifying
against Robert H. Bork in 1987 and advising Anita F. Hill during her
testimony in the unsuccessful attempt to derail the appointment of
Clarence Thomas during his 1991 confirmation hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Frank's 11 books also include "Lincoln as a Lawyer," published in
1961, "Marble Palace: The Supreme Court in American Life" in 1958 and
"American Law: The Case for Radical Reform" in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the law, Frank worked for desert conservation, traveled
the world to hear opera and, according to his daughter Nancy Frank,
"loved zoos, chocolate and flowers."</TE>
<TE>   Frank is survived by his wife of 58 years, Lorraine; five
children, John of Jefferson, Wis.; Gretchen of Los Angeles; Andrew of
San Diego, and Karen and Nancy of Oakland; and six grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service is scheduled Saturday at the Phoenix Art
Museum, where Frank served as a director for more than 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that memorial donations be made to the Desert
Botanical Garden, 1201 N. Galvin Parkway, Phoenix, AZ 85008, or the
John Frank Lecture Series at Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ
85287.</TE>

<HD>Gang Homicides Rise Slightly in O.C. After a 10-Year
Decline, Report Says</HD>
<DH>Crime: The district attorney's office notes that the
numbers are far lower than in the early 1990s. Greater police
presence, longer prison terms are credited.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gang-related homicides rose for the first time in a decade, according
to a report released Wednesday by the Orange County district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   There were 18 homicides recorded last year, compared with 16 in
2000.</LD>
<LD>   That's still a fraction of the more than 70 gang killings the
county recorded in the early 1990s, when gang warfare was at its
height.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said that other types of gang crime, including drug
offenses, vandalism and probation violations, continued to decline
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the number of gang members in the county is at its
lowest level in a decade. The county has 17,306 gang members and 357
gangs, the report said. That's nearly 700 fewer gang members and 10
fewer gangs than in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the decline can be attributed in part to tougher
laws that have kept gang members in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "We're taking a lot of shooters off the street," Assistant Dist.
Atty. Marc Rozenberg said. "We're sending people away for a very long
time now. The law has changed.</TE>
<TE>   "It has helped us fight this plague that we have."</TE>
<TE>   He also credited improved gang law enforcement activities.</TE>
<TE>   Every police department in the county has an anti-gang unit, and
the 12 law enforcement agencies work with prosecutors and probation
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are making their presence [known] out in the streets,"
Rozenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "When there are more police on the streets, you don't have as many
people willing to go out and shoot somebody."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he believes gang crimes will probably rise as the teenage
population increases.</TE>
<TE>   The report was compiled by the district attorney's gang prevention
unit, the Regional Gang Enforcement Team and the Tri-Agency Resource
Gang Enforcement Teams.</TE>

<HD>Kim Hunter, 79; Won Oscar for 'Streetcar'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kim Hunter, the versatile stage and film actress who won 1951's
Academy Award for best supporting actress as Stella Kowalski, Blanche
Dubois' long-suffering sister in "A Streetcar Named Desire," died
Wednesday in New York. She was 79.</LD>
<LD>   Her death, in Greenwich Village, was caused by an apparent heart
attack, according to her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.</LD>
<LD>   Hunter created the stage role of Stella in Tennessee Williams'
towering Broadway play and later rode the character to fame in Elia
Kazan's Oscar-nominated film, each time playing opposite an
electrifying young actor named Marlon Brando, whose shouted mating
call "Stella!" has become an enduring part of cinematic history.</LD>
<TE>   "I had read 'A Streetcar Named Desire' before I read for the part
of Stella," Hunter would recall in a 1999 interview. "I knew it was a
good play, but I don't think I knew how special it was, what a
milestone it would be. I don't think my mind worked that way."</TE>
<TE>   "Doing 'Streetcar' was a joy, needless to say," she said in an
earlier interview. "Plays like that don't come along every other
year. From the struggle to get everything right in rehearsals through
the challenge of sustaining a long Broadway run, it was never easy.
But I wouldn't have given up any of it."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter originated her role on Broadway along with Brando, who
played Stanley Kowalski, and Karl Malden, who played Mitch. Jessica
Tandy played the tragic Blanche DuBois in the stage version, but the
film role went to Vivien Leigh, who had appeared in the play in
London. Leigh, Malden and Hunter won Oscars for their roles, but
Brando was passed over for Humphrey Bogart in "The African Queen."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter's Oscar, however, did not translate into roles of equal
stature. Her subsequent films included "Deadline U.S.A.," "Anything
Can Happen," "Storm Center," "The Young Stranger," "Bermuda Affair"
and "Money, Women and Guns."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to "Streetcar," Hunter expressed fondness for two
other film roles: the 1946 British fantasy "Stairway to Heaven," in
which she played a young American woman working for the Royal Air
Force, and as Dr. Zira, the chimpanzee psychiatrist in the 1968
science fiction classic "Planet of the Apes." She appeared in two
sequels, "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (1970) and "Escape from the
Planet of the Apes" (1971).</TE>
<TE>   Hunter later recalled the arduous task of getting into makeup and
the chimpanzee suit each day. "It was pretty claustrophobic and
painful to a certain extent," she told a reporter in 1998. "The only
thing of me that came through was my eyeballs."</TE>
<TE>   Born Janet Cole on Nov. 12, 1922, in Detroit, her father, Donald,
was a refrigeration engineer while her mother, Grace, had been
trained as a concert pianist and used to accompany choral groups in
public performances. Her father died when she was 3, and her mother
married Bliss Stebbins, a retired businessman from Miami Beach, where
the family subsequently moved.</TE>
<TE>   A shy child, she began to study acting with a drama coach who
lived in her neighborhood, spending hours studying voice technique,
theater history and theory, when not studying on her own. At 17, she
joined a traveling stock company, then got involved with regional
theater, auditioning in California for the acclaimed Pasadena
Playhouse, where she got the ingenue part in a production of "Arsenic
and Old Lace" and a similar role in "The Women."</TE>
<TE>   In 1943, an agent spotted her in Pasadena and she signed a
seven-year movie contract with David Selznick. It was Selznick who
suggested she change her name since Janet Cole was not theatrical
enough and there were already other Janets around, including Janet
Gaynor and Janet Blair. Hunter was delighted because she loathed her
real name. She tossed out the name "Kim" because it was the name of
Magnolia's daughter in "Show Boat." A secretary of an RKO producer
suggested "Hunter." Selznick put the two together.</TE>
<TE>   She made her film debut in a low-budget RKO horror film, "The
Seventh Victim," and followed with secondary roles in other features,
eventually returning to the New York theater.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, Irene Mayer Selznick was producing "A Streetcar Named
Desire" and recommended to her ex-husband that Hunter play Stella
Kowalski.</TE>
<TE>   "I had done a lot of theater--summer stock, winter stock--and ...
David O. Selznick put me under contract to do films," she recalled.
"By the time of 'Streetcar,' I had done about five. I didn't have to
come back and read again; I got it. Incredible!"</TE>
<TE>   In his autobiography, "A Life," Kazan noted that he cast Hunter
because, "The minute I saw her I was attracted to her, which is the
best possible reaction when casting young women."</TE>
<TE>   Hunter was blacklisted by the film industry shortly after winning
the 1951 Oscar. While showing no bitterness, she was concerned that
future generations not forget the toll taken on the entertainment
industry by McCarthyism.</TE>
<TE>   "For a long while, I wouldn't talk about it at all," she said in a
1985 interview. "I do now, because there's a whole new generation
that doesn't remember. And the more one knows, the more one can see,
and not allow history to repeat itself."</TE>
<TE>   Her "sin," she said, was agreeing to be a sponsor of a 1949 World
Peace Conference held in New York during the time she was in
"Streetcar." It so happened that Life magazine came out with a big
picture spread of all the celebrity sponsors and that, in her words,
"fanned the flames."</TE>
<TE>   "I was never a Communist, nor even pro-Communist, but I was very
pro-civil rights and I signed a lot of petitions," she recalled.
"Nobody ever came to me directly and said, 'You are blacklisted,' and
I don't think I ever appeared in 'Red Channels' (a Red-scare pamphlet
that published the names of those suspected of pro-Communist
leanings). "There were only signals, such as the fact there were no
film offers after I won the Oscar, not even from Warner Bros., which
simply never picked up on the contract they had with me.</TE>
<TE>   "At one point," she added, "I called the FBI and asked if I was
posing a problem for my country that I was unaware of. Someone called
on me and said, 'We have nothing on you. ... our problem's with your
industry.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hunter was married to William Baldwin in 1944; they had a
daughter, Kathryn, and divorced in 1946. In 1951, she married actor
and producer Robert Emmett. They sometimes co-starred in plays, and
they had a son, Sean. Robert Emmett died two years ago at age 78.</TE>

<HD>Santa Cruz Officials Plan Pot Giveaway</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SANTA CRUZ</DL>
<LD>City leaders plan to join medical marijuana users at a pot giveaway
at City Hall next week. Their goal is to send a message to federal
authorities that, in this town, medical marijuana is welcome.</LD>
<LD>   The invitation comes one week after agents from the Drug
Enforcement Administration arrested the high-profile owners of a pot
farm and confiscated 130 plants that had been grown to be used as
medicine.</LD>
<LD>   "It's just absolutely loathsome to me that federal money, energy
and staff time would be used to harass people like this," said Vice
Mayor Emily Reilly, who with several colleagues on the City Council
plans to help pass out medical marijuana to sick people from the
garden-like courtyard at City Hall on Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   City Atty. John Barisone said that although the City Council
passed a resolution denouncing the raid, there is no official city
sponsorship of the event. He added that council members and medical
marijuana advocates are acting on their own accord in a public space.</TE>
<TE>   DEA spokesman Richard Meyer was surprised at the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you serious? That's illegal. It's like they're flouting
federal law," he said. "I'm shocked that city leaders would promote
the use of marijuana that way. What is that saying to our youth?"</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, federal agents--acting without support from state
and local law enforcement--raided a small pot farm on a quiet coastal
road about 55 miles south of San Francisco, arresting the owners,
Valerie and Michael Corral.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, leading activists for medical marijuana, have not been
indicted. Their attorney, Ben Rice, said he was informed by the DEA
that the U.S. attorney has declined to prosecute the case. A
spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said she could not comment
on the case, and Meyer said his agency isn't involved in decisions on
whether to prosecute.</TE>
<TE>   State law in California, as well as Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii,
Maine, Nevada, Oregon and Washington, allows marijuana to be grown
and distributed to people with a doctor's prescription. Federal law,
on the other hand, prohibits marijuana use under any circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   California medical marijuana growers and distributors work closely
with local law enforcement, and are quite open about their programs.
In fact, the farm raided last Thursday morning by DEA agents had been
featured in the national media, and the program is listed in the
local telephone book.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, federal agents, working strictly without
local support, have been busting pot clubs and farms in Northern
California.</TE>

<HD>Sacramento County OKs Partner Benefits</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Sacramento County Board of Supervisors reversed itself this week
and voted to offer domestic partnership benefits to the county's
14,000 employees.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-2 decision Tuesday came when Supervisor Muriel Johnson
announced a change of heart after hearing stories of county employees
who faced hardships because their partners did not have insurance.</LD>
<LD>   Previously, a majority of supervisors had opposed the move, citing
potential increased costs and opposition to recognizing same-sex
unions.</LD>
<TE>   The new policy won't cost the cash-strapped county any money
because employees will be required to pay the full premium for their
partners. Eligible couples would have to register with the state as
domestic partners.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I think it's long overdue," said Supervisor Roger
Dickinson. "It's not only the appropriate and humane thing to do, but
it's also a good business decision for the county."</TE>
<TE>   Employees who are worried about their partners' health may be
distracted at work, which does not serve the people of Sacramento, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gay-rights advocates hailed the move.</TE>
<TE>   "We commend Sacramento for recognizing the need to provide equal
benefits," said Ilona Turner, of the California Alliance for Pride
and Equality. "This is a big arena in which same-sex couples are
denied the benefits and rights that married couples take for
granted."</TE>
<TE>   When the new policy goes into effect next year, Sacramento County
will join 14 other California counties and 19 cities in California
that offer domestic partner benefits. Los Angeles County has offered
such benefits since 1995.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Erma Franklin, 64, a Grammy-nominated recording artist who at times
backed up her sister Aretha, died Saturday of cancer at her home in
Detroit.</LD>
<LD>   Franklin spent most of the last three decades working for
Boysville of Michigan, helping at-risk children.</LD>
<LD>   Her biggest hit, "Piece of My Heart," was released in 1967 and was
nominated for a Grammy Award the following year. The song was revived
in a Levi's jeans commercial in Europe in 1992.</LD>
<TE>   Franklin was born in Memphis, Tenn., and started her singing
career at age 5. Erma Franklin and her sister Carolyn, who died of
cancer in 1988, sang backup on Aretha's "Respect," and some credit
Erma with creating the "sock-it-to-me" refrain.</TE>

wave, and beats many competitors to the best spots, long-boarders hit
the beach each morning well before the sunbathing crowds start to
arrive.</CP>

<HD>Attorneys Present Final Arguments in Teen's Fatal Beating</HD>
<DH>Courts: Prosecutor says suspect in the retrial was part of
a mob that killed the Ventura resident. Defense lawyer contends there
is no credible evidence for the charge.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An angry mob beat, kicked, stabbed and bludgeoned an 18-year-old
Ventura man on the steps of his apartment three years ago because
they mistakenly thought he had reported their noisy party to police.</LD>
<LD>   And because Ramiro Salgado was part of that mob, a prosecutor told
jurors Wednesday during closing arguments in his Ventura County
trial, he should be found guilty of second-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   "He's there. He participated. He is guilty," Senior Deputy Dist.
Atty. Maeve Fox said during a two-hour summation.</LD>
<TE>   "He took part in an incredibly savage beating of a human being for
no reason at all."</TE>
<TE>   But a lawyer for Salgado, a 23-year-old Ventura resident, urged
jurors to find him not guilty of murder and a second charge alleging
gang involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Richard Loftus told jurors that prosecutors have no
credible evidence to prove that Salgado participated in the Sept. 25,
1999, slaying of Ventura Theater stagehand William Zara.</TE>
<TE>   Loftus argued that three witnesses to the attack could not
identify his client.</TE>
<TE>   He attacked the credibility of the only trial witness who placed
Salgado near the crime scene, arguing that her brother was granted
immunity from prosecution after identifying Salgado as one of the
assailants.</TE>
<TE>   And while Salgado admitted in an August 2000 police interview to
stomping and hitting Zara, Loftus told jurors that investigators
coerced Salgado into giving a false confession.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know what Ramiro supposedly did," Loftus said, "or
whether he was even there."</TE>
<TE>   Zara died outside his Warner Street apartment in west Ventura
after being hit with a shovel and baseball bat by gang members who
suspected that he and his friends had called police about their party
across the street.</TE>
<TE>   According to court testimony, partygoers waited for the officers
to leave and then confronted one of Zara's friends--sparking a fight
between a few residents and up to 15 gang members who poured into the
courtyard of the small apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   Zara was knocked to the ground and fatally beaten. Witnesses said
the assault lasted only a few moments before the assailants scattered
in different directions.</TE>
<TE>   Some neighbors reported hearing laughter.</TE>
<TE>   When police officers responding to a 911 call returned to the
area, they found Zara lying unconscious on the ground and suffering
from severe injuries, including a cracked skull.</TE>
<TE>   Seven people were indicted on murder charges, although charges
against three were later dropped. The four remaining defendants were
convicted of murder last year and are serving life prison sentences.</TE>
<TE>   Salgado, who was arrested 11 months after the slaying, is the last
defendant to stand trial in Zara's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   This is his second trial. Five months ago, Superior Court Judge
Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. declared a mistrial after the jury deadlocked
over the alleged confession.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors told lawyers afterward that they questioned whether Salgado
participated in the attack or simply told authorities what he thought
they wanted to hear.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fox argued that details in Salgado's statement to
police corroborate other evidence and show that he was an active
participant who knew firsthand what occurred in the courtyard that
night.</TE>
<TE>   As for the defense allegations of police coercion, Fox told jurors
that investigators just outsmarted Salgado.</TE>
<TE>   "There is zero coercion," she said. "It's bunk. It's baloney."</TE>
<TE>   Loftus, meanwhile, urged jurors to reread the transcripts of the
disputed interview and decide for themselves whether the statements
are reliable.</TE>
<TE>   The jury began deliberations late Wednesday and will return today.</TE>

<HD>Robbery Suspect Killed in Police Shootout</HD>
<DH>Crime: Gunfire erupts on a residential street in Stanton
after officers chase suspects in a series of Little Saigon holdups.
Three men are in custody.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A man responsible for a spate of violent robberies in Orange County's
Little Saigon area died in a shootout with police on a residential
street in Stanton after a car chase Wednesday afternoon, officials
said.</LD>
<LD>   The shooting erupted moments after the pursuit skidded to a halt
on the front lawn of a house on Sonnet Street. Two suspects ran
inside the home and then came back out, one opening fire on police
officers, authorities said. A third man stayed in the car and was
apprehended.</LD>
<LD>   A Westminster police officer, who narrowly escaped a bullet, shot
and killed the armed suspect, officials said. Three others, including
the man in the car, the man who ran out of the house and a man who
was inside the house, were taken into custody. Officials declined to
identify the men.</LD>
<TE>   "It's lucky nobody innocent was killed," said Orange County
Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino.</TE>
<TE>   The department is investigating the shooting, but Amormino said
initial evidence suggests that the suspect gave the officer, who was
not identified, little choice but to fire in self-defense.</TE>
<TE>   Officers said they believe that the dead man was responsible for a
series of robberies of beauty salons, restaurants and other Little
Saigon businesses during the last three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the most recent robbery, on Tuesday at the Asian American
Senior Center in Westminster, a 57-year-old man was pistol-whipped
and an 80-year-old woman was threatened with death for not removing a
ring fast enough, authorities and witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the chase began when officers spotted a white Mercedes
they believed was the robbers' car.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia Lopez, 32, who lives about 50 feet from where the shooting
occurred, said she saw the men arrive in a car and run into the
house.</TE>
<TE>   "The cops were chasing them," she said. "They stopped the car and
ran into the house and then one tried to escape into the alley. The
cops followed him and shot him.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very scared," she said. Stephanie Chagollan, who lives
across the street, said she heard several shots.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Wednesday that they believe at least one suspect
lived at the home in Stanton. David Salgado, 12, was arriving home
from school when the shooting happened. He ran inside as fast as he
could.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt very scared because this happened on the same day as the
twin towers," he said. "I didn't know something would happen here in
my neighborhood--it's usually very quiet."</TE>

<HD>Proposal Could Rescue Regional Water Deal</HD>
<DH>Talks: Agency officials hear a plan to tap aquifer for the
Salton Sea. It may help meet limits on take from the Colorado River.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the region's rival water agencies met for an all-day negotiating
session Wednesday, the Imperial Valley water district unveiled a
proposal it says could rescue a deal vital to the future of Southern
California water supplies.</LD>
<LD>   The plan calls for using water from a little-known desert aquifer
in Imperial County to keep the Salton Sea from becoming too salty to
support the countless fish and birds that rely on it.</LD>
<LD>   The Salton Sea, the malodorous, tea-colored body of water that
straddles Imperial and Riverside counties, has become a sticking
point in the proposed sale of water from the water-rich Imperial
Irrigation District to San Diego County because state and federal
laws require that the sea not be damaged by the sale.</LD>
<TE>   Because the sea is replenished by agricultural runoff, any
reduction of water use in Imperial County could inevitably mean a
higher salt content, which could lead to the virtual extinction of
birds and fish in the sea.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District, in a counter to a proposal made
by the San Diego County Water Authority, suggested that the Salton
Sea could be helped by water from the largely untapped East Mesa
aquifer.</TE>
<TE>   The aquifer's water is considered too salty for farming but is
less saline than the Salton Sea. The East Mesa idea was first
suggested months ago by Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine).</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Valley-San Diego deal is crucial to the state's plan
to reduce the amount of water it takes annually from the Colorado
River in excess of its legal entitlement.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposal was made public as representatives of the San
Diego, Imperial Valley, Metropolitan and Coachella Valley water
districts met in Los Angeles for a negotiating session arranged by
Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks).</TE>
<TE>   "People are here working hard to reach a consensus," Hertzberg
said at day's end. "The talks have been very constructive."</TE>
<TE>   If the state does not meet a Dec. 31 deadline for completing the
deal, the Department of the Interior has threatened a mandatory
reduction.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean drastically reduced water for the six counties
served by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District of
Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   But the farmers of Imperial Valley have balked at signing a deal
with San Diego because they think that it calls for too much
fallowing of farmland, and that it unfairly leaves Imperial Valley
with the burden of solving the Salton Sea's environmental problems.</TE>
<TE>   John Penn Carter III, lawyer and lead negotiator for the Imperial
district, said all parties to the proposed agreement "will need to
sacrifice--including finding mitigation water for the Salton Sea."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's counterproposal calls for San Diego to buy less water,
farmers to do less fallowing of land, and the financial terms to be
rearranged so that more money goes to help businesses hurt
financially by a reduction in farming.</TE>
<TE>   "While the counteroffer is not entirely acceptable, it has some
positive elements," said Adan Ortega, vice president for external
affairs for Metropolitan. "We're committed to working to reach an
ultimate agreement."</TE>

<DH>Traffic: Workshops on plans for one of the state's most
congested freeways begin tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To gather more public comment on ways to improve the 101 Freeway,
transportation officials will hold the first in a series of workshops
today.</LD>
<LD>   Transportation officials and engineers plan to present preliminary
drawings and speak individually with those attending the workshops,
which are part of an ongoing study of the 40-mile freeway corridor
from downtown Los Angeles to Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   The $4.5-million study by the California Department of
Transportation has selected five proposed strategies for dealing with
traffic on the freeway, one of the state's most congested. These
include adding lanes, building an elevated rail line down the middle
and improving public transportation to reduce the number of commuters
who drive, Caltrans officials said.</LD>
<TE>   A committee with representatives from Caltrans, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, the city of Los Angeles and the Las
Virgenes-Malibu Council of Governments is expected to announce its
preferred strategy in December.</TE>
<TE>   Some area residents already are rallying those who live or work
along the corridor, whose homes and businesses may be threatened by
freeway widening, to demand public hearings and oppose Caltrans'
efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "People are mad," said Tony Lucente, president of the Studio City
Residents Assn. At an association meeting of about 150 residents
earlier this week, Lucente said there was "unanimous opposition" to
freeway expansion proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Gerald A. Silver, president of Homeowners of Encino as well as the
Coalition of Freeway Residents, said the coalition has mailed
thousands of leaflets to people along the corridor. "There will be
pickets, protests," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The workshops will be held from 6 to 8 p.m. Tonight's meeting will
be held at the Encino Community Center, 4935 Balboa Blvd. Other
meetings will be held on Sept. 18 in the Hollywood Senior Center,
1360 N. Saint Andrews Place, and on Sept. 19 at the Agoura
Hills/Calabasas Community Center, 27040 Malibu Hills Road.</TE>

<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission is holding a
series of public meetings to gather input on how $53 million in
federal housing and community development funds should be
distributed.</LD>
<LD>   "We want to hear from residents," said Carlos Jackson, the
Community Development Commission's executive director, in a
statement.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of unincorporated areas will be asked to discuss
existing resources in their communities and top priorities for future
funding. The input will then help shape the county's annual action
plan and its five-year strategic plan. The funding could be used for
a range of activities, including services for older people,
child-care programs, home-buyer assistance and home repair programs,
and homeless services.</LD>
<TE>   The money was awarded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development.</TE>
<TE>   The next meeting will be held today from 6:30 to 9 p.m. at
Roosevelt Park Senior Center, multipurpose room, 7600 Graham Ave., in
Los Angeles. A list of future meetings is available on the
commission's Web site--www.lacdc.org--or by calling Abbas Zeineddin
at (323) 838-7703.</TE>

<LD>I shouldn't have allowed Labor Day to pass without noting that Alice
Broude recently celebrated her 50th year as a waitress at the Redwood
Saloon on 2nd Street near The Times. During a ceremony in her honor,
she was asked to sing something.</LD>
<LD>   She answered: "I've got two songs in mind, 'We've Only Just Begun'
and 'Take This Job and Shove It.' But I can't decide which one, so I
better not sing at all."</LD>
<LD>   Saloon attendance: When I ran into Alice, she said, "Steve! You
never come in anymore." (I'm only printing this item so my boss will
see it).</LD>
<TE>   Follow these simple instructions: Today's exhibits (see
accompanying) include:</TE>
<TE>   * A men's room that requires a map (photo by Jackson Sleet);</TE>
<TE>   * A road not taken for a lot of reasons in northern England (photo
by Dave Newton);</TE>
<TE>   * A shop with a complicated open-door policy (photo by Joe
Dymkowski);</TE>
<TE>   * And finally, a coupon offer that's tough to navigate (submitted
by Jeff Carruthers).</TE>
<TE>   Boob tube beginnings: The 75th anniversary of the first successful
demonstration of television just fast-forwarded by. On Sept. 7, 1927,
Philo T. Farnsworth, the all-but-forgotten inventor of the magic box,
"transmitted the image of a horizontal line to a receiver in the next
room," the Associated Press said.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Farnsworth wired one of his backers in Los Angeles:
"The damned thing works!"</TE>
<TE>   I can just imagine the backer's response: "But is there cable?"</TE>
<TE>   Serpent privacy issues: Firefighter John Wade of Newbury Park
notes that "with the influx of new residential building, rattlesnakes
and humans often get too close to each other. Firefighters are
usually the nearest local agency trained to handle the close
encounter."</TE>
<TE>   But the firehouse recently received a first-of-a-kind report from
a dispatcher: "Two large rattlers engaging in indiscretions by the
reporting party's waterfall in RP's backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Said Wade: "It's not too often that we are laughing as we head
towards a couple of very large rattlesnakes."</TE>
<TE>   He added that the critters "were not too pleased to be interrupted
in the middle of their family planning session."</TE>
<TE>   Patriotism, within limits: In fashion conscious Newport Beach, a
sign at one health-care center said: "In observance of September 11,
2001, staff, residents, and family members are encouraged to wear
red, white, and blue on Wednesday, September 11, 2002. (No blue
jeans, please)."</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Some folks in Huntington Beach, determined to perform
random acts of kindness on the 9/11 anniversary, handed out roses to
passersby on Wednesday. They were a bit surprised at some of the
reactions. Some people refused the flowers, apparently thinking they
had to pay for them. Others accepted them but tried to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Commented KFWB-AM (980) newsman Bill Cooper: "Perhaps the concept
of 'random acts of kindness' is easier to accept on a bumper
sticker."</TE>

<HD>Uncertain Fate of Monuments to Bygone Era</HD>
<DH>Two massive wood- frame hangars erected in 1942 to house
blimps still impress, but whether or how they can be used has not

<LD>World War II blimp pilot Hugh Tolford remembers floating home in the
darkness after many a patrol hunting for Japanese submarines in the
Pacific, awestruck every time by the man-made wonders rising from the
Santa Ana citrus groves.</LD>
<LD>   Towering before him, bathed in Navy floodlights, were two
gargantuan blimp hangars. At 18 stories high and nearly a
quarter-mile long, they remain the largest wood-frame structures in
the world, according to one engineering group.</LD>
<LD>   "It was just a sea of blackness, and then the lights would come
on. Oh, boy, was that a sight," said Tolford, 86, a retired
lieutenant commander who lives in Sherman Oaks. "Even from the air,
they're impressive. They are just so massive."</LD>
<TE>   Relics of a forgotten era of military aviation, the cavernous
slate-gray hangars at the deserted Tustin Marine Corps Air Station
are so enormous they've been known to support their own weather
patterns--including fog. They are listed on the National Register of
Historic Places, and still dominate the suburban landscape at the
northern tip of Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Tolford arrived at the base--which in World War II was called
Naval Air Station, Santa Ana--when the hangars were under
construction, and he witnessed crews struggling to erect the mammoth
skeletons. The parabolic trusses that frame the buildings were
prefabricated from Douglas fir; the structures are covered in
corrugated aluminum.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1942 at a cost of $2.5 million apiece, the hangars were
each capable of housing half a dozen helium blimps. Each structure
stands 183 feet high, 1,088 feet long and 297 feet wide and covers
almost 300,000 square feet. The Navy Department's Bureau of Yards and
Docks supervised the construction, which from design to completion
took 18 months.</TE>
<TE>   The huge wooden doors of the Tustin hangars have six leaves that
weigh between 26 and 39 tons each, and slide open like accordions on
steel rails.</TE>
<TE>   The hangars are two of 16 the Navy built during World War II along
the West Coast and Eastern seaboard.</TE>
<TE>   Including the two in Tustin, seven remain; two are in Lakehurst,
N.J., two are at Moffett Field in Sunnyvale, and one is in Tillamook,
Ore.</TE>
<TE>   The hangars were built to house a fleet of giant airships that
patrolled the Pacific from Del Mar to Santa Barbara, hunting for
Japanese submarines.</TE>
<TE>   Each blimp was equipped with four 325-pound depth charges, a
.50-caliber machine gun and newly developed radar that could detect
subs sneaking up on the California coast.</TE>
<TE>   The mammoth Navy airships patrolled the sea for 12 to 18 hours at
a time and traveled as far as 150 miles out to sea. Each was manned
by two pilots and eight crewmen.</TE>
<TE>   No sub was spotted off the California coast, however.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, blimps were phased out of the Navy's fleet, and
over the years the hangars have been drafted for a variety of
nonmilitary uses. In 1949, Howard Hughes rented space in one hangar
for a blimp that his company used to advertise the movie "The
Outlaw." The Goodyear blimps used the hangars in the late 1940s.</TE>
<TE>   After the Korean War began, Tustin was recommissioned as the first
Marine helicopter base, in 1951. Each hangar was able to house almost
100 helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The fate of the twin hangars has remained uncertain since the
Pentagon decommissioned the base in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   They have been leased out for an "X-Files" convention and as a
makeshift prayer hall for 12,000 Muslims to mark the end of Ramadan.
Movies have been filmed in the hangars, including the HBO miniseries
"From the Earth to the Moon," the Disney war epic "Pearl Harbor" and
"The Hindenburg."</TE>
<TE>   In August, Orange County supervisors set aside $88,000 to see
whether the northern hangar could be transformed into a military
museum to honor the county's 250,000 veterans. The hangar is part of
an 84-acre parcel the military has deeded to the county.</TE>
<TE>   The museum is being pushed by a local veterans group that already
has $2 million worth of donated vintage tanks, landing craft,
uniforms and other military equipment that was restored for the
recent movie "Windtalkers" about Navajo encryption experts during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The southern hangar, easily visible from Jamboree Road and the
Eastern Transportation Corridor, is being leased from the Navy by
Tustin. Unlike its twin, it has been battered by weather and is the
one more likely to be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   "The city will undertake an analysis to see what the potential
reuse may be, and whether it's worth restoring," said Tustin City
Manager William Huston.</TE>
<TE>   Tolford and other veterans would like to see at least one of the
hangars preserved. "They're unique monuments to a time that should be
remembered," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're unique, not only because of how big they are, but because
of their wood frames," agreed Fred J. Meier, a retired civil engineer
from Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "They used wood, of course, because all the steel was used for
armaments during World War II."</TE>
<TE>   After a three-year campaign by Meier, the American Society of
Civil Engineers officially recognized the two hangars as the largest
wood-frame structures in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "Inside, you can't help but feel like a peanut," Meier said.</TE>

<LD>Grace was never more amazing than Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Heads talked, anchors expounded, eyewitnesses remembered, choirs
sang, musicians played, soldiers saluted, the president prayed, and
tears, blessings and hallelujahs flowed.</LD>
<LD>   All of it televised live throughout the day and night in a cosmic
testament to media gluttony arising from the ashes of Sept. 11, 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Said CNN's Aaron Brown about the extravaganza, "We're open for
business."</TE>
<TE>   Were they ever, with ponderous chin-stroking, itemized
retrospectives and blanket coverage of President Bush's brief speech
to the nation from Ellis Island, with Lady Liberty and her torch
wallpapering his words in the background.</TE>
<TE>   Then later came Scott Pelley's "60 Minutes II" chats with Bush as
part of an expertly told White House account of 9/11 (similar to
those on ABC and NBC), one that predictably had the president
thinking coolly and incisively following the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   For some of us, a leaner remembrance would have sufficed. The
morning's 2 1/2-hour reading of the names of Sept. 11 victims, for
one, was as profound and meaningful in its simplicity as all of the
fat pomp and ritual that continued afterward deep into the evening.</TE>
<TE>   Especially the way CBS News televised this roll call of 2,801 twin
towers dead and missing, being the only network to show their names
and snapshots as former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and 196
other readers performed this sober duty at what Dan Rather titled
"the pit, the soul of ground zero."</TE>
<TE>   Soul, indeed, especially when seeing victims' faces as their names
were called out in this video taps, the images humanizing them in
ways that would not have been possible otherwise. The process
presented them as something beyond apparitions or faceless dead,
providing at least fill-in-the-dot outlines of the shapes and forms
of these people, a minority of whom had already been memorialized in
months of media interviews of their friends and loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   From the speakers' lips to your ears came the names, including a
slew of Thompsons and Ryans, and one Rodriguez after another.</TE>
<TE>   Along with Sept. 11, television was the victims' common
denominator Wednesday. How natural, then, to reflect about them in
relation to that medium, one that indirectly linked most of them in
life as it now did in death.</TE>
<TE>   Had any of the victims watched the HBO premiere of "Band of
Brothers" two nights before they died, contemplating the grisly
results of World War II while unaware, of course, that their own
fates would provoke a different kind of war, an amorphous one against
terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   Were there any playful viewers among the dead? Davin Peterson,
Simon Dedvukaj, Kevin Prior, Kristen Fiedel, Beth Ann Quigley and
James Francis Quinn, all of you in your 20s when you died: Would you
have joined the youngish audience of Fox's "American Idol"? What
about you, Keith Roma, Ryan D. Fitzgerald, Judson Cavalier and Wendy
Small? Admit it. You too would have been hooked.</TE>
<TE>   New Yorker Warren Grifka, did you ever watch "Seinfeld," and if
so, did you laugh at its humor that at once celebrated and targeted
your city? Had you heard of the Soup Nazi, Christina Sunga Ryook?</TE>
<TE>   John Joseph Florio, you sound like a New Yorker's New Yorker. Did
you believe that NBC's "Law &amp; Order" got it right? HBO's "Sex and the
City"?</TE>
<TE>   Were you struck, Jesus Sanchez and Gregorio Manuel Chavez, at how
few Latinos had gained entry to prime time in significant roles? Had
you noticed, Wing Wai Ching and Kyung Cho, that Asian Americans were
all but invisible on the small screen?</TE>
<TE>   Had you watched "The Sopranos" on HBO, Dominick Pezzulo and
Dominick J. Berardi? If so, did you agree with those charging that it
nourished the stereotype of Italian Americans being criminals?</TE>
<TE>   Could you have ever imagined, Mohammed Jawara, that your death
would contribute to an angry, irrational rallying cry against other
Americans with Arabic names who were as innocent as you? What would
have been your opinion, Barbara M. Habib?</TE>
<TE>   Hey, Thomas H. McGinnis, had you heard of Osama bin Laden? What
would you have thought, Steven Howard Berger and Jupiter Yambem,
about today's media-whipped fervor for war with Iraq's Saddam
Hussein? How would you have responded, Londoners Oliver Duncan
Bennett and Melanie Louise DeVere, to British Prime Minister Tony
Blair queuing up behind President Bush?</TE>
<TE>   LaShawana Johnson and David S. Berry, would you have agreed with
the tone of much of the media reporting that Sept. 11 terrorists were
ultimately thwarted by American spirit, even though they caused your
deaths and the U.S. has been reeling emotionally and economically
ever since?</TE>
<TE>   And all of you, would you have even watched Wednesday's coverage
at your workplace or home had you survived Sept. 11 and not been
slaughtered by fanatics? Would you have been as moved as some of us
by the reading of names? By the president and first lady arriving at
ground zero to lay a wreath and then mingle with victims' families?</TE>
<TE>   Instead of black mourning clothes and heavy funereal music, would
you have gone for something upbeat to signify America moving ahead?
How would you have greeted Bush's interview on CBS, and his televised
speech to the nation?</TE>
<TE>   Or would many of you have said to heck with it all and watched "My
Dog Skip" on Fox or the Yankees game on ESPN?</TE>
<TE>   It would have been your choice, of course. That's why the
democracy you died for is so great.</TE>

<HD>A Future Shaped by Hope</HD>
<DH>Many Afghans live on the fringes months after the Taliban
was deposed, but optimism is taking root, nurtured by a sense of
unity and peace.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Twelve months ago, when she heard that terrorists had slammed planes
into the World Trade Center, Jamila Omar had no idea that her own
world, thousands of miles away, would change for the better. Like
most Afghans, she was filled with dread--fearful of facing another
long war, fearful that she or people she loved would be killed.</LD>
<LD>   For the five years of Taliban rule, she dared not emerge from her
home without the all-encompassing robin's-egg-blue burka. On the bus,
like other women, the college-educated journalist took her place at
the rear. She saw stretching ahead of her a life only half-lived.</LD>
<LD>   "I had concluded," she said, "that we women would always remain in
the corners of the room."</LD>
<TE>   A year later, however, women are working and going to school. A
government that is representative has been formed. Except for pockets
of U.S. military activity against Al Qaeda and Taliban suspects--and
despite an assassination attempt last week against President Hamid
Karzai--more than two decades of civil war appear to have ended.</TE>
<TE>   The list goes on: International aid money is beginning to pour in,
albeit not as quickly as people would like, and foreign organizations
are offering advice and personnel. Institutions are forming.
Newspapers are being published in relative freedom. The national
airline, Ariana, has taken wing again. Refugees are returning to
their homes by the hundreds of thousands, exceeding all estimates.
National army and police forces are in training, and mine clearers
are working full time to purge roads and fields of the deadly
explosives.</TE>
<TE>   The country has in Karzai a moderate leader who inspires
confidence in the West and affection from most of his people--even if
he's something of a figurehead with limited powers outside this
capital city. Mohammad Zaher Shah, the octogenarian former king, has
returned and moved back into his old palace. Although no longer a
monarch, he has been given the honorific title "Father of the
Nation."</TE>
<TE>   And in the last few weeks of summer, women such as Omar have found
the courage to shed their burkas and walk with the sun on their
faces, at least here in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "The changes we have witnessed are changes we never even dreamed
of in the past," said Omar, 30, now a reporter for the Kabul Weekly,
a newspaper that strives for Western standards of objectivity in
English, Dari and Pashto. "To begin with, I can tell you about women:
They have not only been physically freed ... but they have been
mentally released."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are worries on the horizon, made all the more
plain by the twin shocks of nearly losing Karzai to an assassin's
bullet in the former Taliban stronghold of Kandahar and the horror of
a bombing that mowed down 26 people in Kabul. On the eve of the first
anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks blamed on Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist network, the latest acts appeared to be a coordinated
challenge to the new Afghan order.</TE>
<TE>   There are still deep fault lines in the society--disagreement over
how liberal a government Afghanistan can afford while many of its
people remain deeply conservative. And many here still fear what
could happen to the country if Western interest flags because of a
war in Iraq or simple boredom. Afghans express anxiety that the
"commanders"--a euphemism for the country's regional warlords--have
not been effectively disarmed and are still playing too large a role.</TE>
<TE>   Although governors are appointed and are supposed to follow
directions from the central government, a lack of rudimentary
telecommunications and a deteriorated road network make it difficult
for officials in Kabul to know what is happening in the regions, much
less impose authority.</TE>
<TE>   Powerful commanders such as Abdul Rashid Dostum in the northern
city of Mazar-i-Sharif and Ismail Khan in the western province of
Herat are able to rule as virtual potentates in their regions,
collecting customs revenues without remitting them to Kabul, while at
the same time paying lip service to Karzai's government.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all this, in big cities and small villages alike
throughout Afghanistan, one encounters an almost uniform sense of
hope that this blood-soaked country has made a worthy start toward
becoming a united and peaceful state. For many ordinary Afghans, the
quality of life hasn't markedly improved, making their optimism even
more poignant.</TE>
<TE>   On the banks of the muddy Amu Darya River, facing Uzbekistan on
the northern frontier of Afghanistan, a 19-year-old high school
student called Najibullah might have cause for complaint. Thin and
ill-clothed, he is living in a warren of hovels made of abandoned
steel containers, and his family draws water from the polluted river
because there is no other source nearby.</TE>
<TE>   But instead of complaints, he spoke enthusiastically of where his
country is headed, and his plans to be part of it.</TE>
<TE>   "We are optimistic that our country has retreated from military
conflicts and now it can become better and better, and that the
reconstruction will continue," he said, adding that his dream is to
be an engineer when he finishes his education. "We are all thinking
in this way, and we are trying our best to help."</TE>
<TE>   What has seized Afghanistan--a phenomenon that might not be
discernible amid the daily news items about conflicts, military
actions and the hunt for Bin Laden--seems to be a national hunger to
make up for the last 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   The spirit can be felt especially in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Its streets are crowded as never before. Of the 1.6 million
refugees who have poured back into the country, more than half a
million have resettled in the capital, swelling its population to 2.5
million.</TE>
<TE>   There is a scarcity of housing, garbage collection, electric power
and, because of drought, clean water. Yet the city hums and bustles.
Returning to it after an absence of six months, one is struck by how
busy everyone seems. The streets are congested with all manner of
conveyances--yellow-and-white taxis, Chinese-made bicycles with
rainbow reflectors on their wheels, pushcarts, donkey carts, even the
occasional horse and buggy or a team of boy-driven buffalo--doomed to
be slaughtered on Butcher's Street.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody is selling something. Restaurants have begun to sprout
up. Although the city retains its cluttered, dusty, war-scarred face,
some of the vehicles on the street are new, like the 50 modern buses
donated by India, the green-and-white police vans sent by Germany,
and the platoons of gleaming white Land Cruisers used by the United
Nations and the more affluent nongovernmental organizations.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a frequent parade of military vehicles, trucks and
armored personnel carriers mounted by jaunty-looking French, German,
Italian or Turkish peacekeepers wearing cool-warrior sunglasses and
bandannas around their necks.</TE>
<TE>   In most of the ministries, too, work is starting to get done. Side
by side, men and women plan their programs and reforms, often
accompanied by small teams of foreign advisors, helping to jump-start
civil aviation, the Central Bank, the phone system.</TE>
<TE>   Enough government functionaries are back on the job that at 4
p.m., the official quitting time, streets suddenly become jammed. A
real rush hour has returned to the city.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a recent Friday at the Haji Yakub mosque, the city's main
place of worship, the thunderous sermon might have raised doubts
about whether the Taliban had ever left town.</TE>
<TE>   "Our nation now needs water and bread, not songs and women's music
on the radio!" exclaimed the imam, Kefayatullah Badakhshani. "Each
one of us has a responsibility to struggle against adultery, sex and
injustice in the country."</TE>
<TE>   In another passage, he said, "This is supposed to be an Islamic
government, and an Islamic government is required to apply Islamic
rule. In this country, there has been war and destruction for 23
years. It is a tragedy now that many Afghans do not have shelter, do
not have a morsel of food. Does such a nation need food and shelter,
or does it need television, films and music?"</TE>
<TE>   One day after the sermon, the Supreme Court of Afghanistan backed
a decision by the head of Kabul Radio and Television to ban women
from singing on the radio and to prevent Indian films from being
aired in the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "We totally oppose the idea of half-naked scenes or ... women's
songs being aired," Fazl Ahmad Manawi, deputy head of the court, told
a reporter. A separate commission appointed by Karzai to monitor
broadcast media, however, said the action was without legal basis.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy was seen here as a way to stake out political
positions for upcoming elections planned in two years. Although there
are no official political parties in Afghanistan, de facto factions
are vying within the ruling group that came to power.</TE>
<TE>   A top government official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
deplored the court's ruling and the action of the religiously
conservative director of Kabul Radio and Television.</TE>
<TE>   "Afghanistan has a long tradition of watching Indian movies, for
at least half a century. For a court to want to change this now, in
this manner, is not the most intelligent thing one could do," he
said. "It stems from a certain amount of ignorance, as well as a
demarcation of the future political battleground between more
fundamentalist groups and more liberal groups.</TE>
<TE>   "This is part of nation-building, because issues like this come up
and it is necessary to address them--and hopefully not with guns."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Fahim Dashty had even more reason than most to be bereft
of hope last September when the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
were attacked. He had suffered severe burns, and was in the process
of being evacuated to France, after surviving a Sept. 9 bombing that
claimed the life of Ahmed Shah Masoud, leader of the Northern
Alliance that then was the last resistance to Taliban rule.</TE>
<TE>   Dashty was filming a documentary of Masoud and was sitting behind
him when the assassins struck.</TE>
<TE>   He spent more than two months recuperating in Paris, and the
collapse of the Taliban gave him an opportunity to return to Kabul.
Dashty, who still bears the scars of his injuries, became the editor
who reestablished the Kabul Weekly after the Taliban fell. He is now
a prominent journalist.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the past year, he identifies as the most important
achievement the holding of the loya jirga, the grand council that
chose a new leadership for the country. And the most serious
challenge for the nation, he believes, is overcoming its lingering
ethnic divisions.</TE>
<TE>   "The meeting of all ethnic groups, all the political groups, in
one tent, lasting eight days, and everyone being able to say what
they wanted--this was a good exercise for us to start over in unity.
The other [positive] factor is the cooperation of the international
community, economically and militarily."</TE>
<TE>   But Dashty said he is angered by the way some of the money
earmarked for Afghanistan is being spent by foreign organizations.
"It's crazy," he said. "They are buying the latest-model cars for
$40,000 each, [which is] the salaries of 10 ministers of the Afghan
government. If we are to succeed in our recovery, we need that money
more than they do."</TE>
<TE>   At the Finance Ministry, where former Johns Hopkins University
professor Ashraf Ghani is trying to set a firm fiscal course, the
matter of foreign aid is also pressing. Ghani sees the fulfillment of
the pledges of assistance made in Tokyo by donor countries in January
as the catalyst for reviving a moribund economy. Development projects
will create jobs and serve as a magnet for foreign investment, which
will bring additional capital and know-how into the country.</TE>
<TE>   But for now, Ghani is worried that even his modest $460-million
government budget for the year may have to be scaled back if the
pledges don't come through.</TE>
<TE>   Ghani refused to be drawn into criticizing the donor governments,
however, saying he understands how slowly the appropriation process
works in various countries.</TE>
<TE>   He believes that the pledges were made in good faith and will
eventually be honored.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been bombed, we have been invaded, but now is the time
for us--with the international community as partners with us," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably quickly, the extremism of the past is fading into
anecdotes. Dr. Fahima Sekandari Khalil, the de facto head of the
country's only maternity hospital during the Taliban years, recalls
the ever-present fear she felt when out in public, like a remembered
rap on her hand when she accidentally exposed her wrist pointing to
an object in the bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   She was a rare woman who was allowed to work--partly because she
was always being drafted to tend to the wives of Taliban officials.
When it was time to go home, she had to draft one of the hospital
janitors to be her escort so she would not be abused by the religious
police.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she has the pleasure of sitting in her own office, managing
the hospital in her own right, and laughing at some of the sillier
edicts that came down from the Taliban religious authorities: Nurses
should not dress in clean, ironed white smocks, only dingy, wrinkled
ones; patients who were beautifully made up should be denied medical
treatment; nail polish was strictly forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   "Already now it seems funny," she said, "but at that time it was
terribly difficult. Yes, it was difficult."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentine politicians, blamed by voters for leading the country into
its worst economic crisis, would have to undergo psychiatric tests to
ensure that they are mentally fit to hold office if a bill before
Congress is approved.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Jorge Capitanich, a former Cabinet chief, has submitted a
bill that would require all congressional and presidential candidates
to take mental and physical exams, a spokesman said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, which may be debated as early as this week, would also
require aspiring leaders to present any criminal records and proof
they have paid taxes in a country where half such potential revenues
are lost to evasion.</LD>
<TE>   Politicians are increasingly the target among voters fed up with a
recession now in its fifth year. It is not unusual for lawmakers to
be insulted or spat on in public.</TE>
<TE>   As March presidential elections approach, the most common popular
street slogan is "Get Rid of Them All!" Soaring poverty and
unemployment have sparked food riots during the last year and forced
four presidents from office since December.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the government partially eased a 9-month-old banking
freeze, allowing savers to withdraw billions of pesos. Economy
Minister Roberto Lavagna announced that beginning Oct. 1, Argentines
would be allowed to withdraw some of the money from accounts that had
been frozen in December to stem a run on banks.</TE>

<HD>Far-Right Party in Austria at a Crossroads</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>A squabble within the party of right-wing populist Joerg Haider has
thrown Austrian politics into chaos, opening the possibility that a
country widely criticized for bringing the far right into government
two years ago will remove it in elections late this year.</LD>
<LD>   Ministers from Haider's Freedom Party, junior partner in the
governing coalition, resigned recently because of the dispute,
prompting Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel of the People's Party to call
new elections.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts say far more voters than usual are undecided, giving
moderate parties a chance to pick up substantial support.</LD>
<TE>   "Normally people know who they are going to vote for; this time
there are a lot of people who don't know what they are going to do,"
said David Pfarrhofer, a director of Market, a respected public
opinion research firm based in Linz. "Usually, maybe 20% don't know
who they are going to vote for; this time it's 40%. So all the
parties have a chance to gain."</TE>
<TE>   The key to the equation is Haider, the charismatic, erratic
populist who has had to apologize for flattering comments about the
Nazi regime, fanned anti-foreigner sentiments and visited Saddam
Hussein this year in Iraq. Haider has played on the fears of
Austria's most isolationist factions, including those who oppose
European Union expansion.</TE>
<TE>   But he and his party have recently suffered a substantial slide in
public support. Nonetheless, officials of the party agreed on
Wednesday to once again make Haider its leader, a post he left in
2000 when the party joined the government. They also chose Herbert
Haupt, the current social services minister, to lead the party in the
elections.</TE>
<TE>   How Haider's party fares in this election could have a lasting
effect on his role in far-right politics here and on his party, many
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The Freedom Party runs the risk of "an electoral Waterloo," said
Fritz Plasser, a political science professor at the University of
Innsbruck. The outcome will depend on several factors, not least of
which is the role Haider plays in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters and opponents alike view him as a masterful campaigner,
more capable than any other Austrian politician of exciting the
electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "We've written Haider off so many times, and we're always
deceived," said Christian Rainer, editor and publisher of the weekly
political magazine Profil. "He always comes back."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Freedom Party and Schuessel's center-right
People's Party, Austria's main parties are the left-leaning Social
Democrats and the Greens.</TE>
<TE>   Haider's party won 27% of the vote in 1999 elections and joined
the government in early 2000. Austria's partners in the European
Union, disturbed by Haider's influence in government, slapped
diplomatic sanctions on the country for seven months, lifting them in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Among the questions in the coming election is how comfortable
Austrians are with the evolving image of their country. A second
issue is whether they perceive the right-leaning government as
tending to their concerns, which include unemployment, an economic
slowdown and a wariness of EU expansion to East European countries,
including four on Austria's borders.</TE>
<TE>   Political analysts said Haider precipitated infighting in his
party to move it back into the opposition role, where it has proven
more popular.</TE>
<TE>   "Haider's appeal was exactly because he was not governing the
country," said Anton Pelinka, a professor at the University of
Innsbruck. Once the Freedom Party became part of the government its
popularity declined, and after the intraparty squabble it polled
recently at about 17%.</TE>
<TE>   "Haider's attempt to break the governing coalition was to make
sure that his party would not say 'yes' to EU enlargement," said
Pelinka, who believes that Haider aspires to a wider role in the
far-right movement in Europe, possibly through the European
Parliament.</TE>
<TE>   That issue plays well with his core constituents, who worry that
EU enlargement will encourage Eastern Europeans to come to Austria
and take jobs from them and lead more Austrians to cross borders to
shop because prices are cheaper.</TE>

<HD>Cry for Me, Brazil, Popular Candidate Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>With five-minute video epics about poverty, death and redemption, the
gruff leftist Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is getting in touch with his
feelings.</LD>
<LD>   Two or three nights a week, the four-time presidential candidate
and current front-runner sits in a chair and tells bits of his life
story to the camera. He talks about shining shoes as a boy and
reveals a painful humiliation his mother suffered when the family
migrated from Brazil's rural northeast to the big city of Sao Paulo.</LD>
<LD>   But most important, Lula weeps. And much of Brazil cried with him
when he recounted a tragedy from his younger days, the day he arrived
at the hospital with baby clothes as his wife prepared to deliver
their first child.</LD>
<TE>   "They told me, 'She died,' " Lula said, repeating the hospital
worker's words with the same curt tone with which they were uttered
decades ago. " 'And the baby too.' "</TE>
<TE>   Remembering that gut-wrenching moment may have been personally
cathartic for Lula. But it was also his opening salvo in the war of
television ads that most analysts agree will play a central role in
determining who is the next president of Latin America's largest and
most populous nation.</TE>
<TE>   For seven weeks before the Oct. 6 election, the major contenders
are appearing three times a week on prime-time television, in a
uniquely Brazilian mix of samba, politics and melodrama. All the air
time is free, giving the candidates their best chance to reach the
more than 100 million voters who will cast ballots.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the pressure of "sweeps week" in the United States
combined with the anarchic give-and-take of a presidential race in
its homestretch.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the campaigns craft their free television time--from 10
minutes or so to 30 seconds--into quick-hit infomercials. The
candidates are cast as the main characters in spots that borrow from
the many elements in the great stew that is this country's popular
culture, including the novela (soap opera) and the musical variety
show.</TE>
<TE>   In between talking heads and testimonials, viewers are treated to
everything from country music jingles--"Jose Serra for president and
jobs, jobs, jobs for the people!"--to children dancing on Rio beaches
with party logos.</TE>
<TE>   Serra, the ruling party candidate, was far behind in third place
when the free commercial time began airing Aug. 20. Many here blame
his mentor, current President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, for Brazil's
languishing economy. But Serra has made a stunning comeback thanks in
part to his highly polished ads--one poll rated them second only to
Lula's in terms of quality and appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In one Serra spot, a series of upbeat declarations by his
supporters jump-cuts into a musical routine staged at a factory, with
dancers dressed in blue overalls, all singing the praises of Serra's
strategy to eliminate the rampant unemployment in Brazil, "The Monday
Plan."</TE>
<TE>   "Today is Monday, a happy day," sing the "workers," whose ranks
include the popular singers Chitaozinho and Xororo. "In a world of
fear, if you have a job, that day is dear."</TE>
<TE>   Center-left candidate Ciro Gomes, in a tough fight with
conservative Serra for second place and a spot in the expected Oct.
27 runoff, attacks Serra in his commercial. The singing workers of
Serra's ad appear in black and white, their happy song giving way to
an angry rap.</TE>
<TE>   "Eleven million seven hundred thousand unemployed," the rappers
chant in staccato Portuguese. "Things have never been worse!"</TE>
<TE>   Such songs are commissioned as part of an overall media blitz
directed by some of Brazil's top marketing wizards, people such as
Duda Mendonca, who years ago won the Gold Lion at Cannes (a
prestigious advertising award) for a commercial selling eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Mendonca is a hired media gun who plies his trade for candidates
across the political spectrum. Some of his first political work was
for the right-wing candidate Paulo Maluf, who was running for
governor of Sao Paulo. Among other things, the marketing wizard made
Maluf switch to a more hip style of eyeglasses. Maluf won the
election.</TE>
<TE>   This campaign season, Mendonca has performed a top-to-bottom image
make-over for Lula, the candidate whose very name strikes fear in the
hearts of wealthy Brazilians and investment bankers.</TE>
<TE>   The Lula of old was a man famous for exhorting crowds of thousands
of workers to struggle--the iconic image of Lula is standing in an
arena full of striking workers in the late 1970s, during Brazil's
dictatorship, angry, defiant, a sort of chubby, Latin Lenin. Today,
Lula cuts an avuncular figure, his graying beard and faint smile
suggesting a wiser, mellower man.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Lula needs to appear on TV that way he is in real life,"
Mendonca said in an interview last year, not long after agreeing to
work for Lula and his Workers' Party, known by its Portuguese
initials, PT. "When he talks with the press--serious, like a bearded
frog--he isn't the Lula that his friends know. Lula is much more
friendly and good-humored. This is precisely the image he needs to
show. He needs to smile more."</TE>
<TE>   For Mendonca, Lula's tears and his stories about his mother are an
invaluable marketing tool. They help address the central weakness of
his front-running campaign: Women don't like him as much as men do.</TE>
<TE>   Some PT activists have accused Mendonca of trying to sanitize the
party's image. To that charge, Mendonca pleads guilty. The PT was too
ideological, he says. It condescended to people, speaking in a
leftist jargon that made voters' eyes glaze over.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, it's silly to have a leftist party that doesn't know how
to talk to poor people," he said. "My work is light, yes, because no
one who is sitting at home in front of their TV wants to watch a
dense political address. People want to see a novela."</TE>
<TE>   It was precisely a novela that Mendonca delivered with one of the
first ads he crafted for Lula, a mini-biopic that begins with a
collage of images from rural Pernambuco state where Lula was born. On
the soundtrack, the popular singer Gilberto Gil delivers a soft, sad
ballad, with a wailing accordion as accompaniment.</TE>
<TE>   Lula smiles as he recounts the happier moments of his childhood,
growing up poor with seven brothers and sisters. But his story takes
a quick, soap opera-style turn when his mother decides to migrate to
Sao Paulo, where Lula's father had traveled some years earlier in
search of work.</TE>
<TE>   "To her great surprise, she arrived to Sao Paulo to find that my
father had married another woman," Lula says. "Today, I think about
the courage this woman had. To be on her own with eight children,
abandoned by a man who left her with nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The tears already welling in Lula's eyes turn to a torrent when he
recounts the death of his first wife in childbirth. Composing
himself, he finds the words that connect the tragedy to the hard
lives that are the fate of most people here.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always thought, even today, that she died like thousands of
Brazilians."</TE>
<TE>   All stations here are required to carry the free political ads
simultaneously, with presidential and local candidates appearing on
alternate nights. It is estimated that about 44% of the Brazilian
electorate had watched some or all of the ads after the first three
nights they began airing.</TE>
<TE>   Serra has slightly more ad time than the other candidates because
the amount allocated to each party is determined by the size of that
party's delegation in Congress. After just two weeks of ad time,
Serra had gained about 15 percentage points on Gomes, tying him in
many polls for second place. Lula is far out in front in most polls,
with as much as 37%.</TE>
<TE>   Against the smooth, polished look of the commercials for Lula,
Serra and the other major candidates, the ads for the minor-party
hopefuls can look like skits from public access television.</TE>
<TE>   The Unified Socialist Workers Party opens its spot with a cartoon
of a vampire taking a deep bite into a map of Brazil. As the camera
pulls back, the vampire is revealed to be Uncle Sam.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Central Command Will Deploy 600 to Air Base in Qatar</HD>
<DH>Military: More than a quarter of the Florida-based
personnel will move to the Persian Gulf nation, perhaps permanently.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a move that would help preparations for a war with Iraq, the
Florida-based command headquarters responsible for U.S. military
operations in the Persian Gulf is deploying more than a quarter of
its 2,000 people temporarily to an air base in Qatar, military
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   About 600 military personnel now at U.S. Central Command
headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base near Tampa, Fla., will be sent
to Qatar in November for a training exercise designed to test the
readiness of newly designed mobile communications facilities, said
Lt. Col. Jim Yonts, a spokesman for Central Command.</LD>
<LD>   The exercise is scheduled to last a week, and all personnel are
expected to return to Florida by early December, Yonts said.</LD>
<TE>   But a senior defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the permanent transfer of a significant portion of Central
Command's functions to Qatar is "something that is under
consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Yonts said planning for the training exercise had been in the
works for several years. But the decision to base the exercise in
Qatar, as opposed to another country, is more recent, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar is viewed as a prospective regional command center for any
U.S. military campaign against Iraq. Word of the exercise emerged as
President Bush seeks international support for a campaign to remove
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1991, when it ran the Persian Gulf War out of an air base in
Saudi Arabia, Central Command has kept much of its equipment at the
Saudi facility and based about 5,000 troops there.</TE>
<TE>   But for months, unsure about Saudi cooperation in the future, the
U.S. military has quietly moved munitions, troop supplies and
communications equipment to Qatar. Among the capabilities being
developed at Al Udeid Air Base, about 20 miles from the capital,
Doha, is an air operations center that duplicates the facility used
by U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, a tent city and air-conditioned warehouses have
sprouted up at Al Udeid. Runways and aircraft parking ramps have been
freshly paved or built from scratch, and hangars for fighter jets,
reinforced to withstand aerial attack, have been constructed.</TE>
<TE>   Both Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald H.
Rumsfeld have visited Al Udeid this year.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Tommy Franks, head of Central Command, has run the
11-month-old war in Afghanistan from his Tampa headquarters.
Periodically he travels abroad to consult with his commanders and
local government officials. U.S. forces have made heavy use of
facilities in Saudi Arabia for the Afghan campaign.</TE>
<TE>   But Franks' aides and other military commanders have complained
about the complications of running a war from a command post several
time zones away.</TE>
<TE>   Franks is likely to visit Qatar during the exercise in November
but is expected to return promptly to Tampa, Yonts said. The command
post exercise, dubbed Internal Look, has been held biennially in the
Gulf region since 1990.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>INCHON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>In the biggest one-day exodus of North Korean asylum seekers coming
from China, 36 people who had been holed up at two sites in Beijing
arrived in South Korea today.</LD>
<LD>   The North Koreans arrived in two groups at Inchon International
Airport, about 35 miles west of Seoul. The first group, 21 people who
had sheltered at the South Korean Embassy in Beijing, arrived via
Manila aboard an Asiana Airlines flight.</LD>
<LD>   An hour later, 15 people who had taken refuge at a German
government school, flew in via Singapore aboard a Korean Air Lines
flight.</LD>
<TE>   Their arrival pushed to 729 the number of North Koreans who have
defected to South Korea this year, 146 more than the number who
defected in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   According to Seoul officials, at least two dozen more North
Koreans were still in the South Korean Embassy in Beijing awaiting
permission to leave China. It was the first time that the embassy had
disclosed that it was housing such a large number of asylum seekers.</TE>
<TE>   Since March, more than 100 North Koreans have been allowed to
leave for South Korea after seeking asylum in foreign offices and
facilities in China.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 26 North Koreans are reportedly being held by the
Chinese. Beijing is obligated by treaty to send home fleeing North
Koreans. But it has let them leave for the South in cases that became
public, perhaps for fear of a foreign outcry. China has tried to
discourage asylum bids by stringing barbed wire around diplomatic
offices and posting more armed guards.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of North Koreans live in hiding in China's northeast.</TE>

by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam," the U.N. agency said in a
statement in Colombo, Sri Lanka's capital.</LD>
<LD>   The statement did not specify when the child soldiers were
released. There are no estimates of the total number of child
soldiers recruited by the insurgents.</LD>
<TE>   The government and the Tamil Tigers are to start landmark peace
talks Monday in Thailand, after 19 years of fighting in which more
than 64,500 people have died.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides have been observing a cease-fire since February.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a Sri Lankan human rights group accused the rebels of
using the cease-fire to forcibly recruit children as soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "Once more ... there are gangs visiting schools and villages and
hauling away screaming children in tractor-trailers," the University
Teachers for Human Rights group said at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for a homeland, saying
the minority Tamils are discriminated against by the Sinhalese.</TE>

<HD>Compelling Case Seen Against Milosevic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL>THE HAGUE</DL>
<LD>After 95 days of testimony, 300 exhibits and 124 witnesses,
prosecutors in the United Nations war crimes trial of former Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic on Wednesday rested the portion of their
case dealing with the massacres and deportation of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the absence of evidence directly linking Milosevic to
atrocities, prosecutors and some trial-watchers contend that a
compelling case has been constructed that he was aware of a
high-level Yugoslav campaign to "ethnically cleanse" Kosovo of its
Albanian population and that he participated in a cover-up.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors have staked much of their case on "command
responsibility," meaning that Milosevic, as president and head of the
armed forces, knew what was happening in Kosovo, or should have
known, and did nothing to prevent it.</LD>
<TE>   The destruction of villages and the forced exodus of Albanians
were stepped up across Kosovo--a province of Serbia, the main
Yugoslav republic--on March 24, 1999, the same day that the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization unleashed airstrikes against Yugoslav
forces.</TE>
<TE>   That led prosecutors to argue that a directed and premeditated
plan was underway.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors brought forward several foreign witnesses, including
European Union envoy Paddy Ashdown, who testified that he told
Milosevic during the war what troops were doing in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Letters were introduced from the former chief U.N. war crimes
prosecutor, Louise Arbour, in which she repeatedly warned Milosevic
that he risked prosecution for war crimes if he did not rein in
Serbian troops in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Concerning a cover-up, prosecutors presented a signed statement
earlier this month from a former Yugoslav secret service chief
stating that he was present at a meeting at which Milosevic gave an
order to remove bodies of civilians killed in Kosovo.</TE>
<TE>   Milosevic will have a chance to present his defense after the
prosecution has completed its case.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Legislators Send Arafat a Message</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Lawmakers force leader's Cabinet to resign despite
his setting an election date.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In a rare mutiny against the power of Yasser Arafat, Palestinian
legislators Wednesday forced his newly appointed Cabinet to
resign--the latest sign of his crumbling authority.</LD>
<LD>   Arafat also announced that presidential and parliamentary
elections would be held Jan 20. He had hoped that at last fixing a
date would stave off the challenge to his Cabinet, but the maneuver
failed.</LD>
<LD>   "Today we proved we can bite," Qadoura Faris announced to
reporters outside the offices of the Palestinian Legislative Council
in the West Bank city of Ramallah. Faris, a member of the council, is
from Arafat's Fatah movement.</LD>
<TE>   "Our aim was to topple the government, and the government now is
toppled," declared Jamal Shobaki, another Fatah lawmaker. "Our next
step is to enforce the rule of law."</TE>
<TE>   Since its election six years ago, the Palestinian legislature has
been viewed as little more than a rubber stamp to Arafat's will. The
Palestinian Authority president routinely ignored the laws it passed.</TE>
<TE>   But Wednesday, members served notice. Their resistance reflected a
growing wave of unhappiness with the way the Palestinian Authority is
run and the direction of the Palestinians' nearly 2-year-old conflict
with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Fed up with the 73-year-old Arafat's autocratic rule and what they
see as his refusal to introduce serious reforms into a corrupt and
inept government, legislators let it be known that they would not
ratify the Palestinian leader's recently reshuffled Cabinet. Several
conditioned their approval on his appointment of a prime minister,
something he refuses to do because it would take away some of his
power.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat lobbied legislators all day long. He summoned key Fatah
leaders to his Ramallah headquarters and agreed to the Jan. 20 date
for elections, apparently thinking that would win approval for the
Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   But when it became clear that his government was headed for a
no-confidence vote that he would be likely to lose, Arafat accepted
the resignations of his ministers.</TE>
<TE>   The political drama came on the third day of the Palestinian
legislature's first full session in nearly two years. A video link
allowed members who live in the Gaza Strip to participate. Israel had
barred 14 Gazan legislators from traveling to the West Bank because
of allegations that they were involved in attacks on Israelis.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat revamped his Cabinet in June under U.S. and European
pressure, adding five members. They included Interior Minister Abdel
Razak Yehiyeh, who recently called for a halt to suicide bombings,
and Finance Minister Salam Fayyad, who is well respected in
international finance circles.</TE>
<TE>   The lawmakers are opposed to the longer-serving Cabinet members,
Arafat cronies who are blamed for many of the regime's failings,
mismanagement and abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators were nearly giddy with what they viewed as their
newfound power.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a challenge to Arafat and his one-man rule," said Hassan
Khreisheh, an opposition legislator from the West Bank city of
Tulkarm. "Arafat must learn from this. We are beginning to show that
elected members can have power."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's developments may not change things substantially
within the Palestinian Authority. Arafat has 14 days to appoint
another Cabinet, and the current one will continue to serve in the
meantime.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the fact that much of the 86-member body rebelled was a
significant barometer of discontent and of a willingness of
legislators to speak out.</TE>
<TE>   In another unusual display, Nabil Amr, who quit Arafat's Cabinet
this year, published a scathing criticism of the president's rule
this week. And he used the semiofficial Palestinian newspaper Al
Hayat al Jadida to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Amr wrote that all Palestinian national institutions are "going
through the darkest days of their history." Instead of blaming Israel
and its military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, he held the
Palestinian Authority responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "We failed in the management of the historical process we faced,"
he wrote. "We failed to establish the rule of law in a manner that
would order the relations between the government and the people."</TE>
<TE>   As for the elections, Arafat had previously said voting would be
held in January but only Wednesday set a date. The Bush
administration, which has called for the removal of Arafat, had
advocated a later date, believing that the sooner elections are held,
the more likely the Palestinian president will be reelected.</TE>
<TE>   No major candidate has thus far stepped up to oppose Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Reuven Rivlin, Israel's communications minister, told Israeli
radio Wednesday that if Palestinians reelect Arafat, "we will
continue to treat them as a people led by a terrorist."</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Probes Terror Ties After Shootout</HD>
<DH>Asia: Battle after police raid on a Karachi apartment house
leaves two suspects dead, five arrested. Gunmen may belong to Al
Qaeda cell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Authorities were investigating whether seven gunmen who hurled
grenades and fired assault rifles Wednesday during a police raid on
an apartment building were linked to terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The three-hour gun battle here left two suspects dead and five
under arrest, Inspector General Syed Kamal Shah said, and six police
officers and intelligence agents were wounded, four of them
seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Although some reports said police suspected that the men belonged
to a cell of the Al Qaeda terrorist network, Shah said he couldn't
reach any conclusions until the investigation was complete. A police
source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the men were
believed to be Afghans or Central Asians.</LD>
<TE>   "The information we received was that there were some criminals
residing in this building," Shah said. "The two dead bodies have not
been identified as yet. After the postmortem, we will put them in the
mortuary, and if they are still not identified, we will presume they
are not locals."</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents have been working with Pakistani police to track down
suspected terrorists in several cities, including Karachi, but Shah
said no foreign law enforcement agents took part in Wednesday's
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Shah said he could not confirm a report that at least one of the
suspects spoke Arabic. "I was on the spot myself," he said. "I did
not hear anything of the sort."</TE>
<TE>   Police surrounded the building at 9 a.m., and the shooting began a
half-hour later. The raid involved apartments on three floors, Shah
said, though only two turned out to be inhabited.</TE>
<TE>   One officer received a life-threatening gunshot wound to the
chest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, police reported that they had arrested five men in a
separate raid who were suspected of planning terrorist attacks on
American fast-food restaurants in Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   The men were suspected of being members of Al Almi, a splinter
group of the militant Islamic organization Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen.
They were preparing to target McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken
outlets in the city, police said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's security forces have been involved in numerous
shootouts with suspected militants in recent months as the government
of President Pervez Musharraf has intensified its efforts to shut
down groups linked to terrorist attacks, such as a car bombing in
June outside the U.S. Consulate in Karachi that killed 12 Pakistanis.</TE>
<TE>   Although this port city has been rife with violent crime and gang
warfare for years, police normally do not come under sustained attack
with grenades and automatic weapons fire, as they did in Wednesday's
gunfight. The firepower fed suspicion that the suspects were trained
militants.</TE>
<TE>   Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups have deep roots in Karachi,
where Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and
killed earlier this year. Police say there were at least two failed
plots to assassinate Musharraf in the city in April.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, police said they had arrested five men from Al Almi in
connection with one of the plots. Police arrested four men from the
same organization in July and accused them of trying to kill
Musharraf with a truck bomb that failed to detonate.</TE>
<TE>   All seven suspects targeted in Wednesday's raid were living on two
floors of the low-rise apartment building, Shah said. A woman and
child also were in the building, but Shah said police evacuated them
before attacking the rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Police had to move carefully because the building was in a densely
populated area, Shah said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not very easy to storm into the apartment," he said. "That
would have been at the cost of great risk to many lives. So we took
time to handle the situation, and we also used tear gas."</TE>
<TE>   Police seized a satellite phone, a laptop computer, CDs, books,
and firearms, hand grenades and ammunition from the apartment,
according to a local newspaper report.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the raid, Shah told reporters that a child had been
killed in the cross-fire, but he retracted that statement later
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Quoting an intelligence official, Associated Press said one of the
wounded suspects scrawled, "There is no God but Allah" in his own
blood on an apartment wall.</TE>
<TE>   Shah said he had not seen that nor heard it reported by any of his
officers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in the room where the two bodies were found, and I have not
seen anything of the sort," Shah said. "But it's not something
uncommon. All Muslims believe that there is no God but Allah. So this
would be proof of their militancy, or the fact that they are
die-hards."</TE>

<HD>Annan Urges U.S. Not to Go It Alone Against Iraq</HD>
<DH>U.N.: Anticipating Bush's speech today, the
secretary-general issues a challenge of his own.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>On the eve of President Bush's address to the United Nations,
Secretary-General Kofi Annan issued a strong warning Wednesday that
the U.S. should not take military action against Iraq without the
world body's approval.</LD>
<LD>   "When states decide to use force to deal with broader threats to
international peace and security, there is no substitute for the
unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations," said a text
released Wednesday for an address Annan will give today before the
president speaks.</LD>
<LD>   "Member states attach fundamental importance to such legitimacy
and to the international rule of law," he added.</LD>
<TE>   Though softened by diplomatic language, and matched with a warning
to Iraq, Annan's message is clear: If the U.S. goes it alone, it will
undermine the international rule of law and risk leaving the Persian
Gulf region in chaos.</TE>
<TE>   The speech's stern language and early distribution set the stage
for the latest round of a diplomatic drama between the Bush
administration and the U.N. Senior U.N. officials said the remarks,
which Annan also gave to Bush on Wednesday, were made available so
they would receive equal attention to the president's speech to the
General Assembly today.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has indicated that, if need be, it will act
against Iraq without the support of the international community.</TE>
<TE>   In the text released Wednesday, Annan said: "For any one
state--large or small--choosing to follow or reject the multilateral
path must not be a simple matter of political convenience. It has
consequences far beyond the immediate context."</TE>
<TE>   He also said: "The more a country makes use of multilateral
institutions ... the more others will trust and respect it and the
stronger its chance to exercise true leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Annan included a warning to Iraq that it was time to toe the line.
"I urge Iraq to comply with its obligations--for the sake of its own
people and for the sake of world order. If Iraq's defiance continues,
the Security Council must face its responsibilities."</TE>
<TE>   The world body has long held a tricky position in the pantheon of
U.S. foreign policy. U.N. officials believe that American governments
often use the U.N. as a surrogate when it is convenient and as a
scapegoat when things go wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the fact that Bush feels compelled to make his case
for taking action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on the
global stage shows that this time, at least, Washington thinks it
needs to be a team player.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of necessity more than choice," said Edward C.
Luck, director of the Center on International Organization at
Columbia University. "Getting international support reinforces the
possibility of getting domestic support and vice versa. The U.N.
happens to be the arena where it all comes together."</TE>
<TE>   Diplomats are relieved that Bush seems to be heeding a chorus of
international warnings that he not skirt the U.N.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a consistent message from all sides, from his father's
former advisors to leaders across Europe and the Middle East," said
William H. Luers, president of the United Nations Assn. of the United
States, an independent think tank. "Since Iraq is unfinished U.N.
business anyway, if you don't at least make an effort to address the
U.N. role, it would be missing a big opportunity to engage a broad
group of nations.</TE>
<TE>   "If we have U.N. backing, it also becomes the U.N.'s problem,"
Luers said. "It's not the U.S. versus Saddam Hussein; it's him
against his neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. doesn't need the Security Council's blessing to attack
Iraq. According to the U.N. resolution that followed Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990, the war is not over until the U.N. verifies that
Hussein's government has destroyed all weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and Britain used this interpretation as the
basis for an airstrike in 1998 after Hussein refused to cooperate
with U.N. weapons inspectors. By then, the international coalition
that initially banded against Iraq was so fragmented, the U.S. feared
that the Security Council would reject a punitive attack if asked.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the U.S. would prefer having the U.N.'s blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bush today plans to present evidence of Iraq's "decade of
defiance" showing that Baghdad has breached almost all its
international obligations, the president won't propose a new U.N.
resolution, his aides say. That will probably fall to Britain,
Washington's major supporter on the Security Council. Behind the
scenes, Bush will send top U.S. officials to lobby more reluctant
council members to join the effort--or at least not block it--while
he would reserve the right to back away from any resolution that
constrains U.S. objectives.</TE>
<TE>   So what role can the Security Council play?</TE>
<TE>   The 15-member council largely agrees that the U.N.'s Iraq policy
needs to be redefined to end Hussein's evasive tactics. Weapons
inspectors haven't been allowed in the country since they left ahead
of the 1998 airstrike, but even when they were there, their demands
for Iraq to surrender known weapons materiel had all the force of
parking tickets, said one former inspector.</TE>
<TE>   Most council members would agree that a deadline should be set for
Iraq's allowing weapons inspectors to return and stronger penalties
if Hussein doesn't allow the monitors unfettered access to all
suspect sites. But the sticking point is how far the U.N. is willing
to go.</TE>
<TE>   Russia and China, both veto-wielding permanent members of the
council, want to find a compromise that avoids the use of military
force, which they believe will destabilize the region--not to mention
their economic interests in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   One idea proposed by the Carnegie Foundation in Washington and
reportedly being floated among Bush advisors is "coercive
inspections," or backing monitors with armed forces who could shoot
their way in if access to a suspect site is blocked. But the weapons
inspectors themselves aren't keen on the idea.</TE>
<TE>   The Security Council was careful while drafting the original
resolution more than a decade ago to make sure monitors remained
unarmed for their own protection, said Ewen Buchanan of the U.N.
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, which trains the
inspectors. They don't want to get caught in a shootout or be taken
hostage and used as human shields.</TE>
<TE>   For a new resolution to pass, there must be nine votes in favor
and no veto from any of the five permanent members, which also
include the U.S., Britain and France.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect a new resolution, not by the end of the month but in the
coming weeks," said Solomon Passy, the foreign minister of Bulgaria,
which holds the Security Council's rotating presidency. "If we can't
reach consensus, we can at least reach a big majority on the
resolution on Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Bush advisors have made it clear that they don't have
much faith that a new resolution or inspection regime will persuade
Iraq to comply.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been plenty of ultimatums" given to the Iraqis,
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice said on CNN this week.
What will occupy the Security Council in the coming weeks is whether
to give the go-ahead to the U.S. to use military force if Hussein
resists efforts to determine whether he possesses weapons of mass
destruction--chemical, biological or nuclear weapons. To do that with
the cover of international approval, the U.S. and council allies may
push the Iraqi leader to compromise in ways he has been unwilling to
in the past, such as requiring access to "sensitive sites" such as
Hussein's many presidential palaces as well as mosques that
inspectors were not allowed to enter.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest fear among diplomats, though, is that the U.S. is
merely seeking U.N. approval to attack Iraq, without regard to the
uproar it would cause Iraq's neighbors, who fear retaliation or loss
of trade with Iraq if they support an invasion. How far do U.S. plans
go? Annan wondered aloud earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   "I know many people are worried about unexpected consequences, and
the question is--the morning after," the secretary-general said.
"What sort of Iraq do we wake up to after the bombing, and what
happens in the region? What impact could it have? These are questions
leaders I have spoken to have posed."</TE>

runs. In a Moscow poll, 53% say attacks were 'deserved.'</DH>

<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA and MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>The world joined the United States on Wednesday in remembering the
horror and recognizing the repercussions of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   People in many nations mourned the loss of lives and of an image
of the United States that had perhaps been an illusion.</LD>
<LD>   "America for many was the place where dreams get fulfilled, a
place where people thought nothing bad can happen," said Katarzyna
Lasocik, 39, a Polish marketing manager who paid her respects at the
U.S. Embassy in Warsaw. "This feeling was crushed."</LD>
<TE>   But the grief was not unanimous. The anniversary juxtaposed sorrow
about the past with fear of the future, admiration for American
values with distrust of American power.</TE>
<TE>   The day was a reminder of how much America's enemies hate the U.S.
: Extremists at a London mosque connected with Al Qaeda held a
baleful celebration they billed as "A Towering Day in History."</TE>
<TE>   The global mood Wednesday was edgy and ambivalent. It reflected a
growing distance between the United States and the rest of the world.
Even among some U.S. allies, solidarity and sympathy mixed with alarm
about what is seen as a disastrous rush toward war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   There were, of course, heartfelt gestures. Thousands of Australian
drivers turned on their headlights in tribute to the dead at 8:46
a.m., the moment when the first plane struck the first tower in New
York. Milan fashion designers and race car drivers played a benefit
soccer game to raise money for the victims and survivors.</TE>
<TE>   The emotions in Britain, which lost 67 citizens in the World Trade
Center, came closest to the outpouring in the United States.
Memorials filled churches, offices, fire stations and town squares.
Television and radio stations provided nonstop coverage of events in
New York and London. Prime Minister Tony Blair, Cabinet ministers,
Prince Charles and Prince Harry joined about 2,000 people at a
service in London's St. Paul's Cathedral.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador William S. Farish thanked the British government
and people, calling them "America's truest friends."</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Frank Dwyer of the New York Police Department presented
British Home Secretary David Blunkett with a bedraggled British flag
found by New York police officers as they scrabbled through the
rubble of the World Trade Center looking for survivors.</TE>
<TE>   "This flag, torn and tattered, still may be flown and is a rich
symbol of the endurance and strength of the British people and the
pain and agony that they went through that day," Dwyer said. "This
flag belongs to this land."</TE>
<TE>   The tone was different in lands such as Saudi Arabia, a nominal
U.S. ally that has come under suspicion since Sept. 11. Fifteen of
the hijackers were Saudi nationals, and Saudis are accused of
funneling millions of dollars to Al Qaeda and other terrorist
networks in the guise of charitable contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia found itself in the awkward position Wednesday of
feeling both like a victim and a suspect, of wanting sympathy and
offering condolences. Young men in cafes in downtown Riyadh, the
capital, said they understood American anger toward their country--up
to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't blame America for the way it reacted, because I
understand the way America perceived what happened," said Mishari
Saud, 21. But he complained that Americans have "lumped us all into
one boat."</TE>
<TE>   "People trusted America so much, they would fight for America,"
said Abdullah, 40, a businessman who said he lived five years in the
United States. "Now we all feel cheated."</TE>
<TE>   Tension hung over Riyadh and the region. U.S. embassies in
neighboring Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and the United Arab Emirates were
closed for security reasons. U.S. military bases were on their
highest state of alert.</TE>
<TE>   Chagrined Saudis have shown signs of confronting their problems.
The kingdom announced this week that it will set up an agency
dedicated to monitoring the work and cash flow of charitable
organizations--though officials persist in denying that the donations
end up in the hands of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to President Bush, Crown Prince Abdullah, the de facto
ruler of the country, said: "We in Saudi Arabia felt an especially
great pain at the realization that a number of young Saudi citizens
had been enticed and deluded.... They allowed themselves to be used
as a tool to do great damage to Islam, a religion they espoused, and
to all Muslims."</TE>
<TE>   Other Muslims in the region disagreed. Asked about Osama bin
Laden, Naima Mohammed, a Palestinian shopper in East Jerusalem
wearing a head covering and traditional embroidered dress, showed off
two prominent gold teeth as she smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a good Muslim and a hero," said Mohammed, 60.</TE>
<TE>   A senior political leader of Hamas, the radical Islamic
organization in the Gaza Strip, said he was happy about the long-term
effect of the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Weak nations and oppressed people got the proof that they too can
stand up against military might," said Abdulaziz Rantisi. "This will
increase Arab revolutionary thinking."</TE>
<TE>   However, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat, along with
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, sent messages of condolence and
support to the American people.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, there was a disconnect between the official line and
public opinion. On a day when Russian President Vladimir V. Putin
told Bush in a phone call that "there are things we cannot forget, we
must not forget," 53% of 2,803 respondents to an instant poll by the
Echo of Moscow radio station said the United States "deserved" last
year's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hostility came in deeds as well as words. Police in Bilbao, Spain,
defused a car bomb Wednesday after a warning given in the name of the
Basque terrorist group ETA; the caller described the 55 pounds of
dynamite as a "special homage" for the anniversary, according to
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   In Afghanistan, U.S. troops avoided injury in two shooting
incidents that marred their own observances. At the Bagram air base
outside Kabul, a lone gunman appeared to challenge coalition forces,
firing an antiquated muzzle-loading weapon at a guard tower about 6
a.m.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops returned fire, wounding the shooter, and Afghan troops
captured him. About the same time, two men were spotted trying to
breach the base's perimeter, prompting an order to close all access
to the base. In eastern Afghanistan near Khowst, two rockets fell in
the vicinity of U.S. forces.</TE>
<TE>   The war on terror was largely upstaged, though, by worries about
the expected U.S. campaign against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   At a memorial service in a Catholic Church in Nairobi, where the
U.S. ambassador recalled the Kenyans and Americans killed by an Al
Qaeda bomb attack in 1998, a Roman Catholic nun implored God "to free
[the U.S.] from the enslaving desire of revenge."</TE>
<TE>   African newspapers similarly used the occasion to warn against
attacking Iraq. "This is a war that must not be waged," said Kenya's
Daily Nation. "Terrorism will not be defeated through terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Nigeria's Daily Trust said any attack on Iraq would rank as "one
of the greatest crimes of the century."</TE>
<TE>   There were protests about a possible U.S. strike against Iraq in
Paris, Manila and Singapore, where a man wearing a Saddam Hussein
mask and army fatigues was arrested at the heavily guarded U.S.
Embassy when he tried to enter a memorial service uninvited.</TE>
<TE>   Some participants in ceremonies said their criticism of policy on
Iraq grew out of affection, not antipathy, for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Heidi Watzold attended a memorial in the Berlin Dome, a blackened
19th century cathedral that was damaged during World War II. The
stout, redheaded Berlin resident wore a sign around her neck that
read: "God Bless America. The souls of terrorists are cursed and will
receive no Paradise."</TE>
<TE>   "I understand that if you can do nothing against this terrorism,
you feel sorrow. You feel you have no weapons," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm against going into Iraq. I pray the Americans and the
Germans don't go in. Think Vietnam. Think Somalia. You don't know the
end. What is the endgame?"</TE>

<DH>Thousand Oaks: A federal loan wraps up financing for the
affordable complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY W. GRIGGS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After seven years of planning, Thousand Oaks officials have finally
completed the last step in financing a 57-unit affordable housing
complex for seniors.</LD>
<LD>   Oak Creek Senior Villas, where one-and two-bedroom units will rent
for $450 and $540, was approved for a $1-million federal loan during
Tuesday night's City Council meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Prospective tenants for the complex at 367 E. Thousand Oaks Blvd.,
next to a Toyota dealership, must be 62 or older and will be
restricted to a household income of $43,080. As part of its agreement
with the city, the developers agreed to keep rents at Oak Creek below
market rates for 55 years.</LD>
<TE>   The project carries an estimated cost of $11.46 million, with the
city and its Redevelopment Agency contributing $3.6 million. The
remainder will be acquired by the developer--a partnership of the
nonprofit Area Housing Authority of the County of Ventura and Long
Beach-based Urban Pacific Builders.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Manager Scott Mitnick said Oak Creek Senior Villas
"illustrates how difficult, complicated, complex and expensive
affordable housing projects can be."</TE>
<TE>   With the city having used nearly 96% of the land designated for
residential development, finding parcels for such a project is
difficult, Mitnick said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few vacant residential parcels left in Thousand
Oaks," he said. "This is one of them."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the federal Housing and Urban Development loan approved
this week, the city in July authorized a $1.1-million bridge loan to
provide the developers with temporary financing. The Redevelopment
Agency spent $1.2 million to buy the land, an expense that will be
repaid.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks has agreed to pay for $250,000 worth of
flood-control improvements to Arroyo Conejo Channel, which runs along
the north side of the nearly two-acre property. The city also agreed
to spend $10,000 a year for five years to hire a consultant to
monitor a mostly dry wetland portion of the parcel, a requirement
imposed by the state Department of Fish and Game.</TE>
<TE>   "This project has eight layers of financing," Mitnick told the
council before it unanimously approved the loan for the complex. The
40-year loan carries a 3% interest rate.</TE>
<TE>   Oak Creek will be a three-story building with 45 one-bedroom
apartments, 12 two-bedroom units, a 2,000-square-foot community room
along with 57 underground parking spaces and 18 guest parking spaces
at ground level. Mitnick said Oak Creek received no waivers and will
be built to the city's design standards.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule calls for the apartments to be ready for occupancy by
early 2005.</TE>

<HD>A Ghost Town's Lesson in Political Reality</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Every now and then a piece of legislation illuminates the good, the
bad and the ugly of politics. So it was with Assembly Bill 1757.</LD>
<LD>   It started as a thing of simple beauty, a bill dreamed up by some
kids competing in a contest sponsored by their assemblyman. Their
winning idea? Designate Bodie, a dusty old mining camp near their
junior high in Mono County, as the official ghost town of California.</LD>
<LD>   The kids' teacher figured that the experience--from the germ of an
idea through the labyrinthine legislative process to a gubernatorial
signature making the bill law--would give her students an insider's
peek at state government.</LD>
<TE>   The assemblyman, Republican Tim Leslie, agreed. Here, he figured,
was a slam-dunk bill, sure to deliver a no-sweat, satisfying victory
for him and the kids.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't turn out quite that way. And what happened made even
Leslie, a 16-year Sacramento veteran, chuckle in disbelief.</TE>
<TE>   * There are 12 students at Lee Vining Junior High School. For
them, winning Leslie's bill-writing contest was a very big deal.</TE>
<TE>   The kids chose the Bodie idea because they think it's a special
place--an Old West relic painstakingly preserved in its original
state--and because it lures tourists through Lee Vining, giving
hometown businesses a boost.</TE>
<TE>   After diligently researching Bodie's history, gathering facts to
support their plea, the students shipped their bill off to
Sacramento. Then the fun began--a trip to the Capitol, a meeting with
Leslie, even the chance to testify before an Assembly committee.
Politicians gave them the VIP treatment and, best of all, AB 1757
looked to be whizzing through the Legislature with nary a no vote.</TE>
<TE>   Then this happy tale of a civics lesson brought to life took an
unexpected turn: Opposition surfaced. Votes vanished. The bill that
looked like a sure thing suddenly appeared doomed.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble arose after merchants in Calico, a commercialized
ghost town near Barstow, raised a stink: Why Bodie? It's not fair.
We're special too!</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Calico backers had the attention of Southern California
legislators, especially Sen. Gloria Romero (D-Los Angeles), who grew
up in Barstow and recalled visiting Calico as a child.</TE>
<TE>   When the bill came up in the Senate for a fateful test in June,
Romero voted no, and most of her fellow Democrats did the same or
abstained.</TE>
<TE>   Down went the Bodie bill. Or so everyone thought.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There's a saying around Sacramento: Never fall in love with your
bills, because if you do, you'll wind up doing goofy things to get a
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, a veteran lawmaker, lives by that mantra. But the Bodie
measure, he said, "put me in a competitive mode." After all the kids'
hard work, he said, "I did not want to lose this bill."</TE>
<TE>   There's another saying around Sacramento: No bill is ever really
dead. And despite its initial fate in the Senate, AB 1757 came back
to life.</TE>
<TE>   Resurrection was made possible by state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina
del Rey), who felt bad that "the kids had a great idea and then
walked right into other people's pride."</TE>
<TE>   Bowen, who visited Bodie over the summer, offered a compromise.
Why not, she wondered, tweak the bill's language and make Bodie
California's official Gold Rush ghost town? Then next year, Romero
could carry legislation making Calico the state's official Silver
Rush ghost town.</TE>
<TE>   Romero said the deal suited her fine, but Leslie balked. He views
Bodie as the state's "real deal" ghost town, and said Calico is a
distant second, offering the "shooting gallery and snow cone ghost
town experience." It pained him to dilute Bodie's designation, even
slightly.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, however, Leslie read the tea leaves and signed on. And
thus the Great Ghost Town Compromise of 2002 was approved by the
Senate, and later by the Assembly, on unanimous votes.</TE>
<TE>   Last Thursday, Gov. Gray Davis sealed the deal, signing the
measure into law. News of the action reached Lee Vining Junior High
by lunch hour, delighting the creators of AB 1757.</TE>
<TE>   Their teacher, Janine Barbato, said the controversy may, in fact,
have enhanced the kids' learning experience. Politics, she noted, is
the art of compromise: "It's not bad for them to see that you don't
always get what you want and that working things out with other
people is part of life."</TE>
<TE>   For Leslie, the fate of AB 1757 brought a sense of deja vu. Years
ago, as a freshman legislator, he carried a bill to make "I Love You
California" the official state song. A furor ensued, with lawmakers
and other Golden Staters offering up their favorite songs.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember Ross Johnson brought a boombox into the committee
hearing and played 'California Girls' by the Beach Boys," Leslie
recalled. "That was his pick."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Leslie had to agree to an amendment remarkably similar
to the ghost town compromise. Instead of a designation naming the
tune the official state song, the statute calls "I Love You
California" an official state song.</TE>
<TE>   That's politics.</TE>

<DH>Santa Clarita: Cleanup of former weapons site remains
explosive issue as suburbs creep closer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The owners of 1,000 undeveloped acres in the heart of fast-growing
Santa Clarita once dreamed of blanketing the land with middle-class
houses.</LD>
<LD>   But after three years of clashing with city officials about how
best to clean up the area, the developer, Santa Clarita LLC, is ready
to unload it.</LD>
<LD>   The site, like hundreds of others around the country, was once
used to manufacture and test military-grade weapons. It is littered
with contaminants, and there is a slight chance that those may
include live shells and projectiles, state environmental officials
say.</LD>
<TE>   "People who have lived around here a long time can remember seeing
the explosions there," said Jeffrey Lambert, Santa Clarita's planning
director. "There's a real fear of what could be on that property."</TE>
<TE>   As suburbs like Santa Clarita continue to encroach upon land
previously used as munitions factories and military bases, officials
say, more homeowners are likely to confront the possibility that
weapons of war may be buried in their backyards.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as part of a $5.5-million pilot
program, this month is testing new cleanup methods in Santa Clarita
that it hopes to use at the estimated 2,000 former U.S. military
sites nationwide that may contain unexploded ammunition.</TE>
<TE>   In Arlington, Texas, residents of a partly built subdivision have
found numerous World War II-era practice bombs in their yards since
August 2000. More than 100 residents are suing the developer, KB
Home, saying they were not notified that the tract is on a former
test site.</TE>
<TE>   At Massachusetts Military Reservation on Cape Cod, residents
received a scare in 2000 when nearly 1,000 pieces of buried ordnance
were unearthed. Although inert, the material was 2,100 feet from an
elementary school that had been built to accommodate a growing
student population in the booming town of Sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   Near Denver, plans for a 7,000-unit housing development on the
former site of an Air Force bombing range are stalled as military
officials struggle to clean up waste, possibly including unexploded
munitions.</TE>
<TE>   And this summer near Sacramento, the Corps of Engineers announced
it must spend $200 million to clean up an unknown amount of ordnance
on land that was once part of the Army's Camp Beale, a rural area
that is seeing an increase in suburban development.</TE>
<TE>   "When the military used these remote places for testing, nobody
thought people would ever be living there," said Lenny Siegel,
director of the Center for Public Environmental Oversight, a
nonprofit group that specializes in base-closure issues. "People are
just discovering the scope of the cleanup."</TE>
<TE>   Deaths from stray military ordnance are rare but not unknown. In
1984, an artillery round killed two boys playing in a San Diego
subdivision that had been a World War II firing range.</TE>
<TE>   Even if undisturbed, munitions can leak toxic chemicals,
contaminating ground water and, in some cases, making even the dirt
around them explosive.</TE>
<TE>   They also can ensnare communities in costly and complicated legal
battles. Santa Clarita has already spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars in legal fees for its contaminated site, and fallout from its
disagreement with the developer has complicated the city's efforts to
build new roads, approve a major auto mall and take control of a
clean portion of the site where a Metrolink station is located. City
officials are trying to wrest control of the land from the developer,
using the power of eminent domain.</TE>
<TE>   The city also believes a toxic byproduct of rocket fuel--ammonium
perchlorate--is seeping from the land into the local aquifer. Though
the developers say there is no proof that their site is responsible,
four nearby water wells have been found to be contaminated and are
closed. The Castaic Lake Water Agency, the local water purveyor, has
sued the developer over the contamination.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Congress allocated $70 million for the Army Corps'
cleanup efforts, the most money ever, said the agency's Robert
Lubbert. But Lubbert said it would take $14 billion to clean up all
the sites in the nation. Other Defense Department estimates have put
the total cost at $100 billion, according to a 2001 report from the
General Accounting Office. Either way, Lubbert said, "It's just not
happening fast enough....But hopefully we're funding [cleanup of] the
most dangerous stuff first."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Defense Department is responsible for cleaning up
former military bases, it is typically not responsible for sites that
were privately owned by independent defense contractors.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Clarita property is believed to be one of the largest
examples of a contaminated, contractor-owned parcel, Lambert said.
From 1934 to 1967, the vast, hilly land was home to a number of
companies that made everything from dynamite to fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   From 1967 to 1987, the Whittaker Corp. built and tested weapons
there for the military, including armor-piercing 30-millimeter rounds
containing depleted uranium, according to Ken Baez of the state
Department of Toxic Substances Control.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Santa Clarita LLC bought the land in 1999 and promised
to rid it of contamination. But the city has resisted the company's
idea of cleaning in phases and putting buildings on parcels as they
are deemed safe.</TE>
<TE>   The Army Corps' pilot cleanup is focusing on one small landfill
containing about 2,800 cubic yards of junk. As it is removed,
researchers will use a number of techniques to determine if it is
explosive--from bomb-sniffing dogs to a chemical spray that changes
colors in the presence of dangerous substances, Baez said.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Stephenson, an Army Corps project manager, said the goal is
to find the best methods for identifying explosive material in the
field. That could eliminate the expensive step of sending extracted
material to a lab for analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaning up the entire site will cost $35 million to $40 million,
said Gary Brown, a spokesman for Remediation Financial Inc., the
managing partner for the development company.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita Mayor Frank Ferry said cleaning up the ground water
will prove to be much more difficult than proving that there is no
ordnance. "The big issue is really perchlorate," he said. The
ordnance issue "is just a boogie monster."</TE>
<TE>   Brown, like Ferry, said it is possible to clean the land so that
it is safe to build on--his company is looking to sell the property
only because it cannot afford to clean the property all at once.</TE>
<TE>   He said he is also convinced that the site contains no unexploded
ordnance. He said all of the firing range tests were conducted under
strict supervision, with all of the shells shot into a specially
constructed building.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew exactly where each one was going to go," he said. "It
was nothing like what you would see at a military training range,
with stuff flying all over the place."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Santa Clarita Councilman Cameron Smyth said city officials
cannot take any chances.</TE>
<TE>   "If I wouldn't feel comfortable living there," he said, "how could
I approve a project that other families will be living on?"</TE>

<HD>Southland Expresses Its Solidarity</HD>
<DH>Remembrance: In ceremonies and simple gestures, residents

<LD>In saffron robes of peace and don't-tread-on-me tank tops, revving
their Harleys and getting towed in red wagons, hundreds of people
spilled into a public square in Covina. They were directed toward
stacks of children's drawings commemorating Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   "Dear people," began the note atop the first stack, from an
8-year-old named Lane. Above the words, in crayon, a jet burrowed
into the twin towers. Everyone was crying. A woman in a purple dress
running from the flames. A stick figure, jumping from the top floors.
Even the sun, which dropped fat, blue tears on the destruction below.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really sorry that some part of your family died," the note
continued. "What happened?"</LD>
<TE>   That remained a real question Wednesday. Three thousand miles and
a year removed from the attacks, even among those who profess to have
recovered, people across Southern California found themselves drawn
to the commemorations, to the prayers of reconciliation, to the
company of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   One man expressed it crossing a Hollywood Freeway overpass,
carrying a large American flag and flashing a peace sign. June Paxson
of Costa Mesa said she was watching the commemorations at home when
she realized she did not want to be alone and drove to a tribute at
the Orange County Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Myles, an American Airlines flight attendant from North
Hills, found her solace in her uniform--wearing it proudly to the
services at Los Angeles' new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be many years before we forget this," Myles said.
"Oh sure, 50 or 100 years down the line it will be another shopping
day like Memorial Day, Veterans Day. But in my lifetime, anyway, it
will be a day of solemnity, which is maybe what we need."</TE>
<TE>   They came to these ceremonies to remember the dead, and to fret
over an uncertain future and the new American vulnerability. They
came, at many services, with the cloud of potential new wars hanging
over their heads, genuinely torn between the allure of peace and the
thirst for vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   They came, too, to reach out to those more directly affected by
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks were a national tragedy, of course, and their
consequences--new airport security, potential new attacks--have been
felt everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   But, so far removed from the pillars of American power and finance
that were targeted that morning, the sentiment here--we're sad
too--has always been burdened with a certain inadequacy, a palpable
sense of separation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way around it: You had to be there," said Rick
Proctor, 53, a Brooklyn, N.Y., native, now a La Verne resident and
one of hundreds who attended the Covina tribute to police officers
and firefighters. "But what we can do is show some support and show
that life has to go on."</TE>
<TE>   In small, spontaneous moments and in large formal ceremonies, the
nation's other megalopolis went to great lengths Wednesday to express
solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   It was telling that many civic leaders rose at 4 a.m.
Wednesday--that way, they could beat the time difference and begin
their events at 5:46 a.m., precisely a year after the first plane
hurtled into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   In Echo Park, the Episcopal Cathedral Center of St. Paul's bells
tolled before dawn. Like many others across the region, one
worshiper, Darien Lolk, arrived in a white T-shirt emblazoned with
the initials and insignia of the New York Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important for me to be up at this hour to kind of coincide
with the East Coast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deepna Nandiga, one of the UCLA students attending an interfaith
ceremony at the university's student union, was en route to New York
on Sept. 11 for a family vacation. The junior majoring in psychology
made it as far as Washington, D.C., when the nation's air fleet was
grounded for the first time. Relieved to finally make it home, she
also found herself missing something she had felt on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I wasn't a part of it anymore," Nandiga said. "Here,
this is all about patriotism, and fear. In New York there was a sense
of community that people out here never experienced. I wish I still
had that."</TE>
<TE>   Strong feelings for police and firefighters--those who rushed in
while others rushed out--helped cement the bond between East and
West. As a solemn ceremony began on the south lawn of City Hall,
Mayor James K. Hahn had to pause briefly while a fire engine raced
by, its sirens ricocheting through downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There go our heroes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said 20-year-old Enrique Chavez of Garden Grove: "I would give my
life for them if I could." He was one of more than 350 people who
gathered at a memorial in Santa Ana on Wednesday to pay tribute to
New York City firefighters and other victims of the terrorist
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds marched from ceremonies at Los Angeles City Hall to the
new downtown cathedral, where 3,000 people packed the pews for a
dramatic interfaith service. Thousands of others amassed on the
streets outside.</TE>
<TE>   After a predawn service at the Islamic Center of Southern
California in Los Angeles, Omar Ricci, 33, of Glendale said he has
been unable to shake the image of a man clinging to a corner of the
World Trade Center, desperately trying to escape billowing clouds of
fire and smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed for that man's soul," said Ricci, chairman of the Muslim
Public Affairs Council and a software firm owner. "This is not a day
to think about Christians, Jews or Muslims. It's a day to talk about
being American."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Southern California, at airports, bridges, theme parks
and other hot spots, officials increased security and intensified
screening of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, between the increase in
security and the decrease in travelers--the passenger load was down
about 16% from an average September weekday--terminals and sidewalks
were noticeably empty. LAPD officers outnumbered travelers. The
heightened security presence was a gloomy reminder that the specter
of a coming war looms on the horizon. Many urged restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "We seek an Earth restored," said the Rev. Leonard B. Jackson of
the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. "We seek a world free
of war."</TE>
<TE>   In Covina, one man joked casually about dropping a bomb on the
detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba--most of whom have not been charged
with a crime--even as others, at an interfaith ceremony at UCLA,
bemoaned what they say is a profound loss of civil liberties in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   They spoke about the possibility of a preemptive military strike
in Iraq, pleading with the nation's leaders to proceed with wisdom,
even while lamenting a sudden, bewildering loss of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   At San Diego military bases, home to more U.S. military personnel
killed in the Afghanistan war zone than any other region, Rear Adm.
Matthew Moffit struck a stern tone.</TE>
<TE>   "The hate that defined that day still exists, and it is our job to
keep it from inflicting death and destruction on our countrymen
again," he told sailors on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier
John C. Stennis. "There is work yet to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ryan Case, 20, a third-class petty officer from east Texas:
"We've got to get Saddam Hussein--this time for good."</TE>
<TE>   It was a day, too, to teach--even when the memories haunting
children seemed to put them on a par with adults.</TE>
<TE>   At Berendo Middle School in Koreatown, eighth-grade social studies
students listed words that described how they felt Wednesday:
nervous, proud, worried, secure, confused. At 9:45 a.m., the school
observed a moment of silence to remember the victims. Elisa Ojeda,
12, bowed her head, closed her eyes and clasped her hands tightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about people who don't have their families anymore and
how they're feeling," she said. "I wonder if their families cried a
lot."</TE>

<LD>   "Dear people," began the note atop the first stack, from an
8-year-old named Lane. Above the words, in crayon, a jet burrowed
into the twin towers. Everyone was crying. A woman in a purple dress
running from the flames. A stick figure, jumping from the top floors.
Even the sun, which dropped fat, blue tears on the destruction below.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm really sorry that some part of your family died," the note
continued. "What happened?"</LD>
<TE>   That remained a real question Wednesday. Three thousand miles and
a year removed from the attacks, even among those who profess to have
recovered, people across Southern California found themselves drawn
to the commemorations, to the prayers of reconciliation, to the
company of strangers.</TE>
<TE>   One man expressed it crossing a Hollywood Freeway overpass,
carrying a large American flag and flashing a peace sign. June Paxson
of Costa Mesa said she was watching the commemorations at home when
she realized she did not want to be alone and drove to a tribute at
the Orange County Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Gloria Myles, an American Airlines flight attendant from North
Hills, found her solace in her uniform--wearing it proudly to the
services at Los Angeles' new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it will be many years before we forget this," Myles said.
"Oh sure, 50 or 100 years down the line it will be another shopping
day like Memorial Day, Veterans Day. But in my lifetime, anyway, it
will be a day of solemnity which is maybe what we need."</TE>
<TE>   They came to these ceremonies to remember the dead, and to fret
over an uncertain future and the new American vulnerability. They
came, at many services, with the cloud of potential new wars hanging
over their heads, genuinely torn between the allure of peace and the
thirst for vengeance.</TE>
<TE>   They came, too, to reach out to those more directly affected by
the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks were a national tragedy, of course, and their
consequences--new airport security, potential new attacks--have been
felt everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   But, so far removed from the pillars of American power and finance
that were targeted that morning, the sentiment here--we're sad
too--has always been burdened with a certain inadequacy, a palpable
sense of separation.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way around it: You had to be there," said Rick
Proctor, 53, a Brooklyn, N.Y., native, now a La Verne resident and
one of hundreds who attended the Covina tribute to police officers
and firefighters. "But what we can do is show some support and show
that life has to go on."</TE>
<TE>   Expressing Solidarity</TE>
<TE>   In small, spontaneous moments and in large formal ceremonies, the
nation's other megalopolis went to great lengths Wednesday to express
solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   It was telling that many civic leaders rose at 4 a.m.
Wednesday--that way, they could beat the time change and begin their
events at 5:46 a.m., precisely a year after the first plane hurtled
into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   In Echo Park, the Episcopal Cathedral Center of St. Paul's bells
tolled before dawn. Like many others across the region, one
worshiper, Darien Lolk, arrived in a white T-shirt emblazoned with
the initials and insignia of the New York Fire Department.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important for me to be up at this hour to kind of coincide
with the East Coast," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Deepna Nandiga, one of the UCLA students attending an interfaith
ceremony at the university's student union, was en route to New York
on Sept. 11 for a family vacation. The junior majoring in psychology
made it as far as Washington, D.C., when the nation's air fleet was
grounded for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Relieved to finally make it home, she also found herself missing
something she had felt on the East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I wasn't a part of it anymore," Nandiga said. "Here,
this is all about patriotism, and fear. In New York there was a sense
of community that people out here never experienced. I wish I still
had that."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds Cemented</TE>
<TE>   Strong feelings for police and firefighters--those who rushed in
while others rushed out--helped cement the bond between East and
West.</TE>
<TE>   As a solemn ceremony began on the south lawn of City Hall, Mayor
James K. Hahn had to pause briefly while a fire engine raced by, its
sirens ricocheting through downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There go our heroes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said 20-year-old Enrique Chavez of Garden Grove: "I would give my
life for them if I could."</TE>
<TE>   He was one of more than 350 people who gathered at a memorial in
Santa Ana on Wednesday to pay tribute to New York City firefighters
and other victims of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds marched from ceremonies at Los Angeles City Hall to the
new downtown cathedral, where 3,000 people packed the recently
shellacked pews for a dramatic interfaith service. Thousands of
others amassed on the streets outside.</TE>
<TE>   Following a predawn service at the Islamic Center of Southern
California in Los Angeles, Omar Ricci, 33, of Glendale said he has
been unable to shake the image of a man clinging to a corner of the
World Trade Center, desperately trying to escape billowing clouds of
fire and smoke.</TE>
<TE>   "I prayed for that man's soul," said Ricci, chairman of the Muslim
Public Affairs Council and a software firm owner. "This is not a day
to think about Christians, Jews or Muslims. It's a day to talk about
being American."</TE>
<TE>   Increased Security</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Southern California, at airports, bridges, theme parks
and other hot spots, officials increased security and intensified
screening of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport, between the increase in
security and the decrease in travelers--the passenger load was down
about 16% from an average September weekday--terminals and sidewalks
were noticeably empty. LAPD officers outnumbered travelers.</TE>
<TE>   The heightened security presence was a gloomy reminder that the
specter of a coming war looms on the horizon. Many urged restraint.</TE>
<TE>   "We seek an earth restored," said the Rev. Leonard B. Jackson of
the First African Methodist Episcopal Church. "We seek a world free
of war."</TE>
<TE>   In Covina, one man joked casually about dropping a bomb on the
detainees at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba--most of whom have not been charged
with a crime--even as others, at an interfaith ceremony at UCLA,
bemoaned what they say is a profound loss of civil liberties in the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   Specter of War</TE>
<TE>   They spoke about the possibility of a preemptive military strike
in Iraq, pleading with the nation's leaders to proceed with wisdom,
even while lamenting a sudden, bewildering loss of innocence.</TE>
<TE>   At San Diego military bases, home to more U.S. military personnel
killed in the Afghanistan war zone than any other region, Rear Adm.
Matthew Moffit struck a stern tone.</TE>
<TE>   "The hate that defined that day still exists, and it is our job to
keep it from inflicting death and destruction on our countrymen
again," he told sailors on the flight deck of the U.S. aircraft
carrier John C. Stennis. "There is work yet to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Said Case Ryan, 20, a third-class petty officer from east Texas:
"We've got to get Saddam Hussein--this time for good."</TE>
<TE>   At the Episcopal Cathedral Center of St. Paul in Echo Park, the
Rt. Rev. J. Jon Bruno, Episcopal bishop of Los Angeles, called for
reconciliation.</TE>
<TE>   A former police officer who once shot and killed a suspect after
he and his partner were fired on, Bruno said part of him still wants
retribution for the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's an old Italian part of me where this hand wants to punch
them in the mouth," he said. "I hope this hand will become useless. I
will tie it behind my back. I will not reach out in anger, because I
know what it is to take part in killing. I've done it. I would rather
reach out, extend my hand in blessing to other human beings."</TE>
<TE>   It was a day, too, to teach--even when the memories haunting
children seemed to put them on par with adults.</TE>
<TE>   At Berendo Middle School in Koreatown, eighth-grade social studies
students listed words that described how they felt Wednesday:
nervous, proud, worried, secure, confused.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:45 a.m., the school observed a moment of silence to remember
the victims. Elisa Ojeda, 12, bowed her head, closed her eyes and
clasped her hands tightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought about people who don't have their families anymore and
how they're feeling," she said. "I wonder if their families cried a
lot."</TE>

<LD>In saffron robes of peace and don't-tread-on-me tank tops, revving
their Harleys and getting towed in red wagons, hundreds of people

<DH>Study: Report suggests L.A. areas with more community
groups get better results from city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES RICCI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When John Given walks onto the backyard deck of his spacious
Brentwood home, his eye is drawn not to the vista of Sullivan Canyon
galloping away beneath him, but to the brushy excess of chaparral
bristling down to his property line from the hill to his right.</LD>
<LD>   The hills of Brentwood, a place of million-dollar-plus houses, are
among the sites with the highest wildfire risk in Los Angeles.
Given's house is the last on his street, the closest to the thirsty,
combustible slopes of the Santa Monica Mountains. Although he is
meticulous about keeping brush cleared a safe distance from his home,
such is not the case with his neighbor.</LD>
<LD>   That is the city of Los Angeles, which owns the adjacent property
and is responsible for its upkeep.</LD>
<TE>   "Were a terrible brush fire to happen, they would not be in
compliance with the fire code," he says. "For me it means paying
$1,200 a year extra in fire insurance because my neighbor, the city,
doesn't take care of their brush."</TE>
<TE>   Even in Brentwood, people such as Given have their beefs with the
city. In that, they are much like people in the San Fernando Valley,
whose discontent with city services has long fueled the fires of
secession.</TE>
<TE>   The difference is that Given and his neighbors, brush clearance
issues notwithstanding, have been quite successful in getting the
city to act on their concerns.</TE>
<TE>   When the city announced that it would install five car-slowing
speed tables on Mandeville Canyon Road, residents protested that the
tables would also slow emergency vehicles trying to get to the upper
reaches of the canyon. After detailed study and negotiation, they
persuaded the city to install only two speed tables. When some
residents learned that their homes were beyond the five-minute
response zone of the Fire Department, they managed to obtain a
meeting with L.A. Fire Chief William Bamattre himself.</TE>
<TE>   Given, who composes music for animated films, is an officer of the
Brentwood Hills Homeowners Assn. He credits local residents' success
with the city not to being "a bunch of spoiled rich people," but to
being highly organized.</TE>
<TE>   Which is what many Valley neighborhoods apparently are not,
according to a new study by USC's Neighborhood Participation Project.</TE>
<TE>   The study suggests that the mostly middle-class Valley has fewer
homeowners associations and community-based organizations than other
major areas of the city, not just richer areas such as Brentwood, but
poorer areas such as East L.A. and South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   Professor Juliet Musso, who led the study, said this disparity may
explain why, of the 39 neighborhood councils that have been certified
by the city under its charter-mandated neighborhood empowerment
program, only seven, or 18%, are in the Valley, which accounts for
about 36% of L.A.'s population.</TE>
<TE>   Musso contends that this lag has less to do with secessionist
skepticism about the effectiveness of the councils, which are
advisory, than with the fact that the Valley "historically has not
had a high concentration of community-based organizations."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, many Valley residents want to participate in the councils
program. Of the 24 applications for certification currently pending,
15 are from Valley neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to why so few Valley councils made it into the first
wave of certification, Musso says, may lie in the area's relative
lack of "social capital" in the form of pre-existing community
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "To do a viable neighborhood council proposal, it's a lot of hard
work," she says. "It's harder to organize in an area where you don't
have a lot of associations already bringing people together."</TE>
<TE>   The USC researchers caution that their study is more suggestive
than definitive. They sent questionnaires to 1,900 neighborhood
organizations in Los Angeles, and 555 responded.</TE>
<TE>   ZIP Code populations, moreover, vary greatly, and the Valley's
relatively low population density may account for some of the
discrepancy between it and other quarters of the city (the
researchers hope to conduct a more definitive study based on census
tracts).</TE>
<TE>   Musso, however, also sees another factor at work: namely, the
Valley's relatively tranquil history--at least in comparison to some
of the city's more embattled communities.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers were surprised to find that the amount of
organizational activity in a neighborhood depends less on residents'
socioeconomic status than on a history of having to confront
troublesome phenomena in their neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal neighborhoods have rallied against environmental threats,
hillside areas against over-development (the Brentwood Hills
Homeowners Assn. fought for a dozen years against a proposal for 34
mansions on the slopes near Given's home, and eventually won).</TE>
<TE>   East L.A. and South-Central neighborhoods have mobilized against
poverty, racism, crime and police abuse; some organizations there
date to the War on Poverty, begun four decades ago .</TE>
<TE>   "For example, Pacific Palisades ... has a long history of
organizing around issues of land use and environmental protection,
which may have contributed to development of particularly strong and
active homeowners associations," the USC study states.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, "there are relatively high levels of organizational
activity found ... in Central and South-Central Los Angeles.... It
would appear that historical patterns of political organization and
community-based service organizations in these communities may
provide a legacy of political engagement."</TE>
<TE>   The pattern seems to obtain even within the Valley, where strong
neighborhood organizations tend to exist in the
over-development-vigilant hillside neighborhoods (for example, the
influential Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., long presided over by
Richard Close, an active supporter of secession) and where residents
have faced environmental threats (for example, the Granada Hills
area, where the North Valley Coalition battled expansion of the
nearby Sunshine Canyon Landfill).</TE>
<TE>   A particular Valley case in point, Musso says, is Pacoima. The
study found that in the ZIP Code that includes the low-income area,
seven community organizations were active, with four more operating
on the community's outskirts. The total is nearly 2 1/2 times the
Valley's overall average of 4.5 such organizations per ZIP Code (the
average for Los Angeles as a whole was 6.2).</TE>
<TE>   From his vantage point on the other side of the Santa Monicas,
Given can't understand why Valley residents would contemplate the
so-called "alimony" payments they will have to make to the rest of
Los Angeles if secession occurs, to help finance "my Fire Department,
my Police Department, my Department of Public Works."</TE>
<TE>   Secession is especially ill-advised, he says, if it's driven by
dissatisfaction with City Hall's responsiveness on the part of
unorganized citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Disaffected Valley residents, he says, "want something
legitimate--but they already have it. They can vote. They can
organize. They can have as much access to the city government as we
do. We have access because we ask for access. One person up against
the city is very difficult. That's why neighborhood organizations
exist, so that we can collectively say, 'This is our concern. This is
our problem.'</TE>
<TE>   "People have a right to self-determination," he adds. "That's one
of the things that make our country great. On the other hand, if
they're not fully taking advantage of all the access that they do
have--voting, participating in neighborhood organizations like
ours--well, will they participate any more in a new city?"</TE>

<LD>   Blakey, President Bush's choice to lead the agency, will succeed
Jane Garvey, whose five-year term expired in August.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier this month, she told a Senate panel considering her
appointment that she would be responsive to inquiries. She also
promised to begin aggressively hiring and training air traffic

<LD>Army medals and commendations that belonged to Oklahoma City bomber
Timothy J. McVeigh will be given to his family, his lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch, who presided over the 1997
trial in Denver that found McVeigh guilty of bombing the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building, said exhibits introduced by McVeigh's
lawyers will be given to attorney Rob Nigh Jr. of Tulsa, Okla. Nigh
said the order clears the way for him to give McVeigh's personal
items to his family.</LD>
<LD>   Nigh represented McVeigh for about five years until he was
executed June 11, 2001, for the bombing that killed 168 people.</LD>
<TE>   McVeigh's medals were introduced by his lawyers at the penalty
phase of his trial to show he had been an outstanding soldier during
the Persian Gulf War and should not be sentenced to death.</TE>
<TE>   Large pieces of the Ryder rental truck used to carry the
explosives and a .45-caliber pistol seized from McVeigh soon after
the blast are among the hundreds of exhibits that prosecutors will
receive.</TE>

<LD>Tropical storm Gustav was upgraded to a hurricane, the first of the
Atlantic season, as it headed toward the Canadian Maritimes, the
National Hurricane Center in Miami said.</LD>
<LD>   Gustav, which dumped as much as 6 inches of rain on North
Carolina's Outer Banks, had strengthened, with maximum sustained
winds as great as 90 mph, the hurricane center said. The minimum for
a hurricane is 74 mph.</LD>
<LD>   The Canadian government issued heavy rain and wind warnings for
all of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and parts of
Newfoundland and New Brunswick.</LD>
<TE>   Gustav was forecast to weaken today as it moves away from tropical
weather, the center said.</TE>

<DH>Memorials at crash sites mark losses as Bush seeks nation's
support in war on terrorism</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOYLE McMANUS and EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>President Bush made a solemn pilgrimage Wednesday to the three sites
where hijacked planes crashed last Sept. 11 and called on Americans
to support a long and possibly wider war against "terrorists and
dictators [who] plot against our lives and our liberty."</LD>
<LD>   "What happened to our nation on a September day set in motion the
first great struggle of a new century," Bush said at a ceremony at
the Pentagon on Wednesday morning. "The enemies who struck us are
determined and they are resourceful. They will not be stopped by a
sense of decency or a hint of conscience--but they will be stopped."</LD>
<LD>   Later, in an evening speech to the nation from New York Harbor,
with the floodlit Statue of Liberty behind him, the president noted:
"Our generation has now heard history's call, and we will answer it."</LD>
<TE>   "We will not allow any terrorist or tyrant to threaten
civilization with weapons of mass murder," he said, in an implicit
reference to Iraq's Saddam Hussein, whom Bush has accused of seeking
nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "Now and in the future, Americans will live as free people, not in
fear, and never at the mercy of any foreign plot or power," Bush
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no intention of ignoring or appeasing history's latest
gang of fanatics trying to murder their way to power," the president
added.</TE>
<TE>   "They are discovering, as others before them, the resolve of a
great democracy. In the ruins of two towers, under a flag unfurled at
the Pentagon, at the funerals of the lost, we have made a sacred
promise to ourselves and the world: We will not relent until justice
is done and our nation is secure. What our enemies have begun, we
will finish."</TE>
<TE>   In his two speeches, Bush did not mention Iraq by name; aides said
he will talk directly about Hussein in a speech to the U.N.'s General
Assembly at 10:30 a.m. today.</TE>
<TE>   But his stark and martial language--which aides said reflected a
passion he also expresses in private--made it clear that Bush
believes that Hussein ranks alongside Al Qaeda as a major threat to
the United States, and that the struggle against terrorism is far
from over.</TE>
<TE>   The president made time for mourning, too, and for praise of the
heroes who raced into the burning World Trade Center and Pentagon to
save others after terrorists crashed hijacked planes into the
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   But amid tears and commemoration, Bush consistently pressed his
central theme: that the outrage of Sept. 11 must not be
forgotten--and should now be turned into a lasting resolve to defeat
America's adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Though they died in tragedy, they did not die in vain," Bush said
of the 184 victims at the Pentagon. "Their loss has moved a nation to
action, in a cause to defend other innocent lives across the world.
This war is waged on many fronts. We've captured more than 2,000
terrorists; a larger number of killers have met their end in
combat.... Yet there's a great deal left to do."</TE>
<TE>   Aides say the president and his advisors are worried by signs that
Americans, yearning for a return to normal life, are losing some of
their zeal for a long-lasting, multi-front war like the one Bush
described. Polls show that large majorities support military
intervention against Iraq, for example, but increasing numbers also
express concern over the possible costs of such a war.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for people ... to keep their eye on the ball," one
Bush aide said.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the more explicit diplomatic campaign getting underway
today, the White House plans to release a 22-page report charging the
Iraqi president with multiple violations of U.N. resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   In today's speech, Bush will argue that the U.N. must act soon to
enforce its existing resolutions that call on Hussein to disarm--and
that any such effort "will require a credible threat of military
force," one aide said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to ask the question: 'What more does the world need to
know about this regime to know that it poses a real threat to peace
and stability in the world?' " another official said. "[He] will
remind U.N. members that the United Nations acted forcefully in 1991,
has been ignored, and that that is a problem for the United Nations."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has not decided what specific course of action to take
against Iraq, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "But what he does believe, and I think a growing number of leaders
are echoing that, is that we can't wait any longer to take some kind
of action against Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Wednesday's commemorations required the president to
walk a fine line: to lead the nation in rites of mourning at a moment
when he hopes, without apology, to turn from sorrow to resolve.</TE>
<TE>   Aides said that as they prepared for this day, Bush's
speechwriters consulted the Gettysburg Address, which President
Lincoln gave at a commemoration of Union dead during the
then-unfinished Civil War.</TE>
<TE>   But Lincoln spoke at a time when the Union was winning the war and
public support was growing, not waning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not Gettysburg," said Fred Greenstein, a scholar of the
presidency at Princeton University.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be more like Franklin D. Roosevelt's hundred days, in the
great national disaster of the Depression, when he needed to rally
the nation," Greenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks last year, Bush succeeded in rallying
the nation and saw his stature rise rapidly, but much of that
momentum seems to have been lost in recent months, Greenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush presidency is now in its third stage--after a lackluster
start and the tailwinds that followed Sept. 11," he said. "It's a
complex, choppy stage with a disheveled foreign policy process....
But it seems to be coming to a head, and we may now be on the cusp of
a fourth stage, if all the pieces come together into a clearer
policy."</TE>
<TE>   Bush began a marathon day of ceremonies by attending a private 8
a.m. service at St. John's Episcopal Church, just across Lafayette
Park from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   The program had called for Vice President Dick Cheney and his
wife, Lynne, to join the Bushes in a candle-lighting ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Cheneys were absent, closeted at a "secure,
undisclosed location" after the federal government declared a state
of high danger of terrorist attacks--an "orange alert."</TE>
<TE>   After the church service, the president and his wife, Laura, stood
on the edge of the South Lawn of the White House, along with hundreds
of administration officials and staffers, in a moment of silence at
8:46 a.m., the time that the first hijacked jetliner slammed into the
World Trade Center a year before.</TE>
<TE>   Then they drove across the Potomac to the Pentagon for the
dedication of the building's damaged wing, largely rebuilt in less
than a year.</TE>
<TE>   From the Pentagon, the Bushes flew to western Pennsylvania and
laid a wreath on a field near the village of Shanksville, where
United Flight 93 crashed after passengers attempted to wrest control
of the plane from hijackers. The president did not speak publicly,
but talked privately with crash victims' family members who had
gathered at the site.</TE>
<TE>   In midafternoon, the Bushes flew to New York, where they walked
hand-in-hand down a long concrete construction ramp onto the floor of
ground zero in Lower Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   There the president laid another wreath and a plaque reading:
"Every life taken here, every act of valor performed, the nation
holds in honored memory."</TE>
<TE>   Again, Bush made no public remarks.</TE>
<TE>   But he lingered for almost two hours with the surviving spouses,
children, parents and other loved ones of the 2,801
victims--initially shaking hands, then kissing and finally embracing
those who sought his embrace. Some came to the president in tears,
whispering in his ear, and he could be seen blinking rapidly against
what looked like incipient tears of his own.</TE>
<TE>   In his pocket, a spokesman said, Bush carried the Port Authority
Police Department badge that belonged to George Howard, an officer
who died after he joined rescue crews at the World Trade Center a
year ago even though it was his day off.</TE>
<TE>   Howard's mother gave the badge to Bush last September, when he
first met with relatives of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   Aides say the president has carried it ever since, as a tangible
reminder of the attack he has promised to redress.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Good evening.</LD>
<LD>   A long year has passed since enemies attacked our country. We have
seen the images so many times they are seared on our souls, and
remembering the horror, reliving the anguish, reimagining the terror,
is hard--and painful.</LD>
<LD>   For those who lost loved ones, it has been a year of sorrow, of
empty places, of newborn children who will never know their fathers
here on Earth. For members of our military, it has been a year of
sacrifice and service far from home. For all Americans, it has been a
year of adjustment--of coming to terms with the difficult knowledge
that our nation has determined enemies and that we are not
invulnerable to their attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Yet in the events that have challenged us, we have also seen the
character that will deliver us. We have seen the greatness of America
in airline passengers who defied their hijackers and ran a plane into
the ground to spare the lives of others. We have seen the greatness
of America in rescuers who rushed up flights of stairs toward peril.
And we continue to see the greatness of America in the care and
compassion our citizens show to each other.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11, 2001, will always be a fixed point in the life of
America. The loss of so many lives left us to examine our own. Each
of us was reminded that we are here only for a time, and these
counted days should be filled with things that last and matter: love
for our families, love for our neighbors and for our country,
gratitude for life and to the giver of life. We resolved a year ago
to honor every last person lost. We owe them remembrance, and we owe
them more. We owe them, and their children, and our own, the most
enduring monument we can build: a world of liberty and security made
possible by the way America leads and by the way Americans lead our
lives.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The attack on our nation was also an attack on the ideals that
make us a nation. Our deepest national conviction is that every life
is precious, because every life is the gift of a creator who intended
us to live in liberty and equality. More than anything else, this
separates us from the enemy we fight. We value every life; our
enemies value none--not even the innocent, not even their own. And we
seek the freedom and opportunity that give meaning and value to life.
There is a line in our time, and in every time, between those who
believe that all men are created equal and those who believe that
some men and women and children are expendable in the pursuit of
power. There is a line in our time, and in every time, between the
defenders of human liberty and those who seek to master the minds and
souls of others.</TE>
<TE>   Our generation has now heard history's call, and we will answer
it. America has entered a great struggle that tests our strength and
even more our resolve. Our nation is patient and steadfast. We
continue to pursue the terrorists in cities and camps and caves
across the Earth. We are joined by a great coalition of nations to
rid the world of terror.</TE>
<TE>   And we will not allow any terrorist or tyrant to threaten
civilization with weapons of mass murder. Now and in the future,
Americans will live as free people, not in fear, and never at the
mercy of any foreign plot or power.</TE>
<TE>   This nation has defeated tyrants and liberated death camps, raised
this lamp of liberty to every captive land. We have no intention of
ignoring or appeasing history's latest gang of fanatics trying to
murder their way to power. They are discovering, as others before
them, the resolve of a great country and a great democracy. In the
ruins of two towers, under a flag unfurled at the Pentagon, at the
funerals of the lost, we have made a sacred promise, to ourselves and
to the world: We will not relent until justice is done and our nation
is secure. What our enemies have begun, we will finish. I believe
there is a reason that history has matched this nation with this
time. America strives to be tolerant and just. We respect the faith
of Islam, even as we fight those whose actions defile that faith. We
fight, not to impose our will, but to defend ourselves and extend the
blessings of freedom.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We cannot know all that lies ahead. Yet we do know that God has
placed us together in this moment, to grieve together, to stand
together, to serve each other and our country. And the duty we have
been given--defending America and our freedom--is also a privilege we
share. We are prepared for this journey. And our prayer tonight is
that God will see us through, and keep us worthy.</TE>
<TE>   Tomorrow is September the 12th. A milestone is passed, and a
mission goes on. Be confident. Our country is strong. And our cause
is even larger than our country. Ours is the cause of human dignity:
freedom guided by conscience and guarded by peace. This ideal of
America is the hope of all mankind. That hope drew millions to this
harbor. That hope still lights our way. And the light shines in the
darkness. And the darkness will not overcome it.</TE>
<TE>   May God bless America.</TE>

<HD>Devastated Firm Grieves, Looks Ahead</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Family and friends of the 658 Cantor Fitzgerald employees who died in
the Sept. 11 attacks came together in Central Park on Wednesday in a
private memorial to remember those lost and to begin thinking about
the future.</LD>
<LD>   Under a huge tent, hundreds of people gathered to hear speeches
from family members, colleagues and survivors, as well as a
smattering of politicians, clergymen and celebrities.</LD>
<LD>   Howard Lutnick, the bond brokerage firm's CEO, whose brother, Gary
Lutnick, died in the attacks, reminded the guests that they would
stand together as they continue to move ahead.</LD>
<TE>   "Each of us has had our hearts torn apart," Lutnick told the
somber, tearful crowd. "But we can take those pieces and put them
back together. And together we will create something new."</TE>
<TE>   The company, which lost nearly two-thirds of its employees last
Sept. 11--representing almost a quarter of the total 2,801 dead and
missing at the World Trade Center--has already started the difficult
process of rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   Cantor Fitzgerald and its subsidiaries have temporarily relocated
to midtown Manhattan and hired 150 new employees.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) reminded the audience that
while the friends and family of Cantor Fitzgerald employees have
suffered immensely, they have also set an example of strength over
the past year.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you move forward when the grief is this large? How do you
endure the sadness?" asked Clinton. "You have helped answer those
questions.... "</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and clergymen representing
different faiths also spoke, while Carole King, Judy Collins and the
Harlem Boys Choir performed.</TE>
<TE>   But the most rousing moment came when Lauren Manning, a Cantor
Fitzgerald sales executive, addressed her colleagues. Manning spent
three months in a coma and sustained such severe burns that she was
given only a 10% chance of surviving.</TE>
<TE>   Standing before the crowd, Manning, who has become a symbol of
resilience, said that, rather than stand for a moment of silence, she
would like to clap until her arms ached, hoping that those who
perished would hear her.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd stood and cheered.</TE>

<HD>D.C. Mayor Winning Huge Share of Write-In Votes</HD>
<DH>Election: Incumbent has a substantial lead in the primary
as the counting continues. He was barred from the ballot because of
phony signatures on nominating petitions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Mayor Anthony A. Williams had a commanding lead Wednesday at the end
of the first day of counting write-in ballots in the city's
Democratic mayoral primary.</LD>
<LD>   In his bid for reelection, Williams had 17,299 votes; the Rev.
Willie Wilson had 1,958 votes.</LD>
<LD>   Poll workers were to return today to continue, with 32 of 141
precincts tallied from Tuesday's primary election.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to work on this day to day until we get it done,"
said Benjamin F. Wilson, chairman of the District of Columbia Board
of Elections and Ethics. Of the 89,618 votes cast, 91% were
write-ins.</TE>
<TE>   Williams was barred from the ballot by the election board because
of irregularities in his nominating petitions--they included
thousands of phony signatures.</TE>
<TE>   The names of British Prime Minister Tony Blair and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan were among the bogus signatures.</TE>
<TE>   Willie Wilson, a local minister, mounted his own write-in effort.</TE>
<TE>   Most voters in the district are Democrats, so the party's
nomination for mayor all but assures election in November.</TE>
<TE>   The four other candidates listed on the official Democratic
ballot--including a trumpet-blowing arts advocate named Faith--each
received just a handful of votes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted that the precincts counted so far were all in
districts known to favor Williams and that those expected to be
supportive of Wilson had yet to be tallied.</TE>
<TE>   Although Williams was always the favorite to win the party's
nomination, the campaign scandal complicated what had promised to be
an easy ride to a second four-year term.</TE>
<TE>   The petition flap was an embarrassment for Williams, an Ivy
League-educated technocrat who portrays himself as an efficient
manager. Wilson jumped into the race after the scandal broke, hoping
to tap into discontent among poorer black voters who say Williams has
ignored their needs and concerns.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual circumstances of the primary have drawn national
attention to the capital, which under Williams had only just begun to
shake off a decades-long reputation for zany politics, shoddy
services and disastrous fiscal management.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere around the nation, Republicans claimed Wednesday that
primary victories by John E. Sununu in New Hampshire and Elizabeth
Hanford Dole in North Carolina provided momentum to keep two crucial
Senate seats.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some good things and bad things that happened to either
party," Norman Ornstein, a political analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute, said of Tuesday's hectic primary night.</TE>
<TE>   One GOP expert said Sununu's win in the primary over Sen. Bob
Smith, a two-term incumbent, was a major relief for Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   "Republicans strengthen their hand immeasurably in retaining that
seat," GOP consultant Rich Bond said. "There's no doubt that John
Sununu is a much stronger candidate in the general election than Bob
Smith."</TE>
<TE>   Sununu, a three-term congressman, will face Gov. Jeanne Shaheen.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Democrats, Ornstein said, they will be ecstatic if
Tampa, Fla., lawyer Bill McBride's narrow lead over former U.S. Atty.
Gen. Janet Reno holds up in the Florida gubernatorial primary,
because he will provide a stiffer challenge to Republican Gov. Jeb
Bush.</TE>
<TE>   Among other races shaping up for November:</TE>
<TE>   * In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott McCallum won the GOP primary and will
face Democratic Atty. Gen. Jim Doyle in November. Former Gov. Tommy
G. Thompson's younger brother, Ed, faced no competition for the
Libertarian nomination.</TE>
<TE>   * In Arizona, Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano won a four-way
Democratic primary for the gubernatorial nomination. Her opponent
will be former Rep. Matt Salmon. Democrat Raul Grijalva and
Republican Ross Hieb won nominations in a new 7th Congressional
District.</TE>
<TE>   * In New York, two-term Gov. George Pataki had no GOP opponent but
lost the Independence Party nomination to billionaire businessman B.
Thomas Golisano. Pataki competed for both nominations. That means
Golisano's name will be on the ballot, along with that of state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, the Democratic nominee.</TE>

<HD>No Victor Yet in Problem-Plagued Fla. Vote</HD>
<DH>Election: Reno, once considered a shoo-in, still trails in
Democratic race. If she loses, she's undecided on whether she'll
challenge results.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>After enduring yet another election marred by technical and human
foul-ups, Floridians waited in political limbo Wednesday to know
whether upstart candidate Bill McBride had succeeded in knocking off
Democratic Party superstar Janet Reno in the gubernatorial primary.</LD>
<LD>   With returns in from 97% of the precincts across the state,
McBride, a Tampa lawyer who has never held elective office, was
leading Reno, the former U.S. attorney general, by 19,500 votes out
of more than 1 million cast.</LD>
<LD>   Although some ballots remained to be tallied in Reno's stronghold
of South Florida, many observers believed that they were not enough
to save the Clinton administration Cabinet member from a humbling
upset and that McBride would be facing incumbent Republican Gov. Jeb
Bush in November's general election.</LD>
<TE>   "What will be will be," said a resigned Charles Alber, 53, who
attended what was supposed to be a Reno victory party at an
oceanfront hotel in Bal Harbour that turned into an overnight vigil
for updated election returns. "If McBride wins, we'll vote for
him--the main thing is to not have Bush in there."</TE>
<TE>   Top officials in the Reno campaign said they were pondering
whether to challenge the election in the courts if they lose. In yet
another parallel with the disputed presidential election of nearly
two years ago, there will be a recount if the margin of victory is a
half percentage point or slimmer because a 2001 state law requires
it, said David Host, spokesman for the Florida Department of State.</TE>
<TE>   The winner should be known at the latest by 9 a.m. PDT today, Host
said. Local elections officials must report results by then.</TE>
<TE>   Glitch-ridden polling in the Sunshine State, a dragged-out wait to
know the victor, the possibilities of a recount and lawsuits--"it's
deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra said," joked Ralph G. Neas,
president of People for the American Way, which has organized a
grass-roots effort to protect the rights of Florida's minority
voters.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, finger-pointing and recriminations were mounting over
who was at fault for the technical glitches, the absent poll workers
and other problems that kept thousands of people, especially in the
Miami and Fort Lauderdale areas, from casting ballots Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of this election went the right way," Secretary of
State Jim Smith, the top election official, said in Tallahassee, the
state capital. However, he added, two counties in Florida's
southeast, Broward and Miami-Dade, should be given an "F minus,
minus, minus--totally unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of Tuesday's irregularities were reported in those
locales. However, a statewide survey by Associated Press reported
problems in 14 of Florida's 67 counties, despite the $32 million
appropriated by state lawmakers last year to modernize voting
machines, increase voter awareness and train poll workers.</TE>
<TE>   "I guarantee you that in November, the election will run much more
smoothly," a plainly irked Bush pledged.</TE>
<TE>   The problems included poll workers who didn't know how to start up
new touch-screen voting machines and ballot cards that tore and
couldn't be read on optical scanners. Machine problems also delayed
the processing of electronic cartridges that contained the votes.</TE>
<TE>   In Broward County, where dozens of polling places opened late,
others closed early and poll workers didn't show up to do their jobs,
many elected officials demanded the removal of local Elections
Supervisor Miriam M. Oliphant. "I am outraged," said county
Commissioner Kristin Jacob. "I am so frustrated to once again be the
laughingstock of this nation."</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Steve Geller said Oliphant, a fellow Democrat elected
in 2000 who championed the purchase of the touch-screen voting
machines, had proved to be a weak administrator. "There were just too
many mistakes to be excused," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In her defense, Oliphant said, "I came into Broward County with a
budget, a very small budget, to serve 960,000 voters."</TE>
<TE>   As of late Wednesday afternoon, at least 3,500 votes from 10
Broward precincts were still reportedly uncounted.</TE>
<TE>   According to the county manager's office in Miami-Dade, which also
was using the touch-screen machines for the first time, election
officials there were still working Wednesday afternoon on returns in
17 precincts, and 500 of 27,000 absentee ballots cast still had to be
checked.</TE>
<TE>   Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas ordered an investigation into what
had gone wrong in the election system, saying, "Our community
suffered a black eye on a day we expected to celebrate our
democracy."</TE>
<TE>   The state's Republican Party was quick to blame Democrats for the
embarrassment at the polls. "Sixty-five of 67 counties got it right,
two didn't, and they happen to be run by Democrats," said Florida GOP
Chairman Al Cardenas.</TE>
<TE>   However, Neas of People for the American Way contended that Bush,
as Florida's chief executive, should be held ultimately responsible
for the mess.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the snafus were reported in African American neighborhoods
of South Florida. Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S.
Commission on Civil Rights and a persistent critic of Bush, said she
planned to ask the Justice Department to "seriously review" the
state's election performance.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the final outcome, it will be a stunning accomplishment
for McBride, who turns 57 next month and was a little-known lawyer
until declaring his candidacy last year. As recently as April, a poll
conducted for two Florida newspapers found he was trailing Reno by a
seemingly hopeless 30 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   In a smartly run campaign that relied heavily on television spots
to raise his profile, the former Marine and Little League coach sold
himself and his school plan. He said he would impose a new tax on
cigarettes that would raise $550 million in its first year to improve
Florida schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The TV ads made him interesting, and what he did from the get-go
was to say, 'I can do it, I can beat Jeb,' " said Susan MacManus,
professor of political science at the University of South Florida in
Tampa. "She [Reno] didn't say that until the final day of the
campaign."</TE>
<TE>   The novice easily bested Reno in fund-raising, amassing $4.2
million to her $2.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   McBride crisscrossed Florida by jet, while Reno ran a quirky,
folksy campaign from behind the wheel of her red pickup truck.
Exploiting her celebrity status, she held a "dance party" fund-raiser
at a trendy Miami Beach nightclub and stumped with Martin Sheen, faux
president from the NBC television program "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Reno closeted herself with legal advisors to ponder her possible
course of action and planned no statements Wednesday, said
spokeswoman Nicole Harburger. "I'm thinking to myself this morning,"
Reno told reporters as she entered her campaign headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   As in Florida, a well-known name failed to ensure victory in
Tuesday's primary in Maryland. Mark Shriver, a nephew of President
Kennedy and son of Sargent Shriver, the 1972 Democratic vice
presidential candidate, lost his bid for the Democratic nomination in
a House district that borders Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Shriver lost a close race to state Sen. Christopher Van Hollen,
who now will try to unseat eight-term GOP Rep. Constance A. Morella.
The district was redrawn to favor Democrats, and a Van Hollen victory
could prove crucial to the party's hopes of winning the House.</TE>

<HD>Terror Detainees Quiet as Guards Reflect</HD>
<DH>Prisoners: Soldiers and employees at the base holding 598
mark the day without incident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GUANTANAMO BAY NAVAL BASE, Cuba</DL>
<LD>If the nearly 600 prisoners knew what day it was, they didn't let on.</LD>
<LD>   But Assistant Fire Chief Steve Waltermon and his crew of 100
Jamaicans, who have not seen a real fire here in three years, were
well aware of the date. They paused Wednesday to stand at attention
and ring the firehouse bells in memory of the New York firefighters
who died at the World Trade Center a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, across this base, the United States' oldest overseas and
the only one in a communist country, sailors, soldiers, airmen and
Marines took note of the anniversary and pledged anew to continue
their task guarding prisoners from the war on terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Though security was stepped up Wednesday at U.S. military
installations worldwide, all was quiet at Camp Delta, a high-security
compound that houses 598 prisoners from 43 countries.</TE>
<TE>   "I walked the camp this afternoon, and it was very, very quiet,"
said Army Col. John Perrone, of Rochester, N.Y. "It was a normal day.
There were no issues whatsoever.... If they do speak about it, it's
in Arabic and I don't know what they're saying."</TE>
<TE>   Said Army Sgt. Blake Winner, a guard from Cleveland: "They do keep
track of the days. If you ask them, they can tell you how long
they've been here. But we don't tell them anything. I don't give them
the time of day."</TE>
<TE>   At an emotional ceremony at Camp America, a complex of wooden
structures that is home to the 1,600 guards watching the mostly
Afghan prisoners, Army National Guard Capt. Sandra Orlandella read a
poem eulogizing her comrades.</TE>
<TE>   Back home, she served as a New York City police officer, and she
still mourns the loss of colleagues she tried to help at ground zero
on Sept. 11. On Wednesday, she was so overcome with emotion she
struggled to keep going.</TE>
<TE>   Behind her in a Quonset hut, a projector displayed images of the
jets exploding into the towers, of the Pentagon afire, of a hole in a
field in Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The video ended with a firefighter passing the American flag to a
soldier, who said, "I'll take it from here."</TE>
<TE>   "For those of us serving here in Guantanamo Bay," Brig. Gen. Rick
Baccus told the 200 gathered in the hut, "our war is about proving to
the world that this country does abide by law in the treatment of
detainees.... Other countries have tortured our servicemen and women.
But we as soldiers will preserve our American ideals."</TE>
<TE>   Flags were lowered to half-staff around the base, including along
the base's 17-mile fence that separates "Gitmo" from Fidel Castro's
regime.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners might not know the date, but they must realize there
is no exit.</TE>
<TE>   On one side of the camp, which once housed detainees from the
Cuban boatlifts, is the Caribbean Sea. On the other are scrub grass
and mountains guarded by machine gun nests.</TE>
<TE>   Since January, when the first flight of detainees arrived from
Afghanistan, four have attempted suicide and 30 have been considered
possible suicide risks, Army officials said. And 80 are in solitary
confinement because of problems while in custody.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Sept. 11 victims whom the Americans here preferred
to talk about on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Fire Chief Waltermon and his crew, who staff the four
fire stations on the base, lined up in front of their trucks as the
bells tolled and then observed a moment of silence.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about it a lot," firefighter Noel King said. "Even prior
to this day we would talk about 9/11, and we will talk about it a lot
tonight."</TE>

<HD>FBI Searches Apartment in Anthrax Case for 3rd Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI agents searched the former home of Steven J. Hatfill, a focus of
attention in the anthrax case, on Wednesday, according to a source
close to the case.</LD>
<LD>   The search, the third of the apartment, was carried out under the
authority of a warrant, said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Hatfill's spokesman, Pat Clawson, said Hatfill was not informed of
the search and has not lived in the apartment in Frederick, Md.,
since Aug. 12. Of the two previous searches, the second was done
under warrant.</LD>
<TE>   Clawson said, "If they are looking for something, how come they
didn't find it during the first two searches?"</TE>
<TE>   Chris Murray, spokesman for the FBI's Washington field office,
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Five people were killed by anthrax-tainted letters sent through
the mail last fall. Anthrax contaminated several buildings, including
a Senate office building.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has identified Hatfill as a "person of interest" in its
investigation but says he is no more or less important than about 30
fellow scientists and researchers with the expertise and opportunity
to conduct the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, 48, has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attacks
and says the Justice Department is ruining his life by linking him to
the crimes.</TE>
<TE>   He was fired Sept. 3 from a job at Louisiana State University
after the Justice Department sent his supervisor an e-mail ordering
that Hatfill be barred from working on department-funded projects.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill worked until 1999 for Ft. Detrick's Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases in Maryland. It is the primary
custodian of the virulent Ames strain of anthrax found in the anthrax
letters.</TE>

<DL>WILMINGTON, N.C.</DL>
<LD>A judge said Wednesday that he wouldn't force the Miss America
pageant to continue recognizing two Miss North Carolinas, but he
agreed to quickly decide whether one of the women voluntarily quit.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge James Fox denied Rebekah Revels' request to
extend a state judge's order that let her join preliminary Miss
America events in Atlantic City, N.J.</LD>
<LD>   Revels sued last month, claiming she was forced to give up her
crown in July when a former boyfriend told pageant officials he had
two photos of her topless. First runner-up Misty Clymer then assumed
the title.</LD>
<TE>   Fox said he would try to make a decision today, after closing
arguments in Revels' case. The pageant ends Sept. 21.</TE>
<TE>   George Bauer, interim president of the Miss America Organization,
said after the hearing that Revels would not be removed immediately,
despite the expiration of the state order Wednesday. "The Miss
America Organization will treat Rebekah Revels with every courtesy,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox has suggested to Barry Nakell, Revels' attorney, that she seek
financial compensation. But Nakell has said money can't make up for
not being allowed to compete for the Miss America title.</TE>

<HD>9/11 Hearings Cloud Terrorist Suspect's Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: There's fear that surprise disclosures before
Congress could taint the proceeding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The judge and lawyers in the upcoming trial of Zacarias Moussaoui
fear that public congressional hearings planned for next week on
intelligence failures of Sept. 11 might provide surprise disclosures
or testimony that could affect the trial or give Moussaoui
significant grounds for appeal.</LD>
<LD>   The last prominent defendant to benefit from high-profile
congressional hearings was Oliver L. North, who testified before
Congress on the Iran-Contra scandal, then later was indicted and
convicted of three felonies. His conviction subsequently was
overturned and the case was dismissed after an appeals court ruled
that his congressional testimony tainted the trial.</LD>
<LD>   This time, the House and Senate intelligence committees are
conducting a joint inquiry into why the American intelligence
community didn't learn of the attacks in advance, and what can be
done to prevent breaches in the future.</LD>
<TE>   In February, the joint committee began requesting--and
receiving--tens of thousands of pages of documents from the FBI, the
CIA and other federal agencies and conducting hundreds of interviews
with members of those agencies. The committee plans to begin public
hearings Wednesday, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, 34, was indicted in December on six counts of
conspiring to participate in the Sept. 11 attacks. Jury selection in
Alexandria, Va., is scheduled to begin Nov. 18. Moussaoui is
representing himself.</TE>
<TE>   His standby attorneys have told U.S. District Judge Leonie
Brinkema that the hearings almost certainly will involve Moussaoui,
since he was arrested weeks before the hijackings. The defense team
is both aghast at the possibility of nationally televised
condemnations of Moussaoui shortly before a jury is picked and
hopeful the process will give the defense openings to attack
witnesses or argue that the trial has been irreparably prejudiced.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is going to be a real mess," said Lawrence Walsh,
the independent counsel in the Iran-Contra affair.</TE>
<TE>   "If nothing else happens, it makes it hard to get an impartial
jury if Congress is going to spill this stuff all over the front
pages on the eve of trial," he said.</TE>

<HD>Mudslides Now Beset Colorado</HD>
<DH>Weather: Hundreds are stranded in fire-scarred southwest
part of state. More rain is forecast.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Heavy rains sent trees, boulders and rivers of mud rushing across
charred hillsides Wednesday in southwestern Colorado, isolating
hundreds of residents in their homes for the second time in less than
a week.</LD>
<LD>   No one was in immediate danger, but roads near Durango were
blocked by debris 10 feet high and boulders weighing several tons
apiece, La Plata County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Bender said.</LD>
<LD>   "What used to be a pine forest next to an upscale home is now a
gaping hole and a boulder field," Bender said.</LD>
<TE>   As much as 3 inches of rain had fallen in the area since Tuesday
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   More rain was forecast, and authorities were bracing for
additional mudslides.</TE>
<TE>   There were no reports of mud moving into homes but several
driveways were buried under boulders and gouges were cut across
several properties as the mudslides changed the course of creeks,
Bender said.</TE>
<TE>   Mudslides hit the same area Saturday. At least five families had
to leave their homes because of the damage, and 12 more families had
heavy debris inside their homes.</TE>
<TE>   The landscape, left barren by the 70,485-acre Missionary Ridge
wildfire in June, is especially susceptible to mudslides because
there is little vegetation to hold the soil in place.</TE>
<TE>   Residents say the mudslides are one more nightmare in a summer
marked by disaster.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it the summer of hell," said Shirley Andersen, who has
lived in the Durango area 36 years. "This is the worst."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen said there were mudslides Wednesday on both sides of her
house along County Road 250, but her home was spared.</TE>
<TE>   "We were up all night. It rained real hard all night and I could
hear the plows and stuff trying to clean up the mud," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Bender said the area about nine miles north of Durango along
County Road 250 was the hardest hit, though mudslides also forced
road closures in the Vallecito area several miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy-equipment crews cleared debris from roads and used it to
build makeshift dikes and culverts to try to steer additional debris
away from homes.</TE>
<TE>   Bender said residents were told to remain on alert for possible
evacuations, as they have been for most of the summer.</TE>
<TE>   Residents may see problems for as long as three years, Bender
said, until vegetation grows back.</TE>
<TE>   The land will be marked for years, Bender said. "The debris that
was scattered Saturday and today will be here for decades."</TE>

<HD>Americans Mourn as One</HD>
<DH>Memorials: From firehouses to churches to fast-food
restaurants--in loud and quiet gatherings--the nation pauses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a bleak day clouded by mourning and memory, Americans marked the
first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks by gathering Wednesday for
solemn public rites that revealed the nation's undiminished grief.</LD>
<LD>   From the thousands who marched down into the scarred pit of New
York's ground zero and up to the newly renovated walls of the
Pentagon, to the tiny crowds who attended a firehouse ceremony in
Coventry, Ohio, and hundreds of other memorials across the country,
Americans paid respects to the 3,025 who died and recalled a
devastating day that echoed a year later with fresh warnings of new
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "I came to show my solidarity," said Lori Konrad, a USAir flight
attendant who joined President Bush and 5,000 mourners on a
wind-rippled oat field near Shanksville, Pa., the speck of a town
where United Airlines Flight 93 crashed, killing hijackers and the
passengers who fought back. "This is like losing part of the family.
When I look at the memorial where people have left so many keepsakes
in memory of the crew and passengers, it makes me want to cry."</LD>
<TE>   Throughout Southern California, thousands of people attended
dozens of events commemorating the terrorist attacks--from the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, to a dingy coffeehouse, where
they played songs written for the occasion, to the Museum of
Tolerance, where they lighted a candle for each of the more than
3,000 victims. In Los Angeles' Koreatown, Buddhist monks trailed a
squad of police pipers, carrying a banner proclaiming: "Let there be
peace on Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Even those who busied themselves in the routine of work, or
retreated into private reflection, were unable to avoid the
relentless tug of the day's somberness and the spiraling dread of new
terrorism threats.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of government warnings of terrorist movements that
spurred a nationwide state of high alert, authorities moved quickly
to avert trouble.</TE>
<TE>   A Northwest Airlines jet on its way from Memphis, Tenn., to Las
Vegas was diverted to Fort Smith, Ark., after three passengers
reportedly locked themselves in a bathroom. A Dallas-bound American
Airlines jet returned to Houston escorted by two F-16 fighter jets
after a passenger mistakenly reported spotting a weapon aboard. A
bomb threat emptied the Ohio Supreme Court building. And Coast Guard
inspectors ordered a freighter out to sea after radioactive traces
were detected in its cargo hold.</TE>
<TE>   Airline passengers brave enough to fly and those with no other
transportation choices found themselves buckled in for tense
journeys. A flight attendant on a United Airlines jet from Dallas
burst into tears over the intercom as the plane landed at
Washington's Reagan National Airport. Dogged by morbid memories of
planes turned into flying bombs, some travelers were visibly relieved
after landing, alternately voicing defiance and admitting inner
fears.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed more people looking around at each other," said Richard
Wolff, a Jacksonville, Fla., businessman exiting a USAir flight at
Reagan National. "I know I was more nervous today."</TE>
<TE>   American businesses marked the day with varying degrees of homage.
Flags flew at half staff outside McDonald's restaurants. Kmarts
opened two hours late. General Motors held media ads. Even the Web
mourned as Yahoo's home page was bordered in black and the auction
site EBay displayed a virtual flag.</TE>
<TE>   Air passengers were among the few Americans who could avoid the
gripping televised images of mourning beamed from the concrete
valleys of Lower Manhattan--and the mirror-image rites that the rest
of America offered as their own salve for a lonesome day.</TE>
<TE>   If New York had its burly, silent bagpipers and string-quartet
dirges, Washington had its Pentagon parade ground of military men and
Pennsylvania had its impromptu memorial fence of fluttering flags and
baseball caps. Hundreds of other American towns found their own
homespun ways to pay homage.</TE>
<TE>   Firetruck horns in Waco, Texas, blared in solidarity. Navy fighter
jets roared over Norfolk's harbor. Park Ridge, Ill., residents
planted "liberty trees." Ancient church bells tolled all morning in
tiny Winthrop, Maine--as they did in churches across the country--for
each moment of impact of the four doomed planes. Firefighters in
Bethesda, Md., snapped to attention outside their station, saluting a
half-staff flag and idling rush-hour traffic as respectful motorists
slowed in appreciation.</TE>
<TE>   In Coventry, Capt. John Dolensky, surrounded by his 16-member fire
department, all bedecked in dress double-breasted uniforms, intoned
the names of 343 firefighters who perished at the World Trade Center.
It took him 20 minutes. "Some of the names were a challenge, but
these guys are heroes," Dolensky said later. "I hope I did them
justice."</TE>
<TE>   All day, every news channel offered grim, year-old footage of the
twin towers afire and fresh images of mournful bagpipers and
heartbroken families, reminding even casual viewers that attention
had to be paid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm watching it right now on television, and I've been struggling
to keep it together. I've been crying, to be frank," said the Rev.
Kimberly Murphy, pastor of Winthrop Congregational Church. As the
bells of her church sounded near her home, Murphy sipped her coffee
in tears, preparing to lead her Maine congregation in an evening
prayer service for Sept. 11's victims and survivors.</TE>
<TE>   Bells tolled too outside the National Cathedral in Washington,
D.C., interrupting the homily delivered by Archbishop Desmond Tutu of
South Africa on behalf of the Sept. 11 victims. "Our hearts still go
out in compassion and sympathy," Tutu said, "as you still wrestle
with the consequences of those traumatic events of that day, that
awful day."</TE>
<TE>   In Seattle, Linda Martin, 34, a market research worker, broke down
as she listened to a broadcast of the ground zero ceremonies on her
car radio. The day before, she had scoffed at the rites as
"sensationalism. But ... listening to the radio, I realized today is
a day for everyone to be reminded of the grief that people directly
affected struggle with every day."</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 16,000 Seattle residents felt similarly, crowding into
Safeco Field to listen to a sober performance of Mozart's "Requiem."
Carrying flags and banners, thousands more joined a public procession
later in the day, joined by Red Cross workers who handed out packets
of tissues to those overcome by anguish.</TE>
<TE>   Even before former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani began to
read the names of the dead at ground zero, a brigade of construction
workers led their own impromptu memorial uptown at a skyscraper site
at Columbus Circle.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:15 a.m., nearly 100 men wearing hard hats spilled into the
surrounding streets. One hardhat ordered comrades working several
floors above to drape flags out from the scaffolding. Then, at 8:46
a.m., the exact moment an American Airlines 757 crashed into the
north tower a year ago, the workers suddenly doffed their helmets and
put their hands on their hearts.</TE>
<TE>   Several blocks south, at Times Square, traffic froze as
pedestrians and drivers stared up at a vast NBC video screen carrying
the first minutes of live coverage from the service at ground zero.
There was no sound from the screen, and the intersection too was
eerily silent. The cars waited, idling, as the lights changed red,
then green, then red again. Businessmen and students waited patiently
with their briefcases and backpacks, watching for long minutes, many
quietly weeping.</TE>
<TE>   At dusk, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ignited an eternal flame in
Battery Park City to memorialize those killed at the trade center. As
Bloomberg held a battery-powered, flickering electric candle high,
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan greeted a crowd of foreign dignitaries.
"The memory of those we lost will burn with unending brightness,"
Bloomberg said as the flame caught.</TE>
<TE>   In SoHo, Michelle Peters wore black to a prayer service for 12
vanished firefighters from Ladder 5. It was the same turtleneck and
trousers she had worn a year ago, when she rushed down to the World
Trade Center Elementary School to retrieve her two daughters. "I
wanted to be able to walk with dignity in these clothes instead of
running," she said. "I just need to show that I'm in control."</TE>
<TE>   It was the sort of small gesture of defiance that Americans ached
for as they lurched through a long day that crawled on at a caisson's
pace.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles businessman Billy Deeb strode onto the same
Burbank-to-Oakland Southwest Airlines flight for which he had bought
a ticket a year ago. His flight that day, like hundreds of others
across the country, was grounded.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, this is closure," he said, taking an exit-row seat as the
plane took off. Flight attendants wore patriotic ribbons and thanked
the passengers for "showing the American spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "This is coming full circle," Deeb said, adding: "It's like the
president said. We have to travel to show that the terrorists didn't
win. We cannot be afraid."</TE>
<TE>   Small victories were also claimed in the heartland. At Mt.
Rushmore in South Dakota, Virgil Ledgerwood, 69, and his wife,
Davette, made up for their own shattered plans. They had planned to
fly from St. Louis to explore Yellowstone, the Badlands and other
Western national parks--an itinerary aborted by the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, they were making up for lost time. "We had it on TV
at the motel," Davette Ledgerwood said. "It was hard to watch. I was
glad when we got in the car. We listened to a little radio, but when
the president was done, we turned it off and found a music station."</TE>
<TE>   She wore an American flag T-shirt as she explored the monument
with her husband. Around them were hundreds of tourists making
similar statements, most wearing patriotic-themed clothes. Along
Highway 90, the main tourist route through South Dakota, residents
hung flags and signs from their homes, many reading simply: "We'll
never forget." In Rapid City, S.D., patriots blared their horns in
response to a parked white car that was spray-painted with an
exhortation: "Honk for the USA!"</TE>
<TE>   At the Pentagon, where Bush, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld
and a parade of generals and dignitaries spoke to an appreciative
audience of 13,000, only the upbeat story of the government's hasty,
efficient rebuilding was enough to buoy some who attended.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Mianegaz, a Pentagon civilian employee, had considered staying
away, certain she could not handle any more sorrow. But showing up at
the last minute, she found herself heartened. "Now that I see it, I
think, this really does show a victory here," she said. "You look at
this place, how it's been rebuilt, and you think, yes, we did it."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld and other officials lauded construction workers and
military officers who worked feverishly to repair the blackened gash
left when American Airlines Flight 77 slammed into the building a
year ago, killing 184 inside and aboard the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   "There was nothing you could do when the plane was coming," said
Frank Probst, a quality assurance manager for the Pentagon Renovation
Program who survived the blast a year ago. "The only thing we could
do was build it back."</TE>
<TE>   Uniformed troops paced on the five-sided building's rooftop, while
hidden just out of sight were Humvee military vehicles mounted with
armed batteries of Stinger missiles aimed skyward.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Rear Adm. Matthew Moffit told a group of sailors
atop the aircraft carrier John C. Stennis that there is "work yet to
be done."</TE>
<TE>   "The admiral's got it right: There's unfinished business out
there," said Case Ryan, 20, a third-class petty officer from East
Texas. "We've got to get Saddam Hussein this time for good."</TE>
<TE>   America mourned under the gun, its shores patrolled by beefed-up
Coast Guard patrols, its air corridors rent by fighter jets. Air
Force pilots were aloft over New York and Washington, officials said.
Two F-16s were quick to take to the skies over Texas after several
people reported seeing a passenger with a weapon aboard a Fokker 100
jet flying to Dallas from Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "There were never any threats made or anything," said American
Airlines spokesman Ernie Soto, "but the pilot decided it would be
better to be safe than take a chance, so he came back." Airline
officials later said two armed air marshals were on board.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities were taking no chances on the ground in Houston,
either. At the mosque of the Islamic Society of Greater Houston,
Sheik Omar Inshanally led a midafternoon prayer service for 35 Muslim
men. "Muslims have a double reason to be prayerful and hopeful and
angry today," Inshanally said. "Those cowards who killed people made
so many lives miserable."</TE>
<TE>   But as Inshanally and other leaders decried "the act of brutality"
of Sept. 11, a totem of the tension wrought of the nation's long day
of mourning sat just beyond the ornate iron fence. Parked outside,
motor off, was a blue-and-white Houston police patrol car.</TE>

<HD>For First Couple, Day of Remembrance a Day of Raw Emotions,

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Hand-in-hand, their faces etched in pain, President Bush and First
Lady Laura Bush strode purposefully down the seven-story-deep ramp
into the gaping hole where the World Trade Center towers once stood.</LD>
<LD>   In the dusty, wind-swept pit below, arrayed in a large circle,
awaiting the first couple were hundreds of relatives of those who
died a year ago on a day that America will never forget.</LD>
<LD>   After briefly laying a ceremonial wreath, the president and Mrs.
Bush immediately began greeting the mourners. And it wasn't long
before the president began blinking back tears as he reached deep
into the crowd to hug, kiss, salute and, above all, console. At one
point, the Bushes paused and then joined the West Point choir in a
moving rendition of "America, the Beautiful" as shadows crept across
the baleful gathering.</LD>
<TE>   Their visit to ground zero late Wednesday afternoon capped an
emotional day that also took the Bushes to the two other sites where
hijacked jets crashed a year ago: the Pentagon and a pastoral field
in southwestern Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Lower Manhattan, as in Pennsylvania, the president made no
public remarks; instead, he and Mrs. Bush simply laid a wreath and
then mingled quietly with the families of those killed on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The Bushes began the national day of remembrance by attending a
private service at St. John's Episcopal Church, just on the other
side of Lafayette Park from the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Amid heightened security, the couple emerged from the White
House's north entrance at 7:40 a.m., trailed by National Security
Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In these rapidly shortening days of late summer, the sun was just
topping the trees to the east as the flag atop the Executive Mansion
flapped vigorously at half-staff.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some Sunday services that he attends at the church, when he
sits halfway back, Bush on Wednesday settled into a front-row pew,
with two Secret Service agents directly behind him.</TE>
<TE>   In all, about 150 guests, including senior White House staffers
Karl Rove and Mary Matalin, attended the invitation-only service,
filling about three-quarters of the red-cushioned pews.</TE>
<TE>   After the service, the president and first lady participated in a
moment of silence on the White House South Lawn to mark the precise
moment a year ago when the first hijacked airplane struck the north
tower of the World Trade Center. At exactly 15 seconds before 8:46
a.m., the president and first lady emerged, holding hands. They then
simply stood, with heads bowed.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined by hundreds of administration officials and White
House workers, from groundskeepers in short-sleeved green shirts to
military personnel in their crisp dress whites.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone, it seemed, wore commemorative pins--flags with "The
White House" stamped on the front, and the dates "September 11, 2001;
September 11, 2002" on the back. The pins were distributed Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   After about a minute, the silence ended and the presidential
limousine pulled up, ready to take the first couple to their next
destination, the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   At the suburban Virginia headquarters of the Defense Department,
about 13,500 people gathered in a makeshift stadium in the shadow of
the Pentagon's rebuilt exterior wall. Among them was Solicitor
General Theodore B. Olson, whose wife, Barbara, was a passenger on
the hijacked jet that smashed into the building.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the crowd were two groups of small schoolchildren, the
classmates of students who were on that flight.</TE>
<TE>   As Marine Staff Sgt. Kevin Bennear sang the national anthem, four
soldiers on the roof directly behind the president attempted to
unfurl a gigantic U.S. flag that has flown at the site of the
wreckage--a struggle in the face of 20 mph winds.</TE>
<TE>   Another backdrop at the event was a huge billboard suspended from
a crane, bearing children's artwork depicting their reactions to the
terrorist attacks. As Bush spoke, the cables holding the billboard
occasionally clanged loudly against pieces of scaffolding, and the
large canvas screens snapped and popped in the wind.</TE>
<TE>   Near the ceremony's conclusion, both the president and first lady
waved small flags as they joined in the singing of "God Bless
America."</TE>
<TE>   Then, four fighter jets roared low overhead.</TE>
<TE>   In his brief remarks, Bush called the Pentagon "a working
building, not a memorial," and he said its rededication earlier this
summer served to "renew our commitment to win the war."</TE>
<TE>   The president clearly had in mind his goal of extending the war on
terrorism to Iraq, as he warned of "a great deal left to do."</TE>
<TE>   "What happened to our nation on a September day set in motion the
first great struggle of a new century," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "And as long as terrorists and dictators plot against our lives
and our liberty, they will be opposed by the United States Army,
Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force and Marines."</TE>
<TE>   From the Pentagon, he flew to Johnstown, Pa., and then by
helicopter to a field in nearby Somerset County, where Flight 93 had
crashed.</TE>
<TE>   As at ground zero, the president and his wife spent about an hour
with the relatives of those who died at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Some exchanges were lighthearted. One woman told Bush that it was
her 86th birthday. The president hugged her and said, "I hope when
I'm 86, I look as good as you do."</TE>
<TE>   A relative who runs six miles a day said he would like to run with
the president some time. To that, Bush quipped, "I could run the
first three with you. But I couldn't keep up with you for the next

<HD>Tribute to Gallantry of Flight 93 Victims</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Bell rings out 40 times for 40 names at a desolate
Pennsylvania field now venerated.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SHANKSVILLE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Forty times the bell rang out across western Pennsylvania's valley of
death Wednesday and 40 times a new name was read, until finally all
the passengers and crew on United Airlines Flight 93 were accounted
for. Their families and friends bowed their heads, then stood to sing
"America, the Beautiful."</LD>
<LD>   The Boeing 757 had gone down near here at 10:10 a.m., a year to
the minute from when the bell first rang, after the passengers'
heroic attack on four terrorists who had hijacked the Newark-to-San
Francisco flight. The attack, homeland security chief Tom Ridge told
the crowd gathered in the field, 400 yards from the crash site, was
the first battle in the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 of the victims' relatives converged on this small
hamlet for the outdoor commemoration, as had several thousand members
of the public, many of whom carried American flags. After the
hourlong ceremony, President Bush met privately with the families, as
he did several months earlier at the White House.</LD>
<TE>   "The healing gets easier with time, and a gathering like this
really helps that process," said Armond Talignani, whose brother,
John, a World War II veteran, died in the crash. He was flying to San
Francisco to attend the funeral of his son, who had been killed the
week before in a car accident.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the crystal-clear day when Flight 93 crashed, dark clouds
hung Wednesday over the Allegheny back roads leading to the expansive
field, rimmed by trees broken and seared by the plane's impact. The
temperature hovered in the low 60s, and a stiff wind snapped at the
cluster of American flags and kicked up dust from the gravel road.</TE>
<TE>   Among those who came to remember the victims'
gallantry--symbolized by Todd Beamer's last known words, "Let's
roll"--were a contingent of 40 or so pilots and flight attendants,
wearing uniforms that represented several airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The crowds were drawn to a makeshift collection of remembrances
that grew spontaneously over a year's time. A Buddhist altar, fruits
and coins and pictures of the deceased are placed there. Many
visitors sign small stones. Others leave hats and flags and write
messages on a large sheet of white cardboard attached to a strand of
mesh wire. "To my sister, Nichole," one said. "I won't forget the fun
we had."</TE>
<TE>   Jack Wolford, a retired USAir pilot, and his wife, Rose, drove
from Virginia Beach, Va., to attend the commemoration. He came, he
said, to honor "these people who are true heroes in every sense of
the word."</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth," he went on, "I've still got too much
anger in me. Anger, I guess, that people could hate us so much they'd
do something like this. I hope I'll get rid of some of that anger
today. I hope by watching the family members being tough, it'll help
me be tough and get some of this anger out of my system."</TE>
<TE>   Libby Custer pulled her sweater tighter around her to cut the
chill. "We just live a mile away. I was on the phone with Mother that
morning. I was watching the attack on the World Trade Center and I
said, 'At least we don't have any terrorist targets in Somerset
County.' Then I heard the scream of a jet engine and 10 seconds
later, an explosion that shook the house."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The number of domestic airline flights was down markedly Wednesday as
heightened concerns about security on the Sept. 11 anniversary
prompted two emergency landings--both of which appeared to have been
caused by misunderstandings.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's terrorism alert system remained at "code orange,"
indicating a high risk of a terrorist strike, but despite a number of
scares around the nation "there have been no incidents that, at first
blush, appear to be involved with terrorism," said Gordon Johndroe, a
spokesman for the White House Office of Homeland Security.</LD>
<LD>   Overseas, the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks saw 13 U.S.
embassies and consulates closed, mostly in Asia. Several diplomatic
posts in Europe received mail that contained a white powder, which
was being analyzed.</LD>
<TE>   Also Wednesday, authorities arrested five men in Pakistan on
suspicion of planning terrorist attacks on U.S. fast-food restaurants
in Karachi. All five men were members of Harkat-ul-Moujahedeen
al-Almi, an Islamic militant group, and had received weapons training
in Afghanistan, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., initial reports of a possible attempted hijacking of
an American Airlines flight over Texas prompted the military to
scramble an F-16 fighter. The airliner, which had two federal air
marshals aboard, made an emergency landing in Houston, where it was
surrounded by law enforcement agents. It turned out that a passenger
who was suspected of carrying a knife had a folding pocket comb, the
airline said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, a Northwest Airlines flight from Memphis, Tenn., to Las
Vegas was diverted to Fort Smith, Ark., after some passengers aroused
suspicion. Details remained sketchy late Wednesday, but government
officials in Washington said they received reports that several male
passengers had locked themselves in a lavatory and were believed to
be shaving. If the men were shaving with razors, it raises concerns
about how they brought the razors past security checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   No one was injured in either incident, and the passengers who came
under suspicion did not attempt to interfere with flight crews,
officials said. No terrorism-related charges were being considered,
an FBI official said.</TE>
<TE>   While the security scares were resolved without incident, the
Sept. 11 anniversary had an unmistakable dampening effect on air
travel, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.</TE>
<TE>   At 8 a.m. EDT there were 3,090 flights aloft under FAA control,
compared with 3,706 at the same time the previous Wednesday, FAA
spokesman Bill Shumann said. The reduction was more dramatic toward
midmorning. At 11 a.m., there were 4,053 flights in the air, compared
with 5,791 the previous Wednesday, a 30% reduction. The gap narrowed
somewhat as the afternoon continued.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the 26,700 U.S. flights scheduled Wednesday were down
about 19% from the nearly 33,000 scheduled on the day of the attacks,
according to Back Aviation Solutions, a consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland security spokesman Johndroe said the orange alert issued
Tuesday would remain in effect indefinitely. Based on a mosaic of
intelligence information, an orange warning represents the
second-highest level of alert. Before Tuesday, the level had been set
at yellow, indicating an "elevated" risk of attack. Since its
implementation in March, officials have yet to elevate the alert
status to the highest level, red, which signals a "severe" risk of
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should expect the threat level to go from orange to
yellow" today, Johndroe said. Because of the higher threat level, law
enforcement has been taking countermeasures that would not have been
employed last week. "Raising the level has had a deterrent effect,"
Johndroe said.</TE>
<TE>   Off the New Jersey coast, the Coast Guard ordered a Liberian
freighter out to sea early Wednesday for investigation into why
radiological sensors went off during an inspection.</TE>
<TE>   The Palermo Senator was ordered six miles out to sea for further
testing. Results of those tests were not immediately available.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Vicki Kemper, Josh Meyer and James F. Peltz

<HD>Florida Vote Foul-Up Puts Reform Onus on Congress</HD>
<DH>Politics: Lawmakers vow to revive a stalled federal effort
to overhaul balloting systems. But the prospects for a bipartisan
deal remain uncertain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As a new Florida election controversy cast a spotlight on
congressional inaction, senior lawmakers pledged Wednesday to revive
their faltering effort to enact an overhaul of the nation's voting
systems.</LD>
<LD>   All sides agree that the disputed 2000 presidential recount in
Florida was Exhibit A in the case for a major federal initiative to
make the process of voting simpler and more secure.</LD>
<LD>   Now the state has, on a somewhat smaller scale, served up Exhibit
B: a marred gubernatorial primary election.</LD>
<TE>   But whether this second Florida foul-up, centered on Tuesday's
Democratic matchup between Janet Reno and Bill McBride, is enough to
push Congress to reach compromise on a bill that would affect every
state remains uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-led House and Democrat-controlled Senate have both
passed versions of a voting reform bill, each by overwhelming
margins. Nonetheless, lawmakers have been unable for months to bridge
substantial partisan differences on issues such as ways to prevent
election fraud.</TE>
<TE>   And in one crucial respect--federal funding--the reform movement
has fallen backward. In August, citing budget pressures, President
Bush killed $400 million from an appropriations law that Congress had
intended to help states begin to upgrade election systems.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers from both parties said Wednesday that they would
redouble efforts to produce a bill acceptable to both chambers and
the president.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're trying to give it a second push. We're doing everything we
can,'' said Sen. Christopher S. "Kit" Bond (R-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still hopeful," said House Minority Leader Richard A.
Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   Referring to troubles in the McBride-Reno race, he said: "How many
times do we have to go through this before we decide that we're going
to help the states and counties do this right?"</TE>
<TE>   Each party lamented the inaction--and blamed the other for it.
Advocates for reform, meanwhile, have urged both sides to cut a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I would certainly hope that what has occurred in Florida would
break things loose and get us some movement on election reform," said
Kay J. Maxwell, president of the League of Women Voters. "A solution,
or at least a hoped-for solution, has been sitting in Congress, and
nobody's taking any action on it."</TE>
<TE>   The House last December passed, 362 to 63, a bill that would
authorize Washington to send billions of dollars to state and local
election agencies. In exchange, the bill sought to spur those
agencies to modernize their voting systems, and in particular to
phase out the punch-card ballots made infamous during the 2000
dispute between Bush and Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate in April passed, 99 to 1, a bill that would impose a
range of national standards on voting systems--for example, requiring
better access to polling places for disabled voters and requiring
states to offer voters a chance to correct errors.</TE>
<TE>   To win GOP support, the Senate bill also included an anti-fraud
provision, written by Bond, that would require certain first-time
voters who register by mail to show some form of identification when
they vote. The House bill contained no similar provision.</TE>
<TE>   In talks between House and Senate members, the anti-fraud measures
have provoked the most debate.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans have accused Senate Democrats of backing off a pledge
to support the Bond language.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, seeking to thwart measures they say might turn
legitimate voters away from the polls, question whether House
Republican leaders want a bill.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the two chief House sponsors, Reps. Robert W. Ney
(R-Ohio) and Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) insisted that the bill remains
very much alive. Ney said House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.)
"has a strong will to get this done."</TE>
<TE>   Hoyer described negotiators as "very energized." He said agreement
had been reached, for instance, on the level of spending the bill
would authorize: $3.5 billion over five years.</TE>
<TE>   Such money is expected to go a long way to help states such as
California replace punch-card voting machines. Hoyer said a portion
of the federal funding could be spent to train poll workers on how to
use new systems--evidently a problem Tuesday in some precincts in
South Florida.</TE>
<TE>   But as the all-too-familiar scenario in Florida unfolded, some
lawmakers warned that Congress could not legislate an end to election
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as I would like to see an election reform bill pass
before Congress adjourns for the year," Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)
said, "passage of such [a] bill cannot guarantee trouble-free
elections in every state.''</TE>

<HD>'Every Day Has Felt Like Sept. 11' for Loved Ones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>They came in groups, clinging to each other, but some grieved alone.
A few pushed aging parents in wheelchairs and some had babies in
strollers. They all stood in silence Wednesday as the wind blew dust
in their faces, waiting to hear a name read that--for each--was like
a knife in the heart.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't know if I would come today," said Deborah Garcia, noting
that the anniversary of her husband's death was only going to
aggravate a wound that might never heal. "To me, every day has felt
like Sept. 11."</LD>
<LD>   On a morning when New York wept and remembered--and the keen of
bagpipes was heard in the streets at 4:30 a.m.--thousands of grieving
family members converged on the site of the former World Trade
Center. They stood in silence under a blazing sun as the names of all
2,801 people missing and dead in the terrorist attacks were read
aloud.</LD>
<TE>   The names were recited crisply, with virtually no interruption,
and it took more than two hours to finish the list. As the readings
continued, mourners quietly placed flowers and other memorials to
loved ones on the grounds of the dusty pit, which is all that remains
of the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   "They were our neighbors, our husbands, our children, our sisters,
our brothers and our wives," New York Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said
after the names were read. "They were our countrymen and our friends.
They were us."</TE>
<TE>   Although New York held a multitude of memorial services marking
the first anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, the ground zero
ceremonies were poignant because they featured one of the largest
single gatherings of victims' families in public. The sheer number of
them--thousands packed in front of a stage and an equal number jammed
onto a nearby highway--testified to the savage loss of life at the
World Trade Center and its effect on so many people.</TE>
<TE>   An Eerie Stillness</TE>
<TE>   But raw emotions also spilled into the busy streets next to ground
zero. A year ago, the neighborhood was filled with choking dust and
falling debris, with the sounds of wailing sirens and thousands
fleeing for their lives. It was far quieter Wednesday, even eerily
silent, as crowds gathered to watch or simply ponder the sad ceremony
unfolding several blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen so much pain in one place," said Phil Crosson,
mourning the loss of his daughter's fiance. "A lot of us still can't
accept it."</TE>
<TE>   The ceremonies paused to mark four moments: 8:46 a.m., when the
first plane hit the north tower; 9:03 a.m., when the second plane
struck; 9:59 a.m., when the south tower fell, and 10:30 a.m., when
the north tower collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the day, President Bush bowed his head before a wreath at
the site and New York concluded its official ground zero events with
the lighting of an eternal flame in nearby Battery Park City,
honoring all those who were lost.</TE>
<TE>   A host of dignitaries participated in the low-key but moving
ceremonies, including New York Gov. George Pataki, New Jersey Gov.
James E. McGreevey and Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. Former
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, forgoing any remarks, read the first 43
names on the long list of Sept. 11 victims.</TE>
<TE>   As they assembled in front of a dais near the site, family members
held pictures of loved ones with handwritten notes like "Remember Me"
scrawled on the top. Others wore T-shirts commemorating victims'
lives, hugged each other and released balloons when their names were
read.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody you see has a hole in their heart," said Kit Mak,
mourning the death of her sister, Yuk-Ping Wong, 47. "We knew this
was a special event, so we came, even though my parents couldn't bear
to be here."</TE>
<TE>   Standing nearby and clutching six roses, Garcia said she still
hasn't come to terms with the death of her husband, David, let alone
the idea that a year has passed. The only reason she decided to come,
she confessed, is that it gave her yet another opportunity to say
goodbye where he had died.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to give me these all of the time," she said, pointing to
the flowers in her hands. "So I came here today to give one back to
him."</TE>
<TE>   One block away, people who went to work in busy office buildings,
just as they did a year ago, were moved by the pageantry. Many stood
to listen to the sounds of names being read.</TE>
<TE>   Others ducked out of buildings to gaze at the space where the
towers stood and to mark a painful anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   "Just showing my respects," said Courtney Barnard, 38, who works
near the trade center site and paused at 8:46 a.m. "All these people
here knew someone," pointing to a crowd gathered on the sidewalk and
adding that he knew 10 traders who perished at Windows on the World,
the 107th-floor restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   Up-Close View of Terror</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, several window washers gathered for their morning break,
and they couldn't help but remember the pandemonium in the streets
one year before.</TE>
<TE>   Gus Saavdra, 42, a Colombia native, recalled how he was on a
scaffold outside the 52nd floor of a skyscraper across the street
when the first plane struck one of the towers. He felt the rumble of
the second plane even before it hit.</TE>
<TE>   Saavdra and a co-worker had to lead an electrician, also on the
scaffold, to safety because "he froze."</TE>
<TE>   "We had to grab him and carry him down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other members of the Local 2 window washers' union weren't so
lucky.</TE>
<TE>   One was working on the roof of one of the towers when the second
plane hit; another worker jumped from the 92nd floor to his death.</TE>
<TE>   As the ceremonies unfolded, there were signs of a massive security
buildup. Car traffic was halted near the World Trade Center, a
military helicopter with a protruding gun turret circled above, and
special police details guarded rooftops and lobbies throughout the
downtown area.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Port Authority police set up two decontamination
tents--in case of chemical or biological attacks--just south of
ground zero, and officials said a large number of undercover officers
were also deployed.</TE>
<TE>   Procession in Streets</TE>
<TE>   Although the ceremonies officially began at 8:46 a.m., they
started hours earlier, before dawn. Drum and bagpipe processions--one
from each of the city's five boroughs--began marching toward ground
zero. Each band was composed of emergency workers who answered the
call Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The wailing of the pipes reached Manhattan's Upper West Side by
4:30 a.m., but it was not a call to war or alarm. The pipers called
New Yorkers to rise to the memory of the day--even though they
appeared to startle some from sleep. Apartment windows popped open as
the bands passed, and muffled cheers erupted in the mostly empty
streets.</TE>
<TE>   When the bagpipe players arrived, family members and other
onlookers gave them emotional applause.</TE>
<TE>   They left the ceremony when it ended just before noon, joining a
stream of mourners pausing for one last look at the pit.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Gillespie walked away carrying a bright bouquet of roses, his
jacket slung over his arm. He had come from Philadelphia to honor the
memory of his godson, Kenny Caldwell, who worked on the 102nd floor
of one of the towers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult day, but it's an important day," he said. "It's
important to remember, to be together and celebrate the life. People
say time heals things, but it has only made it worse."</TE>
<TE>   Gillespie said he found the New York ceremony "very moving, but
very, very sad, very, very difficult. I'm hearing all these names,
seeing so many people in such grief. It doesn't give me any closure."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Voters to Decide if CenterLine Stays on Track</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Council approves a citywide election on a
shortened version of the light-rail line.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decision late Tuesday by Irvine's City Council to submit a portion
of the CenterLine light-rail plan to voters creates a new threat to
the entire project, transportation officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Arthur Leahy, chief executive officer of the Orange County
Transportation Authority, said a rejection of the project in Irvine
probably would force a reevaluation of the rail line to determine if
it still made "transportation sense." OCTA is the lead agency behind
the $1.1-billion project.</LD>
<LD>   The vote came after a five-hour debate over the rail line,
which--as currently envisioned--would run 11.4 miles from the front
steps of UC Irvine to the Santa Ana train station with stops at the
Irvine Business Complex, John Wayne Airport, South Coast Plaza and
the Santa Ana Civic Center.</LD>
<TE>   Council members approved the route, shortened by more than six
miles from an earlier plan to avoid Irvine neighborhoods where many
residents oppose CenterLine. Shortening the line eliminates the
Irvine Spectrum commercial area and the Irvine Transportation Center,
a major bus and rail hub, as the southern terminus of the system.</TE>
<TE>   But the council, which is facing an initiative drive against the
project, also agreed to hold a citywide election on the project
before June 30. Should voters disapprove, CenterLine could not enter
the city.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome a vote on the matter," said Mayor Larry Agran, a
CenterLine backer who is running for reelection in November. "We want
to allow the fullest public participation in the final decision."</TE>
<TE>   OCTA officials estimate the line will carry almost 31,000
passengers a day during its first year. Preliminary engineering
studies are underway, but a final decision on whether the line will
be built is at least a year away.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's action finalizes the proposed alignment for the project
and allows OCTA to meet a Sept. 16 deadline to apply for at least
$500 million in federal funds. The authority's board approved the
truncated route Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and council members Mike Ward, Chris Mears and Beth Krom
approved the revised line and the special election. Councilman Greg
Smith, an opponent of the rail proposal, cast the only dissenting
vote.</TE>
<TE>   Few people are going to ride CenterLine, said Smith, predicting
the line will eventually be extended to the Irvine Spectrum along a
route that will affect neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a lot of talk about providing choice, but no one
is going to choose this," Smith said. "Light rail may work elsewhere,
but it is not going to work here."</TE>
<TE>   A second ballot measure approved by the council asks if any
expansion of CenterLine in Irvine should be submitted to voters.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measures will incorporate ideas from an initiative
proposed by Fund Alternatives Instead of Rail Transit, an
anti-CenterLine group based in Irvine. The group began gathering
signatures over the weekend to qualify its own measure for a possible
March election. The measure would block construction of CenterLine in
Irvine and strip all references to light rail from the city's general
plan.</TE>
<TE>   John Kleinpeter, the group's chairman, criticized the council
decision, saying it was an attempt to defuse his group's initiative
campaign and confuse voters by placing two CenterLine measures on the
ballot.</TE>

<HD>Gehry Can't Escape Environmental Concerns</HD>
<DH>Tree: Preparation for architect's new office near Playa
Vista leads to felling of a prized eucalyptus with historic
significance to a family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seemed at first that by moving his office to a site outside Playa
Vista's boundaries, architect Frank Gehry was cutting his ties to the
controversial coastal wetlands construction project.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, workers preparing Gehry's new design studio were creating
a new controversy by cutting down a towering eucalyptus tree that was
the Westside's last tie with Ballona Creek's historic rancho era.</LD>
<LD>   The 100-foot tree shaded ranchers' headquarters for generations.
It was chopped down last week to make way for a parking lot for Gehry
and his staff of 125 architects and designers.</LD>
<TE>   The destruction has outraged neighbors and members of a pioneer
ranching family whose roots to the Ballona Creek area reach back to
1819.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree was a remembrance of the ranch. It was something we held
sacred," said Fred Machado, 78, the great-great-grandson of the
settler who created 13,919-acre Rancho La Ballona.</TE>
<TE>   "That tree marked a historic spot. That was the only thing left
from the ranch. It was so big and beautiful and healthy. It's like
losing a real close friend."</TE>
<TE>   The chain-sawing came as Gehry issued a denial that
environmentalists had persuaded him to locate his new headquarters
away from Playa Vista--for which he has been hired to design office
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Although Gehry announced last year that he was moving his offices
from Santa Monica to Playa Vista, it was learned a month ago that he
was setting up shop instead a few blocks away in an existing
industrial area at 12541 Beatrice St.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists who for years have campaigned to preserve Playa
Vista as a wetland wildlife habitat quickly claimed victory. On Aug.
30, activists delivered a huge thank you card to Gehry and invited
him to join their campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry dispatched an assistant to accept the poster-size card. But
four days later he announced that his move to Beatrice Street was due
to timing problems, not disenchantment with Playa Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Residents of a 50-year-old neighborhood next to the Beatrice
Street site tried without success to block the tree's destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowner Mickey Shockley said she pleaded with Gehry's office to
stop the chopping before the entire tree was destroyed. "What remains
at this moment are two large trunks, which left could continue to
grow," she wrote the architect.</TE>
<TE>   "As a very well-known architect, Mr. Gehry, I would have hoped a
parking area of your design could have saved this once-beautiful
tree."</TE>
<TE>   Greg Machado, another member of the former ranching family, rushed
to the site in an attempt to halt the cutting.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the crew that I believed the tree should not be touched,
that it was protected by part of a deed restriction," said Machado of
El Segundo. He said family matriarch Gayle Machado was convinced that
paperwork in storage for over 35 years would prove the family's
intent to save the tree.</TE>
<TE>   Gehry was unavailable for comment Wednesday. But a spokesman said
the tree was already down by the time they received Shockley's
letter.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Ayeroff, president of NSB Capital Partners, which acquired the
$10-million Beatrice Street property in partnership with Gehry, said
he was unaware of any agreement to preserve the tree.</TE>
<TE>   "We did due-diligence about the property. I'm totally unaware of
any special protection" for the tree, Ayeroff said. "The first time
we hard of the Machado connection was after the tree was cut down."</TE>
<TE>   But it was "a private tree on private property. It's an industrial
area that's been transformed over the past 25 years. In the future
that tree might have been somewhat dangerous," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Machado family members said the eucalyptus was planted about 1900
to shade the family ranch house--a two-story, porch-wrapped wooden
structure constructed 5 feet off the ground as protection from
periodic flooding from the nearby Ballona Creek.</TE>
<TE>   The house was built after Augustin Machado and his brother,
Ignacio, first obtained grazing rights to the rancho from Spain in
1819 and then, in 1839, became owners through a land grant issued by
Mexican authorities.</TE>
<TE>   During the 19th century the rancho was home to 20,000 cattle,
along with thousands of sheep and herds of horses that were raised
for use by gold miners and settlers in Northern California. The
rancho's lands stretched from the ocean and the Westchester bluffs
eastward to Baldwin Hills and north to what is now Pico Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   More than 40 Machado family members were born and raised in the
old ranch house over the years, according to Fred Machado, who lives
in Culver City: "My grandmother and grandfather had 12 children
there. As children grew up and married, they'd build a little house
near the ranch house. The families were close."</TE>
<TE>   Machado's father and five uncles trained in the attic of the ranch
house to become boxers. Between 1915 and 1930, they fought at boxing
stadiums around Los Angeles under the ring name "McManus" to conjure
up the image of tough, Irish bruisers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Partitioned into pieces that were traded or sold off, by the
mid-20th century, the ranch had shrunk to about 30 acres wedged
between the creek and what is now Playa Vista. The land was farmed
for celery and beans before it was subdivided for industrial use in
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   The old ranch house was burned down in the mid-'60s by children
playing with matches, Machado said. At the time of the fire, the room
that the "McManus Brothers" had trained in was still papered with
promotional boxing posters from their careers in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "The tree was the only thing left to designate where the ranch
was. We thought it would be saved as part of the sale of the ranch,"
Machado said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too late now. It's just a shame."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 2001 races for Los Angeles City Council and mayor, then-school
board member Caprice Young couldn't believe what she was hearing.</LD>
<LD>   The candidates portrayed L.A. schools and their leaders as
incompetent and helpless, and promised voters that they would "save
the schools." Didn't the politicians, she wondered, realize that they
had no direct authority over education?</LD>
<LD>   Now, more than a year later, Young said she has been pleasantly
surprised that "they've stopped the bashing and started the
partnership."</LD>
<TE>   From funding after-school programs to redesigning carpool drop-off
points, and from combating truancy to tearing down crack houses near
campuses, the city of Los Angeles is cooperating more than ever with
the Los Angeles Unified School District, an independent entity that
welcomes the help.</TE>
<TE>   "Those of us on the City Council are always being asked what we
can do about schools," said Councilwoman Janice Hahn, who heads the
council's first Education and Neighborhoods Committee. "The old
answer used to be, 'That's not our jurisdiction. That's the school
board's.' That's not the answer anymore."</TE>
<TE>   It seems logical that a city's government would look out for, if
not oversee, its schools. Mayors in New York, Chicago and other large
cities recently have made changes to give them more authority over
education. But in Los Angeles, that has not been the case
historically.</TE>
<TE>   The division between City Hall and the school district--which have
separate powers, budgets and leaders--has made for turf battles over
the years, Young said.</TE>
<TE>   The elections in the last year of a new mayor, city attorney and
enough first-timers to make up a majority of the City Council, plus
recent additions to the Board of Education and the superintendent of
schools office, have spurred this new partnership, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor James K. Hahn has appointed the city's first deputy mayor
for education, Barbara Sandoval, who is helping the school district
speed through its massive building campaign while urging the district
to design its sports fields and other campus features with
non-students in mind.</TE>
<TE>   "We're focused on this to maximize resources and leverage the
opportunities," Sandoval said. "It's time for a new way of doing
business."</TE>
<TE>   Just last week, City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo unveiled another
city-district cooperative effort: a program to discourage students
from ditching class by tracking and counseling habitual truants.</TE>
<TE>   Standing next to him at Mulholland Middle School in Van Nuys were
Young--now the Board of Education's president--and board members
Julie Korenstein and Mike Lansing. Also on hand was Supt. Roy Romer,
once an elected official himself (he was formerly governor of
Colorado).</TE>
<TE>   Romer has expanded the district's legislative lobbying office to
include a deputy in Los Angeles who works only with local government.
"I just think there's a lot more [to] gain if we focus upon mutual
collaboration," Romer said. "You do it because it's just such a
natural."</TE>
<TE>   No one is saying all politics have been put aside; the cooperation
is not always seamless. At Delgadillo's news conference last week,
school officials panicked when he gravely told a phalanx of TV
cameras that 100,000 students are absent each day--it's more like
50,000, the district said. Nevertheless, the city and the school
district cite numerous recent efforts--big and small--that indicate a
new relationship. They include:</TE>
<TE>   * Use of the city's Ethics Commission to administer a new ethics
program for the school district and those who lobby it.</TE>
<TE>   * Expansion of L.A.'s BEST, a 14-year-old program in which the
school district, city and private sector collaborate to provide
after-school tutoring and recreational activities for 18,000 students
at more than 100 schools.</TE>
<TE>   * Use of classrooms, auditoriums and athletic fields for
neighborhood meetings and activities.</TE>
<TE>   A cooperative, congenial relationship with the city is crucial if
the district is to plan and build 100 schools in coming years to
relieve crowded classrooms, district officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As L.A. Unified scours the city for suitable sites, often using
eminent domain to obtain property, district leaders said the support
of city politicians is essential.</TE>
<TE>   "Officially, the school district can go out and do whatever it
wants, but as we've seen from the past, that's also not a good way to
be a member of the community," said Glenn Gritzner, Romer's assistant
for local governmental affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Romer, the school board and city officials use the word
"community" to describe what public schools should be: centers of
learning for children, but also for people of all ages, for
recreation, health care and many other functions.</TE>
<TE>   Council members and other city leaders have no power to shake up
the curriculum or hire teachers, but they do have the authority to
improve just about everything up to the schoolhouse door.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling is that there is nothing that tells kids more directly
how much or how little we value them than the quality of their
surroundings," said Councilman Jack Weiss.</TE>
<TE>   At Sherman Oaks Elementary School in Weiss' district, the morning
drop-off used to be chaos as parents and children competed for the
road with commuters using a shortcut to work. Drivers sped, illegally
turned, illegally parked.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, Weiss' office worked with police and the school
to develop a new drop-off plan involving volunteers and more diligent
ticketing of offenders.</TE>
<TE>   That immediately solved the problems, said former Principal Tom
Stekol.</TE>
<TE>   "The little things are the big things in this regard," Young said.
"We're not out trumpeting some great strategic plan. We're just doing
it, and that's the way it should be done."</TE>

<CX>   School authority--A story in the California section Thursday about
cooperation between Los Angeles City Hall and the Los Angeles Unified
School District implied that the mayors of New York and Chicago used
their own authority to gain more control of their cities' education
systems. As in some other U.S. cities, both mayors strongly pushed
for such control, but their respective state legislatures awarded it
to them.</CX>

<HD>CHP Arrests Nick Nolte</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Actor Nick Nolte was arrested on suspicion of driving under the
influence Wednesday after the California Highway Patrol said he was
driving his 1992 Mercedes Benz erratically on Pacific Coast Highway
in Malibu.</LD>
<LD>   The 61-year-old actor, known for his Academy Award-nominated roles
in "Affliction" and "The Prince of Tides," was headed south near
Kanan Dume Road about 12:10 p.m. when CHP officers conducting an
unrelated traffic stop noticed the actor's sedan cutting off other
cars, swerving and crossing into a northbound lane, CHP Officer
Leland Tang said.</LD>
<LD>   After pulling the actor over and administering a field sobriety
test, officers determined that Nolte "was under the influence of
either drugs or alcohol," Tang said.</LD>
<TE>   CHP officials refused to comment on Nolte's blood-alcohol level at
the time of the arrest, citing their ongoing investigation. No drugs
were found on the actor, although he appeared to be "disoriented and
drooling, with drooping eyes," Tang said.</TE>
<TE>   As officers conducted their tests alongside the highway, a small
group of onlookers pulled over and took out cameras to capture the
incident on film, Tang said.</TE>
<TE>   Nolte was booked at the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department's Lost
Hills-Malibu station. He was released about 8:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>A Neighborhood Shares Dinner, Remembrances</HD>
<DH>Memorial: Residents of a Fountain Valley cul-de-sac gather
over a meal. 'Sitting at home wasn't the thing to do,' says one
participant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The roast ham came out of the oven at 1 p.m., and the roast beef went
in.</LD>
<LD>   On an ordinary American street, on a seemingly ordinary sunny day,
Cheridah Heckman, 74, and husband Victor, 75, prepared a sit-down
dinner Wednesday for 50 neighbors to commemorate the anniversary of
Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The Heckmans, who have lived on the quiet Fountain Valley
cul-de-sac since July 4, 1966, don't know anyone who died in the
attacks. But it seemed fitting to gather their community together--to
talk, to eat together and to say a silent prayer for those who died a
year ago and a continent away.</LD>
<TE>   "They gave their lives for their country that morning," said
Victor Heckman, a World War II Navy veteran. "They didn't know they
were going to when they woke up that day, but that's what they did."</TE>
<TE>   In a dining room lined with Norman Rockwell plates, the Heckmans
prepared the buffet table, gathering hand-embroidered red, white and
blue napkin rings and other decorations.</TE>
<TE>   "These are my peace doves," she said, pointing out two
papier-mache birds.</TE>
<TE>   Loss is not unfamiliar to people on Teal Circle. Her neighbor,
Ilse Van Don, is from Indonesia. Van Don told her of losing many male
relatives in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   To Cheridah, there is a simple solution to such terrors: cook, sew
or do both.</TE>
<TE>   "I told Ilse I really don't know how to make cole slaw exactly the
way she does, and asked her if she could make that for tonight," she
said. "She said sure."</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, Cheridah had just finished sewing an enormous red velvet
bedspread and was running to show it to another neighbor, when the
news came that President John F. Kennedy had been shot.</TE>
<TE>   She was 13 when Pearl Harbor was bombed. She heard that news on
the radio. Four of her brothers were at war within the year. When she
graduated from high school in 1948, she ran to catch a bus to Los
Angeles to meet her sweetheart, Victor. Within months, he too was at
war, a naval machinist stationed in Guam. He came home safely.</TE>
<TE>   Now, after 54 years of marriage, the Heckmans have seven children,
too many grandchildren to count, and two great-grandchildren--the
second of whom arrived in the early hours of this Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, they turned on the television, just as they
were doing a year ago when their regular morning show was interrupted
with news that a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so awful, all those people were dying. All those
firefighters," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She returned to setting up in earnest. She already had baked three
cakes--"red velvet" chocolate, spice and lemon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's her idea, and I support it completely. I'm the muscle," said
Victor while tidying the front lawn of their ranch-style home, where
two campers occupy the driveway, an ancient pickup graces the garage,
and a flag Cheridah hand-sewed in the same pattern as Betsy Ross'
hangs in a picture window.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, a mechanical gerbil on a side table warbled "I'm a Yankee
Doodle Dandy" when its paw was pressed, ready to entertain the
evening's younger guests.</TE>
<TE>   For the Heckmans, the silver lining of last year's tragedy has
been the effect it had on younger people. Cheridah said she loved
seeing children gathered on the corner excitedly shrieking "Light the
candles!" at dusk a day after last year's attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It reminds me of what kids used to do in the '40s," she said.</TE>
<TE>   For Victor, "the younger generations are viewing the American flag
as something positive now. They're beginning to understand what good
it represents."</TE>
<TE>   As evening fell, parents and their young children and seniors
piled plates high and gathered at candlelit tables in the street to
eat and reflect.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a national memorial day, and sitting at home wasn't the
thing to do--this is so special," family friend Kevin Goodling, 37,
of Costa Mesa said of the dinner.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think about her," he said, gesturing to his 2-year-old
daughter. "And about all the kids who don't have parents because of
what happened."</TE>
<TE>   Cheridah asked everyone to raise a glass. "This is to all of those
who died the day the World Trade towers fell," she said. "This day
should not be celebrated, but it should be remembered.... And because
each of you have so many religions, I'd like you to say your own
quiet prayer, or say it to somebody special."</TE>
<TE>   Everyone bowed their heads.</TE>

<HD>13 Teens Treated for Ritalin Ingestion</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thirteen Antelope Valley High School students were treated at a
hospital Wednesday after taking illicitly obtained Ritalin, and about
150 of the prescription-only pills were confiscated on campus,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Three became seriously ill from an overdose, officials said. The
others showed symptoms of grogginess or incoherence. All had been
released from Antelope Valley Hospital by evening.</LD>
<LD>   "They are all OK," Principal Mark Bryant said.</LD>
<TE>   Ritalin is given to hyperactive children to calm them down. Its
possession is illegal without a doctor's prescription, Sheriff's Sgt.
Patrick Atkins said. The Sheriff's Department launched an
investigation to determine who was distributing the pills on campus,
and criminal prosecution is possible, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The first student became ill and fell during a flag-lowering
ceremony in remembrance of the Sept. 11 tragedy. School officials
called an ambulance and learned from his classmates that he had taken
the pills. When two more students showed overdose symptoms of
grogginess and incoherence, Bryant got on the public address system.</TE>
<TE>   "We were imploring the students to come forward if they had taken
the pills," he said. "We just started hunting all these kids down."</TE>
<TE>   Eight students who had taken the pills but were not seriously ill
were taken to the hospital by ambulance as a precaution. Three others
who said they had taken the pills were released to their parents,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley Hospital spokesman Ed Callahan said by late
afternoon, 13 students had been treated.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant and police said they don't believe the drug-taking had
anything to do with the 9/11 anniversary. "There was nothing to
indicate that," the principal said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant said he believes one or two students may have been the
source of the pills. Wednesday's incident was the first he had heard
of the drug being illicitly passed around on campus, he said.</TE>

<HD>Democrats Endorse 2 Valley Candidates</HD>
<DH>Secession: Twenty of 111 hopefuls had sought the party's
nod.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Democratic Party has endorsed only two
candidates on the San Fernando Valley secession ballot, labeling the
others it interviewed unqualified to run a large city.</LD>
<LD>   About 20 of the 111 candidates for mayor and city council in the
proposed Valley city sought the county Democratic Central Committee's
backing, the party chairman said Wednesday. A Valley city would have
14 districts and a mayor.</LD>
<LD>   The committee voted Tuesday night to endorse Scott Svonkin of
Studio City in the 14th Council District and Ronald Clary of Canoga
Park in the 9th District. Clary is an attorney and Svonkin is chief
of staff to Assemblyman Paul Koretz (D-West Hollywood).</LD>
<TE>   "Out of the large number of candidates we interviewed, these two
were the only ones that rose to the level the Democratic Party would
judge to be competent and qualified to run the nation's sixth-largest
city," chairman Eric Bauman said.</TE>
<TE>   The committee did not endorse mayoral candidate Mel Wilson because
he did not arrange an interview. That surprised some because he is
considered the leading Democratic contender. Wilson said he still
hopes to get the endorsement.</TE>
<TE>   The party was in an odd position on the endorsements because it
has taken a stand against secession. It also opposes the Hollywood
secession measure on the same ballot and has declined to endorse any
of the candidates for a Hollywood city council.</TE>
<TE>   All the offices are nonpartisan.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Close, chairman of the Valley VOTE secession group, said
the Valley endorsements are a sign that Democratic officials believe
the breakaway proposal might pass and are hedging their bets. "They
did the right thing," Close said.</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the Valley Democratic Party is opposed to secession
and had refused to endorse any candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Svonkin said the county party's nod is "huge" for his campaign,
especially because few political groups have issued endorsements.</TE>
<TE>   Clary said the Democrats' backing "probably gives me some
credibility as a candidate."</TE>

<LD>Bells tolled and bagpipes wailed as people throughout Ventura County
paused Wednesday to remember those who died in the terrorist attacks
on the United States one year earlier.</LD>
<LD>   At schools, city halls and places of worship, residents paid
tribute to the fallen as they reflected on the troubling changes that
had swept through their lives since the carnage.</LD>
<LD>   People gathered at institutions that were touched by the attacks
both directly and indirectly.</LD>
<TE>   At Amgen, the Thousand Oaks biotech firm, hundreds of employees
fondly recalled Dora Menchaca, a company research scientist who died
when American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. At an
Oxnard middle school, students mourned passengers--youngsters who had
been excitedly anticipating a science field trip to Channel Islands
National Park--they had never met who were on the same jet with
Menchaca.</TE>
<TE>   Top county fire and law enforcement officials honored their
counterparts in New York with an observance at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library and Museum near Simi Valley. And in Ojai, a
memorial was held at an organization that provided 13 of the rescue
dogs that sniffed through the smoldering rubble of the World Trade
Center.</TE>
<TE>   In an outdoor ceremony at Amgen's headquarters in Newbury Park,
Chief Executive Kevin Sharer recounted to a throng of somber
employees the steps their company had taken to honor Menchaca, who
died at 45.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen is matching contributions to a college scholarship fund for
Menchaca's 5-year-old son, Jaryd. It has also donated $3 million to a
UCLA Medical Center oncology wing that will be named for Menchaca,
who earned her doctorate in epidemiology at the school.</TE>
<TE>   On Amgen's sprawling campus, a simple "area of reflection" was
unveiled--a grassy oval with a crepe myrtle tree, white iceberg roses
and a marker inscribed: "Dora Menchaca--scientist, mother, wife,
colleague, friend. Much admired, greatly missed."</TE>
<TE>   In December the space shuttle Endeavor flew 4.8 million miles with
an Amgen experiment, a tattered flag from the World Trade Center and
a medal Menchaca had won in the Los Angeles Marathon. Clad in his
blue NASA jumpsuit, astronaut Dom Gorie choked back tears as he
recalled that flight and spoke of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't even compare what we suffered with what Earl must feel a
year after the fact," he said, glancing at Menchaca's husband, Earl
Dorsey.</TE>
<TE>   A Santa Monica attorney, Dorsey thanked his wife's co-workers for
their support. He exhorted them to follow her example of "packing as
much as possible into every minute of every day."</TE>
<TE>   At Frank Intermediate School in Oxnard, students bearing flowers
trooped to a pair of 4-foot-high black, stone "towers" that had been
planted on campus as a memorial. One by one, the youngsters dropped
off a single rose, daisies picked on the way to school, a handful of
carnations dyed red, white and blue.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 11, 2001, three Washington, D.C., middle school students,
three teachers and two staff members from the National Geographic
Society were flying west to join students from Frank and other
schools on a science expedition to Santa Cruz Island.</TE>
<TE>   Their deaths jolted the campus. Students raised $1,000--one boy
donated his birthday money--and local businesses chipped in for the
stone towers and benches placed around them in the shape of a
pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Eighth-grader Veronica Ayala, 13, remembers crying as she watched
television interviews with the dead children's parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I didn't know them, they're still people just like
us," she said. "It just feels sad."</TE>
<TE>   In the packed courtyard of the Reagan library, nearly 650 people
applauded as a Ventura County sheriff's helicopter flew low,
displaying a big American flag.</TE>
<TE>   The county's top public safety officers--including Sheriff Bob
Brooks, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and county Fire Chief Bob
Roper--read from speeches by Reagan, Abraham Lincoln, John F.
Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr. and others.</TE>
<TE>   Their words comforted Kris Chatari, 46, a legal secretary from
Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   "We have never, ever forgotten what our country is about--and
that's freedom," she said. "We're going to face more trouble, but we
have to be united and stand tall."</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County Fire Chaplain Larry Modungo sounded the same theme.</TE>
<TE>   "Before 9/11 our nation was divided over a presidential election,"
he told the crowd. "On Sept. 11 our nation was attacked. Our feeling
of safety was destroyed....We became a nation united."</TE>
<TE>   In a memorial at the National Disaster Search Dog Foundation in
Ojai, tears mixed with barks and yelps as staff members struggled to
discover meaning in the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "What matters to me most is that we find the good that comes out
of it," Wilma Melville, the group's director, said. "If we can't, we
have to make the good that comes out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting around a table with black Labradors and golden retrievers
lolling at their feet, staff members recalled the day and its
aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   So many calls poured in from people eager to donate money, time or
their own animals that four new phone lines were installed.</TE>
<TE>   Debra Tosch, executive director of the foundation, tearfully
recalled all activity at ground zero ceasing whenever a body was
found. She remembered a firefighter breaking down as he hugged her
black lab Abby.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember just seeing that pain on their faces," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Staff writers Gregory W. Griggs, David Kelly and Jenifer Ragland
contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel:</LD>
<LD>   "Hey, Hootie: Three words, pay per view.</LD>
<LD>   " ... The natural answer to your problems at Augusta National is
to take the Masters tournament off 'free TV' after next year and
start producing it yourself on pay per view.</LD>
<TE>   "From your perspective, it's the natural solution. You are a
private club with select membership, so why not have a tournament
only seen on TV by a private audience willing to pay for the
privilege?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe you could even sell viewing rights to women, although I'm
not sure how that works."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Two players from the same Ivy League school were
winners of the Heisman Trophy in the mid-1930s. Who were they?</TE>
<TE>   Floor-man: Some random thoughts by Dave Kindred in the Sporting
News:</TE>
<TE>   * "The World Basketball Championship has proved two things. Our
guys don't care. And Vlade Divac can flop in two languages.</TE>
<TE>   * Bob Knight hammered a man's chest in anger. To settle a
resulting lawsuit, Knight paid $25,000. If this becomes a trend,
football coaches will go broke.</TE>
<TE>   * " 'The Old Farmer's Almanac' reports that several years ago U.S.
Senators William B. Spong Jr. and Hiram Fong could have sponsored a
bill recommending the ringing of church bells to hail the arrival in
Hong Kong of the U.S. table tennis team.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been the Spong-Fong Hong Kong Pingpong Ding-Dong
Bill."</TE>
<TE>   Thuggery survives: President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien met Monday and agreed on the need to fight terrorism around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Canadian leader stopped short on one key area," says
Richard Burkhard of LaughLine.com, "banning thugs from the National
Hockey League."</TE>
<TE>   Lock for the Rocks: "The Lions lost the opening game of the season
by 28 points," says Jay Leno. "I don't want to say things look bad
for the team, but the Rolling Stones are playing Detroit next week,
and they're a two-touchdown favorite."</TE>
<TE>   Car crazy: NASCAR owner Felix Sabates gave a vivid explanation for
why he no longer employs driver Robby Gordon: "He has a tremendous
amount of talent, but when he pulls the helmet over his head, he
knocks some sort of switch that makes him an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1970, USC opened the football season
by routing Alabama, 42-21, at Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't an omen for the rest of the season for the Trojans, who
had a 6-4-1 record.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back again: On this day in 1981, UCLA opened the season
with a 35-18 victory over Arizona at Tucson.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins had a 7-4-1 record that season.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: End Larry Kelley of Yale and halfback Clint Frank
of Yale in 1936 and 1937.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Richard Bortkevich, 26, son of Olympic gymnastics
legend Olga Korbut, pleaded guilty in Lawrenceville, Ga., to
counterfeiting charges. Police had discovered $20,000 of his phony
$100 bills.</TE>
<TE>   Says Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times: "Possible punishments
include, fittingly enough, a lot of parallel bars."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Beyond the Glory"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net, Sunday, 8 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   There is a lot more to Jim Kelly than being on the losing end of
four consecutive Super Bowls. The former Buffalo Bill quarterback and
his wife, Jill, discovered in 1997 that their son Hunter was
inflicted with the debilitating Krabbes disease. Hunter would bring
hope to others in his fight against the fatal inherited disorder of
the central and peripheral nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional story of Kelly, his son and their fighting spirit is
told in this excellent edition of "Beyond the Glory."</TE>
<TE>   Of Hunter, Kelly says, "My son, he'll never walk. He'll never
talk, He'll lose his sight. He won't be able to do what all the other
kids do. But he's going to be able to do greater things. He's going
to help other kids down the road. Through him, there will be
miracles."</TE>
<TE>   Jill Kelly says, "I'll talk to [Hunter] and tears will well up in
my eyes because he's so intense and he looks right through me with
those awesome eyes. There is nothing in this world that is more
precious than those times with him."</TE>
<TE>   Jill Kelly and others close to her husband, including his father,
three brothers, former teammates and former Bill coach Marv Levy, are
among those interviewed</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame this year, was born in a
small mining town in Pennsylvania to a coal miner father and a
homemaker mother. Kelly and his five brothers lived in humble
surroundings. His high school team had only 23 players but with Kelly
at quarterback the school won two state titles.</TE>
<TE>   He went to Miami and played two years in the old USFL before going
on to star for the Bills.</TE>

<KH>OSCAR DE LA HOYA VS. FERNANDO VARGAS Saturday at Mandalay Bay
Events Center. Pay-per-view, card begins at 6 p.m.</KH>
<HD>Basic Training</HD>
<DH>Mayweather Sr. has become the 'sergeant' De La Hoya wanted,
changing the fighter's style with old-school discipline</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The sparkle in his eyes outshone his flashy suits and diamond-studded
rings. The emotion in his voice conveyed more than all of his witty
poetry and crowd-pleasing hype.</LD>
<LD>   "The way we joke around and have fun, Oscar is like my son," said
Floyd Mayweather Sr. of Oscar De La Hoya, "even though we are
different races."</LD>
<LD>   And for Mayweather, that is the most satisfying part of the
unlikely relationship between this odd couple whose backgrounds are
so different. Mayweather is a loud, brash, in-your-face, African
American trainer who served five years in prison for drug dealing. De
La Hoya is a soft-spoken fighter of Mexican descent who avoids
confrontations and maintains his image as a positive role model by
heading a charitable foundation.</LD>
<TE>   Mayweather, 49, has a son of his own, Floyd Mayweather Jr., the
World Boxing Council lightweight champion. But their relationship has
been shattered by bitter differences over the young Mayweather's
behavior and career choices.</TE>
<TE>   "He will always be my son," said the elder Mayweather.</TE>
<TE>   But, he says, he has found the next best thing in De La Hoya. In
preparing his fighter for Saturday's 154-pound championship bout
against Fernando Vargas at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay Events Center,
Mayweather has toughened up De La Hoya's training regimen and
expanded his options in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "I've made him a 'blackexican,' " boasted Mayweather, saying he
has combined some of the techniques he sees more prevalent in black
fighters with De La Hoya's natural skills.</TE>
<TE>   As far as De La Hoya is concerned, this is the trainer he always
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He had a trainer who knew defense but didn't pay much attention to
offense.</TE>
<TE>   So Jesus Rivero was gone.</TE>
<TE>   He had a trainer who knew boxing but didn't care much for playing
politics.</TE>
<TE>   So Emanuel Steward was gone.</TE>
<TE>   He had a trainer who knew how to wrap hands but didn't know much
about strategy.</TE>
<TE>   So Robert Alcazar was gone.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an Olympic gold medal and titles in five weight classes,
De La Hoya never has found a consistent style nor developed total
confidence in the ring. That's largely because he has never had
stability in his corner. Each new trainer has had different ideas
about training camp, a different fight plan, a different philosophy.</TE>
<TE>   It all has been so confusing.</TE>
<TE>   Especially since the voice that mattered most to De La Hoya
belonged to his father, Joel, a former fighter. But Joel preferred to
stay in the background and let his feelings be known through
surrogates. So he brought in Alcazar, whom he had met when they
worked together in a factory, and made him his front man.</TE>
<TE>   When it became obvious the job was too big for Alcazar, other
trainers, starting with Rivero, were shuttled in to work with
Alcazar. Steward was, by far, the best of those, but he chafed at
operating without total authority.</TE>
<TE>   After De La Hoya suffered losses to both Felix Trinidad in 1999
and Shane Mosley in 2000, fights in which he displayed questionable
strategy, poor stamina and a failure to adjust to his opponents'
tactics, De La Hoya finally decided to get rid of Alcazar.</TE>
<TE>   "What I really need," said De La Hoya at the time, "is somebody to
push me.... I need like a sergeant who is going to tell me, 'You are
going to do this or I am out of here.' Somebody who is going to throw
a bucket of water in my face at 5 a.m. to wake me up to get me to
run. I need a Bob Knight in my training camp, somebody who is going
to be firm with me and will push me to the next level."</TE>
<TE>   Sounded as if he were looking for Mickey, the fictional trainer
played by Burgess Meredith in the "Rocky" movies who trained Rocky
Balboa by demanding that he chase live chickens and pound slabs of
beef in a meat locker.</TE>
<TE>   What De La Hoya got was a real-life facsimile in Mayweather, who
became his trainer in October 2000. Instead of sweating over
chickens, Mayweather worked the pounds off by making De La Hoya run
with weights around his ankles. Instead of pounding beef, De La Hoya
chopped wood. But the effect was the same.</TE>
<TE>   An old-school disciplinarian had taken command of De La Hoya's
camp. De La Hoya didn't need cold water splashed in his face. All he
needed was to hear Mayweather's raspy voice and he was up and
running.</TE>
<TE>   Before the younger Mayweather was even born, his father was an
established welterweight who fought, among others, Sugar Ray Leonard
in a 16-year ring career. Mayweather lost that fight and enough
others to deny him the chance for ring greatness that his son
possesses.</TE>
<TE>   But his biggest troubles came outside the ring. Mayweather entered
a federal prison in Milan, Mich., in 1993, removed from an active
role in his son's life as the younger Mayweather won a bronze medal
in the 1996 Olympics and then turned professional. The senior
Mayweather could only gaze through his prison bars and dream of the
day he and his son would be reunited in boxing, the family business.</TE>
<TE>   It was a sweet dream, but the reality was short-lived. When the
elder Mayweather was released, he eagerly anticipated grabbing the
reins of his son's career as both manager and trainer.</TE>
<TE>   But while the two Mayweathers were on the same page in terms of
the fighter-trainer relationship, they weren't even reading the same
book in terms of fighter-manager. The younger Mayweather fired his
father from the managerial position and replaced him with rap-music
producer James Prince.</TE>
<TE>   When HBO offered the younger Mayweather a six-fight deal worth
$12.75 million, he initially refused to sign, labeling the money
"slave wages." That infuriated his father.</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, the Mayweather split was complete. The younger Mayweather
kicked his father out the house he was paying for, repossessed his
car and found a new trainer.</TE>
<TE>   And Mayweather has found a new fighter in De La Hoya, whom he has
already trained for his last two fights, victories over Arturo Gatti
and Javier Castillejo last year.</TE>
<TE>   Along with cracking the whip in training and remaking De La Hoya's
ring philosophy and technique, Mayweather has become the court jester
of Team De La Hoya, dissipating the tension that once filled the
camp, a byproduct of the power struggle that ensued before Mayweather
was given total control.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather approaches the rigors of training with a zeal that is
infectious. And he spouts poetry like a poor man's Muhammad Ali,
taunting the opposition while keeping De La Hoya laughing at the
pointed barbs.</TE>
<TE>   Alcazar would appear at news conferences in traditional warmup
gear, make a standard prediction of victory and leave the heavy
lifting to De La Hoya in terms of verbally attacking the opponent.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's Mandalay Bay news conference for Saturday's title
fight, Mayweather stepped up to the microphone in a bright blue suit,
shoes to match, the ever-present gaudy rings, and proceeded to unfurl
a paper containing his latest poem.</TE>
<TE>   "You came here on vacation, but you're going home to probation,"
he told Vargas, who completed a sentence earlier this year on assault
charges.</TE>
<TE>   With Mayweather drawing the anger of the Vargas camp, De La Hoya
was free Tuesday to play the role of gentleman that suits his image,
complimenting Vargas and promising a competitive fight.</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather has taken steps to ensure it will be competitive.
Despite all his success, De La Hoya has basically been a one-armed
fighter, relying too much on his left jab and left hook. But
Mayweather has been focusing on far greater use of De La Hoya's right
hand. Mayweather is also teaching De La Hoya how to become a better
defensive fighter by rolling his shoulders and moving his body from
side to side, rather than backpedaling.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been a great inspiration and provided great motivation,"
De La Hoya said. "Without Floyd Mayweather, I probably wouldn't be
here."</TE>
<TE>   Mayweather, De La Hoya said, has been the wakeup call he was
searching for.</TE>
<TE>   "He gets me out of bed in the morning," De La Hoya said.
"Sometimes it's hard for me to train. Sometimes I ask myself, 'Why am
I doing this?' Floyd tells me, 'You got to win another world title.
You've got to beat the guys who beat you.' He knows how to talk to
me."</TE>
<TE>   While others cautioned Mayweather about stepping into a situation
that had sunk so many other trainers, Mayweather insists he wasn't
concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard all the stories about the other trainers," Mayweather
said, "but I never worried about that. I'm a trainer. Let me do my
job. If you don't let me do my job, see ya."</TE>

<HD>Operation Goes Well on Shaq Toe</HD>
<DH>Lakers: Center has already regained some range of motion,
but recovery time is still six to eight weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shaquille O'Neal came out of the fog early Wednesday morning, and
there were familiar faces at his hospital bedside, Laker officials
and O'Neal officials among them.</LD>
<LD>   He grinned crookedly and offered a crude gesture to them all, and
they laughed, because they knew then that he probably would be fine.</LD>
<LD>   The force behind three consecutive Laker championships and the
predominant reason the franchise expects a fourth, O'Neal woke up,
stood up and walked away from surgery on his arthritic big toe, the
minimum required for what his doctor later called a successful
procedure.</LD>
<TE>   Standing between buildings at UCLA Medical Center, Dr. Robert Mohr
said surgeons encountered nothing unexpected in the 45-minute surgery
that cleared bone spurs from the first joint of O'Neal's afflicted
right toe. The range of motion in the joint improved immediately and
significantly, Mohr said, and he predicted a recovery time of six to
eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   A six-week rehabilitation would have O'Neal ready a week before
the regular season begins. Eight weeks would have him sit out five
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything went extremely well today," Mohr said. "Surgery went
as scheduled, as planned.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, with the passage of time, Mother Nature and active
rehab, he should be back better than he was at the end of last
season."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal and the Lakers are banking on it.</TE>
<TE>   He sat out 10 games last season because of the ache in his toe,
and often lacked the mobility that, along with his unusual size and
strength, made him the NBA's dominant player. The pain soured his
mood and the anti-inflammatory medication soured his stomach, and he
was frustrated when his injury allowed lesser talents to stay with
his.</TE>
<TE>   His regular-season statistics fell beneath his career numbers,
but, drawn by the conclusion of the season and the lure of the
three-peat, O'Neal played his best basketball in the playoffs, and
was most valuable player of the NBA Finals for the third consecutive
year.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of a summer spent gathering medical opinions and
dismissing others, O'Neal was jovial when he arrived at UCLA Medical
Center at 7:15 Wednesday morning, according to his agent, Perry
Rogers.</TE>
<TE>   "He was in a great mood," Rogers said. "He was ready to get it
done. He was excited."</TE>
<TE>   Mohr, who before the procedure had said it would be difficult to
know exactly what the joint would require until surgery, found clean
cartilage--vital to an optimum recovery--and no unusual damage. In a
procedure called a cheilectomy, Mohr carved away bone spurs from the
top of the joint.</TE>
<TE>   "This type of procedure is probably the least troublesome,
complication-wise, and that's one of the reasons we chose it," he
said. "Plus, that's all that was indicated in his case. As far as a
track record, I don't think there are many people of Mr. O'Neal's
size and profession who have had this problem. But I don't anticipate
any trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Before the surgery, Mohr said, the joint allowed O'Neal about 30
degrees of movement.</TE>
<TE>   "You need about 60 to 80 degrees of motion for athletic activity,"
Mohr said. "When we freed up all the bone spurs and remodeled the
joint, we reestablished the availability of motion for him.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as the future, we're very confident he's going to have a
complete recovery. From what I've seen, I see no reason not to
continue with that belief."</TE>
<TE>   If the recovery proceeds as planned, O'Neal will begin a
rehabilitation program in two weeks or sooner, when he will be
allowed to ride a stationary bike. Mohr predicted O'Neal would run in
about six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "And then," Mohr said, "get back in action as soon as he can after
that."</TE>
<TE>   Mohr had arrived at the news conference surrounded by those
closest to O'Neal--business manager Mike Parris, bodyguard Jerome
Crawford and agent Rogers. Also, Laker Coach Phil Jackson and General
Manager Mitch Kupchak had visited O'Neal in the recovery room.</TE>
<TE>   Kupchak admitted he has mulled the impossible--replacing O'Neal,
even for a brief period early in the season. Samaki Walker had
capable moments at center last season, and the club could bring to
training camp the likes of Ike Austin or Duane Causwell, depending on
their play in this week's tryout camp.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when the news seemed so favorable on a sunny morning in
Westwood, that seemed far away.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're all relieved," Kupchak said. "When the doctor came
out with a smile, there was a great deal of relief."</TE>

<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>If John Robinson's Nevada Las Vegas football team defeats Oregon
State on Saturday, it will be the 200th victory in his
professional/college career.</LD>
<LD>   It's not going to happen, of course, so I stopped by his office
Wednesday to tell him so. I see no reason to treat him any
differently than Pete Carroll and Bob Toledo.</LD>
<LD>   The Rebels are 16-point underdogs to Oregon State in Corvallis so
Robinson's 200th victory probably will come a week from Saturday at
Toledo, and I'll be out of town by then, so I wanted to give him his
due for his 130th career loss this week, and his 200th victory next
week.</LD>
<TE>   "The Oregon State game will be on TV. When we win, look for me on
the field--I'll have a personal signal just for you," Robinson said,
and apparently once a Trojan always a Trojan, because I get that
signal a lot from folks at USC.</TE>
<TE>   I found that comforting, of course, that there is still a link
between Robinson and USC, and while I always thought Trojan fans were
supposed to hold two fingers high in the air as a salute, I guess one
finger is some kind of secret code between Tommy Trojan groupies when
the media is around.</TE>
<TE>   "I love USC," Robinson said. "Mike Garrett? He and I aren't
friends, but that happens. When they fire your butt at The Times, you
won't be friends with the guy who fires you either."</TE>
<TE>   For all I know, Sports Editor Bill Dwyre has already tried to fire
me, but I haven't gotten the message, because I know better than to
check my answering machine.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, it was Garrett's voice on the answering machine," when the
USC athletic director left word Robinson had been fired, "but that
was a long time ago, somewhere between Gettysburg and the first World
War," Robinson said. You know, around Dwyre's birthday.</TE>
<TE>   When was the last time Robinson talked to Garrett? "Before I was
fired," he said, and he wasn't complaining.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A YEAR AGO USC snubbed Robinson and did not invite him to join his
1976 Trojan football team for the school's annual Salute to Troy
picnic. A number of his former players were upset and let the
school's administration know about it. Someone apparently got Garrett
a book on good etiquette over the last year or mailed an invitation
to Robinson this year without his knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   The word at USC was that Robinson never responded, and since
President Steven Sample and Garrett don't return calls, he was only
following their example.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what happened," Robinson said. "Next year they will
honor our championship team, so I will try to go."</TE>
<TE>   I would imagine Garrett would probably want to plan that Las Vegas
vacation for that weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE REBELS ARE 1-1 this year, and 16-21 in Robinson's fourth year
trying to resurrect a downtrodden program. As upbeat as always, he
said he's all about moving forward, and at 67, he's all about moving
forward.</TE>
<TE>   "In the whole course of things I wasn't right on everything and
[Garrett] wasn't wrong on everything," Robinson said, and when I
asked if this was the politician in him speaking, he said, "Yeah, it
is. But the jerk in me doesn't last real long. All that negative crud
just messes you up, and if you're negative about an incident like the
one that happened to me, it clouds your judgment for the whole
school."</TE>
<TE>   Robinson said he looks for the USC scores every week. "And I find
myself rooting for them," he said, "which is different from the first
couple of years after I left, when I found myself rooting against
them. I wanted them to lose to prove they were wrong for getting rid
of me. Now how silly was that?"</TE>
<TE>   There isn't a hint of bitterness about Robinson, his office here
decorated with many Trojan memories, including a cardinal-and-gold
shot of Ronnie Lott. He said he has the friendships from those
wonderful USC days, and beyond that, "once you're gone--parade or
kicked out the door--you're gone."</TE>
<TE>   "But once a Trojan, always a Trojan," he said. "I went to the Marv
Goux tribute on campus recently and heard the band, and oh my God, it
sounded great. I've always liked 'Conquest,' and when I was coaching
and you heard it, you knew the game was over and you had a win, the
horse would run by and we probably had just beaten Notre Dame's sorry
behinds."</TE>
<TE>   Now that little wiseacre crack about Notre Dame was for my benefit
because I believe his 8-3-1 mark against the Irish is enough to
condemn to the depths of you know where, and told him so. But he said
he has worked for Georgia Frontiere, Garrett and Al Davis, and so he
already knows: "I'm going to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HE IS NOW the only Division I-A football coach in the country who
is also the school's athletic director, and his contract calls for
him to coach at least three more years. "I'm still scared to death
every week," he said. The thrill of competition still has a grip on
him.</TE>
<TE>   Spend 90 minutes with him, and it's the best entertainment in a
town that is dedicated to providing nothing else. He can take the
teasing, dish it out and is loaded with perspective, although someone
else might describe it differently. They love him here and he'll
never beat Notre Dame again. Or Oregon State, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST WORD comes in an e-mail from Vince Aleman:</TE>
<TE>   "Why has The Times sent you to cover a fight you can't relate to
in the slightest? These men are literally putting their lives on the
line for our entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   I can relate to that; I've gone to Sparks' games for your
entertainment.</TE>

<HD>Baffert Closes With a Field Day</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer, with five entries in eight-horse
Futurity, takes top four spots as Del Mar meet concludes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>Trainer Bob Baffert not only had the best horse in the Del Mar
Futurity, he had the best four horses.</LD>
<LD>   Running an unprecedented five horses in the eight-horse
meet-ending stake Wednesday, Baffert won the $250,000 race with
Icecoldbeeratreds, and following the winner across the line were
Kafwain, Chief Planner and Friendly Mike, who also come from the
Baffert barn. Baffert's other starter, Bull Market, went off the 5-2
favorite and ran sixth.</LD>
<LD>   Icecoldbeeratreds, owned by Mike Pegram and ridden by David
Flores, gave Baffert his seventh Futurity victory in a row. He hasn't
been beaten in the stake since Future Quest won in 1995 and Baffert's
Cavonnier finished third. Baffert's first Futurity winner, Silver
Charm, won the 1996 Futurity and in 1997 won the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness.</LD>
<TE>   On the first Sept. 11 anniversary, Del Mar made two observances.
Before the races, there was a helicopter flyover, a raising of the
flag to half-staff and 15 jockeys dressed in red-white-and-blue silks
standing in the winner's circle for the singing of the national
anthem by Jeff Ewert, a Chula Vista fireman.</TE>
<TE>   Later, between races, a giant flag was unfurled before the crowd
of 14,921 by dozens of firefighters and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   They were joined by a special detachment of their counterparts
from New York, where terrorists struck a year ago. The flag, 100 by
50 yards, covered an area from the sixteenth pole to the finish line,
and from the outer rail to the tote board.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other closing-day stakes at Del Mar, D'wildcat, after Devine
Wind was disqualified for interference in the stretch, won the
$76,425 Live The Dream Handicap and Palmarola beat Fancee Bargain by
half a length in the $75,000 California Equine Retirement Foundation
Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With telephone and internet betting available for the first time
at Del Mar, averaging more than $584,000 a day, the meet ended with
an overall $12.1 million daily average, a 2% increase over last year.
The on-track daily attendance averaged 15,518, an increase of less
than 1%. The on-track handle averaged $2.2 million, a drop of about
1%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magic Weisner, recovering from the West Nile virus, will be
returned to his barn at Laurel Park today.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarians say the 3-year-old gelding's recovery prospects are
good and they believe that the horse could race again.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Weisner ran second in the Preakness, was fourth in the
Belmont and won the Ohio Derby.</TE>

<LD>It took the anniversary of the tragic events of last Sept. 11 to do
it, but there was no news Wednesday in the dispute involving Augusta
National Golf Club and the National Council of Women's Organizations.</LD>
<LD>   A recorded message at the NCWO said there would be no comment
about the Masters issue--through Saturday--out of respect for the
families affected by the terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   At Augusta National, a spokesman said that club Chairman William
W. "Hootie" Johnson was not available for comment.</LD>
<TE>   The silence won't last. Presumably, after a respectful pause, the
issue of whether the women's group can force Augusta National to
invite a female member will flare up again.</TE>
<TE>   Martha Burk, head of the 160-group women's organization, has taken
aim at CBS to attempt to dissuade the network from televising the
Masters, but CBS representatives have already said the network will
take no action.</TE>
<TE>   And insiders at Augusta National, who would not comment on the
record, said it is certain that neither will Augusta National
officials, at least not before the tournament in April.</TE>
<TE>   So what we're left with is an unresolved dispute that won't go
away.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to sympathize with the hard-line stand at Augusta
National that seems to portray the club as helplessly out of touch.
Legal issues are fine, but this is a moral issue.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, such a time-consuming and expensive campaign,
the success of which would enable a woman of obvious privilege to pay
a hefty membership fee to join an exclusive club, seems to run
contrary to the common interests of thousands of women with their
legitimate, daily concerns in the workplace--not the country club.</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   Publicity Stunt</TE>
<TE>   You have to love the early publicity for next week's Solheim Cup,
the women's version of the Ryder Cup. Catrin Nilsmark of Sweden, who
isn't even on the team, got the ball rolling when she was quoted in a
story for a Swedish Web site saying Laura Diaz "has a cocky
attitude," calling Cristie Kerr "a little brat" and saying Michele
Redman "has no talent."</TE>
<TE>   When questioned about her comments, Nilsmark amended one of them,
or at least expanded on it. She says what she actually said was that
Redman had done well, despite having no talent.</TE>
<TE>   If you add it up, this is the most commotion Nilsmark has caused
on the tour since she made a stir by playing in hot pants. There's a
chance there will be more: Nilsmark is the European team captain for
the 2003 matches in Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   Stay tuned.</TE>
<TE>   A Gilder Cage</TE>
<TE>   It has been called life's mulligan, and the Senior PGA Tour is
clearly that if you use Bob Gilder as an example. He won six
tournaments in a 24-year career on the regular tour, the last one 19
years ago. But Gilder, 51, won twice as a senior last year and four
times this year--three of them in playoffs. No one has done that in
11 years.</TE>
<TE>   How did he do it? Gilder is first in total birdies and sixth in
putting, the combination of which vaulting him to second on the money
list with $1.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   Winning Time</TE>
<TE>   Four months after his death, Sam Snead won another tournament.</TE>
<TE>   That's sort of how it has turned out after the PGA Tour Policy
Board approved a rule change that counts victories in the British
Open as "official" victories.</TE>
<TE>   Snead, who died in May, won the 1946 British Open, but it was
never added to his total number of victories because winning the
British Open was not recognized as an official PGA Tour victory until
1995. Now, Snead has 82.</TE>
<TE>   Other big winners: Jack Nicklaus 73 victories (1966, 1970, 1978
British Opens); Tom Watson, 39 (1975, 1977, 1980, 1982, 1983); Arnold
Palmer, 62 (1961, 1962); Gary Player, 24 (1959, 1968, 1974), and Greg
Norman, 20 (1986, 1993).</TE>
<TE>   Ben Hogan, who died in 1997, now has 63 official victories, with
his 1953 British Open victory at Carnoustie added.</TE>
<TE>   Thank-Uh Vera Much</TE>
<TE>   News item: John Daly is helping design two golf courses in Memphis
that will make up sort of an Elvis Presley memorial golf complex,
called "Elvis Presley Ranch."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: One of the greens will be in the shape of a deep-fried
peanut butter and jelly sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Canada</TE>
<TE>   News item: The good news is that 17 Canadians were in the field
for last week's Canadian Open at Angus Glen.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: That's also the bad news. No Canadian has won the
Canadian Open since 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Taunts R Us</TE>
<TE>   The countdown continues to the Ryder Cup, which is two weeks away.
David Duval, among others, figures something is missing, though. That
would seem to be rampant animosity, which is usually a staple of the
U.S.-Europe golf confrontation, but apparently now relegated to a
lesser status.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, ill will is a factor that might have been taken out of
the equation since the event was postponed for a year because of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Said Duval: "I think it's going to be easier for everybody because
there hasn't been as much hype. There hasn't been any name-calling."</TE>
<TE>   In the interest of promoting a healthy environment, it's time to
change all that.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some healthy taunting suggestions for both sides, but
still entirely suitable for the occasion:</TE>
<TE>   For Colin Montgomerie: "Hey, have you put on a few pounds or are
you hiding some haggis in your sweater?"</TE>
<TE>   For Tiger Woods: "Butch is coaching me now, baby."</TE>
<TE>   For Sergio Garcia: "Hurry up, will you? I've got to go to work
tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   For Phil Mickelson: "What's the over-under on sundown?"</TE>
<TE>   For Phillip Price: "Nick and Vincent can hit it better than you."</TE>
<TE>   For Stewart Cink: "You should have stayed where you're more
comfortable--in the kitchen."</TE>
<TE>   All right, now you know, so don't be surprised if you hear any of
this repeated.</TE>
<TE>   Tournament Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: The Air Canada Championship in Vancouver already has
640 volunteers signed up for the 2003 event.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Thus exceeding the number of title sponsors by 640. At
least the Air Canada event is not alone. There are as many as five
PGA Tour events (Phoenix, Miami, Hilton Head, S.C., Hartford, Conn.,
Las Vegas) that are without title sponsors for next year.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder Cup Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: Published reports in Europe say that Jesper Parnevik is
considering pulling out of the Ryder Cup because he's playing so
poorly.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Really? Interesting, because you can't do that.</TE>
<TE>   Tuning In</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's questionable that anyone can be declared the
winner in this increasingly ugly matter, but how about the television
viewers of the Masters who won't have to endure a single commercial?
John Markon of the Richmond Times-Dispatch in Virginia thinks it's a
concept that should be carried to other televised sporting events.</TE>
<TE>   Said Markon: "Baseball games could be shortened by about an hour.
It would be possible to view an entire World Series, Stanley Cup or
NBA Finals without knowing every word of every ad by the end of Game
2."</TE>
<TE>   Money News</TE>
<TE>   News item: Pro Tour Memorabilia announces the issuance of a new
licensed World Golf Hall of Fame Raymond Floyd silver coin.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Floyd can add it to his own coin collection, which
includes the first nickel he ever made.</TE>
<TE>   Birdies, Bogeys, Pars</TE>
<TE>   Andy Carey, Mitch Gaylord and Dr. Sammy Lee are some of the
celebrities expected to take part in the Byron Scott and American
Happenings celebrity tournament that will be played Sept. 14 at Aliso
Creek Inn Golf Course in Laguna Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The event benefits Parkinson's disease research. Details: (760)
632-7770.</TE>
<TE>   The LPGA event in Tucson has a new name for 2003: The
Welch's/Circle K becomes the Welch's Fry's Championship.</TE>

<LD>Fairfax quarterback Thomas Herringshaw, who threw for 2,618 yards and
20 touchdowns last season, will not return to the team.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Shane Cox said he spoke on Tuesday to Herringshaw's father,
who informed Cox that his son would not play. Cox said the father was
concerned his son would get injured.</LD>
<LD>   "The family felt that it was not in their son's best interests to
play football," Cox said. "They wanted him to concentrate on other
things."</LD>
<TE>   Cox said the senior continues to receive recruiting letters and
that he doesn't understand the decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel absolutely horrible for Thomas," Cox said. "He's a
wonderful kid. He deserves to play, but we have to respect the wishes
of the parents."</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Troy Jackson will start for the Lions at Sepulveda
Monroe on Friday night.</TE>

<TE>   Bobby Brimmer, who guided the L.A. Ribet Academy boys' basketball
team to the Southern Section Division V-AA finals in his first year
as coach, has been fired because of his players' academic
shortcomings, Ribet Chief Executive Ronald Sires said.</TE>
<TE>   "Academics are first, athletics are second," Sires said. "Mr.
Brimmer never understood that."</TE>
<TE>   Brimmer, who coached the Fighting Frogs during the summer and had
signed a contract for the upcoming season, said he was shocked by his
dismissal and would try to force the school to pay his coaching
salary. Sires said the school does not have to pay Brimmer because he
violated the contract "by not adhering to our principles."</TE>
<TE>   Dan Alon, the Ribet girls' basketball coach last season and the
boys' coach three years ago, has been selected to replace Brimmer.</TE>

play for a school team for the first time this season at Carson High.</TE>
<TE>   Matias, 17, who had been enrolled in a Mission Viejo-based
independent-studies program the last three years, is currently No. 3
in Southern California and No. 24 in the girls' 18 national rankings.</TE>

<TE>   High hopes for the Granada Hills girls' tennis team's upcoming
season took a double blow when its top two players recently decided
not to compete.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica Nguyen, the City Section singles runner-up as a freshman
last season, is not attending Granada Hills and will enroll in a
home-schooling program instead, according to Coach Ron Wood. Junior
Christine Dao is attending school but will concentrate on academics
and junior tournament play, Wood said.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: Defending champion Brea and the division's 1999
champion, La Verne Bonita, are in Division VI. The 2000 division
champion, West Covina South Hills, is in Division VII. Last year,
section runner-up Buena Park won its first playoff game in 45 years,
and the Coyotes should be hungry to continue their success. They're
more athletic than last season's team, and that's a good start.
Pomona moved into the Valle Vista League from the Miramonte, where it
faced powers Charter Oak and Los Altos. Though Northview remains the
Valle Vista favorite, Pomona could become a player.</TE>

Brea at Tustin.</TE>
<TE>   The scoop: The combined record last season for the six teams in
the realigned Century League was 42-21-2, including Tustin's three
forfeit losses. Orange Lutheran, runner-up the last two seasons to
Ventura St. Bonaventure in Division XI, is 10-4-1 against schools in
Division VII or higher, beginning with a 1996 victory over La Mirada.
The Lancers also won four consecutive Olympic League titles before
being switched to the Empire League. From 1999 through last season,
seven teams in the division have won section titles.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: The departure of the Miramonte League to Division VI
opens the playoff door. Charter Oak and Los Altos, both from the
Miramonte League, played in the division final for three consecutive
seasons. Santa Fe was a Division VII semifinalist last year and with
the return of running back Adam Sandoval, appears primed for a title
run. Arroyo, a longtime Mission Valley League power that finished
second in the league last season, returns 17 starters, including
all-league running back Anthony Olivas. Montebello, Bell Gardens,
Alhambra and Schurr will battle for the Almont League title and
whichever team emerges should challenge in the playoffs.</TE>

Diamond Ranch vs. West Covina South Hills at Covina District Stadium;
Oct. 4, Sultana at Victor Valley; Nov. 1, Serrano at Sultana; Nov.
15, La Quinta at Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   The scoop: Kaiser, in only its second varsity season, advanced to
the division final but lost to La Quinta, 21-10. The Cats return six
starters on offense, including 6-foot-3, 215-pound running back Allen
Wade, and six on defense, led by 6-4, 230-pound lineman Kyle
Musselman. La Quinta, which will be trying for its third consecutive
division title, graduated one of the region's top athletes in
tailback/defensive back Frederick Collins, but Joe Jiannoni is
expected to take over as the team leader. Another top player is Palm
Desert's Joe Johnson, a Palm Springs transfer. Serrano will be trying
for its fourth consecutive Mojave River title. Diamond Ranch, which
returns 15 starters from its inaugural varsity team, makes its debut
in the Mt. Baldy League.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: Last year's champion, Santa Monica, division runner-up
North Torrance and the rest of the Ocean League have moved to
Division IV, and traditional powers Bishop Amat and Loyola have gone
on to Division I. With St. Paul moved out of the Del Rey League to
the Mission, and with former Los Padres League powers Paso Robles and
Atascadero now in Division IV, the Pioneer and Montview leagues gain
prominence. Temple City, a Division X quarterfinalist a year ago, is
the division's preseason favorite. South Torrance, Culver City and El
Segundo all return top skill-position players.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: Paraclete won its fourth consecutive Division XII
title--and section-record fifth championship in a row--last season.
But the Spirits lost three NCAA Division I players to graduation and
are tabbed to finish behind Montclair Prep and Cerritos Valley
Christian in the new Olympic League. Carpinteria has 16 returning
starters, including quarterback Aaron Gonzales, who last year ran for
900 yards and threw for 1,100. St. Monica returns 17 starters,
including all-league linebacker Andrew Ramirez.</TE>

<TE>   The scoop: Division teams are breathing a sigh of relief because
four-time defending champion Paraclete has moved back to Division XI,
but the addition of the Christian and Desert Mountain leagues won't
make things any easier. Arrowhead Christian won the Division XIII
title last season, defeating Mammoth in the final. Arrowhead
Christian, which has been to section finals in five of the last six
years and won three of them, has 10 starters returning and is the
division favorite. Mammoth returns 12 starters and adds several key
players from a 10-0 junior varsity team. High Desert League power
Mojave has the experience edge with 30 returning lettermen.</TE>

Hall, the top-ranked team and the only remaining semifinalist from
last year. They are likely to be challenged by several contenders,
including Academy League members Capistrano Valley Christian and

<DL></DL>
<LD>Until last season, when Lakewood Mayfair beat Suburban League rival
La Mirada for the Division VI football championship, a team from the
Sea View League had won a Southern Section title in nine consecutive
seasons.</LD>
<LD>   With the section realigning leagues and divisional playoff
groupings, the Sea View League and Division VI are unlikely to see a
trend of that magnitude.</LD>
<LD>   Moving into the division will be the Miramonte League--which
includes Division VII champion Covina Charter Oak and runner-up
Hacienda Heights Los Altos, the 1999-2000 Division VII winner--and
the Century and Empire leagues have been revamped and strengthened.
Gone is the weakling of the division, the Golden West League.</LD>
<TE>   "It's loaded," said Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley, whose team
won section titles in 1994 and '99 as a Sea View representative but
lost to La Mirada in overtime in a semifinal last season after giving
up a game-tying field goal at the end of regulation. "Across the
board, this is the most competitive division in the Southern
Section."</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the mix:</TE>
<TE>   * Tustin, the strongest program from the Golden West, will join
the Century League, along with Orange League power Brea Olinda, the
unbeaten Division IX champion last season, and Placentia El Dorado.
Santa Ana Foothill, a Division VI semifinalist last season, has moved
from the Century to the Sea View. Gone from the Century and the
division are Orange and Santa Ana Valley.</TE>
<TE>   * Two-time Division XI runner-up Orange Lutheran moves to the
Empire League, along with Placentia Valencia, to challenge
traditional powers La Palma Kennedy and Anaheim Loara as well as
Cypress and Anaheim Katella. Gone from the league and the division is
Santa Ana Century.</TE>
<TE>   * The Miramonte lost Diamond Ranch and Pomona but got Valle Vista
League member La Verne Bonita, the 1999 Division IX champion. It
becomes a five-team league, and coupled with the maturity of Hacienda
Heights Wilson, it should be stronger than last season.</TE>
<TE>   * Including Sea View teams, the division has seven schools that
won eight championships in the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "You go Division I, Division II, and I think the next-best
division is Division VI," Los Altos Coach Greg Gano said. "It's a
tough division.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, we stumbled and could have lost in the first round to
[San Gabriel] Gabrielino--our kids took some teams for granted--but
if we do that this year, we'll get blown out of the water. I think
that's where the difference is, the early rounds. You'll have people
that can beat you."</TE>
<TE>   Rob Wigod, the section's assistant commissioner in charge of
football, said enrollment, competitive equity and geography played
into the realignment, but he knows he put together a terrific
division.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a real mix, a confluence of different issues," Wigod
said. "Brea is an outstanding program, Orange Lutheran has been
successful at a [lower] level. You have the Division VII guys, plus
the Division VI guys, and last year you had the Suburban League teams
playing for the title.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunities and possibilities in this new Division VI are
going to be very interesting to play out."</TE>
<TE>   The championship game will also be played at Edison Field for the
first time, largely because the division has had good attendance for
title games in the past. Whatever championship matchup there is this
season should be worthy of the venue.</TE>
<TE>   Bonita wasn't the only Valle Vista League team to move into a new
league. West Covina South Hills, the 2000 Division IX champion, was
moved into the San Antonio League and placed in Division VII. That
had Coach Steve Bogan breathing a sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be some great playoff games in that division
early on," Bogan said of Division VI. "Anybody who's honest knows
Division VI is loaded and would be glad to be in a different
division."</TE>

<LD>SOUTHERN SECTION</LD>
<LD>   No. 25 Compton Dominguez (0-0) vs. No. 24 Anaheim Esperanza (0-0)
at Valencia High, 7 tonight</LD>
<LD>   Esperanza missed the playoffs last season for the first time since
1988 and finished with a losing record (4-5-1) for the first time in
16 years. Shaun Wildenstein, a 1,000-yard rusher last season, returns
for the Aztecs, whose strong offensive line is led by Chris Boblit.
Defensive linemen Gabe Long is also a standout. Anthony Wheat will
take over at quarterback for Justin Wyatt, who now plays cornerback
for USC. Wheat is one of the top free safeties in the region. Lionel
Larry, who won the 100 and 200 meters at the Division II track finals
last season as a sophomore, is one of the top newcomers.</LD>
<TE>   Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 8 Newhall Hart (0-0) vs. No. 2 Los Alamitos (0-0), Long Beach
Veterans Stadium, 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   These teams have ridden similar high-powered offenses to become
two of the premier programs in Southern California over the last 12
years. Since 1990, Hart is 135-23 and has won five Southern Section
championships, including the last four in Division III. Over the same
span, Los Alamitos is 128-22-2 and has three section titles. Neither
team has missed the playoffs during that span. Los Alamitos, with 12
returning starters and three key transfers, is loaded on offense with
mobile quarterback Jeff Kline and receiver Brandon Tripp, among the
best in the nation. Hart looks to junior quarterback Sean Norton to
run the offense and will likely use running back Paxton Howard a bit
more than usual as Norton adjusts to varsity competition.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 San Clemente (0-0) vs. No. 5 Huntington Beach Edison (0-1),
Huntington Beach High, 7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Edison got off to a rough start last week against Honolulu Lolani,
surrendering 28 unanswered second-half points in a 34-20 loss. Games
against Santa Ana Mater Dei and Anaheim Servite follow. Edison's
Tommy Grady, one of the top quarterbacks in Southern California,
threw two touchdown passes but had two other passes intercepted.
Senior Andy Avila gained 100 yards rushing for the Chargers in an
impressive debut. Senior quarterback Beau Budde, San Clemente's
career passing leader, and senior wide receiver Chris Miller, who
could break the school's receiving record this season, lead the
Tritons.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CITY SECTION</TE>
<TE>   No. 10 Woodland Hills Taft (0-0) at L.A. Crenshaw (0-0), 3 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   The Toreadors may enter the season as the City Section favorite,
but they open with a stiff test against a team that has its sights
set on playing in December. The teams met twice last year with
Crenshaw winning, 21-14, in the season opener and Taft winning,
38-28, in the section semifinals. Taft's Steve Smith needs 76
receptions this season to move into the national top 10 for a career.
Quarterback Cary Dove gets his first chance at improving on a
3,264-yard, 32-touchdown season. Crenshaw, always tough to defeat at
home, is led by running back Daymeion Hughes and defensive lineman
Brandon Mebane, a Division I prospect.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey (0-0) at Sylmar (0-0),</TE>
<TE>   7 p.m., Friday</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey is the defending City Section champion, but the Dons go
into the year having to prove they are worthy champions. These two
perennially strong teams like to keep things simple--they run the
ball and play sound defense. Sylmar will look to control the line of
scrimmage with a veteran offensive line led by 305-pound tackle Louis
Solis. Running behind that line will be tailbacks Ryan Carew and
James Pringle. Trying to stop them will be linebackers Jerome Johnson
and Demetrius Jones, the leaders of the Dorsey defense. Longtime
Coach Paul Knox is four victories shy of 150 for his career.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INTERSECTIONAL</TE>
<TE>   No. 15 Long Beach Jordan (0-0) at No. 18 Carson (0-0), 7 p.m.,
Friday</TE>
<TE>   Carson has won 10 City Section championships and should be in the
hunt for another one. The Colts have size with 6-foot-2, 300-pound
defensive tackle Matthew Malele, one of the top recruits on the West
Coast. The Colts also have a strong offensive line and a number of
dependable running backs. Jordan, a Southern Section Division I team,
is coming off one of its best seasons. The Panthers gave Poly a scare
last season in a Moore League game and nearly upset Mater Dei before
losing, 12-7, in the first round of the playoffs. The Panthers have
size up front with 6-7, 375-sophomore Morgan Roseborough and two
other linemen over 290 pounds. Carson defeated Jordan last season,
29-19.</TE>

<HD>Heisman Winner Crouch Will Retire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Crouch, the Heisman Trophy winner last year for Nebraska who
tried to make the switch from quarterback to receiver with the St.
Louis Rams, has decided to retire.</LD>
<LD>   "I have given this a lot of thought," Crouch said in a statement
released Wednesday night. "This decision was tough and not something
I took lightly."</LD>
<LD>   Ram Coach Mike Martz said Wednesday night that Crouch, the team's
third-round pick, informed him of his decision last Friday. Crouch
did not make the trip to Denver for the regular-season opener Sunday
and has not practiced with the team since then. Martz has closed
practices for the first three weeks of the season, and the Rams had
not made an announcement.</LD>
<TE>   A day before leaving the team, Crouch gave no indication he was
leaning toward quitting, although he expressed some frustration with
his status on the team.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what reporters were missing in the closed practices, he
said: "You're missing me run all the scout team plays, that's what
you're missing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta Falcon cornerback Ray Buchanan was suspended for four
games for using steroids despite insisting he took them by mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "Evidently, I took a supplement of some sort that had a steroid
derivative in it," Buchanan said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "Either way, it was my mistake, and I will serve my penalty. I
would like to apologize to my teammates, the Falcons' organization
and the Atlanta Falcons' fans. I will learn from this."</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan, 30, will sit out more games during the suspension than
he has his previous nine seasons. He has played 81 games in a row
since signing with the Falcons in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Seahawk quarterback Trent Dilfer returned to practice and
expects to be ready for Sunday's home opener against the Arizona
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer, who sprained his right knee during Seattle's exhibition
opener Aug. 10, took the majority of snaps instead of backup Matt
Hasselbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Hasselbeck started against Oakland on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Bear safety Damon Moore has been suspended for four games
for violating the league's substance-abuse policy.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, acquired in the off-season as a free agent after playing
three seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, had been on the Bears'
injured list. He tore a knee ligament in the NFC championship game in
January.</TE>
<TE>   Moore told the Chicago Sun-Times his suspension resulted from a
failed drug test taken in February.</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not take steroids, but he declined to specify what
drug the test detected.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati receiver Danny Farmer severely sprained a ligament in
his left knee during practice and will be out for at least three
weeks.... Tennessee Titan running back Robert Holcombe cracked his
left hip at the joint and will be out at least four weeks. Holcombe
was hurt just before halftime of the Titans' 27-24 victory over the
Eagles on Sunday when he was hit after catching a pass.</TE>

<AU>BOB OATES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Of the players I've watched in 66 years of writing about football,
Johnny Unitas, who died Wednesday at 69, was the best all-around
quarterback and the smartest signal-caller as well as the closest
thing to self-made of any of pro football's 216 Hall of Famers and--
above all--the toughest athlete.</LD>
<LD>   As another Hall of Famer, Merlin Olsen, said one day several years
ago when we were talking about Unitas and the role of courage in
competitive sports: "He's the bravest man I've known in football."</LD>
<LD>   Hardly huge for an NFL star, Unitas, who stood 6 feet 1 and
weighed 195 pounds, played many games over many years against Olsen,
a 6-5 defensive tackle who usually weighed at least 275.</LD>
<TE>   Both excelled in their specialties, passing and pass-rushing, yet
neither ever feared the other. Said Olsen: "Out of the corner of his
eye, Unitas may see you coming, and I swear that when he does, he
holds that ball a split second longer than he really needs to--just
to let you know he isn't afraid of any man. Then he throws it on the
button."</TE>
<TE>   On the button indeed. Or shoe-level if that seemed better. Or high
or wide--whatever worked. As a passer, Unitas wasn't the best of the
NFL's many quarterbacks, past or present--the best was Joe Namath,
I'd say, with Sammy Baugh next--but no passer has ever surpassed
Unitas in feel for getting the ball away and getting it wherever it
had to be for a completion.</TE>
<TE>   It was his passionate interest in completions regardless of any
adversity--any troubles such as unexpected double coverage or the
kill-the-quarterback rush of Deacon Jones and Olsen--that led Unitas
to invent a pass that was to become a game-plan staple everywhere in
the league then and now: the so-called comebacker.</TE>
<TE>   Jones and Olsen played side by side on the defensive line of the
Los Angeles Rams the year that Unitas, the leader of the two-time
NFL-champion Baltimore Colts, came up with the comebacker. There are
sports fans who, when they see it today, still say, "That pass was
underthrown." And when Unitas first threw one to a wide receiver
sprinting backward instead of forward, everybody thought the ball was
underthrown, including every opposing coach and player. As he
reported later, Unitas, who also invented, among other passes, the
so-called fade, was simply hunting for a place where Hall of Fame
teammate Raymond Berry could get the ball in something like peace,
away from the choking coverage he saw in every game.</TE>
<TE>   A wide receiver, Berry, like Unitas, also was self-made. But even
if you're annoyingly nearsighted and painfully crooked-backed, as
Berry was, it's easier to make yourself into a respectable receiver
than an NFL passer.</TE>
<TE>   "No position in any sport is remotely as hard to play," Olsen
said. "NFL quarterbacks are the greatest athletes in America."</TE>
<TE>   The first NFL game Unitas played was an exhibition in Portland,
Ore., where he wasn't much. His first employers, the Pittsburgh
Steelers, rated him so low on the scale of what they wanted that they
cut him.</TE>
<TE>   I was there that summer night in Portland, and I remember that the
Rams who had faced him weren't impressed and weren't surprised to
hear he was gone. In any case, Ram management didn't pick him up, or
even consider it. And, saddening him, no other team would touch him
either.</TE>
<TE>   Unitas alone saw Unitas as an All-Pro quarterback. And he joined a
sandlot team that year to learn it, the only Hall of Famer who ever
did. He spent his first postgraduate season after leaving Louisville
playing games on the bottom rungs of the football ladder.</TE>
<TE>   In 1956, however, the Colts found themselves out of quarterbacks.
And they needed one more than they needed their pride as a team that
would never scour the sandlots for a passer, and by then Unitas had
learned to throw spirals.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Unitas nor Baltimore ever regretted their union. He played
there from 1956 to 1972, and when the Colts didn't want him anymore,
he caught on with the San Diego Chargers.</TE>
<TE>   In Charger scrimmages he reminded some people not of the Unitas
who had played in four NFL championship games, Super Bowls III and V
among them, but of the sandlot Unitas.</TE>
<TE>   He was then 40, but he wouldn't quit. They had to throw him out.
That spirit, that unwavering perseverance, is what made him what he
was. What's so admirable about hitting a home run one day and
retiring the next, as Ted Williams did? Ending one's career
prematurely is the worst way to go, and Unitas wouldn't think of it.</TE>
<TE>   What he thought about instead, in an era when players and not
coaches called the plays, was how to improve his signal-calling and
so compensate for advancing age or anything else. Increasingly
throughout his 18 NFL years, in truth, the question about Unitas was
whether he was winning with his arm or his head. Some of us rank him
as the wisest strategist the NFL had, player or coach, before Bill
Walsh built the San Francisco 49er club that won a record five Super
Bowls.</TE>
<TE>   And it was harder for Unitas to call good plays than Walsh. Before
and after every call, Unitas got knocked around, interrupting his
concentration, you'd think. But it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   As Merlin Olsen said long ago: "The thing that gives Unitas his
concentration is his courage."</TE>

<DH>UCLA's Perry eager to put injuries aside as he seeks to
fulfill potential</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Road trip.</LD>
<LD>   You'll understand if Tab Perry hopes this one doesn't last as long
as his last one.</LD>
<LD>   He spent six uncomfortable nights at Pullman Memorial Hospital
last November with a partially collapsed lung and broken ribs after
being hurt in the Bruins' loss to Washington State.</LD>
<TE>   Groggy from pain medication, with his parents at his bedside,
Perry greeted an unusual parade of visitors.</TE>
<TE>   There was Washington State Coach Mike Price.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a real good guy, a real good coach," Perry said. "He brought
me McDonald's one morning."</TE>
<TE>   Said Price: "An Egg McMuffin. I'd try to be there and cheer him
up. We tried to get him all decked out in Cougar gear, but we wanted
to make him as comfortable as possible."</TE>
<TE>   There were others.</TE>
<TE>   "Marcus Trufant, the one that hit me, he came by," Perry said.
"[Lamont] Thompson, the guy who had four interceptions. Jason Gesser,
the quarterback. A linebacker.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time I was in and out, all the drugs and everything.
But I get hurt, and a lot of their guys come by. It was just
reassuring. They let me know that I'm not in this by myself."</TE>
<TE>   He is back among his own now, ready to depart with the rest of the
Bruins for Stillwater, Okla., to play Oklahoma State on Saturday in
UCLA's first road game of 2002. This time, he plans on coming home
with the team.</TE>
<TE>   The vague lack of ease that accompanied Perry onto the field at
the end of last season is gone.</TE>
<TE>   Though he returned after three weeks to play in the last game
against Arizona State, he didn't catch a pass, playing with a cracked
rib while wearing a quarterback's rib guard.</TE>
<TE>   "Going across the middle, it made me think about it a little, like
I hope I don't get hit and get hurt. I tried to get over that real
fast," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week in the victory over Colorado State, he had two
receptions for 43 yards--including the 15-yarder that gave the Bruins
a first and goal at the five-yard line to set up the go-ahead
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "That first play of the Colorado State game I had to go across the
middle. I got popped pretty hard," Perry said. "Nothing hurt, so I
was like, 'Come on, it's on.' "</TE>
<TE>   Now the supremely confident junior is eager to make good on the
potential evident in his 6-foot-3, 220-pound NFL receiver's body and
his skills as a kick returner.</TE>
<TE>   Despite not having a catch over the last three games last season,
he led UCLA with 416 receiving yards in only 21 catches--a 19.8
average.</TE>
<TE>   After waiting for his turn behind Freddie Mitchell and Brian
Poli-Dixon, Perry rededicated himself during workouts this summer at
home in Northern California. Now he has a chance to become a star.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he could be as good as anyone we've had," receiver coach
Ron Caragher said. "Whatever you would look for in body type for a
receiver, he's probably got it: size, speed, strength, athleticism,
jumping ability, hand-eye coordination."</TE>
<TE>   Ambition? Perry has that too.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perfect world, if I could have it my way, I'd have 70
catches, about 1,500 yards, like 19 touchdowns," said Perry, listing
numbers that would put him among UCLA's top five single-season
leaders in every category.</TE>
<TE>   "That'd be perfect, but I know it's not going to be like that....
Next year, it's going to be like that."</TE>
<TE>   The confidence shouldn't be surprising. After all, he wears No. 1
on his jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't wear that number if you're not confident," Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Caragher sees self-assurance but not cockiness.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a confident individual, not boisterous like one or two of
the guys we've had before," Caragher said. "He's confident and knows
he can compete against a lot of people and be successful. That's
important."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Perry's confidence put him in hot water last week when he
told a reporter he didn't think UCLA would have any trouble with
Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo let him know during a team meeting to tone down
the bulletin-board material.</TE>
<TE>   "He was saying, 'Keep your mouth shut. If that's what you think,
that's fine. But we don't need that attention--especially with all
the stuff that's going on,' " Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   "After the meeting, a couple of people asked me about it and said,
'Is that what you said?'</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'I'm not going to lie to you, that's what I said: I don't
think they're very good and I think we're going to beat the ... out
of them.' "</TE>
<TE>   The final score says so, 30-19. But Perry didn't like all that he
saw.</TE>
<TE>   "How should I say this? We just weren't executing," he said.
"There were a lot of plays we really messed up.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a couple of young guys, so there might have been jitters.
We just overcame that with athletic ability. They might have done the
wrong thing, but they made up for it by making the big play.</TE>
<TE>   "A little bit of our timing was off on the passing game. That
might have been a little bit of jitters too.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't really say anything about the coaching, but I know there
was a couple of times where--nah, I'm not going to say anything. I'll
leave that one alone. It was a little chaotic on the sidelines, I'll
say that, the personnel, some little incidents. Nothing too serious."</TE>
<TE>   Tiptoeing out of that minefield, Perry said he's still, well,
confident, in the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as we keep progressing as the season goes on, I think
we'll be fine," he said. "I think we'll be really good.</TE>
<TE>   "If we stay the same or slip just a little bit, I think better
teams are going to capitalize--especially when we get into the
Pac-10."</TE>
<TE>   Perry won't see his friends from Washington State again until the
last game of the regular season Dec. 7.</TE>
<TE>   This time it will be on his turf. But the memories will be there.</TE>
<TE>   "When it first happened, I knew something was wrong," he said. "I
got hit, and I felt my rib break. I just couldn't breathe. I started
coughing, and I started coughing up blood. That's when they were
like, 'Let's call the ambulance.'</TE>
<TE>   "I was never scared at all. I was mad. Mad that I fumbled. Mad
that I wasn't going to finish the game, because it was a close game
when I got hurt. And then I was mad when I found out we lost the
game."</TE>
<TE>   By the time he got back to Los Angeles the Friday after the
Washington State game, UCLA had started to lose the season too,
caught in the swirl surrounding DeShaun Foster's violation of NCAA
extra-benefit rules by driving an expensive SUV that belonged to a
Hollywood director.</TE>
<TE>   "The DeShaun thing was a real shocker," Perry said. "I came back
and it was like, 'Yeah, did you hear about DeShaun?' "</TE>
<TE>   Foster didn't play again, and UCLA lost to Oregon and USC before
defeating Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   "Just being on the sideline, watching us lose games that were so
close, I was thinking I could have contributed just a little bit,"
Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was real rough. I've never been a team leader or anything. I'm
kind of the quiet guy that sits in the back and just does my part.
But it was real hard watching everything basically just go down the
drain."</TE>
<TE>   This season, Perry's doing all he can to make this season
different.</TE>

<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Byron Moreno, the controversial referee from Ecuador who added 13
minutes of injury time in a Sunday match between Barcelona of
Guayaquil and Liga de Quito that enabled Liga to score two late goals
to pull out a win, has received a 20-game suspension.</LD>
<LD>   Moreno is also under investigation by Ecuador's soccer authorities
and could face a lifetime ban.</LD>
<LD>   Barcelona President Leonardo Bohrer claimed that Moreno was mixing
politics and soccer in the match since Moreno is a candidate in
October elections for a spot on the Quito City Council.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not ethical for him to continue being a referee, especially
in a province in which he is a candidate," Bohrer told Reuters. "The
supporters of Liga de Quito are voters in his province."</TE>
<TE>   Bohrer also claimed that the refereeing commission was unhappy
with Moreno's match report, in which he allegedly gave false
information on the minutes in which Liga scored its two late goals.</TE>
<TE>   Moreno also sent off two players and caused confusion by first
awarding a goal and then disallowing it during the match.</TE>
<TE>   He signaled six minutes of injury time but played 13, during which
Liga scored twice--in the 99th and 101st minutes--to get the 4-3 win.</TE>
<TE>   The Ecuadorean Football Federation Web site announced that Moreno
had admitted an error and that "it's human to make mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time this summer that Moreno has been embroiled
in controversy.</TE>
<TE>   At the World Cup, Moreno issued a red card to Italian striker
Francesco Totti and disallowed what would have been a game-winning
goal by Damiano Tommasi in Italy's eventual 2-1 tournament-ending
loss to co-host South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Talks</TE>
<TE>   Argentine Carlos Bianchi, coach of Boca Juniors, has reportedly
met with Mexican Soccer Federation President Alberto de la Torre to
discuss the Mexican national team job.</TE>
<TE>   Other candidates to be mentioned prominently in the Mexican press
include local favorite Hugo Sanchez, who is coaching Pumas in the
Mexican league.</TE>
<TE>   Bianchi has coached in France (Reims, Niza and Paris), Italy
(Roma) and Argentina (Velez, Sarsfield and Boca Juniors) and has won
Copa Libertadores titles in 1994, 2000 and 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican officials plan on filling the position, left vacant when
Javier Aguirre left to take over Spain's Club Atletico Osasuna,
within two months.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez Ban Reduced</TE>
<TE>   Mexico defender Rafael Marquez had his four-game suspension
reduced to three games by the FIFA Appeal Committee on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Marquez had been suspended from national team games after earning
a red card for head-butting Cobi Jones in Mexico's 2-0 loss to the
United States at the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   FIFA also upheld the six-month ban on Tunisia's Skander Souayah,
who was suspended April 22 for doping.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz Sacked</TE>
<TE>   Villareal Coach Victor Munoz was fired Wednesday, a day after his
Spanish first-division team's embarrassing 2-1 loss to third-division
Hercules in the first round of the King's Cup.</TE>

<AU>JOHN STEADMAN</AU>
<BD>BALTIMORE SUN</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Editor's note: Baltimore Sun columnist John Steadman, a Red Smith
Award winner for major contributions to sports journalism and the
voice of Baltimore, died Jan. 1, 2001. This column first appeared
Dec. 12, 1999.</LD>
<LD>   It'll soon be 40 years and John Unitas has hardly been challenged,
meaning the unapproached record of throwing a touchdown pass in 47
consecutive games. A mark that seems sacrosanct, almost indelible as
his exclusive property. Hundreds of quarterbacks have tried to reach
the same, magic number but have yet to generate even an idle threat.</LD>
<LD>   Unitas is alone--47 straight games putting a passing touchdown on
the scoreboard. An individual distinction. He never set out to create
such havoc for rival defenses. His inherent, God-given ability
allowed him to do what no other quarterback has done in the 80-year
history of the NFL.</LD>
<TE>   The latest to charge Unitas' achievement is Peyton Manning of the
Indianapolis Colts, who has accounted for a scoring pass in 25
consecutive games. He'll have to nearly double what he has done so
far if he's to pass Unitas. Does Unitas believe his record will be
tied or exceeded? "It wouldn't surprise me," he said. "Peyton Manning
is a logical threat. Teams now play four more games in the schedule.
Quarterbacks also throw a lot more, like 40 to 50 passes a game."</TE>
<TE>   The celebrated ball was taken out of play during the game in Los
Angeles and presented to Unitas as a memento. But he has no idea
where it is. "I guess some kids got it from me. I always thought a
football was to be played with, not looked at."</TE>
<TE>   Before Manning [whose streak would end at 27 games] got in the
throwing contest with Unitas, others made a brief volley but never
got there, specifically Dan Marino, who reached 30 and stopped, and
Dave Krieg, with 28 successive games before he slammed into the wall.
Others took, in the past four decades, their best shots and failed,
such as Chris Chandler, Daryle Lamonica, Frank Ryan, Sonny Jurgensen,
Warren Moon, Jeff Blake and Dan Fouts.</TE>
<TE>   Yet they never seriously approached Unitas, who four times led the
NFL in passing and became an incredible play-caller, beating the
clock in pressurized situations and displaying a physical durability
that earned the lasting respect of teammates and rivals. The mark of
47 straight games recording a passing touchdown is the
attention-getter and provides enduring credibility to his
marksmanship.</TE>
<TE>   Some interesting ironies evolve from a study of Unitas' record,
especially what might be called the Los Angeles factor. It was
against the Rams at the Coliseum in 1956 that he started the streak;
then two years later he surpassed the previous NFL mark of 22
straight games, held by Cecil Isbell. In 1960, again in Los Angeles,
what began four years before came to an end. Strangely enough, all
three games were losses for the Colts.</TE>
<TE>   A box score of touchdown receptions during the extended string
shows Raymond Berry with 38; Lenny Moore, 27; Jim Mutscheller, 24;
Alan "the Horse" Ameche, four; L.G. "Long Gone" Dupre and Alex
Hawkins, three; and Jerry Richardson, two. The longest pass play was
an 82-yard completion to Moore in San Francisco in 1957, and the
shortest, for one yard, on two occasions in 1960 went to Hawkins,
first in Green Bay and later in Baltimore against the same team.</TE>
<TE>   On the day Unitas moved past the former Packer passer, we
interviewed Isbell regarding Unitas by telephone at the Milwaukee
Athletic Club. "He's a fine fellow, a real good person and I'm happy
for him," Isbell said without any hint of regret. Then he paused and
added, "Tell him I hope he leaves that short one for me," meaning a
four-inch toss from Isbell to Don Hutson in 1942 that became the
shortest scoring pass in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   The league later decided to remove the "shortest touchdown pass"
category from the listings, so Isbell was deprived by the
statisticians. Among the witnesses in the immense crowd of 100,202 in
Los Angeles when Unitas passed Isbell was the Hall of Fame leader of
the Packers, Earl "Curly" Lambeau, who was Isbell's coach throughout
his career in Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for a critique of the young Colts quarterback, Lambeau said:
"Quite a thing for Unitas in only his third season as a professional
quarterback to do something like this. I understand Cecil Isbell said
he was happy that as fine a kid as Unitas came along to do the job. I
must say I feel the same way."</TE>
<TE>   During the streak, Unitas hit on 713 passes in 1,336 attempts for
10,827 yards, had 103 touchdown tosses, 62 interceptions and a
completion average of 53.4%. His average yards were 230.3 a game. In
1958, after he returned from the casualty list, giving way to backup
George Shaw, he was to carry the Colts to their 23-17 championship
win over the New York Giants, and Unitas was voted the most valuable
player.</TE>
<TE>   The baseball batting record of Joe DiMaggio, who hit safely in 56
straight games for the New York Yankees in 1941, is frequently cited
for comparison with Unitas. Or maybe it's vice versa. Yet the
differences between the two sports must be considered. Baseball is
played every day, but football kicks off once a week during a shorter
season. One is a passive sport; the other involves all-out physical
contact. Had DiMaggio missed a game because of illness or injury, his
streak would have stopped. In football the rule is different, and
rightly so.</TE>
<TE>   A painful injury caused Unitas to miss two games in 1958. The
Colts routed the Packers, 56-0, and a defensive back, John Symank,
jumped on Unitas after he was on the ground, puncturing a lung and
damaging his ribs. Doctors refused to let him play for two weeks.
Then, fitted with a protective jacket under his jersey, Unitas
returned to beat the Rams, 34-7, while throwing touchdown shots to
Moore, for 58 yards, on his first pass attempt and a 12-yarder to
Mutscheller.</TE>
<TE>   There were times during the streak when he threw multiple
touchdown passes, on seven occasions as many as four in a game.
Perhaps the closest he came to having the streak end was in Game 40
at Green Bay, a 35-21 loss to the Packers.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't connect until 70 seconds were left, pitching to Hawkins
for the final score.</TE>
<TE>   While Unitas was putting up his amazing total of 47 in a row,
there was little attention brought to what he was doing. The country
had become aware of his rich natural ability, but there was only
casual mention of how, game after game, he was firing touchdown
passes.</TE>
<TE>   After he kept the skein alive in Green Bay, he was asked how
important it was to maintain the touchdown consistency, adding to the
count each Sunday. "Records don't mean a thing to me," Unitas said.
"Nothing is as important as winning. You go into a game to win as a
team and not set records. I imagine if I was record-hungry, the thing
wouldn't have been extended this far. It makes no difference to me
when it stops."</TE>
<TE>   Now the question: Will "47" be duplicated or surpassed? It's
impossible to say it's never going to happen, because records,
regardless of who sets them, have a way of being surpassed. John
Unitas' football immortality, in truth, isn't based on numbers,
regardless of what happens to "47" and those amazing touchdown totals
he put together.</TE>

<HD>War Emblem Sold, Will Stand at Stud in Japan</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>DEL MAR</DL>
<LD>In a deal estimated between $17 million and $18 million, this year's
Kentucky Derby winner, War Emblem, has been sold to the same Japanese
breeding farm that stood another Derby winner, Sunday Silence, before
his death last month.</LD>
<LD>   Shadai Stallion Stud, owned by the Yoshida family, will stand War
Emblem next year, at a mating fee of $66,000 a mare. War Emblem, who
also won the Preakness before his Triple Crown bid ended with an
eighth-place finish in the Belmont Stakes, will run for the last time
in the $4-million Breeders' Cup Classic at Arlington Park on Oct. 26.</LD>
<LD>   Ahmed bin Salman, a Saudi Arabian prince, bought 90% of War Emblem
from the colt's breeder, Russell Reineman, less than three weeks
before the Derby. The prince died in July and the heirs to his
Thoroughbred Corp. have indicated that there will be a downsizing of
the international stable.</LD>
<TE>   After the Triple Crown, War Emblem ran in two million-dollar
races, winning the Haskell at Monmouth Park and finishing sixth in
the Pacific Classic at Del Mar. His overall record is seven wins in
12 starts, with purses of $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem is the first Derby winner since Sunday Silence, who won
the race in 1989, to go directly to stud in Japan. Other Derby
winners, including Chateaugay, Kauai King, Majestic Prince and
Ferdinand, wound up at stud in Japan after first standing in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Silence became Japan's premier stallion, his progeny
winning 75 stakes and earning $322 million.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So desperate to try avoiding another loss, Bret Boone ignored one of
the basic rules of baserunning. And it cost the Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<LD>   After Boone's baserunning blunder kept Seattle from scoring in the
top of the ninth despite two doubles, Todd Greene led off the bottom
of the inning with a homer and the Texas Rangers dealt another blow
to the Mariners' playoff chances with a 4-3 victory Wednesday night
at Arlington, Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Boone led off the ninth with a double but got only to third on
Carlos Guillen's hit off the left-field wall. Left fielder Todd
Hollandsworth, who knew Guillen's hit was over his head, held up his
glove like he had a play. Instead of going halfway, Boone went back
to second to tag up, expecting to go to third after the catch.</LD>
<TE>   "I was sure he was going to catch it, but in that situation
there's no excuse," Boone said. "I know you go halfway. I got greedy,
and I screwed up. I'm not going to say we lost because of that play,
but that play was big and I know better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Boone was then thrown out at home on a suicide squeeze try when
Jose Offerman struck out against Francisco Cordero (2-0).</TE>
<TE>   After sweeping a three-game series at Kansas City, the Mariners
have lost the first three games in the four-game series to the
last-place Rangers. The Mariners trail the Angels by six games in the
American League wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's getting down to the nitty gritty, and we can't do this,"
Boone said. "The trip started off great, and now we've lost three in
a row. There's no die in this team, but this is not good at this
stage."</TE>
<TE>   Greene hit a 2-and-2 pitch from Arthur Rhodes (8-4) down the
left-field line for his seventh homer.</TE>
<TE>   Greene had pinch-hit in the eighth inning for catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, who struck out three times to end a 13-game hitting
streak. He left because of a bruised right leg.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Rodriguez hit his major league-leading 54th homer and rookie
Hank Blalock also homered for the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   New York 5, Baltimore 4--Nick Johnson hit a game-winning single
with two out in the 11th inning on an emotional night at Yankee
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Yankees dedicated a monument in Monument Park
to the "victims and heroes" of Sept. 11. The ceremony included
saxophonist Branford Marsalis playing "Taps"--a moment that brought
tears from some among the 35,183 in attendance, including Yankee
Manager Joe Torre.</TE>
<TE>   Once the ceremonies were over, Yankee Stadium returned to business
as usual. The groundskeepers cavorted as usual to "YMCA" as they
dragged the basepaths after the fifth inning, and fans rocked to
"Cotton Eye Joe" in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The loudest cheers came when Torre was ejected in the ninth inning
after Robin Ventura was ejected by plate umpire Angel Hernandez for
arguing a called third strike.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees reduced their magic number to nine for clinching their
fifth consecutive AL East title. The Orioles have lost 17 of their
last 18.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 8, Detroit 2--The Twins backed Brad Radke (8-4) with a
six-run second inning at Minneapolis and lowered their magic number
for clinching the AL Central to three.</TE>
<TE>   Cristian Guzman had a homer and three runs batted in, and Torii
Hunter hit a three-run double to highlight the second-inning outburst
against former teammate Mark Redman (8-15).</TE>
<TE>   George Lombard and Carlos Pena each homered for Detroit, which has
lost 12 of 14.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins, who improved to 41-19 within the division, begin a
four-game series today at Cleveland, which clinched the division last
year by beating the Twins at Jacobs Field.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 6, Tampa Bay 3--Pedro Martinez rejoined the Red Sox
rotation and got his 150th career win, and Manny Ramirez hit his 15th
career grand slam.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (18-4), sidelined since Aug. 28 because of a sore left
groin and hip, gave up three runs and seven hits in six innings at
St. Petersburg, Fla. He struck out eight and walked two.</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez hit 29th homer, and third in as many games, during a
five-run fifth against Paul Wilson (6-10).</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 9, Chicago 6--Mike Sweeney hit a three-run homer, and
Brandon Berger and Carlos Beltran each hit two-run shots at Kansas
City, Mo., where the Royals ended an eight-game skid.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was the first this month for the Royals and enabled
them to avert a team-record ninth consecutive home loss.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 6, Cleveland 5--Vernon Wells hit a sacrifice fly in the
top of the 11th inning and the Blue Jays completed a sweep of the
three-game series at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Scott Cassidy (1-4) pitched 1 1/3 hitless innings to earn
his first career victory in 55 appearances.</TE>

<HD>Angels Move One Game Out of First</HD>
<DH>Baseball: They beat Athletics, 6-5, and can forge tie for
the lead in AL West with another victory tonight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a day of somber remembrance of the terrorist attacks that changed
the world a year ago, the Angels gave their appreciative fans many
reasons to celebrate.</LD>
<LD>   In what felt like a massive and mutual healing session, the Angels
rallied for a 6-5 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Wednesday at
Edison Field and ended a day of sorrow with cheers and smiles. Shawn
Wooten's two-out double in the seventh inning scored Garret Anderson
and Scott Spiezio with the tying and winning runs, and the Angel
bullpen did its job admirably in closing out the team's 12th triumph
in 13 games.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels moved within one game of the division-leading
A's--creating a first-place showdown tonight in their series
finale--and increased their lead over Seattle to six games in what is
supposed to be a race for the wild-card berth. The Angels' magic
number to clinch their first playoff berth since 1986 is 12: Any
combination of Angel victories and Seattle losses equaling 12 will
put the Angels in postseason play.</LD>
<TE>   Seattle hasn't gained ground on the Angels for 16 consecutive
days, since Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   The paid crowd of 34,302, which was bolstered by about 8,000
complimentary tickets received through a season-ticket exchange
program, delighted in watching the Angels pound Oakland pitchers for
14 hits. Fans waved American flags, star-spangled bandanas and
patriotic placards, glad of a joyous event on a day that will be
linked with tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "That was awesome--a packed house," Wooten said. "It seemed like a
playoff game. I've never been in one, but I assume that's what it
would be like."</TE>
<TE>   Said Angel Manager Mike Scioscia: "Woot is a guy we wanted to give
a few more at-bats. It's a good time for him to step up. He really
gave us a big lift."</TE>
<TE>   The A's had won 23 of their previous 25 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel bullpen worked 4 2/3 innings and did not allow a hit.
Scot Shields (4-3) relieved John Lackey and pitched 2 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We were able to put a lot of pressure on them every inning and
our bullpen came through again," Scioscia said. "We earned every
piece of that."</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival pitched the ninth for his 37th save.</TE>
<TE>   "The fans really pulled me through that last inning," Percival
said. "I was running on vapor. They gave me a little extra."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey worked out of a jam in the first but was tagged for four
runs in the third inning, all with two out.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hatteberg singled to right, and Miguel Tejada lined a
3-and-2 pitch into the gap in right-center. Hatteberg slid home
barely ahead of the throw, while Tejada took third.</TE>
<TE>   Lackey got two quick strikes on Eric Chavez, but the Oakland third
baseman battled back with a single to right, scoring Tejada. Chavez
trotted home on Jermaine Dye's 19th home run of the season, a blast
into the family section in left field.</TE>
<TE>   Cory Lidle faltered in the fourth, and the Angels pounced. While
fans created a blizzard effect by waving the Sept. 11 commemorative
T-shirts they had received, the Angels scored four runs, tying the
score and earning a spontaneous standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Fullmer began the surge with a double to center. Spiezio sent
him home with an opposite-field single to left. Wooten followed with
a double to center, sending Spiezio to third. Spiezio scored on
Bengie Molina's sacrifice fly to deep center, on which Wooten tagged
and went to third.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kennedy then looped the ball into short left, off the glove
of the diving Tejada. Wooten scored, and Kennedy ended up at second.
Kennedy advanced to third on a wild pitch with David Eckstein at bat,
and he scored when Eckstein tapped a perfect bunt up the third-base
line.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd roared as Eckstein returned to the dugout and was
greeted by high-fives from his jubilant teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Their joy was dampened in the fifth inning, when Oakland pushed a
run across to regain the lead, 5-4.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Durham walked, stole second and moved to third on Hatteberg's
grounder to the right side. He scored on Tejada's single to left, a
milestone hit for the Oakland shortstop. It was Tejada's 187th hit of
the season, tying the Oakland Athletics' record set by Jose Canseco
in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wasted a fine chance to pull even in the fifth.</TE>

<LD>Third baseman Troy Glaus, who sprained the middle and ring fingers on
his left hand while sliding head-first into second base Monday, was
not in the starting lineup Wednesday for the second successive game.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Glaus, who appeared as a defensive
replacement in the ninth inning Tuesday, was available for
pinch-hitting duty but was held out as a precaution. "He's improved
from [Tuesday]," Scioscia said.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Spiezio started at third for the second straight game.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Salmon, hit by a pitch on the left arm Tuesday, didn't start
Wednesday, but Scioscia said that was merely to give the right
fielder a rest. Salmon, who missed 18 games last month after being
hit on the hand, said he was fine and pinch-hit in the seventh,
grounding out to third.</TE>
<TE>   "It startled me more than anything," he said of the pitch that hit
him in his second at-bat. "It was one of those things. It was the
first one that was up and in again [since his hand was hit], so it
was a little strange."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was mildly surprised he didn't start, but he didn't
complain. "I would be willing to bet if I was swinging the bat well
I'd be in the lineup," said Salmon, who is three for 18 with no
extra-base hits in six games since returning to the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   With Jarrod Washburn cleared of sexual assault allegations,
Scioscia scheduled him to start Friday in the opener of a three-game
series against Texas. Rookie Mickey Callaway will start tonight's
series finale against Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had tentatively planned for Washburn to face the
first-place A's today, but the disruption of his routine the last few
days led them to delay his start.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Having visited the site of the World Trade Center last month, the
Angels had a special perspective on the first anniversary of the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a time you wish never would have happened, but it did, and
we have to remember the people who perished," Spiezio said. "And you
have to remember the people who risked their lives to save other
people. It's great we're playing. We have an opportunity to give
thanks."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio said he initially wondered if baseball should halt for the
day but decided he'd rather play. He also said he didn't fear for his
safety in a public place.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to go about our business as Americans," he said. "It's a
free country. There are risks living in a free country. I'd rather
have it this way than Big Brother watching over your shoulder 24/7."</TE>
<TE>   Fans received T-shirts imprinted with the Major League Baseball
emblem and the words "We shall not forget." A moment of silence was
held and a flag was unfurled on the infield by several dozen police
officers while a police honor guard stood in a semicircle on the near
edge of the outfield grass. Fireman John Price of Brea, who
participated in the rescue and recovery efforts in New York, threw
out the first pitch. Also, the game was halted for a moment of
silence at 9:11 p.m.</TE>

<HD>It's a Rocky Ride in Boulder for Barnett</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gary Barnett couldn't talk long to a visiting reporter Aug. 20
because it was moving day on campus--players checking into dorms--and
the fourth-year Colorado coach felt he finally had things moving in
the right direction.</LD>
<LD>   But now it's three weeks later, USC is hitching wagons headed east
as the higher ranked team and Barnett is Sisyphus again in a town
called Boulder.</LD>
<LD>   Ranked No. 7 in the preseason, Colorado (1-1) already has taken
two baby steps back, losing its fourth consecutive opener under
Barnett and, last week against San Diego State, losing starting
quarterback Craig Ochs to another concussion.</LD>
<TE>   Only an optimist would think Colorado is right on track.</TE>
<TE>   After all, is this not how Barnett's team stumbled into 2001,
losing the opener to Fresno State, losing Ochs to an injury, then
closing so hard and fast the Buffaloes missed a spot in the national
title game by 0.05 of a point in the bowl championship series
computer?</TE>
<TE>   Let's see Colorado pull that trick again.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if we're going to know that until we step on the
field with another quarterback," Barnett, forced to start junior
college transfer Robert Hodge against USC, said this week. "History
says yes, history says this team had it happen to them last year, but
each year is different, and the mindset of every team is different,
so I don't think there's any way of predicting that until we get on
the field and see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   Barnett has made Colorado a talking piece since taking the reins
from Rick Neuheisel, but there also have been avalanche warnings.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking wide-open spaces after his noteworthy run at Northwestern,
Barnett hoped to slip back into Colorado the way a man would into his
favorite shoes. He coached two years at Fort Lewis in the 1980s
before spending eight seasons as Bill McCartney's assistant at
Colorado, an era capped by a share of the national title in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett's homecoming, though, has been fraught with twists and
turmoil and is only weeks removed from an off-season that could only
be described as off-putting.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't kidding when they said the Rocky Mountains were all
peaks and valleys.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado could not have been more sky high after its shocking,
62-36 home victory over Nebraska last Nov. 23, an event that seems
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado followed with a victory over Texas in the Big 12 title
game, then was crushed to learn it had been edged for the second BCS
title game spot by, of all teams, Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado grudgingly accepted its Fiesta Bowl bid and played like
it in a 38-16 loss to Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Off the field, things were quiet as a circus:</TE>
<TE>   Last December, six Colorado players and six recruits were
implicated in a sexual assault complaint made by a woman who claimed
she was raped at an off-campus party.</TE>
<TE>   After a lengthy investigation and much public debate and clamor,
the Boulder District Attorney's office decided not to press charges,
although it did offer some scathing opinion regarding player
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "The off-field stuff has been a war," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   On June 9, Tom McMahon, the team's co-defensive coordinator, died
at age 53 after a two-year battle with lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids saw Tom the last three months and knew he wasn't the
same," Barnett said. "They didn't separate themselves, but they could
almost see it coming."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado then spent its summer vacation answering charges of 54
NCAA violations, 51 on Neuheisel's watch.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett wondered why his program might have to pay for violations
committed by a coach who left the program.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's a situation where it was not institutional, just guys who
went out to make decisions on their own to break rules, then I have
problems with that following a school," Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   On Aug. 9, Barnett was in the room at Philadelphia when the NCAA
questioned Neuheisel about the alleged violations, mostly technical
stuff involving recruiting rules.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, Barnett came away fuming at the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   "It came down to them wanting to grill Rick, and they grilled
Rick," Barnett said. "Rick probably pushed the envelope, and did it
more creatively than anyone else, but what he did is no more illegal
than what every other college coach in the country does. To just pick
out a school and to slap us for what they're going to slap us with,
for what everybody else is doing, they've got their head in the
sand."</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA's decision on Colorado is pending.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado players have gone back to class on NCAA rules.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been very educated in camp," offensive lineman Justin Bates
said. "But all this stuff they're talking about was when I was a
freshman and before I was even here."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado also had to endure receiver Jeremy Bloom's public quest
to play football and keep endorsement money he made as a world-class
freestyle skier. After the NCAA rejected his argument, Bloom put his
ski career on ice and joined the Buffaloes.</TE>
<TE>   You would have thought Colorado players would have learned from
mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't get stuck out of the gate, like we did last year against
Fresno," Bates said before the season.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Colorado opened with another heartbreaking loss, to rival
Colorado State.</TE>
<TE>   "Take care of the little things," Bates said a few weeks ago.
"Bridge those gaps, so we don't have to worry about 0.05 or some
computer ranking."</TE>
<TE>   With USC on its way, and a trip to UCLA shortly to follow,
Colorado has more to worry about than decimal points.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall Plan</TE>
<TE>   Biggest game in school history?</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it is, maybe it ain't," Marshall's star quarterback Byron
Leftwich said this week of tonight's game at No. 11 Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   If you have to choose, go with "is" over "ain't."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes got higher for Marshall when UCLA defeated Colorado
State last weekend and the hyped Heisman Trophy showdown between Rex
Grossman and Ken Dorsey turned into a dud.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado State's loss left No. 16 Marshall as the only non-BCS
conference team with a shot at finishing in the top six and earning
one of two at-large BCS bowl berths.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, with Grossman and Dorsey combining to throw five
interceptions in Gainesville, Fla., Leftwich has a chance to make his
early-season Heisman case before a national cable television
audience.</TE>
<TE>   John McEnroe's response: You can't be serious.</TE>
<TE>   Argument: if receiver Randy Moss, maybe college football's most
gifted player ever, couldn't win the Heisman Trophy for Marshall in
1997, how can Byron Leftwich?</TE>
<TE>   Rebuttal: Moss finished fourth in balloting behind winner Charles
Woodson, Peyton Manning and Ryan Leaf. Despite Moss' obvious talent,
many Heisman voters questioned the level of competition he faced.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the media-friendly Leftwich, Moss' demeanor was not
suitable for Heisman packaging.</TE>
<TE>   Difference this year? The Heisman field is wide open and Leftwich
gets a national television shot against Virginia Tech, a top-notch
defensive unit.</TE>
<TE>   Leftwich is riding a stretch in which he has thrown for at least
400 yards and four touchdowns in his last four games dating to last
year.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech is only the fourth ranked opponent Marshall has
played since upgrading to Division I-A in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't allow everyone being so hyped up about this game hype us
up too much too," Leftwich said. "We don't have to put no added
pressure on ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   Hurry-Up Offense</TE>
<TE>   More on Tony Soprano's school, Rutgers, located off Exit 9 on the
New Jersey Turnpike.</TE>
<TE>   After humiliating losses to Villanova and Buffalo, Rutgers
plummeted to No. 181 in this week's Sagarin Ratings, well below
college football's Mendoza line of 117 Division I-A programs.</TE>
<TE>   How bad is it? Princeton, which played Rutgers in the college
football's first game in 1869, ranks six places higher in the latest
Sagarin ratings at No. 175, and Princeton has yet play its season
opener.</TE>
<TE>   How bad is it? Army, which lost to Holy Cross last week, is a 4
1/2-point favorite at Rutgers this week.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Coach Mack Brown says playing at North Carolina would have
been a bigger deal three years ago. Only four players Brown coached
are on the present North Carolina roster. "There are not a lot of
ties as far as football is concerned," Brown says, "there are a lot
of ties in the state."</TE>
<TE>   Brown coached 10 years in Chapel Hill before Texas made him a 1998
offer he couldn't refuse. Brown has garnered the reputation for not
winning the big game when it counts--once against Florida State in
1997 while at North Carolina and three times at Texas, twice to
Oklahoma and once to Colorado--but there's no denying his
program-building skills. North Carolina won two games in Brown's
first two seasons and won 20 his last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Stat of the week: Number of touchdown passes Florida Gators have
thrown since 1990: 425. Number of touchdown passes Florida threw
against Miami: zero.</TE>
<TE>   Quote of the week: Florida Coach Ron Zook on the talent gap
between his team and Miami: "We want to have the same type of players
they do." Hard to imagine those words leaving Steve Spurrier's mouth.</TE>
<TE>   If you think Saturday's Michigan-Notre Dame game is going to come
down to a field goal, don't count on Michigan. Wolverine kickers have
made only one of six attempts through two games. It was a big one,
though, Philip Brabbs' 44-yarder to defeat Washington as time
expired.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska plays at Penn State this week for the first time since
1982, the year Joe Paterno's boys defeated Tom Osborne's by a 27-24
score. It was Nebraska's only loss that season.</TE>
<TE>   That's a long time between visits for revenge to be a factor,
right? "Nebraska fans have long memories," Coach Frank Solich, an
assistant coach on Nebraska's 1982 team, said. "We didn't get it done
at their place. We hope that will change this time."</TE>

<HD>Walter Gets Start for Arizona State</HD>

<LD>Arizona State Coach Dirk Koetter has decided to start sophomore
Andrew Walter at quarterback in Saturday night's game at San Diego
State (0-2).</LD>
<LD>   Redshirt freshman Chad Christensen had started the first three
games for the Sun Devils (2-1), with Walter relieving Christensen in
the season-opening loss at Nebraska and in the second half of last
Saturday's come-from-behind victory over Central Florida.</LD>
<LD>   "We'll flop roles this week. We'll start off with Andrew and see
where that takes us," Koetter said.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Illinois Coach Ron Turner says Jon Beutjer, a transfer from Iowa,
will start at quarterback Saturday when the Fighting Illini (0-2)
play host to Arkansas State (1-2). Beutjer replaces Dustin Ward....
Florida Coach Ron Zook is planning several lineup changes after
Saturday's stinging loss to No. 1 Miami, the most significant of
which involve linebacker Byron Hardmon. He will move from the outside
to the middle and replace Matt Farrior. Todd McCullough will play at
Hardmon's outside position when the 12th-ranked Gators (1-1) play
Ohio (0-2) on Saturday.... Indiana Coach Gerry DiNardo says Gibran
Hamdan will start at quarterback in place of Tommy Jones when the
Hoosiers (1-1) travel to play Kentucky (2-0). Jones suffered a
concussion in the first half of Saturday's loss to Utah and is still
feeling the effects of the injury.... The task of rebuilding Kansas'
offensive line may have been too much for assistant Ken Conatser, who
resigned after only two games. Conatser, 62, was the second offensive
line coach hired by first-year Coach Mark Mangino. Former Notre Dame
assistant Dave Borbely joined the Jayhawk staff last winter, but he
resigned before the start of spring practice to take a job at
Colorado.</TE>

<HD>Dele's Brother Sought by FBI</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Mother worried about her sons after
disappearance of former NBA player.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What Patricia Phillips loves most about her Santa Monica apartment is
the tranquillity--the ocean breeze sailing through her open windows,
the quiet that allows for her morning meditations interrupted only by
the comforting rings of a wind chime.</LD>
<LD>   But her peacefulness was on hold Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Telephone calls came streaming in, and with each ring, Phillips
either rose wearily to check the caller ID on her home line--or
scrambled to answer her cell phone.</LD>
<TE>   "I need to get the cell," Phillips said. "That's the number Miles
has called both times."</TE>
<TE>   Miles Dabord, also known as Kevin Eugene Williams, is Phillips'
35-year-old son and the older brother of former NBA player Bison
Dele.</TE>
<TE>   Dele, 33, who was known as Brian Williams when he played at Santa
Monica St. Monica High and later with the Clippers and the 1996-97
NBA champion Chicago Bulls, is missing somewhere in the South
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   So is his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, and Bertrand Saldo, the
captain of Dele's 55-foot catamaran, the "Hakuna Matata."</TE>
<TE>   Law officials presume they are dead, and they would like to speak
with Dabord to find out what he knows.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips said both of her sons were sailing together with Karlan
for six months until early July. Karlan called her mother on July 7.
Neither Dele nor Karlan have established contact with any of their
family members or friends on the mainland since. Friends say they
were last seen alive on the French Polynesian island of Moorea, a
51-square-mile haven that features a Club Med location, multi-hued
lagoons, white-sand beaches and jagged, picturesque mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Dabord placed a cell phone call to Phillips once Tuesday night,
and again Wednesday morning. In both brief conversations, he
threatened suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips quoted her son saying, "Ma, I know the police are looking
for me. Nobody will believe my story. I just want you to believe me.
I just wanted to call you before I take care of myself. Mom, I didn't
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Phillips: "He called me and told me he wanted me to know he
didn't do this thing he was being accused of. He said how important
it was for him to know that I believed him, and that I loved him,
because he was at the end of his life."</TE>
<TE>   Although Phillips declined to disclose all details of her talks
with Dabord, Scott Ohlgren, Karlan's stepfather, said he was told
Dabord referenced a physical struggle he had with Dele sometime
during the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Miles told her essentially nothing," Ohlgren said. "How's that
for an alarm?"</TE>
<TE>   Dabord was picked up and questioned by Phoenix police Sept. 5
after attempting to purchase gold from an establishment, Certified
Mint, by signing "Brian Williams" on a check for $152,000 from his
younger brother's account. He used Brian Williams' passport as
identification. Police did not arrest Dabord, citing "lack of
information." Kevin Porter, Dele's personal assistant, told Phillips
he accompanied Dabord to Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix
and watched him purchase a plane ticket to San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the conversations she had with Dabord, Phillips
received more news Wednesday. The FBI announced an active missing
persons investigation to determine what has become of Dele, Karlan
and Saldo.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Black, a spokesman from the bureau's San Francisco office
that will serve as the base of the investigation, said officials are
in the process of interviewing those with information about the
disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very much interested in talking to Kevin Eugene Williams
[Dabord] about this matter," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Ohlgren: "I'm so grateful they're looking for him [Dabord].
I've got a feeling the FBI has a pretty long arm, and they'll be able
to solve this."</TE>
<TE>   Black would not comment on Dabord's whereabouts, although sources
close to the matter said the FBI has information that Dabord drove to
San Diego this week and ventured across the border to Tijuana. He is
also believed to have told his side of the story to an attorney
friend, providing a stipulation that the attorney can divulge the
details if Dabord commits suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Dwight Manley, Dele's agent, said he has tried to arrange for a
criminal attorney, John Barnett, to represent Dabord.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have long to wait," Phillips said. "Miles will
either take his life or he'll come in."</TE>
<TE>   The "Hakuna Matata" and its occupants remain missing, Black said.
The FBI has contacted the U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Control Center in
Honolulu, Black said.</TE>
<TE>   "We conducted a search by phone with other centers, and that
search has been suspended," Chief Petty Officer Joseph Curcio of the
Honolulu Rescue Control Center said Wednesday. "If we get a request
to search again, we will run it up the chain. Until we get some kind
of manageable search area, all we can do is put out the word to other
RCCs. A specific area would allow us to do more, starting with
messages to ships at sea."</TE>
<TE>   Francois Chaumette, an assistant harbor master in Papeete, Tahiti,
said his control center is prepared to conduct a search, including
the use of a plane or military vessel, if requested. Chaumette said,
"The strange side of this story is that we have not been able to
firmly say until now if they were missing or if they did not want to
be disturbed on some remote island."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, who discussed the saga at length Wednesday afternoon
while sitting at her dining table within reach of a pile of tissues
that she occasionally used to dab tears, said she fears the worst for
both of her sons.</TE>
<TE>   "I can only assume that if this is worth it to Miles to take his
life over, what else is there?" Phillips said.</TE>
<TE>   She is leaning on aunts and uncles for support now. As an aunt
left an audible phone message in the background, "I love you so
much," Phillips' smooth face cringed and tears welled in her eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a little disappointed with some of the e-mails I've
received from family and friends, in that they had all asked only
about Brian," Phillips said. "I sent them all a reply [Tuesday]
night, saying, 'I need you to pray and hope for Miles too.' No one
knows the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Until Tuesday night's phone call from Miles, Phillips said she had
been estranged from him since January 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no one incident," Phillips said of the split. "It had
to do with Miles feeling that he couldn't ever be loved as much as
Brian. People always gravitated to Brian, even before he became a
celebrity. Miles is studious and quiet. He grew up in his brother's
shadow. Everything that happened to Brian was so much bigger than
what happened in Miles' life. I think that manifested in Miles to the
point where he was telling himself, 'My mother doesn't love me, and
she never will.' "</TE>
<TE>   Dele was regarded as one of the most enigmatic players in NBA
history. Manley said Dele dated Madonna. Dele ran with the bulls in
Pamplona, Spain. He once rode a bicycle from Denver to Phoenix with
only a credit card. He was a certified pilot and scuba diver. When he
retired in 1999 and forfeited a contract that owed him $30 million,
he told Manley he didn't like the competitive nature of an artistic
sport like basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a wide range of interests too," Phillips said. "I am a
researcher who has attempted to figure out this big, interwoven web
of life. Brian did that by pushing the adrenaline envelope. Miles was
more like me."</TE>
<TE>   She said the boys occasionally raised their voices at each other
while growing up, but never had a violent exchange.</TE>
<TE>   It's a detail like that, Phillips said, that makes this big,
interwoven web so complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Truth allows you to move forward, it sets you free--even the most
awful truth," she said. "Uncertainty keeps you in prison. It
paralyzes you. I stand here today paralyzed."</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Right-hander throws 132 pitches in 62/3 innings,
leads Dodgers to 7-3 win that evens wild-card race.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Brian Jordan peeked at the auxiliary scoreboard above left field
after the fifth inning Wednesday, saw that Dodger starter Hideo Nomo
had already thrown 110 pitches and thought, "Whoo-whee." Catcher Paul
Lo Duca went to the mound in the fifth to see if his pitcher was
feeling all right.</LD>
<LD>   Not to worry. The right-hander once threw a 191-pitch complete
game--with 16 walks--in Japan for the Kintetsu Buffaloes, defeating
the Seibu Lions in 1994, so why all the fuss? Nomo was just getting
warmed up.</LD>
<LD>   Nomo had plenty left in his tank, and because of that the Dodgers,
a car length behind San Francisco before the game, pulled even with
the Giants atop the National League wild-card race with a 7-3 victory
before 41,310 in Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<TE>   Rising to the challenge of a virtual must-win situation, Nomo
allowed two runs and six hits in 6 2/3 innings, a gutsy 132-pitch
effort in which he struck out eight, walked five and threw more
pitches than he had in any game over the last four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom had three hits, a rally-sparking single in the
first, a triple in the sixth and an RBI double in the eighth, and
Jordan broke open a one-run game with a three-run home run in the
fifth, as the Dodgers ended their four-game losing streak and the
Giants' five-game win streak, and salvaged the finale of a three-game
series.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't want to come here and get swept, go down two games [in
the wild-card standings] and be in a position where you have to sweep
[a four-game series from the Giants] next week," Lo Duca said. "If we
had lost, it wouldn't have been the end of the season, but this was
as close to a must-win game as you can get. It's a big swing between
being two games down and even."</TE>
<TE>   With that kind of pressure, it's no wonder Manager Jim Tracy said,
"There's nobody I'd rather have on the mound today than Hideo Nomo."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo struggled early, needing 73 pitches to get through three
innings, and he allowed single runs in the second and third innings,
but he never crumbled. Nomo found a groove in the fourth, allowing no
more hits until being pulled in favor of Paul Shuey with two out in
the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Nomo (14-6) is 12-1 with a 3.08 earned-run average in his last 23
starts dating to May 17, and 19 of those games resulted in Dodger
victories. He has a 10-3 record and a 2.52 ERA against the Giants and
is 8-0 with a 1.78 ERA in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "You hear the words 'warrior' and 'battler' with him, and they're
all the right words, because he just will not give in to you," Tracy
said. " ... He's had a number of tremendous performances for us this
season, and that one ranks right near the top. I don't know where our
club would be without him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably mad at me for not letting him throw 175 pitches,
but that's just who he is and what he's all about. And don't think
the rest of the guys in that clubhouse don't recognize that."</TE>
<TE>   Nomo chose to recognize his teammates after the game, responding
to several questions about his pitching by saying he was able to
relax after Jordan's home run.</TE>
<TE>   The tension of a 2-2 game, in which the Dodgers squandered several
early scoring opportunities, evaporated in the top of the fifth,
which Grissom opened with a triple to right-center.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca doubled to left to make it 3-2, Shawn Green reached on a
bloop single to center, and Jordan, replacing the struggling Adrian
Beltre in the cleanup spot, blasted a 2-and-0 Kirk Rueter pitch deep
into the left-field seats for a 6-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom also sparked a first-inning rally by smacking Rueter's
first pitch of the game into center for a single.</TE>
<TE>   Lo Duca singled and Green walked to load the bases.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan rolled a grounder to third, but third base umpire Ed
Montague ruled that Giant third baseman David Bell failed to nick the
bag with his foot on his attempt for a double play. Grissom scored on
the error, Jordan beat the throw to first, and Eric Karros' RBI
fielder's choice made it 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   David Bell's RBI single pulled the Giants within 2-1 in the
second, but Nomo got Rich Aurilia to pop out with the bases loaded to
end the inning. San Francisco tied it in the third on Tom Goodwin's
RBI single, but Nomo escaped a first-and-third, one-out jam by
striking out J.T. Snow and a bases-loaded, two-out jam by striking
out Rueter.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't have his great stuff, but he just battled and battled,"
Lo Duca said of Nomo. "They had opportunities for big innings, but he
turned them into nothing."</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Inexperienced Beirne Gets Big Assignment</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>In the thick of a heated wild-card race, when each game seems more
important than the previous one, the Dodgers will turn to a
right-hander who has made one major league start in his career--Kevin
Beirne will pitch against the Colorado Rockies on Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Asked if he ever expected Beirne to start a game of such magnitude
this late in the season, Manager Jim Tracy said, "No ... but it is
what it is."</LD>
<LD>   In other words, with Kazuhisa Ishii hospitalized because of a
fractured skull and Andy Ashby's start pushed back to Sunday because
of an infection on the middle finger of his pitching hand, Tracy
didn't have much of a choice.</LD>
<TE>   But that does not mean the Dodgers don't expect good things from
Beirne. The 28-year-old is 1-0 with a 2.57 earned-run average in nine
relief appearances after going 10-3 with a 4.15 ERA in 22 starts for
triple-A Las Vegas, and Tracy believes Beirne, a former Texas A&amp;M
wide receiver, has the mental makeup to handle the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   "I've liked the way he's carried himself from the first day he
walked in here," Tracy said. "He's a competitive kid who has backed
down from nothing. I have the utmost confidence in him."</TE>
<TE>   Beirne's only other start was for the Chicago White Sox on Sept.
26, 2000, when he gave up three runs and three hits in five innings
in a no-decision against the Boston Red Sox. He has never pitched in
Coors Field, but he has pitched in Colorado Springs, "which is even
higher in altitude," Beirne said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different, and you have to make adjustments, like you do in
a lot of places," Beirne said. "I've got to keep the ball down, use
both sides of the plate and change speeds. I just want to keep it
close and give the team a chance to win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Kevin Brown, who gave up five runs and six
hits in five innings of Tuesday night's 5-2 loss, returned to Los
Angeles on Wednesday to be examined by Dr. Robert Watkins. But the
checkup, scheduled before Brown's start, was considered routine, and
Tracy said Brown will remain in the rotation and start Tuesday night
against the Giants at home.</TE>
<TE>   Reviews for Brown's first start since June 11 surgery for a
herniated disk in his lower back were mixed. Said Giant Manager Dusty
Baker: "He wasn't quite Kevin Brown. He had the movement, but not the
velocity. But he's still better than most."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy was encouraged by Brown's performance, saying "it was better
than the numbers indicate." A blown call by home plate umpire Ed
Montague in the second inning cost the Dodgers two runs and changed
the complexion of the game. After giving up two runs in the first,
Brown got out of a second-and-third, no-out jam.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things happened early that started the snowball rolling down
the wrong side of the hill," Tracy said. "But he knuckled down and
got out of the first, and the play at the plate cost him a couple of
runs in the second."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ashby played long toss and threw for about five minutes in the
bullpen Wednesday, and though his finger felt tender at first, he
said the workout went well. "The main thing is there wasn't any
swelling when I was throwing," Ashby said. "There's no reason I
shouldn't be able to pitch Sunday unless it swells up or I stick [the
finger] in something I shouldn't." Ashby will throw again for 10-12
minutes in the bullpen today.... Third baseman Adrian Beltre has one
hit in his last 31 at-bats but hasn't taken his slump into the
field--he made several fine defensive plays in Wednesday's win and
has made only two errors since the All-Star break.</TE>

<HD>Giants Can't Gain the Mental Edge</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The San Francisco Giants could have delivered a psychological blow,
putting the Dodgers on the ropes late in the National League
wild-card race.</LD>
<LD>   But the Giants swung and missed Wednesday and the Dodgers fought
back, salvaging a 7-3 victory as part of a three-game series at
Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants would have moved two games ahead of the Dodgers for the
playoff berth they've both targeted with the Arizona Diamondbacks
leading comfortably in the NL West, increasing the heat on their
longtime rivals with 17 games left. Instead, the Dodgers have pulled
even and are invigorated, believing they can achieve their goal.</LD>
<TE>   "They had a chance to really send a message, winning the first two
games, so the win was big for us just to leave here even," first
baseman Eric Karros said. "If they win today, we're out of here two
games out and probably not feeling really good.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, even though we only won one out of the three, we feel like
we've got some momentum. We can take that momentum and build on it."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, things may have turned only briefly.</TE>
<TE>   The clubs meet again in a four-game series beginning Monday at
Dodger Stadium, and the Giants are no less confident despite a wasted
opportunity before a sellout crowd of 41,310. They stranded 11
runners, including leaving the bases loaded in the second and third
with Dodger pitcher Hideo Nomo teetering.</TE>
<TE>   "We got two, but you want three," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said.
"We both wanted it and needed it, but just 'cause you need something
doesn't mean you're going to get it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was in the hands of Nomo and the people who hurt us today, but
we had our chances. We had the bases loaded two or three times in the
first [few] innings. We had a number of opportunities, but Nomo
managed to get away."</TE>
<TE>   Giant left-hander Kirk Rueter couldn't shake the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants had their steadiest starter on the mound with a chance
to sweep the Dodgers and create some space in the race, but the
best-case scenario didn't materialize as they hoped. With the score
tied, 2-2, in the fifth, Rueter gave up four consecutive hits without
recording an out, getting yanked after Brian Jordan's three-run home
run gave the Dodgers a 6-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we had a good homestand," Rueter said. "We're down to the
last couple of weeks and we're tied up. If you had told us a week
ago, when we were three or four games out, that we would be tied up
at this point, we would have taken it. We would have liked to have
gotten the sweep, but we are all tied up."</TE>
<TE>   That's Baker's view as well. The manager who has guided the Giants
to two division titles since 1997 said, obviously, he would rather be
two games ahead, but he has worked well from similar positions in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, you'd love to pull ahead, but a week ago you could say we
didn't have any chance," Baker said. "You can be disappointed on one
hand, but you've got to be grateful and thankful on the other hand.</TE>
<TE>   "How devastating would it have been if they had taken two of three
from us or swept us? We're all professionals out here. We're both
good teams."</TE>
<TE>   But time is running out for one of them.</TE>

<HD>No Athlete Meant More to Baltimore</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY LEVINSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My first recollection of Johnny Unitas was when I was a kid going to
Memorial Stadium for one of those preseason intrasquad games the
Colts used to have each year. The thing that stood out in my mind,
and now in retrospect, was when he was introduced, the public address
announcer said, "And now, Number 19, John Uni-TASS." That was him. He
was just this guy. He got his chance to play when George Shaw, the
starter, was injured, and he wasn't terrific initially.</LD>
<LD>   And then suddenly, it happened.</LD>
<LD>   Unitas certainly had the athletic ability and the leadership
qualities, but the thing that made him great, in my mind and those of
the people of Baltimore, was that he was a working-class hero. There
was nothing flashy about him. He had the high-top shoes, the crew
cut. His attitude wasn't "I'm super cool." He just went out and did
the job. And no matter how spectacular the comeback may have been, or
how incredible the play was, he would just walk off the field, the
crowd would be cheering and he never celebrated that. It was like, "I
did my job."</LD>
<TE>   There was something about that simplicity that endeared him to me,
the fans and the city in ways that are almost indescribable. With
Unitas, it wasn't about showmanship. You'd see him walking off the
field, if he'd just thrown an interception or just won the game in
the last seven seconds, and it would seem to be the same. We had to
fill in the emotions, because he didn't show them. And I think that
made the experience even more special.</TE>
<TE>   One moment I will never forget was a game in 1960, when the Colts
were playing for first place in their division. Unitas was trying to
bring the team back to win and he tried to throw, but the ball was
hit and it fluttered out his hand, incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   He had been knocked to the ground, and the field was muddy. I
remember him getting up. The Colts lost. And Unitas walked back as he
always did--he could have just thrown the touchdown pass that won the
game and he would have walked back the same way. Highs or lows, you
never saw any emotional distinction. I was always fascinated by that,
and I know my friends were. He was "the Quiet Man." If you would
apply it to film, it would be Clint Eastwood, that kind of quiet
stoicism.</TE>
<TE>   I met Unitas several times, but I didn't know him well. I only
knew him really as a fan. I used to go out to watch the Colts
practice. And then after everyone left, Unitas and Raymond Berry
would continue to work on pass patterns. Everyone else had left long
before. The work discipline between them was really extraordinary. It
was like the guy took on the job, got it done, was great at it, no
fanfare. He just did his work.</TE>
<TE>   I think he embodied the city of Baltimore more than any athlete
who ever played there, even more so than Cal Ripken Jr. There was
something mystical about Unitas. Maybe because he was more distant in
a certain way, or maybe because he came from a time when there was
less media and it was slightly more innocent. There wasn't the
accessibility to athletes that there is now. I think that's why we
think of him in slightly more mythical terms.</TE>
<TE>   He had an incredible, profound effect. Unitas happened at the time
when Baltimore was just getting a football team and he rose to
dominance just as football was rising to prominence. And, of course,
there was the 1958 NFL championship game against the Giants, which
has been called the greatest game ever played. This was Baltimore
beating New York, which was a very big deal then.</TE>
<TE>   All those things collided at one time. Unitas was involved in all
these things that almost defined modern football. When football
really began to explode in the late '50s, he was The Quarterback,
playing on the greatest team in the world. And he symbolized that
era. The next generation was Namath. Flashier. Boisterous. Unitas
didn't say much.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I saw him, oddly enough, was when I came to
Baltimore to watch the Ravens play the Indianapolis Colts. Unitas was
on the sidelines and I came down there with my son, who at the time
might have been 10. I said, "Hello, this is my son Jack," and Unitas
told Jack, "Come on, get in a little closer, get a better view of the
field."</TE>
<TE>   I said to him, "Isn't it odd to be rooting against the blue and
white and the horseshoe?" He looked at me and just kind of shook his
head, as if he was still in disbelief that that team ever left
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   And then, at one point, the Ravens were driving and Unitas' face
was flashed on the big screen. The place went crazy. It was an
amazing moment. This was my childhood hero and the crowd was cheering
the tight shot of him and my son Jack whispered to me, "Who is that
man?" He had no information of him at all.</TE>
<TE>   We were leaving stadium after the game and I told Jack, "That was
the greatest football player we had ever seen." And then I told him
stories of Unitas and how he won the championship game against the
Giants. I filled him in on who he was, and my son was suddenly quite
taken by him.</TE>
<TE>   But that one moment of "Who is this guy?" made me realize a couple
of generations have gone by and it's up to you to pass on this
information. Because they need to know.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jerry Stackhouse was traded from Detroit to the Washington Wizards in
a six-player deal Wednesday that sent fellow shooting guard Richard
Hamilton to the Pistons.</LD>
<LD>   The Pistons sent Stackhouse, 27, forward Brian Cardinal, 25, and
center Ratko Varda, 23, to the Wizards for Hamilton, 24, forward
Bobby Simmons, 22, and guard Hubert Davis, 32.</LD>
<LD>   "When you have the opportunity to add an All-Star player of
Jerry's caliber, you can't hesitate on the chance to strengthen the
team," Wizard General Manager Wes Unseld said. "We had to part with
several players we were very high on, but we feel we have improved."</LD>
<TE>   Stackhouse, a two-time All-Star selection, has a scoring average
of 21.2 points in seven seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton, drafted seventh overall by the Wizards in 1999, averaged
20.0 points last season.</TE>

<TE>   Chris Webber of the Sacramento Kings pleaded not guilty to charges
of obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury about his dealings
with a University of Michigan booster.</TE>
<TE>   The booster, retired autoworker Ed Martin, says he lent Webber
$280,000 while the basketball star played in high school and at
Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Webber, 29, has said he received only small amounts of money,
mostly under $50.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was released on a $10,000 bond and a pretrial conference
was scheduled for Sept. 26. Webber left the federal courthouse in
downtown Detroit without speaking to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Webber was indicted Monday, along with his father and his aunt,
who did not appear at the hearing. Arraignment dates have not yet
been set for Webber's father, Mayce Webber Jr., and his aunt,
Charlene Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, the three face up to 10 years in prison and a
$500,000 fine.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Finley tied the score with a home run in the eighth inning, and
Quinton McCracken followed with a triple and scored the go-ahead run,
and the Arizona Diamondbacks rallied to defeat the San Diego Padres,
6-5, Wednesday night at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Pinch-hitter Lyle Overbay, a rookie, drove in his first run in the
majors with a single to right field that scored McCracken. The
Diamondbacks lead the National League West by 6 1/2 games over the
Dodgers and San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Finley hit a 1-and-0 pitch from reliever Kevin Walker (0-1) into
the Padre bullpen leading off the eighth for his 23rd homer. Finley,
who also had a two-run single, has 1,999 career hits.</LD>
<TE>   McCracken followed with his eighth triple to tie four others for
the NL lead. Overbay singled with one out against Brandon Villafuerte
to score the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   The rally denied San Diego's Adam Eaton his first victory this
season. Eaton pitched five innings--his longest outing in three
starts since returning Sept. 1 from elbow surgery performed in August
2001--and gave up four runs, five hits and six walks.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 8-0, New York 5-5--Al Leiter wanted to last at least six
innings on the Sept. 11 anniversary. He wound up going all the way.</TE>
<TE>   Leiter pitched a six-hitter for his second shutout this season and
the Mets split a doubleheader at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Chipper Jones homered twice and drove in five
runs, and Kevin Millwood (17-6) won his eighth consecutive start.</TE>
<TE>   In the dugout before the game, Leiter (13-11) lined up six hats
that are worn by New York City police officers, firefighters, port
authority workers and emergency personnel.</TE>
<TE>   No matter which hat he was wearing, Leiter dominated the Braves.
He struck out eight and gave up six singles.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 4, Milwaukee 3--Pinch-hitter Miguel Cairo drove in the
go-ahead run with a bloop single in the seventh inning at Milwaukee,
and the Cardinals extended their winning streak to eight games.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis opened a season-high 6 1/2-game lead over second-place
Houston in the NL Central. The Cardinals are on their longest winning
streak since a nine-game stretch from Sept. 8-22, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 8, Houston 6--Two homers and five runs batted in by Jeff
Bagwell at Houston weren't enough to keep the Rockies from damaging
the Astros' postseason hopes.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Aaron Cook won his second consecutive start, giving up
seven hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   Bagwell reached 30 homers for the seventh consecutive season and
the eighth time in nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Cincinnati 1--Elmer Dessens took a perfect game into
the seventh inning at Cincinnati, then gave up two-run homers to
Aramis Ramirez and Craig Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   Dessens (7-8) retired the first 19 batters before Jack Wilson
reached on shortstop Gookie Dawkins' throwing error.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Giles flied out, and Ramirez followed with a homer to left.
Rob Mackowiak hit a grounder that glanced off the first-base bag for
a single, and Wilson homered to left.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 9, Florida 2--Placido Polanco and Travis Lee each hit
three-run homers, and Brett Myers (4-4) pitched six solid innings at
Philadelphia to help the Phillies end a six-game losing streak. Pat
Burrell drove in his 110th run for the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Montreal 3--Sammy Sosa ended his slump with his 495th
career home run, going three for four to help the Cubs win at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Vidro had two RBIs for the Expos, but they weren't enough to
keep Masato Yoshii (4-9) from losing his fourth consecutive start
since Aug. 21.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Here, said Brian Jordan.</LD>
<LD>   Grab, said Marquis Grissom.</LD>
<LD>   Pull, said Hideo Nomo.</LD>
<TE>   Fingers on the precipice of the pennant race, a rival preparing to
stomp, the Dodgers were dragged back to temporary safety Wednesday by
three weathered hands.</TE>
<TE>   Does that grip have 17 more games in it?</TE>
<TE>   As their breath and color slowly return, the Dodgers can only
hope.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to avoid a three-game sweep and a two-game deficit in the
wild-card race, they stepped into jeering Pacific Bell Park on
Wednesday against the San Francisco Giants needing their heartiest
game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom started it. Jordan ended it. Nomo defined it. The Dodgers
got it.</TE>
<TE>   The final score was 7-3. The final pitch felt like a first one.</TE>
<TE>   Two teams, dead even, 17 games remaining, winner plays in October,
loser waits for April.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgers and Giants. The renewal of a race that has lasted forever.</TE>
<TE>   "This is gonna be fun," Jordan said. "This is gonna be a battle."</TE>
<TE>   It is a battle that unofficially started Wednesday, because it
could have ended Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers never said it, but you could hear it in the pregame
silence of their clubhouse, see in the worried eyes of their manager.</TE>
<TE>   "You would worry about the psychological effect of your biggest
rival sweeping you and putting you two games down," Jim Tracy
acknowledged afterward. "Our players were well aware of that. And
they played like it."</TE>
<TE>   They played like it because the three old guys played like it.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, with 48 postseason games under his cracked belt, began
the first rally with a single and the winning rally with a triple.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go through it," Grissom said. "I've been through it."</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, with 35 postseason games under his perpetual ice packs,
toppled Jeff Kent with a slide into second base, then knocked over
the rest of the Giants with a three-run homer.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of our guys haven't been in this situation before," Jordan
said. "But they're learning."</TE>
<TE>   And Nomo? The 34-year-old guy who trudges around as if he's 50?
The guy who has been around so long, Nomomania is cool again?</TE>
<TE>   As usual, his deliberate delivery and tendency to avoid the strike
zone made this game last forever. But this time, Nomo also lasted
forever, 132 pitches, two runs in nearly seven innings, and I know
what you're thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, 132 pitches are the most thrown by a Dodger this season.
And, certainly, some arms have difficulty recovering from such heavy
lifting.</TE>
<TE>   But durable Nomo claims he once threw 191 pitches in Japan. And
with the season on the line and the bullpen bracing for a weekend in
Denver, Tracy really had no choice.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, you have to be ready to throw everything at them,"
Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought that on the new-era Dodgers, most of those
things would be coming from the old guys?</TE>
<TE>   Start with Grissom, who said the foundation for his hits against
hot Giant pitcher Kirk Rueter was created long before the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I've faced him for, like, six or seven years," Grissom said. "I
know what he does. And I keep studying him."</TE>
<TE>   Sitting around a television in the visiting clubhouse Wednesday
morning, many Dodgers were studying Rueter, who entered the game with
a 13 1/3-inning scoreless streak and only one loss since July.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the season, such skull sessions on opposing pitchers
weren't very crowded, attended mostly by the older guys.</TE>
<TE>   "But everybody is catching on now," Grissom said. "They are
understanding that this game is all about homework."</TE>
<TE>   And Grissom's homework?</TE>
<TE>   "I knew he likes to start me off with a fastball away and throw
that same pitch if he's in trouble," Grissom said.</TE>
<TE>   His first-pitch, leadoff single that led to a two-run first inning
was on a fastball away. His 2-and-0 triple to start the four-run
fifth inning was on the same pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because you know what it is, that doesn't mean you'll always
hit it," Grissom said with a laugh. "But at least you give yourself a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   That's all Jordan wanted in the fifth inning after two ugly
grounders earlier.</TE>
<TE>   With 14 homers and 56 RBIs before the game, he has hardly been the
offensive equivalent of Gary Sheffield. But the Dodgers coveted him
because, unlike Sheffield, he understands pennant-race moments such
as these.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been anxious, trying to do too much, so I told myself to
stay back and make him throw a strike," Jordan said. "When I got
ahead 2 and 0, I knew it was going to be there. I just had to swing
as hard as I could."</TE>
<TE>   He hit the ball so hard, Barry Bonds barely turned as it soared
over his head and into the left-field bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   He hit the ball so hard, the Giants deflated in the manner of an
ugly orange balloon, walking through the rest of the game as if it
were spring training.</TE>
<TE>   "A good game like this ... that does take the air out of you,"
Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers flew to Denver hoping to remain pumped. The Giants
flew to San Diego hoping to find perspective.</TE>
<TE>   They will reunite at Dodger Stadium for the start of a four-game
showdown that could decide the season, beginning Monday, not nearly
soon enough.</TE>

<HD>Scioscia's Message Finds an Audience of Believers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What Mike Scioscia said to Jarrod Washburn about the police
investigation into an alleged sexual assault by the Angel pitching
ace will stay private. What Scioscia said to his team, in a meeting
about Washburn and the investigation, also will stay private.</LD>
<LD>   But it's a good bet that whatever Scioscia said was absolutely the
right thing. In three years as Angel manager, Scioscia just about
always says the right things.</LD>
<LD>   Do you know how hard that is? Always saying the right things to 25
different men? These are men of different talent levels. Some are
outgoing, some are private, and some have fragile psyches. Some of
them love criticism and are motivated by it, and others hate it and
crawl into a hole because of it.</LD>
<TE>   No matter how hard Scioscia is poked, prodded, stuck with a sharp
stick, no matter what the questions are after tough losses or good
wins, after long losing streaks or big winning streaks, no matter the
postgame second guessing--"Why did you bring Percival in?" or "Why
did you leave Percival on the bench?"--Scioscia just folds his hands,
looks you in the eye and gives the answer. "Because that's what I
thought was the right thing to do."</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County district attorney's office said no charges would
be filed against Washburn, the anchor of Anaheim's stalwart pitching
staff. An investigation that started 10 days ago apparently did not
offer enough evidence against Washburn for a criminal case to be
pursued.</TE>
<TE>   Asked how he felt, Scioscia said: "Relieved." Asked how Washburn
felt after receiving the news, while in Scioscia's office, Scioscia
said: "Relieved." Asked if Washburn gave evidence of any emotions,
Scioscia said, "Relief is an emotion, isn't it?" And that was the end
of the questions about Washburn and the law.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever there is bad news--reliever Troy Percival going on the
disabled list for a few weeks; Tim Salmon getting hit on the hand and
turning a day-to-day injury into an 18-day episode in the dugout; a
team that finished 2001 in a pathetic nose dive starting the 2002
season the same way--Scioscia says not to worry.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a good team and we'll play better," he said over and over
when the team started 6-14 and his name was being mentioned as the
manager most likely to be fired by June.</TE>
<TE>   And darned if Scioscia wasn't right. This is a good team. The
Angels are 35 games over .500 with only one 2002 All-Star, Garret
Anderson. If it's not the players, which seems to be what voting fans
and American League All-Star Manager Joe Torre said, then Scioscia
must be doing many things very well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been obviously difficult for Jarrod," Scioscia said of the
last 10 days. "It's difficult when things are out of your control."</TE>
<TE>   In that last sentence, Scioscia was talking as much about himself
as he was about Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Scioscia had no control over what happened to his star
pitcher. He had control only over what happened to his team. Tuesday,
when the news broke, Scioscia gathered the Angels, told them the
little he knew and the Angels defeated Oakland, 5-2. No one in the
clubhouse was angry or disappointed or anguished. There was no hint
of anxiety, no mention of bad Angel happenings in past Septembers.</TE>
<TE>   Remember last month when the Angels blew a four-run, ninth-inning
lead and lost to the Red Sox, 10-9, in 10 innings? It was the last
game of a four-game series and the loss could have been devastating,
coming against a team chasing the Angels for the wild-card playoff
spot.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would you think that?" was Scioscia's answer to the
possibility that this loss was worse than any other loss. "It's no
different than any other game. We just move on and win the next one."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did. They won the next one.</TE>
<TE>   There is never any panic here and Scioscia is the reason why. Down
4-0 to the A's on Wednesday night, the Angels kept looking for the
right pitches, took the right swings, took the smart chances. They
advanced runners with sacrifices. They scored on a squeeze play. They
got back in the game, not with big, flamboyant plays but with small,
smart ones.</TE>
<TE>   Now, instead of being voted most likely to be fired, Scioscia is a
front-runner to be manager of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Angel fans were on their feet Wednesday night, wildly waving the
giveaway T-shirts, unprompted by scoreboard pleadings or Rally Monkey
histrionics. They are beginning to understand the Scioscia way. Be
patient. Be positive. There is nothing so bad that it can't be

<LD>UCLA has rebuked attempts by Oklahoma to cancel games against the
Bruins in 2003 and 2004. UCLA is scheduled to visit Norman, Okla.,
next season and play host to the Sooners the following year.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma also has Alabama on its schedule next season and a source
in Norman said Wednesday the Sooners don't want to play the Crimson
Tide and UCLA during the same season. Oklahoma was lucky to escape
with a victory over Alabama two weeks ago.</LD>
<LD>   Oklahoma could break its contract with the Bruins but would have
to pay UCLA a $500,000 buyout.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Poor special teams play put a damper on the Bruin victory over
Colorado State and has been a point of emphasis all week in practice.
UCLA fumbled two kickoffs, missed two field-goal attempts and
surrendered a 55-yard punt return.</TE>
<TE>   So after practice Wednesday, kick returners stayed on the field an
additional 15 minutes, working on simply catching the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "We've put a lot of time and effort into special teams," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "We need guys to perform."</TE>
<TE>   Opportunities to return kicks against Oklahoma State might be few.
Kicker Cole Farden has put 11 of 13 kickoffs into the end zone this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nobody on the UCLA roster is from Oklahoma, but receiver Ryan
Smith and defensive tackle Steve Morgan are from Dallas, within
driving distance of Stillwater.</TE>
<TE>   About 60 of Smith's relatives and friends are making the trek,
including his former coaches and teammates from Marcus High in Flower
Mound, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   About 75 Bruins will make the trip, and Smith was chagrined to see
the list of players who must stay home. Five of them had promised
Smith their allotment of two free tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I've got to tell more of my friends they have to buy their
own," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, who will have about 20 relatives in attendance, was named
a game captain by Toledo.</TE>

<TE>   Asi Faoa received a continuance until Jan. 31, 2003, in his
sentencing for a misdemeanor assault conviction a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   The junior defensive tackle, who was sentenced to 180 days in jail
more than a year ago, has asked to get into a work furlough program
that would allow him to attend classes.</TE>

<DH>Pro football: Quarterback known for his leadership helped
bring in the modern era with Colts in 1958 championship game victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Unitas, the legendary Baltimore Colt quarterback who broke
nearly every NFL passing record and was known for his remarkable
field presence as he ushered in the league's modern era, died
Wednesday afternoon. He was 69.</LD>
<LD>   Unitas suffered a heart attack while working out at a physical
therapy center in Timonium, Md., and, despite efforts by the center's
medical staff to revive him, he died at the scene. His body was taken
to nearby St. Joseph Medical Center.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a swift event," said Vivienne Stearns-Elliott, a
spokeswoman for the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Unitas had undergone emergency triple-bypass surgery in 1993 after
a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Known as the "Meal Ticket" by one teammate and "Johnny U" by the
rest of the football world, Unitas in his familiar No. 19 won three
championships with the Baltimore Colts in an 18-year career. The
two-time NFL most valuable player was the first quarterback to throw
for 40,000 yards and retired after the 1973 season with 22 NFL
records, among them most passes attempted and completed, most yards
gained passing and most seasons leading the league in touchdown
passes.</TE>
<TE>   He threw at least one touchdown pass in 47 consecutive games, a
record that has not come close to being touched. That mark is more
impressive considering he set it when teams played 12 games a season,
not the current 16, so it represents a four-year span.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the greatest quarterback who ever lived," said Sam Huff, a
Hall of Fame linebacker for the New York Giants and Washington
Redskins. "He couldn't run like Fran Tarkenton, he couldn't throw a
screen pass like Y.A. Tittle, he couldn't throw a picture-perfect
pass like Sonny Jurgensen, but he could do everything and make it
work."</TE>
<TE>   Huff played across the line of scrimmage from Unitas in the 1958
championship, when the star quarterback led the Colts to a
come-from-behind victory over the Giants in a match football
historians have long called "the Greatest Game Ever Played."</TE>
<TE>   With 90 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Colts trailing by
three, Unitas completed four passes to move 85 yards and set up the
tying field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I was thinking, 'OK, we tied. At least we'll get
half the money,' " Huff recalled. "Nobody ever talked about sudden
death; I didn't even know what that meant."</TE>
<TE>   The league's commissioner was Bert Bell, who believed no
championship game should end in a tie, and an on-the-spot decision
was made to play until the next team scored.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants got the ball first but were forced to punt. Unitas
responded by driving his team 80 yards in 12 plays, and running back
Alan Ameche scored to give the Colts a 23-17 victory in the
nationally televised game at Yankee Stadium. Suddenly, millions of TV
viewers were hooked on football.</TE>
<TE>   "The drama came from the championship setting rather than the game
itself, until we came down to tie it in the final seconds," Unitas
recalled. "And then it became the first playoff ever to go to sudden
death, and you can't have much more drama than that."</TE>
<TE>   Don Shula, who coached Unitas for seven seasons, said it was
Unitas' toughness as much as anything that allowed him to stay in the
pocket, giving his receivers that much more time to get open.</TE>
<TE>   "I always felt that he invented the two-minute drill," Shula said.
"He seemed to have a clock in his head and always knew how much time
he had to work with."</TE>
<TE>   "He was the first of the great modern quarterbacks, and his
performance set the standard for everyone who followed him at that
position."</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, Unitas suffered a severe injury to his right arm during
an exhibition game and had to sit out most of the season. He threw
only 32 passes that season, and his backup, Earl Morrall, became the
NFL's MVP. Morrall led the Colts to Super Bowl III, where they lost
to Joe Namath and the upstart New York Jets in one of the most
momentous upsets in NFL history.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even play until the fourth quarter," Unitas said in
1994, recalling that Super Bowl stunner. "Any time they bring out in
these little excerpts and they bring the '68 game on, they talk about
Joe Namath being against Johnny Unitas.</TE>
<TE>   "I say, 'Uh-uh.' They're blaming me for all that stuff. I didn't
have anything to do with it until the fourth quarter. I took the team
down and scored a touchdown and we were going for another one when
the game ended."</TE>
<TE>   From his trademark flattop haircut to his black high-top cleats,
Unitas embodied Baltimore. He was always critical of Robert Irsay's
decision to move the Colts to Indianapolis. At one point he said he
did not want to be included in the record books put out by the
Indianapolis Colts.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, however, he was a high-profile supporter of
the Baltimore Ravens, the former Cleveland Browns.</TE>
<TE>   "He was on the short list of players that you can count on one
hand of the greatest to ever play," said Art Modell, owner of the
Ravens. "His impact was enormous. He cared so much for this community
that he made his home. And he fought for his fellow NFL alumni to
increase their benefits and improve their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Added Modell: "This is a sad day for the NFL and an even sadder
day for Baltimore."</TE>
<TE>   Before being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979,
Unitas was named the league's MVP in 1964 and '67; the greatest
quarterback of all time by NFL's 50th Anniversary Committee; player
of the decade by the Associated Press in 1970; and five times
All-Pro.</TE>
<TE>   When asked what it was like to play with Unitas, tight end John
Mackey once said, "It's like being in the huddle with God."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pittsburgh on May 7, 1933, Unitas was only 4 when his
father, who owned a small coal delivery business, died of pneumonia.
His mother went to night school to become a bookkeeper to support her
four children.</TE>
<TE>   Unitas played college ball at the University of Louisville because
Notre Dame turned him down.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first walked on the field at Louisville, the head coach
thought I was a waterboy, I was so small," Unitas said in an HBO
documentary.</TE>
<TE>   He caught the attention of pro scouts as a sophomore in 1952, when
he completed 17 of 22 passes, three for touchdowns, to beat Florida
State, 41-14. He was a ninth-round selection of the Pittsburgh
Steelers in 1955 but--in what has to be one of the biggest personnel
blunders of all time--was cut in training camp.</TE>
<TE>   A man without a team, he worked construction and played for the
Bloomfield Rams for $6 a game in the semipro Greater Pittsburgh
League. Later that year, the Colts received a letter from a Unitas
fan urging them to take a look at him, which Coach Weeb Eubank did.
Unitas was signed in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   "He was bowlegged and slope-shouldered, he looked like a physical
wreck, but, man, could he play," Huff said. "One time when I was
playing for the Redskins, I called nine different defenses. He beat
all nine of them. I didn't want to call any more defenses because
nothing worked against him."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Summerall was the kicker for the Giants when they lost to
Unitas' Colt team in the 1958 and '59 NFL championship games."He
didn't look like a quarterback in those high-top shoes, but he had a
great arm, a great sense of timing, he was a gambler and he had an
unconventional way of calling plays," Summerall said. "Tom Landry,
who was our defensive coordinator, could never figure out his
play-calling. In those days, the quarterbacks called the plays."</TE>
<TE>   Although lots of people, Summerall among them, considered Unitas a
"gambler," he didn't agree with that description.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him one time: 'I thought you were the first guy to be a
gambling quarterback,' " said Ted Marchibroda, a former NFL
quarterback who coached Unitas late in his Colt career. "He said, 'I
was prepared. When I did something, I had a reason for doing it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hall of Fame receiver Raymond Berry played with Unitas on the
Colts through 1967. He remembered Unitas' first NFL appearance in
1956 against the Chicago Bears after starter George Shaw was hurt. On
his first pass, Unitas threw an interception that was returned for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But it was a different Unitas, Berry said, when the Colts got the
ball back.</TE>
<TE>   "It hadn't shaken him up a bit," Berry said. "It was the first
time I saw the real John Unitas."</TE>
<TE>   The Colts won, 28-21.</TE>
<TE>   Unitas finished his career with the San Diego Chargers, after
being sold by the Colts in January 1973 for $150,000. The Chargers
paid him $250,000, double his salary with the Colts, but he played
only five games and was 1-3 as a starter, throwing for three
touchdowns and seven interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, he became the first quarterback to surpass the
40,000-yard mark. The landmark completion went to former USC star
Mike Garrett, now the school's athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember them stopping the game, and I felt like I had been
given a gift," said Garrett, who compared Unitas' impact on football
to the one Ted Williams made on baseball. "I was such a minuscule
part of his career, but I could actually say I was a part. It was a
thrill."</TE>
<TE>   Unitas quit in 1974 with one year remaining on his two-year,
$500,000 contract with the Chargers. He was signed as a football
commentator by CBS for about $90,000 a year. He didn't need the
money, but thought the TV work would be enjoyable. As it happened, he
was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1982 interview with The Times, he said: "I went in totally
unprepared. No training, no coaching, nothing. My first game was a
disaster. I finally had something to say and I'm rolling along when
suddenly the director is talking into my ear, saying, 'Commercial
coming up in 10, 9, 8...' I just stopped talking, right in the middle
of a thought."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of his third year on the air, CBS told Unitas he would
have to improve his command of the language and said he would have to
go back to school and take some classes. For nine consecutive
weekends, Unitas drove from Baltimore to Philadelphia to work with a
specialist.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently, it wasn't enough; the network fired Unitas two years
later.</TE>
<TE>   "I was expected to be glib, funny, insightful and speak
perfectly," he said. "But I wasn't prepared."</TE>
<TE>   After his TV career, Unitas pursued several interests in
Baltimore, where he and his wife, Sandra, raised their three
children, Joey, Chad and Paige. He did a national radio show for
several years from his restaurant, the Golden Arm, and often made
public appearances and speeches.</TE>

<TE>   Cradle of Quarterbacks</TE>
<TE>   Six prominent NFL quarterbacks from western Pennsylvania:</TE>
<TE>   George Blanda: Native of Youngwood was pro football's ageless
wonder. Blanda played 26 seasons as quarterback/kicker for four AFL
and NFL teams--Chicago Bears (1949-58), Baltimore Colts (1959),
Houston Oilers (1966-66) and Oakland Raiders (1967-75).</TE>
<TE>   Jim Kelly: Native of Pittsburgh possessed "linebacker mentality"
and mastered the "no-huddle" offense that became a Buffalo Bill
trademark. Kelly led the Bills to an unprecedented four consecutive
Super Bowl appearances and was the fourth-fastest in NFL history to
reach 30,000 yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Marino: Native of Pittsburgh is the NFL's all-time leader in
yards passing (61,361) and touchdown passes (420). Marino also has
season records for yards passing (5,084) and touchdown passes (48).</TE>
<TE>   Joe Montana: Native of Monongahela was a two-time NFL most
valuable player and led the San Francisco 49ers to four Super Bowl
titles. Earned a reputation for being impervious to pressure, leading
31 fourth-quarter comebacks.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Namath: A Beaver Falls native, "Broadway Joe" guaranteed the
New York Jets of the American Football League would beat the heavily
favored Baltimore Colts of the NFL in Super Bowl III in 1969. The
Jets' 16-7 victory gave the upstart AFL credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Unitas: Native of Pittsburgh led the Baltimore Colts to NFL
championships in 1958 and 1959. "Johnny U" was a two-time NFL MVP.</TE>

<HD>Knee Infection Leaves Simmons Questionable</HD>
<DH>UP NEXT FOR USC at Colorado (1-1)   Saturday, 12:30 PDT,
Ch. 7</DH>

<LD>Melvin Simmons, a starting linebacker for USC, could miss or be
slowed for Saturday's game against Colorado after being hospitalized
for an infection in his knee.</LD>
<LD>   Simmons was taken to USC-University Hospital Tuesday night after
practice. He missed Wednesday's workout and remained in the hospital
while receiving intravenous antibiotics.</LD>
<LD>   Simmons redshirted last season after transferring from Washington
State, where he was a starter for the Cougars. Simmons made five
tackles in the Trojans' opener against Auburn and suffered a mild
concussion.</LD>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore Lee Webb worked in Simmons' place Wednesday
with middle linebacker Mike Pollard and strong-side linebacker Matt
Grootegoed.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Bobby Otani would back up Webb if Simmons does not play
or is slowed against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winston Justice turns 18 on Saturday and will probably celebrate
by becoming the first true freshman to start on the offensive line
for USC since Travis Claridge and Faaesea Mailo started against Notre
Dame in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt junior Eric Torres, who started the opener against Auburn
at right tackle, was told by coaches Wednesday to concentrate on
playing right guard, meaning Justice will almost certainly start at
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   Justice and Torres worked side-by-side with the first-unit offense
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "It's helpful with Torres at guard," Justice said. "He's been here
four years, so he helps me out a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Zach Wilson was expected to start at right guard this
season, but he strained his left foot on the first day of practice
and only participated in limited drills since returning Monday.
Freshman Fred Matua replaced Wilson until he suffered a bruised knee
a few days before the opener. Fifth-year senior Derek Graf started
against Auburn and alternated with Matua, who is still nursing the
injury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Approximately 50 firefighters and police officers attended
practice and dinner at the invitation of Coach Pete Carroll in
observance of last year's Sept. 11 tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "Living a college life and in that kind of setting right now, [the
players] might not be as aware as they need to be of what's going on
and how significant a day this really is," Carroll said. "We were
just trying to respect the day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Senior Chad Pierson, who sat out the opener because of a strained
hamstring, will start against Colorado, Carroll said.... Cornerback
Ronald Nunn practiced with a cast on his right hand because of a
broken right thumb suffered Tuesday. Nunn said he felt soreness but
was otherwise unaffected.... The Trojans will practice without pads
today and will travel Friday to Boulder, Colo., where they will
conduct a walk-through at Folsom Field.... Jennifer Fertig, the
daughter of former USC quarterback, assistant coach and assistant
athletic director Craig Fertig, died of Epstein-Barr virus on Tuesday
at Hoag Memorial Hospital in Newport Beach. She was 31. A memorial
service will be held Wednesday at Pacific View Memorial Park in
Corona del Mar.</TE>

<HD>Washburn Won't Face Charges</HD>
<DH>Jurisprudence: Orange County district attorney, citing lack
of evidence, declines to file sexual assault charges.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County district attorney Wednesday declined to file sexual
assault charges against Angel pitcher Jarrod Washburn, closing the
matter within hours of receiving the case from Anaheim police
investigators.</LD>
<LD>   "We have thoroughly reviewed the case, and we are rejecting the
case based on a lack of sufficient evidence at this time," Deputy
Dist. Atty. Randy Payne said.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn had been under investigation for 10 days. He left the
team to be with his family Tuesday, when Anaheim police publicly
confirmed the investigation of the allegations, and rejoined the team
Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm just happy I've been cleared and that this is all done with,"
Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn never was interviewed by police, said Edward Munoz, an
attorney who assisted Washburn's agent, Scott Boras, during the
investigation. Munoz said an assortment of credibility issues
surfaced soon after the young woman in question made her accusation
to police Sept. 1, after she allegedly met with Washburn at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   Munoz said that security personnel working that night had seen her
at the stadium but could not corroborate elements of her story to
investigators, including that she had yelled for help. Munoz also
said the young woman lied to Washburn about her age.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would a young fan lie about their age, unless you were trying
to appear older or younger for a particular goal?" Munoz said. "That
should be a red flag."</TE>
<TE>   Munoz said he was baffled and disappointed that police chose to
confirm the investigation without acknowledging that there were
serious discrepancies in the case, exposing Washburn to false
accusations that were broadcast across the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that was very unfair," Munoz said.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn declined to discuss details of the investigation but said
it had taken its toll on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't slept real well. I haven't eaten real well," he said.
"I'm sure I'll eat a little better and sleep a little better
tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Boras said he was pleased that the district attorney had cleared
Washburn so soon after the allegations became public but said that "a
stigma is attached" nonetheless. Washburn, popular with fans and
teammates, said he would not stop signing autographs and talking with
fans. He hopes he will be treated fairly when he makes his next start
Friday at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope the fans can see this for what it was," he said.
"This was an accusation. It was determined not to have any merit."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn, 28, is married with one son. He is the ace of the Angel
pitching staff and ranks among league leaders with a 17-5 record and
3.32 earned-run average.</TE>
<TE>   "We know one of our brothers is going through a rough time,"
closer Troy Percival said. "Beyond that, we're all focused on one
thing. I'm sure he's still focused on winning ballgames.
Unfortunately, he got a little sidetracked. But he'll be back out
here competing with us shortly."</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy said he was less worried about
Washburn as a pitcher than as a husband and father.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody needs that kind of stuff coming into their house," Kennedy
said. "We were behind him all the way."</TE>
