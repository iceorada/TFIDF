<LD>It's been a rough year for Eddie Murphy. First his buddy-cop comedy
"Showtime" with Robert De Niro failed to make waves with either
critics or moviegoers. Then his next film, the $100-million-plus "The
Adventures of Pluto Nash," took two years to come out and wasn't even
screened for critics.</LD>
<LD>   And early reviews of his newest film, the action-comedy "I Spy,"
which opens Friday, haven't been very encouraging.</LD>
<LD>   The action-comedy is very, very loosely based on the 1965-68 NBC
action series, which broke the color barrier for dramatic television
series. "I Spy" was the first non-comedy series to star an African
American actor, Bill Cosby. He won three consecutive Emmy Awards for
his performance as Alexander Scott, a Temple graduate, Rhodes scholar
and superspy whose cover was as a trainer of tennis pro Kelly
Robinson (Robert Culp), a Princeton-educated spy.</LD>
<TE>   The movie version, directed by Betty Thomas, who also helmed "The
Brady Bunch Movie" and Murphy's "Doctor Dolittle," is played strictly
for laughs. Murphy takes on the Robinson role -- in this incarnation,
a womanizing middleweight boxing champion -- and Owen Wilson is
Scott, a crackerjack secret agent who is shy around the ladies. They
team up to recover a state-of-the-art reconnaissance aircraft that
has fallen into the hands of an arms dealer (Malcolm McDowell).</TE>
<TE>   Still, don't count Murphy out. He's had great box office success
with his remakes of famous films, turning his versions of "The Nutty
Professor" and "Doctor Dolittle" into franchises.</TE>

<HD>Shortlist's big job: musical education</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU> Randy Lewis</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The founders of the Shortlist Music Awards, to be announced Tuesday
night at the Henry Fonda Theatre in Hollywood, know what they're up
against in the vastly overcrowded awards-show field, but they are
optimistic that they can be noticed.</LD>
<LD>   It helps that they have a relatively modest goal. They're not out
to top the ratings of the MTV Video Music Awards or other televised
awards specials; they just want to let fans know about records that
probably won't be honored at all those other ceremonies.</LD>
<LD>   "In everything we do, we try to think about that consumer for whom
art directs their lifestyle," says Greg Spotts, an entertainment
marketing consultant who started the Shortlist Awards last year with
Tom Sarig, vice president of artists and repertoire for MCA Records.
"A lot of those people want to stay up to date, but they're busy
people. So we thought, 'Let's give them a crib sheet of some good new
stuff.' "</LD>
<TE>   Last year the Shortlist winner was "Agaetis Byrjun" by Icelandic
pop group Sigur Ros. This year's 10 finalists are the latest albums
from Aphex Twin, Bjork, Cee-Lo, DJ Shadow, the Doves, N.E.R.D., the
Avalanches, the Flaming Lips, the Hives and Zero 7.</TE>
<TE>   What gives the Shortlist its distinction is the panel that chooses
each year's winner: It's made up of critically acclaimed musicians,
along with a few critics who do the acclaiming. The two eligibility
requirements are that nominated albums be single-artist, full-length
albums released during the previous year and that the album hasn't
reached gold status (for sales of 500,000 copies).</TE>
<TE>   The effect of the award?</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, when Sigur Ros won, sales of their album jumped 75%
the next week," Sarig says, "and it continued to sell considerably
more than it had before. It didn't sell a million, but it definitely
had quite a bump, and we think that's good." Its U.S. sales to date
are 122,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan.</TE>
<TE>   "The important thing to us," he adds, "is not to have a big party
and give out an award. We're doing real-world things in an effort to
grow the audience for some of these records that are not making it
through the regular media channels."</TE>

<HD>Spirits rise at a monster of a rave</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Baltin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attendance at the fifth annual Monster Massive rave Saturday was
up a few thousand from last year's estimated 17,000, but a better
indicator of recovery from dance music's post-Sept. 11 downturn was a
reinvigorated spirit.</LD>
<LD>   That spirit was illustrated when the escalator inside the L.A.
Sports Arena was closed by security. Instead of getting rowdy, the
young fans thronged to the pedestrian ramps, with those at the bottom
sending Mardi Gras-like whoops and yells upward, while fans at the
top shouted down to their counterparts below.</LD>
<LD>   The festival, which filled the arena and the surrounding grounds
with colorful, often skimpy costumes, swirling lasers and giant video
screens, often took on a surreal quality, with such images as Snow
White dancing outdoors with Cinderella during an inspired set by
Chicago's DJ Funk, who made an auspicious L.A. debut.</LD>
<TE>   But therein lies the rub with festivals of this size. Too often
the music can be overshadowed by the spectacle. Monster Massive
featured nearly 50 performances on five stages, showcasing many
subgenres of dance music, as well as live hip-hop from Medusa. But
it's the crowd and the costumes that leave the indelible impressions.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a musical statement, it may have been in the event's
setup. The "Tomb of Doom" stage, featuring largely progressive sets
by the likes of DJ Irene and Judge Jules, was on the main arena
floor, which last year held the house music stage. So it appears that
the obvious, large-scale, arena rock-esque synthesizer hooks of
progressive have become the sound of choice in the dance world 2002.</TE>
<TE>   That impression was driven home when Richard "Humpty" Vission and
Anne Savage, playing back to back, attracted thousands to the main
stage with some nice, but not inspired moments, while outdoors the
superlative tag team of Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson was
redefining house music with some serious tribal beats and wicked
stops and starts -- while their audience gradually dwindled.</TE>

<KH>NEW YORK, N.Y. GERALDINE BAUM</KH>
<HD>Bratton, celebrity in transit, bids farewell</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GERALDINE BAUM</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Bratton returned to the scene of his political crime before
heading west last week to take over the LAPD. The tented garden
behind Tina Brown's East Side apartment and the people who filled it
were just the kind of evidence that cost Bratton the job in New York
back in 1996.</LD>
<LD>   Amid the climbing greenery on a postage-stamp patio, New York
swells and the media elite had gathered to bid Bratton farewell --
and perhaps to be remembered by him the next time they need a source
in L.A. Every blond in network TV was present, not to mention all the
usual social suspects -- Mario Cuomo, David and Helen Gurley Brown,
Don Hewitt and Regis Philbin.</LD>
<LD>   This is the kind of room Bratton savors. He was working rooms like
this by night in the 1990s, a buttoned-down rock, relentlessly
droning wonkish paradigms amid the celebrity froth. By day, he was
shaking up the city first as transit police chief and later as master
of the entire city force.</LD>
<TE>   The city became a much safer place, an achievement Bratton took
credit for in a Time magazine cover story, much to the dismay of
America's mayor -- merely New York's mayor back then, Rudy Giuliani
-- who threw Bratton out. He couldn't stand that the police
commissioner's popularity exceeded his own in the polls and among the
power brokers. And it didn't help that Bratton had a six-figure book
deal and a free ride on investment tycoon Henry Kravis' private jet.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the celebrities sipping white wine at Tina's on Tuesday
night rolled their eyes at all the fanfare surrounding Bratton's new
post, the way he draws limelight instead of preparing quietly for a
tough new assignment. "60 Minutes" is filming his first week in L.A.,
which may explain why Mike Wallace was there in full makeup. Or not.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton is heading for one of the few jobs in law enforcement
that is compatible with his habit of celebrity snorkeling. Where he's
going, police chiefs and mayors have parity. They fight -- Daryl
Gates and Tom Bradley famously didn't speak for a year -- but neither
is subordinate to the other.</TE>
<TE>   So Bratton and his wife, Rikki Klieman, a "Court TV" interviewer,
can keep on partying, so long as he also brings luster back to the
Los Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   At this fourth going-away party (or were there five?), Bratton, in
a somber pinstriped suit, looked content, if not a little
uncomfortable. With Henry Kissinger and Tom Wolfe in the room, he
wasn't exactly the center of gravity. He had a few friends here -- a
judge, his ghostwriter, another cop.</TE>
<TE>   John Timoney, his former deputy and competition for the L.A. job,
had spent the day as a TV analyst about the suburban D.C. sniper. But
when the two cops -- and close friends -- finally greeted one another
in the back of the garden, they could have been in the kitchen
getting free sandwiches from the help.</TE>
<TE>   "There's John Timoney," Bratton said, with a rare wide grin. "He
used to be somebody." "Yeah, and there's Bratton. He's had nine
lives," Timoney declared, noting that his friend's Boston accent is
still a handicap. "He still hasn't learned how to say depaaaaatment
as in 'police department.' " This was definitely not the same tone
the guest of honor had struck earlier, somberly chatting up
Kissinger.</TE>
<TE>   Kissinger and Bratton apparently struck up an acquaintance after a
couple of lunches back when Bratton was chief. It didn't seem
incongruous, at least not to Kissinger, that a top cop might be
socializing with a top diplomat.</TE>
<TE>   "He should be here," Kissinger said on his way out of Tina's
party, as Paula Zahn tried to elbow her way into the conversation
with him in a packed hallway. "He shouldn't be just waiting for some
crime to happen. He should understand the people."</TE>
<TE>   This is the people?</TE>
<TE>   They were Tina's people and Rikki's people and Tina's husband,
Harry Evans', people, and even Bratton's lawyer's people.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfe said he'd met Bratton through his lawyer, Ed Hayes, at
Elaine's, where Bratton had held a sort of night court for years at a
table with his lieutenants, great late-night drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   "Good, colorful policemen are always stars," said Wolfe, a
standout himself in a brown-and-white tattersall suit and baby-blue
tie.</TE>
<TE>   So how exactly did this crowd think the Brattons would be received
in L.A. and by whom? This type of Noah's ark party that Tina Brown
specializes in -- where each species arrives in black town cars two
by two -- is not as common in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Gossip maven Cindy Adams confided, "I happen to know that
invitations are already out."</TE>
<TE>   Felicia Taylor, a local anchor for WNBC and actor Rod's daughter,
grew up in Los Angeles. She had a hard time imagining where Bratton
would fit in. "But I feel assured that Rikki will help him on this
front," Taylor said of the relentlessly social Mrs. Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Klieman, Bratton's fourth wife, has made it clear she'll be moving
to the West full time within a year. But first she wants to find work
and was overheard musing about becoming an actress.</TE>
<TE>   "60 Minutes' " Steve Kroft pointed out that Donna Hanover, a
former Mrs. Giuliani and also a TV reporter, had struggled to create
a show-biz career. Klieman smiled demurely, suggesting nothing would
stop her.</TE>
<TE>   Only KB Home's Bruce Karatz, a bicoastal millionaire, could easily
rattle off a vision of Bratton on the other coast: "I see him at the
Palm in Hollywood or the Palm near the Staples Center before a Laker
game or at a dinner with Magic Johnson, Jennifer Aniston -- Brad
would be off making a movie -- the president of USC, maybe somebody
big in the gay community.... "</TE>
<TE>   Karatz had only just met Bratton but is convinced he's a winner:
"I talked to him tonight for 10 minutes and I can tell he's going to
bring a whole new page to the LAPD."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in another corner, Bratton was describing in stupefying
detail his new "jurisdictions" to a beautiful, red-lipsticked,
Chardonnay-sipping petite New Yorker. Until finally, numbed, she made
her escape.</TE>

<HD>A collection of graceful 'sketches'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Merle Rubin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the last 3 1/2 decades, Wislawa Szymborska, the Polish poet
awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1996, has been writing a
newspaper column called "Nonrequired Reading." Occasioned by a motley
array of books that have come her way -- everything and anything from
an encyclopedia of assassination to a do-it-yourself guide to
wallpapering -- these short pieces (around 500 words each) are not
book reviews, she declares, but "sketches." Some, as it happens,
contain astute criticism of the books in question, but in the main,
Szymborska simply uses the books as jumping-off points.</LD>
<LD>   Informal, unpretentious, full of common sense, shrewd insight and
wry humor (all ably captured in Clare Cavanagh's fine translation),
Szymborska's sketches have a matter-of-fact ease and simplicity that
will win the hearts of readers and the envy of other writers who know
how hard it can be to achieve such grace.</LD>
<LD>   Born in 1923 in Krakow, Szymborska lived through the brutal Nazi
occupation and the subsequent communist regime to see democracy at
last. As one reads this chronologically arranged selection, which
begins in 1968, one is struck by the unwavering humanity and
compassion of this woman's voice.</LD>
<TE>   Whether she is considering books on birds, Neanderthals, fossils,
tyrants or extraterrestrial life, Szymborska's great gift is her
ability to see straight through to the essentials. UFOs leave her
cold: "The reader may think that I'm a thick-skulled rationalist who
can't even entertain the idea that anything strange ... could still
happen on our ordinary earth. It's just the opposite -- for me there
is no such thing as an 'ordinary' earth. The more we find out about
it, the more mysterious it is, and the life it holds is a bizarre
cosmic anomaly."</TE>
<TE>   Reading the diary kept by Dostoevsky's wife, she muses:
"Objectively, life with her Fedya was a hell of fear, anxiety, and
humiliation. Subjectively, though, it made her happy. One smile or
kind word was enough to dry her tears, and she'd gladly remove her
wedding band, her earrings, and her shawl so that Fedya could pawn
them, then use the proceeds to gamble and lose everything once again
.... We're dealing here with the phenomenon of great love. Detached
observers always ask in such cases: 'So what does she (he) see in him
(her)?' Such questions are best left in peace: great love is never
justified. It's like the little tree that springs up in some
inexplicable fashion on the side of a cliff: where are its roots,
what does it feed on, what miracle produces those green leaves? But
it does exist and it really is green -- clearly, then, it's getting
whatever it needs to survive."</TE>
<TE>   The encyclopedia of assassinations sets her thinking of the
innocent civilians who have replaced rulers and leaders as the
primary targets of today's new breed of political murder, terrorism:
"Their misfortune was not that they held some rank, some office, but
the apparently meaningless fact that at a given moment they went in
somewhere, left somewhere, stopped somewhere, or simply went back to
their own home for the night. I think the world stands in urgent need
of ... an encyclopedia [of the non-famous victims of terrorism]. Done
scrupulously and impartially, it would be a worthy contender for the
Nobel Peace Prize."</TE>
<TE>   A French historian's biographical attempt to "scrape the tar off
the fiendish Catherine de Medici" impresses her not at all:</TE>
<TE>   "He ascribes virtues to her that somehow never managed to surface
even once during the course of her thirty-year reign. He calls her
the 'Italian Montaigne' (Lord have mercy) and 'an artist who lent her
creative gifts to the realm of politics.' Seven civil wars that she
either couldn't or wouldn't avert don't speak well of her artistry
.... So I'm not convinced by the superlatives with which the author
deluges Mme de Medici...."</TE>
<TE>   Nor is Szymborska beguiled by a German art historian's efforts to
present Vermeer as representative of his era:</TE>
<TE>   "According to this critic, the work [one of Vermeer's last
paintings] signals both the age's decline and the waning of the
artist's inspiration: it is cold, artificial, and calculated. The
lady standing by her instrument is, he writes, psychologically
'isolated' in her 'monumentally frozen gesture.' I look and disagree
at every turn. I see a miracle of daylight falling on different
materials: human skin, the silk gown, the chair's upholstery, the
whitewashed wall. Vermeer constantly repeats this miracle, but in
fresh variants and dazzling new permutations. What on earth have
coldness and isolation got to do with this? The woman puts her hand
on the virginal as if she'd like to play us a passage in jest, to
remind us of something. She turns her head toward us with a lovely
half-smile on her not particularly pretty face. The smile is
thoughtful, with a touch of maternal forbearance. And for three
hundred years she's been looking this way at all of us, including
critics."</TE>
<TE>   Not unlike the thoughtful, forbearing half-smile that lights up
Szymborska's writing.</TE>

<HD>A heated Mc-culture clash</HD>
<DH>In a city that holds fast to tradition, McDonald's wants a
spot in the historic main square.</DH>

<LD>OAXACA, Mexico--The zocalo, or central plaza, a 473-year-old
colonnaded square, is the heart of this city, and its languid beat
almost never changes. In timeless rhythm, people linger in sidewalk
cafes under its stone arches, watching passersby stroll in the shade
of Indian laurels around its gazebo. The same two dozen local
merchants along its perimeters have been fixtures for years, enjoying
moderate, easygoing prosperity.</LD>
<LD>   That's why eyebrows shot up in May when El Mundo Elegante shut
down after 52 years of selling clothes on the zocalo's eastern edge.
The explanation, two months later, was an even bigger jolt: The owner
had agreed to lease the place to McDonald's.</LD>
<LD>   The ensuing protest in defense of "slow food" has stalled the
hamburger chain's bid for an operating license and opened a debate
here over the cultural correctness of Big Macs. The debate is echoing
across Mexico, where large American retailers have become ubiquitous
in a decade of freer trade but have yet to become universally
accepted.</LD>
<TE>   Oaxaca is world-renowned for its Indo-Spanish cuisine and
mind-boggling variety of chili peppers. It boasts seven kinds of
mole, a painstaking sauce that takes three days to prepare.
Deep-fried crickets, not French fries, are the snack of choice.</TE>
<TE>   More than a food fight, however, the conflict is about money,
power and urban geopolitics: Should a multinational giant, in return
for investment in one of Mexico's poorest states, be ceded space in
the very center of a culturally distinctive city?</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps sacred is too strong a word, but our zocalo has a style,
a soul, a way of being that would be altered forever by American fast
food," said Francisco Toledo, a leading Mexican artist and Oaxaca
native, who launched the protest with the battle cry "No McZocalo!"</TE>
<TE>   Yet people here are sharply divided over the proposed franchise.
The city's business elite, backed by many who simply love burgers,
argues that Oaxaca can ill afford to snub a foreign investor that
promises to respect the zocalo's treasured Spanish colonial
architecture (no golden arches allowed) and create more than 70 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Gabino Cue Monteagudo proclaims neutrality as he
struggles to reconcile fast versus slow, growth versus tradition. The law
allows him to veto any project that endangers "intangible" elements
of the city's cultural heritage, including cuisine, but no mayor here
has ever used that power.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxaca is still a "slow" city, and the mayor is in no rush to
decide.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this battle has a laid-back style, unlike other recent
fights over globalization in Mexico and elsewhere that have stirred
violent passions. The farmers who forced the cancellation of a new
international airport for Mexico City in August and the marchers
resisting plans for a Costco bargain warehouse on the site of an old
spa in Cuernavaca have wielded machetes and clashed with police.</TE>
<TE>   In the most famous attack, farmer and activist Jose Bove drove a
tractor through the glass front of a McDonald's under construction in
Millau, a cheese-making center in southwestern France, three years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   In Oaxaca, Toledo and his band of artists, writers, intellectuals
and conservationists showed disdain for McDonald's last summer by
gathering people in the zocalo and giving away tamales by the
thousands. The rallies have been peaceful, the debate civil, the
deliberations glacial.</TE>
<TE>   A range of ills</TE>
<TE>   Rather than tackle the issue head-on, Mayor Cue chose to move the
discussion beyond McDonald's to confront a wider range of ills
degrading the old city center. This month, he organized a six-day
forum so Oaxacans could think up ways to rescue that 188-block zone
from traffic jams, vandalism, noise, shoddy maintenance, unlicensed
vendors and marchers for political causes who camp in the streets for
weeks on end.</TE>
<TE>   "All the polemics over McDonald's, all this energy, we're trying
to channel into something more ambitious: a revival of our city
center," the mayor said in an interview. "What we eventually decide
about McDonald's is secondary."</TE>
<TE>   The City Council will soon debate the licensing request, he said,
after searching for a consensus in hours of transcripts from the
forum and thousands of still-uncounted ballots cast in an informal
referendum over the last weeks.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's has opened 235 franchises across Mexico since 1985. One
opened here in 1993, but it is clustered with Sears, Office Depot and
Sam's Club on the city's outskirts, where some Oaxacans think such
retailers should be confined.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Santamaria, who manages that McDonald's, said
market studies pointed to the zocalo as the ideal spot for a second
restaurant because of heavy pedestrian traffic there. He noted that
the chain has put franchises on or near the central squares of five
Mexican cities with nothing like the opposition raised here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to hurt the culture of Oaxaca to serve hamburgers
in the zocalo," said Santamaria, a Frenchman who is married to a
Oaxacan. "Nobody is going to hold a gun to your head and say you have
to eat at McDonald's."</TE>
<TE>   Santamaria's franchise is so popular with people like Jacinta
Chares, whose sons are 6 and 10, that they favor the zocalo's central
location. "It would take one bus ride to get my kids to McDonald's
instead of three," said the 30-year-old waitress, who serves
traditional Oaxacan fare at a zocalo cafe.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were up to the kids, McDonald's would win their franchise,"
said Guillermo Garcia Manzano, the city's top official for tourism
and commercial development.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of adult protest took many by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   Josefina Diaz, 57, whose Spanish immigrant father founded El Mundo
Elegante, said she thought there was no reason to say no when
McDonald's offered to rent her two-story property. She had decided to
close the store and go abroad for cancer treatment and she still
doesn't understand "the scandal kicked up by that painter," referring
to Toledo. She let go of 18 employees, about one-fourth the number
McDonald's would hire.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got McDonald's in the center of Paris, Rome, London,
Moscow, Beijing, everywhere," she said. "It's normal."</TE>
<TE>   Gustavo Esteva, a researcher at Oaxaca's Center of Intercultural
Encounters and Dialogue, rose at the recent forum to warn against
that sort of logic. The fast-food chain's penetration of city centers
around the globe is nothing less than "a march of cultural conquest,"
he declared, and the line must be drawn here.</TE>
<TE>   Such McDonald's-bashing dominated the forum, which was
co-sponsored by the mayor and Toledo's Pro-Oax group. Pro-Oax
represents Oaxaca's artistic community, which has recently bought and
renovated many buildings in the city center in hope of reviving its
dying residential neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   The artists are at odds with an established business elite, who
own about 55% of the real estate downtown, over who calls the shots
there. The two groups have taken opposing stands on McDonald's,
trading jabs in the press.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo, 62, whose rumpled attire and wild mane are icons in the
anti-McDonald's fight, suggested at one point that Oaxacans boycott
not only American fast food but all local restaurants, and eat at
home to be sure their food is not contaminated.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Hernandez Cruz, president of the local chamber
of restaurant owners, said that if the painter were truly concerned
about hygiene, "he should bathe, shave and cut his nails."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who imports Texas beef for his Oaxaca steak house, said
his chamber supports McDonald's in the name of variety and free
enterprise. "If we served only traditional food here," he declared,
"some people would die of hunger."</TE>
<TE>   On closer inspection, fast food and other cultural imports already
have a foothold in the zocalo. Street vendors sell hamburgers there,
as do some of the cafes, and Disney characters rise above the crowds
on helium balloons hawked by the hundreds.</TE>
<TE>   A multinational invasion</TE>
<TE>   But McDonald's might herald a full-scale multinational invasion of
the colonnaded square, traditionalists argue. The company reportedly
agreed to pay Diaz $8,000 per month rent, well above the going rate.
"What would stop other merchants there from giving up their space to
Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken, which are also ready to pay
high rent?" Toledo asks.</TE>
<TE>   "He may be right about that," said Iliana de la Vega, who runs El
Naranjo, an acclaimed restaurant offering traditional Oaxacan food
just off the square. "But I think it's more dangerous for a few
people to dictate what kind of food can be serve in the zocalo and
what kind cannot."</TE>
<TE>   "What's authentic? Who's going to judge?" she asked. "If we
have to accept other forms of business to raise our standard of living,
I'm for it. We don't want to preserve our poverty."</TE>

<HD>A name that opens doors is getting besmirched</HD>
<DH>David E. Kelley's new drama, 'Girls Club,' stumbled badly
in its debut, and if ratings don't improve tonight, it could be case
closed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Girls Club" is not just a Fox drama that debuted to weak ratings
last Monday -- it is a David E. Kelley drama, which makes the thud
with which it landed all the more noteworthy. Those 5.8-million
viewers "Girls Club" attracted left the show fifth in its time
period, far behind the CBS sitcoms "Everybody Loves Raymond" and
"Still Standing," which averaged 19 million viewers, and slightly
behind "Everwood," a new drama on the WB. If those ratings repeat
tonight for the second episode of "Girls Club," Fox could pull the
show before the November ratings sweeps begin Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Even as a flawed drama, "Girls Club" seems curiously like an
imitation of Kelley, by Kelley, as opposed to the unadulterated voice
of "The Practice," "Ally McBeal" and "Picket Fences," his three most
acclaimed series. While he can't be expected to make great TV each
time out, this latest effort bemuses even those who have worked with
Kelley (who declined to be interviewed for this article).</LD>
<TE>   What is clear is that Fox scheduled the series before the pilot
was shot, making "Girls Club" this year's version of a never-ending
story, in which networks invest in marquee names, making all but
blind commitments to show creators with great credits. Kelley has a
development deal with Twentieth Century Fox Television estimated to
be worth more than $100 million, and Fox is desperate for fresh
dramas, with the departure of franchises such as "The X-Files" and
"Ally McBeal." Given Kelley's track record, he would seem a good bet,
and in "Girls Club" he delivered what the network ultimately wanted
-- something with his name on it.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls Club" is about three attractive associate attorneys
swimming with the sharks in a San Francisco law firm. (One of the
publicity photos has lead actresses Kathleen Robertson, Chyler Leigh
and Gretchen Mol dressed in a kind of Catholic schoolgirl chic, their
lips freshly glossed. They look ready to take your deposition.) Based
on the first two episodes, Kelley tries to dance between quippy
lawyer talk, inflamed ethical speechifying, WB angst and
HBO-influenced sex talk. He's done this well elsewhere, of course,
but not here. You could blame the actors, but then, they're so darn
cute -- living together, working together and playing together.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley, it should be noted, has a success ratio that any TV
writer-producer would envy, and he is hardly the first lionized
auteur to turn out a stinker. That list features the most respected
writer-producers in the business, including John Wells of "ER" and
"The West Wing" fame (less known for such shows as "Trinity" in 1998
and "Citizen Baines" in 2001), and Steven Bochco, who gave the Boston
attorney his first Hollywood break, as Wunderkind writer of "L.A.
Law."</TE>
<TE>   After the revolutionary success of his '80s dramas "Hill Street
Blues" and "L.A. Law," Bochco signed a development deal with ABC,
worth tens of millions of dollars, to create more shows. He proceeded
to make "Cop Rock," a musical cop show, "Capitol Critters," an
animated sitcom set in the White House, and "Murder One," which
followed a first-degree murder case over the course of a season.</TE>
<TE>   None of those shows stuck, but at least Bochco, who would go on to
co-create the freshly gritty drama "NYPD Blue," was using his deity
status to experiment with what was creatively possible in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Kelley has said that he wanted to do a show about female
associates in an old boys network, but there is something retro about
it all -- an enlightened male fantasy in which hot lawyers fight for
respect (and they're hot!). Kelley has run afoul of critics for his
portrayal of women in the past -- even on "Ally McBeal," which turned
Calista Flockhart into an icon of the newer, younger professional
woman, as Kelley explored the zany, if at times juvenile, side of his
comedy. "Ally McBeal" won the 1999 Emmy for best comedy; in an
unprecedented sweep, "The Practice" won the same year for best drama.
At the time, Kelley's new ABC show, "Snoops," about sexy detectives,
wouldn't make it past a season, but whatever: Kelley and Fox
restructured their relationship, to the tune of boffo bucks.</TE>
<TE>   But it would be misleading simply to chalk this up to a successful
producer pressured by a network. Kelley is too competitive to throw
something on the air he didn't believe in, simply to fulfill a deal,
according to several sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. At
the same time, "when he doesn't have his heart in something, this is
what he ends up with," said a writer who formerly worked on one of
Kelley's shows after viewing the premiere episode of "Girls Club."</TE>
<TE>   According to the reputation that precedes him, Kelley is a
prolific writer who crafts episodes for multiple on-air series, in
long hand, cocooned from the madness of producing network television
by a cadre of producer/protectors. When Kelley does farm out scripts,
he often ends up rewriting them, say sources, and he has never been
much interested in shepherding another writer's idea. That may
change. "He feels that it's time to start making this transition into
becoming a producer," said manager Marty Adelstein, Kelley's longtime
representative, referring to the volume of scripts Kelley still
writes.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Kelley is said to be refocused on "The Practice,"
after withdrawing from the show last season, though he has handed
over the reins on "Boston Public," in its third season on Fox, to
another writer-producer.</TE>
<TE>   But last spring, Kelley was being Kelley, with three shows on the
air. One, "Ally," required a swan song episode. And Fox, hurting for
fresh dramas, wanted him to conjure another series, as he is
contractually obliged to do. So Kelley wrote a family drama that --
according to several sources involved -- the network felt was too
soft, not salable under the Fox brand. They wanted something
glossier, something younger-skewing, for women. Inevitably, the
trendy HBO hit "Sex and the City" was invoked.</TE>
<TE>   "People were surprised, and delightedly so, that he was willing to
pick up pen and pad and create another show, particularly when this
network is in the middle of a rebuilding process," said Sandy
Grushow, who, as chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment Group,
oversees both the studio and network side of Fox's operation. "It's a
bet you'd make any day of the week."</TE>
<TE>   In July, Kelley met the media at the annual TV critics gathering
in Pasadena to promote "Girls Club." The show, he said, would draw on
his own experiences as a young lawyer observing that female
associates weren't afforded the same advantages as men.</TE>
<TE>   "The toughest thing about television, when you create a ...
success, you have to be able to do a hundred of them," Kelley was
quoted as saying. "That puts a limit on originality to a certain
extent. Because some things that are very bold, very different, will
wear out after 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours. The original luster will
fall off."</TE>
<TE>   Some weeks after this, Kelley wrote another pilot. It is
described, according to someone who has read it, as a show that
exposes the bombast of reality and news programs. Maybe the timing of
Kelley's inspiration is coincidental. Either way, Fox will surely
need it.</TE>

<HD>Brazilian group gives a fusion lesson</HD>

<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be an exaggeration to suggest that there's been a buzz on
the jazz scene regarding the Brazilian group Banda Mantiqueira.
Despite a 1998 Grammy nomination for its recording "Aldeia," the Sao
Paulo-based, 14-piece ensemble has largely been known only via
word-of-mouth recommendations from musicians who have heard the
impressive band either in Brazil or during one of its international
tours.</LD>
<LD>   In the Orange County Performing Arts Center's Segerstrom Hall on
Saturday night, Southland listeners finally had an opportunity to
experience the work of what is obviously a world-class jazz
aggregation.</LD>
<LD>   The initial announcement of its appearance with the Orquestra de
Sao Paulo listed the debut performance of a work titled "Night Flight
to Rio." But, perhaps in an effort to present a program with more
familiar material to an audience that clearly had no idea what to
expect, the combined ensembles instead offered a set of material
embracing the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao Bosco, Chico
Buarque and Ary Barroso.. The resulting performances were
extraordinary examples of what was once referred to as Third Stream
music -- a seamless blending of classical and jazz.</LD>
<TE>   In the past, however, "seamless" was usually an illusion. Not so
with the Banda and the Orquestra, either in the arrangements and
compositions, or in the capacity of the musicians from each unit to
generate an astounding degree of rhythmic swing.</TE>
<TE>   A medley of choros by Pixinguinha and Jaco do Bandolin was
arranged by Mantiqueira leader Nailor Azevedo (more familiarly known
as "Proveta") into a work that climaxed with a wildly exuberant
exchange of fleet-fingered passages curling in and around both
ensembles. Brazilian composer Guinga's "Baiao de Lacan" (also
arranged by Proveta) offered similarly highflying passages. Stunning
solo passages surfaced throughout each of the works -- from
saxophonist-clarinetist Proveto, trumpeter Walmir Gil and valve
trombonist Francois de Lima.</TE>
<TE>   Banda Mantiqueira clearly deserves wider exposure -- at the very
least a tour of its own. But its work with the Orquestra is equally
important. At its best it is a model for jazz-classical fusion that
should be examined carefully by the many American composer-arrangers
who seem to have such a difficult time threading these seemingly
disparate genres together. The Brazilians, as it turns out, have
found a way.</TE>

<HD>Adams permeates the evening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard S. Ginell</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles Philharmonic's first Green Umbrella concert of the
season took place Saturday night at Royce Hall -- which was unusual
-- and revolved around the music and influence of John Adams -- which
was not, given his omnipresence in concert halls and in the press.</LD>
<LD>   If there is one guiding principle that animates Adams, it is the
credo, use everything. It didn't start with him, but he seems to be
the embodiment of that spirit in our time, one that doesn't place a
value judgment on whether an influence came from Beethoven, Duke
Ellington or a television cartoon. What matters is how it is used,
whether it works and how the composer expresses it through his or her
unique personality.</LD>
<LD>   That spirit has been thoroughly absorbed by Derek Bermel in his
1998 clarinet concerto "Voices," which Adams conducted with evident
relish while Bermel handled the solo part. But Bermel's piece often
goes beyond the boundaries of taste in his zeal to throw in
everything he's absorbed and gets trapped in a quicksand of dead-end
effects and banal pop.</LD>
<TE>   The first movement became a wearisome slapstick shouting match
between the streetwise clarinet and the jeering orchestra, and the
piece concluded with an arch, elephantine attempt to fuse funk and
big-band jazz with a symphony orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   After intermission, Esa-Pekka Salonen emerged to take charge of
Adams' massive culminating symphonic work of the 1990s, "Naive and
Sentimental Music," which stands as a mid-career summary of the
composer's now-extravagant orchestral manner. It was illuminating to
hear the work again in the Royce acoustics (it was premiered by
Salonen and the Philharmonic at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in February
1999), with newly revealed details in needle-sharp relief, the
chugging climaxes gathering with greater cumulative force and logic.</TE>
<TE>   The other Adams work on the program, "Hallelujah Junction," for
two pianos, was written in the late '90s. In some ways, it is a
throwback to early Adams, with its phasing Minimalist grooves,
interrupted by an unabashedly Romantic Rachmaninoff-tinged interlude
in the center, concluding with a shouting, stabbing hallelujah chorus
of sorts. Pianists Grant Gershon and Gloria Cheng, for whom the piece
was written, did the honors.</TE>

<HD>Where rubberneckers meet rubber noses</HD>
<DH>Exhibition of clown art, inspired by Diane Keaton's book on
the subject, draws a crowd of visitors to Bergamot Station galleries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Haithman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They must have arrived in clown cars; art gallery owner Robert Berman
believes that 2,000 visitors, give or take a few, attended the
opening of "A Thousand Clowns, Give or Take a Few," an exhibition of
clown paintings -- yes, clown paintings -- at Berman's two gallery
spaces at Santa Monica's Bergamot Station.</LD>
<LD>   Both galleries, which stand across the parking lot from each
other, were jammed with guests ogling hundreds of clowns, grinning,
dancing, weeping, sleeping, playing accordions and sniffing daisies,
plastered from floor to ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   Almost lost in the crush of bodies was actress Diane Keaton, who
shares Berman's fascination for clown art -- and whose just-published
book, "Clown Paintings," from PowerHouse Books, inspired the
exhibition, which runs through December.</LD>
<TE>   In one gallery is a motley clan of clowns mostly by amateurs,
including those featured in Keaton's book.</TE>
<TE>   The other contains what Berman calls a "clown-ological"
retrospective of clown depictions from the early 1900s to the
present, titled "From Picasso to Extremo," including works by
Oregon's Extremo the Clown.</TE>
<TE>   Keaton's chosen attire -- a belted black leather jacket and skirt,
black leather gloves, black fishnet hose rolled down around the ankle
just above her black high-heeled pumps, glasses with violet lenses --
seemed conservative compared with some of the outfits selected by
this crowd. Gallery-goers in typical Westside black mingled with
visitors sporting pink evening gowns, transparent plastic raincoats,
giant green sunglasses or big red noses.</TE>
<TE>   But Keaton's Annie Hall voice was unmistakable, ringing with glee
as she greeted a new arrival: "Isn't this insane?"</TE>
<TE>   Munching Red Vines and boxes of Barnum's Animals -- a weird
complement to the requisite gallery-opening fare of plastic cups of
wine -- visitors first craned their necks, then lowered their eyes to
take in the red-nosed portraits. Most seemed awed by the total
clown-surround.</TE>
<TE>   That is, except for one woman standing outside the gallery,
overheard confessing to her companion in a whisper: "I'm kind of
scared of the clowns."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, Santa Monica art gallery owner Berman began
collecting clown paintings. He acquired both blue-chip clown
portraits by famed artists, including Picasso, Georges Rouault and
Man Ray, and the kind of amateur clown paintings you find at swap
meets alongside armless Barbies, coonskin caps and toasters that had
browned their last slice in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   But then, about three years ago, Berman began encountering a
peculiar phenomenon: Sellers of clown paintings were not as eager to
deal as they once were. Paintings he could once acquire for $25 now
had asking prices of $125 or more. When it came to clown paintings,
Berman no longer had a corner on the flea market.</TE>
<TE>   "They started saying: 'If you don't buy it, Diane Keaton will,' "
Berman says. "That's how I found out she was collecting clown
paintings."</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Keaton had been clown hunting for about three
years, ever since she experienced "an epiphany" upon glimpsing an
intriguing clown painting at a Rose Bowl swap meet.</TE>
<TE>   This desperate-looking clown, with its tongue lolling out like an
eager cocker spaniel's, a floppy candy-striped bow tie and a potted
cactus on its head changed Keaton's life forever -- and is now
featured on the cover of her book.</TE>
<TE>   " I don't see them as kitsch," Keaton insisted in a recent
telephone interview. "Some of them are remarkable portraits in my
opinion, and I stand behind that."</TE>
<TE>   "Clown Paintings" pairs glossy reproductions of 66 selected clowns
with commentary from well-known American comedians including Woody
Allen, Steve Martin, Whoopi Goldberg, Goldie Hawn and Jerry Lewis.
Keaton -- who has also edited four books of photography, including
"Still Life," a collection of movie stills from Hollywood's golden
era, and "Local News: Tabloid Pictures From the Los Angeles Herald
Express 1936-1961" -- got a wide range of responses to her request
for comments.</TE>
<TE>   Some sing the praises of the clown; others, including Candice
Bergen, are less enthusiastic: "How much do I have to pay to not have
one of these paintings hanging in my house?" wrote Bergen in her
essay, titled "Compendium of the Creepy."</TE>
<TE>   Berman collects both high- and low-end clown art; Keaton sticks
mostly to the amateur stuff. But both have the same mission: to
garner some respect for the clown painting, which seems to rank at
least a few notches below the velvet Elvis on the art scale.</TE>
<TE>   "We both do it out of a search for something true and good,"
observes Berman. "Clowns are considered the most base form of art
there is, like the flower. But a Georgia O'Keeffe flower is not bad,
and a Picasso clown is not bad. It's a matter of deciding what is
good, bad and in between. "</TE>
<TE>   Keaton's identification with clowns is a bit more personal. "The
way I dress -- well, we can just go ahead and rag on that -- I'm more
sedate now, but I had a real strong clown period at one time in my
life," Keaton says. "I still have a leaning toward it; there's
something about hiding, about framing yourself in that way, that has
a big appeal. Which, of course, stems from the fact that basically I
feel -- it's just classic stuff, nothing very interesting or unusual
about it -- well, low self-esteem is, I guess, the best way to put
it.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are a performer, I think there is always this need to be
somehow more than you actually are, more than normal -- and clowns
take things very far. So as much as I sometimes say: 'Oh, those are
the ugliest things I've ever seen,' there came a point that I
thought: 'My God, these are kind of extraordinary.' "</TE>
<TE>   Though the mood at the opening was for the most part joyous, one
visitor was distressed by what he saw. A man who said he was a member
of that prankish performance art troupe the Los Angeles Cacophony
Society, wandered lonely as a clown -- that is, wearing full clown
suit, makeup and a red cotton-candy wig. He identified himself only
by his "clown name," Apostate. He, too, collects clown paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a project of mine to do a clown show, and she beat me
to the punch," he said wistfully, before walking away into the dark,
his big shoes flopping against the pavement.</TE>

<HD>Monheit swingingly shows her flip side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a striking difference between the Jane Monheit who showed
up on stage at Pepperdine's Smothers Theatre on Friday night and the
Jane Monheit who is represented on her new CD, "In the Sun." Anyone
hearing her in concert for the first time would have had little
difficulty identifying her as a jazz singer -- and a good one, at
that. In contrast, anyone experiencing Monheit for the first time on
the CD could easily be reluctant to use the label at all.</LD>
<LD>   Part of the problem traces to Monheit's talent, which is diverse
enough to bring a certain chameleon-like quality to her work. At
Pepperdine, she spiced her set with the addition of a sweetly
pop-tinged reading of the Eric Kaz-Libby Titus '70s rock ballad "Love
Has No Pride."</LD>
<LD>   Beyond that, the program -- in which she was accompanied by
pianist Michael Kanan, saxophonist Joel Frahm, bassist Joe Martin and
drummer Rick Montalbano -- soared comfortably within the jazz orbit.
Even in "Over the Rainbow," in a rendering that has become something
of a trademark for Monheit, she stretched and remolded the line,
reminiscent -- although in very different stylistic fashion -- of the
melodic variation associated with Sarah Vaughan.</LD>
<TE>   Other material was offered with more rhythmic lift, including
"People Will Say We're in Love," "It Might as Well Be Spring" and
"Cheek to Cheek." In each case Monheit displayed her rapidly maturing
ease with improvisational reshaping, aided immensely by her unerring
sense of pitch and precise ear for harmony.</TE>
<TE>   A generous helping of Antonio Carlos Jobim tunes -- "Chega de
Saudade," "Dindi" and "Aguas De Marco" -- was delivered with lightly
floating rhythmic ease (although, strangely, she neglected to perform
either of the two Ivan Lins tunes from her new album). And her tender
version of the lovely Bernstein/Comden &amp; Green ballad, "Some Other
Time," revealed yet another glowing facet of her artistic growth.</TE>
<TE>   Monheit still relies a bit too heavily upon her powerful
instrument, tending to hit the obvious climaxes, not yet at the point
where she completely apprehends the value of dramatic understatement.
But the talent and imagination to be a top-level jazz artist are
available to her.</TE>
<TE>   Whether she will use them toward that goal is the question. And
the escalating pop orientation of her recordings suggests that her
managers may have another direction in mind. To do so, however,
they'll have to put a lid on the sort of fine, briskly swinging
performance she delivered.</TE>

<LD>Don't despair.</LD>
<LD>   With the globe in such turmoil, escapism through entertainment is
just the ticket to lift spirits and soften worry lines. Who needs
nerve-jangling reality when it's possible to unwind tranquilly with
television and float off into dreamy fantasy the likes of this?</LD>
<LD>   Terrorists are about to explode a nuclear device in Los Angeles!</LD>
<TE>   Yes ... Jack's back.</TE>
<TE>   Have I already determined who are the new moles inside L.A.'s
branch of the federal Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU)? Of course. Am I
not your perceptive devoted servant, again guiding you through the
inky labyrinth of serpentine "24," as twisty and spellbinding as ever
when it resumes Tuesday night on Fox?</TE>
<TE>   As in its premiere season, it's again a serial whose 24 episodes
add up to 24 hours in the lives of its characters, most notably Jack
Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland), who gets the call from President David
Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) to save L.A.</TE>
<TE>   When we checked in on these kids during last season's finale,
then-Sen. Palmer was en route to becoming the nation's first African
American president and Jack's wife, Teri (Leslie Hope) -- capping one
of the worst days of anyone in humankind -- was history after taking
a bullet from CTU turncoat Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke). Coming off an
eventful 24 hours herself, their teenage daughter, Kim (Elisha
Cuthbert), had escaped terrorist Victor Drazen (Dennis Hopper). It
was Drazen's plan to assassinate Palmer that was foiled by Jack.</TE>
<TE>   Back from last season are Palmer (who operates a pared-down,
humorless White House compared with "The West Wing's" boisterous
crowd on NBC), earnest CTU operative Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard),
unsavory district director George Mason (Xander Berkeley) and
Palmer's ruthless wife, Sherry (Penny Johnson Jerald).</TE>
<TE>   Here, too, of course, are Jack and Kim, still distraught about
Teri a year after her death.</TE>
<TE>   Kim wants no part of her father (telling him, "Every time I see
you I think of Mom") while working as a nanny in a swanky
contemporary home whose undertones foreshadow something ominous.</TE>
<TE>   Now a CTU dropout, Jack is a bearded, bitter recluse, in no mood
to return when urged and cajoled to re-up for the sake of his
country. Does he? Are there 24 hours in a day?</TE>
<TE>   In the first of two episodes provided by Fox, Jack is swiftly back
in control and again resourceful, once he returns as a personal favor
to Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   But his personality's dusky side -- which surfaced with clarity
last season -- darkens to black as he deploys menace and brutality to
root out those preparing to set off a rogue nuclear weapon that very
day (in the show's parlance, a 24-episode window).</TE>
<TE>   Because of its content, "24" is a series that inevitably rubs
shoulders with the real world. Trimmed from last season's original
pilot was a two-second shot of a jet exploding in the air because it
was seen as coming too close to the flaming Twin Towers realism of
9/11. And Tuesday's hour introducing a nuclear threat airs after last
week's prediction by a task force of former top government officials,
academics and business leaders that the next terrorist attack against
the U.S. will be even more cataclysmic than last year's.</TE>
<TE>   Related to that, here's a major criticism:</TE>
<TE>   Drazen was a Serb. How facile, though, for the second-season "24"
to immediately throw around Middle Eastern names and identify Arabs
-- still among the entertainment industry's favorite boogeymen -- as
pivotal in the plot to obliterate L.A. It's a low road for the show
to take, not because Arab terrorists aren't a frightening threat, but
because TV and movies have long depicted those of Middle Eastern
origin as a shifty-eyed, violent monolith. That stereotype still
taints Arab Americans today.</TE>
<TE>   On a lighter note, expecting story consistency and flawless
reasoning from "24" is a mistake. You'll need no Geiger counter to
detect veins of illogical behavior here, nor a reliance on past story
devices.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately, for example, someone is on the run and goes
missing, promising another of those parallel searches that challenged
our hero last season. "Where is she?" Jack demands in a coming
episode.</TE>
<TE>   And what about the show's surfeit of young blonds? There are so
many here -- none of them having fun -- that it's hard separating one
from the other.</TE>
<TE>   Yet echoing last season, there's nothing on the air more
entertaining than "24," whose unpredictable hairpin curves and
misdirection still have you nervously groping for a seat belt.</TE>
<TE>   Think of it as a highly watchable triumph of form, style and
suspenseful directing, with a big assist from Sutherland. A season of
Jack now under his belt, he wears this role like his own skin.
Ratcheting up last season's intensity, he appears almost crazed at
times, as if his interior smoke alarms were squealing and he were the
nuclear device about to be triggered.</TE>
<TE>   Serialized stories can be problematic; witness those relatively
soft ratings that dogged the original "24."</TE>
<TE>   If this season's first two episodes are an indication, though,
watch every hour and you'll be rewarded.</TE>

<HD>Sculptor has engineered an artistic marvel</HD>
<DH>Anish Kapoor's huge PVC work dominates the Tate Modern's
cathedral-size main hall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>LONDON -- It is one of the world's biggest sculptures -- an immense
engineering feat that stretches twice the length of a Boeing 747 and
soars 10 stories high.</LD>
<LD>   Anish Kapoor's futuristic creation "Marsyas," unveiled last week
in London's Tate Modern art gallery, leaves visitors gawking at its
sheer scale.</LD>
<LD>   At 508 feet long and 115 feet high, the enormous structure, made
from a single span of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) membrane pulled taut
over three steel rings, dominates the gallery's cathedral-size main
hall.</LD>
<TE>   "It will undoubtedly come to be seen as one of the most
significant sculptures of this century," said Donna de Salvo, Tate
Modern's curator.</TE>
<TE>   The structure consists of three giant steel rings -- two wedged
vertically at either end of the vast Turbine Hall, with a third
suspended horizontally over a walkway in the center of the space.</TE>
<TE>   The blood-red membrane forms a giant trumpet at each ring and
tapers into a fluted tunnel that arches across the hall. The PVC is
stretched so tight that it looks as solid as cast bronze. It is so
large that it's impossible to see the entire sculpture from any one
position.</TE>
<TE>   Kapoor, who began the project in January, says the membrane has a
fleshy quality, "rather like a flayed skin." The title of his
creation refers to Marsyas, the satyr in Greek mythology, who was
flayed alive by the god Apollo.</TE>
<TE>   The Indian-born artist says the work has "a kind of intimacy" and
is "womblike."</TE>
<TE>   "I chose this red because I wanted it to be an experience of a
kind of interior," he said, adding that he wanted to humanize the
industrial feel of the Tate Modern, a former power station on the
River Thames that opened as a gallery in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Turner Award-winning artist worked on the project with the
Arup engineering firm. It took up to 40 people working 10 hours a day
for almost four weeks to build the sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a notoriously difficult space," said Kapoor, who was born
in Bombay in 1954 and has lived in London since the 1970s. "It's a
big thing because it needs to be a big thing. One hopes that it's a
deep thing."</TE>
<TE>   "Marsyas" has captured the imagination of London art critics.</TE>
<TE>   The Independent said it resembled a "trio of blood-red lilies or
oversized sinews of the body."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Campbell-Johnston of the Times called it "simply
magnificent."</TE>
<TE>   "The work is fascinating as a feat of engineering alone," he
added. "The laws of physics must have been pushed to all but breaking
point."</TE>
<TE>   The Guardian's art critic, Adrian Searle, however, was somewhat
dismissive about the "world's biggest tapeworm."</TE>
<TE>   "It manages something difficult -- to be at once stupid and
unforgettable," Searle wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Marsyas" will be on display, free of charge, until April.</TE>

<HD>Rivera has fan-pleasing covered</HD>

<LD>As a performer, Lupillo Rivera goes beyond the call of duty when it
comes to entertaining his fans. An indication of his zealousness came
halfway through the singer's performance Friday at the Universal
Amphitheatre, when a luxurious bed was brought onstage, complete with
a young, negligee-clad woman.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera looked at her with a mischievous glint in his eyes. He then
jumped onto the bed, unbuttoned his shirt, and joining the muchacha
under the covers, delivered a few bars of the Jose Alfredo Jimenez
standard "Amaneci En Tus Brazos." Woke up in her arms, indeed.</LD>
<LD>   This over-the-top vignette was indicative of the irreverent spirit
with which the Mexico-born, Long Beach-raised Rivera, 30, tackles
traditional Mexican music. No wonder he has become one of its most
glamorous idols. Sporting an expensive-looking gray suit and his
shaved head, Rivera made the most of the cultural archetype he has so
carefully constructed -- the misunderstood macho man with good
intentions and a weakness for wine, women and the songs of Vicente
Fernandez.</LD>
<TE>   Rivera knows his ranchera aesthetics well, and he can belt out a
mean "El Rey." But he shone whenever he favored the banda format,
accompanied by a 12-piece brass ensemble, two percussionists and an
accordionist. At times, the clarinets would surprise with swinging
solos that could have come out of a Benny Goodman record.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Rivera emphasized the importance of family ties.
Besides inviting his sister, Jenni, to perform a few raucous banda
numbers, he also brought his father onstage and to sing with him on a
tune he dedicated to all Mexican immigrants who are exploited by
their bosses.</TE>

<LD>Eminem's latest single is exploding, Justin is leading Nick, and
Carlos and Christina have it all over Whitney and Mariah.</LD>
<LD>   With pop music's fall superstar siege underway, who needs
surnames?</LD>
<LD>   New singles from many of pop's biggest-selling acts have set up a
high-profile horserace that also hints at how their new albums may
fare during the all-important final quarter of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the most intense scrutiny will be on Whitney Houston and
Mariah Carey, whose offstage exploits have landed them on the covers
of supermarket tabloids more often than on those of music magazines
since their last albums came out.</TE>
<TE>   Houston is releasing "Just Whitney ... " next month, her first new
album in four years, and radio hasn't heard much to get excited about
so far.</TE>
<TE>   The first single, "Whatchulookinat," flopped at pop radio, barely
cracking the Billboard Hot 100 chart in September, although it was a
dance-club hit, and her Web site notes it has reached No. 7 in
Poland. Her recently released second single, "One of Those Days,"
hasn't generated much enthusiasm back home yet either.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't necessarily think Whitney's got any baggage, but it
remains to be seen how she's going to do," says Michael Steele,
program director at L.A. Top 40 station KIIS-FM (102.7). "It's all
about a great song, and she's going to need a great song."</TE>
<TE>   A great song presumably would swing the spotlight back on
Houston's voice after her run-in two years ago with Hawaiian
authorities who allegedly found marijuana in one of her travel bags.
Possession charges were dismissed, but the incident added to her
status as a favorite target of the tabloids.</TE>
<TE>   "It's always harder to get the second single going once the first
one hasn't come through," says Jeff Pollack, one of the nation's
leading radio consultants. "I think ["One of Those Days"] will do
better than the first single, but it's too early to tell."
Representatives for Houston's label, Arista Records, did not return
calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Carey likewise is attempting to refocus attention from her private
life to her music with the single "Through the Rain," after last
year's nervous breakdown, the disappointment of her "Glitter" film
and album (it's sold just 554,000 copies) and a humbling contract
buyout.</TE>
<TE>   In January, EMI Records paid her $30 million to close out the
remainder of an $80-million, four-album contract she'd signed in
2001. Four months later, however, Carey signed a $20-million,
three-album deal with Island Def Jam Records, part of the Universal
Music Group.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, Island Def Jam Chairman Lyor Cohen said, "We were
dying to sign her.... I never once looked at Mariah as washed up.
I've always viewed her as this amazing artist -- a great singer and a
great songwriter."</TE>
<TE>   Radio's response to "Through the Rain," the first single from her
"Charmbracelet" album due in December, has been less than amazing
since it was released last month.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Acampero, charts manager for the Radio &amp; Records trade
publication, thinks that amount of time makes it too soon to render a
verdict, but Pollack says, "The first single does not look like it's
going to get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, however, says he's taking the long view on Carey's career
and isn't concerned about an out-of-the-gate hit, which would have
been more likely with an up-tempo leadoff single than a dramatic
ballad such as "Through the Rain."</TE>
<TE>   "I did not want to do the typical record company fake artificial
radio boogie on this because Mariah is in a different place in her
life," Cohen says. "I chose an entirely different method and that is
to let this record go out without a video, take its time and slowly
and methodically penetrate and gain traction. Then we'll put the
video out. Then we'll do 'Oprah' and then the 'Today' show. And at
that time is when this record should be judged."</TE>
<TE>   At KIIS-FM, Steele says, "I like [Houston's new single].... I
can't say the same for Mariah's.... But I'll tell you what's going to
be an even bigger hit is the next Christina [Aguilera] single,
'Beautiful.' That's not just a great record; it could be a career
record for her. And 'Dirrty' continues to be a big hit for us.</TE>
<TE>   "By far the biggest record of the fall is going to be Santana. The
single ["The Game of Love"] with Michelle Branch is already a No. 1
request with us."</TE>
<TE>   Aguilera and the Carlos Santana-led group Santana are more typical
of the current trend in which superstar records are getting listeners
fired up fast.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like almost everything on the superstar level is being
pretty well-received," says R&amp;R's Acampero.</TE>
<TE>   In the solo teen-idol sweepstakes, 'N Sync's Justin Timberlake is
the victor over his Backstreet Boy rival, Nick Carter, at least with
their initial volleys. Timberlake's single "Like I Love You" is
getting almost double the airplay nationally that Carter's leadoff
solo single, "Help Me," is, according to R&amp;R.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, rap's 800-pound gorilla, Eminem, is muscling his way to
the top of the charts again with "Lose Yourself," from the "8 Mile"
soundtrack, which is expected to give him one of the fall's runaway
hits and his second monster album of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eminem record is massive," Pollack says. "He just gets better
and better. He's really swinging to the fences here."</TE>

<LD>In an attention-getting stunt that may not be as outrageous as some
of its antics but was no less effective, "Jackass the Movie" landed
at No. 1 over the weekend, once again demonstrating the box-office
muscle of males under age 25.</LD>
<LD>   "Jackass," a film version of the Johnny Knoxville-fronted MTV show
about young men performing dangerous, frequently idiotic, sometimes
repulsive stunts, grossed an estimated $22.7 million on 2,509
screens. The film, which cost only about $5 million to make, is a
much-needed hit for its distributor, Paramount, which has suffered
repeated flops in recent months, including the expensive period epic
"The Four Feathers," and, most recently, the youth-oriented thriller
"Abandon."</LD>
<LD>   Most of the film's business came Friday night, with 66% of the
audience male and 71% under 25, according to exit surveys conducted
by Paramount. Nearly 50% were males between 17 and 24.</LD>
<TE>   Because the movie is rated R, studio executives say they did their
best to keep out kids under 17 by not advertising the film on
television before 9 p.m. Fearing surprise raids, some exhibitors say
they went to great lengths to make sure no one under 17 got in. But
industry sources say it is virtually impossible to prevent a
determined youngster from seeing the film, particularly in megaplexes
with 16 or more screens.</TE>
<TE>   Universal's "The Truth About Charlie" debuted at No.14 with an
estimated $2.3 million. Even considering the film was in only 752
theaters, its meager per-screen average of $3,105 indicates limited
audience interest in seeing Mark Wahlberg and Thandie Newton in a
remake of "Charade."</TE>
<TE>   Another remake, this one of a Japanese horror movie, "The Ring,"
came in second, jumping an impressive 25% from its opening weekend
because of an increase in theaters. The film brought in an estimated
$18.8 million, averaging $7,133 on 2,634 screens for a cumulative
total of $39.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.' "Ghost Ship," debuted in third place with an
estimated $11.7 million in its maiden voyage. Disney's "Sweet Home
Alabama," slipped to fourth, grossing an estimated $6.4 million,
bringing its total to $107.2 million. "My Big Fat Greek Wedding,"
continues to plug away at the box office, coming in at fifth and
grossing an estimated $6.3 million. That film, which was released in
May, has grossed $177.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Universal's "Red Dragon" continued to droop, this week to No. 6
with an estimated $4.7 million for a total of nearly $85 million.
Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk Love" is blooming, with nearly
$3.5 million over the weekend for a total of $6.1 million since its
release three weekends ago. Sony Pictures, which distributed the
Revolution Studios film, has slowly rolled out the film after its
initial release in a handful of theaters. The movie, which stars
Emily Watson and Adam Sandler, increased to 481 theaters compared
with 75 last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 8 is the children's animated, biblical-themed "Jonah: A
VeggieTales Movie," distributed by Artisan Entertainment. That film
grossed an estimated $2.9 million for a total of $19.7 million over
four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   At No. 9 is Fox's "The Transporter," which grossed an estimated
$2.8 million for a total of $21.5. Rounding out the top 10 was Fox
Searchlight's "Brown Sugar," which took in an estimated $2.7 million
for a total of $22.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   Total box office for the weekend's top 10 movies was an estimated
$82.7 million, according to tracking firm Nielsen EDI.</TE>

<HD>The road to hard times</HD>
<DH>In Getty displays of work by Dorothea Lange and Horace
Bristol, photos of Dust Bowl migrants and others help define an era
of suffering and dignity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leah Ollman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early in his career as a photojournalist, Horace Bristol deflected
the criticism of another, better-known artist by declaring humbly,
"I'm just like a stonemason working on a cathedral." The analogy held
true for him through the 1930s, '40s and '50s, as he chronicled
everyday life and culture in the U.S. and Asia. He was a
single-skilled individual, laboring toward something grand and
affirming, a "Family of Man"-style humanism.</LD>
<LD>   Dorothea Lange shared Bristol's humility but applied a more potent
aesthetic sensibility to the task and exercised greater ambition to
effect change. She understood keenly the power of photography to
influence perception -- not just visually, but politically,
sociologically, historically. "The camera," she once stated, "is an
instrument that teaches people how to see without a camera." And
propaganda, she believed, was merely another word for something you
believe in strongly.</LD>
<TE>   The J. Paul Getty Museum recently opened a stirring pair of shows,
drawn primarily from its collection, featuring the photographs of
Bristol (1908-1997) and Lange (1895-1965). "About Life: The
Photographs of Dorothea Lange" is the larger, a survey in 80
pictures, anchored by her searing documentation of migrant labor in
the '30s. The Bristol show focuses on just one series of photographs,
which covers some of the same turf as Lange's landmark,
Depression-era work. Unlike hers, Bristol's work from this period did
not constitute the core of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Lange recorded concisely and eloquently the conditions of the Dust
Bowl migration through the expressions and postures of laborers, the
textures of their lives. Her image of a weary and pensive mother, her
young children clinging to her like barnacles, has become an icon --
perhaps the icon -- of the era. Although none of Bristol's images
attained that same iconic status, he, too, was instrumental in
shaping our collective understanding of the period through his role
in the creation of another landmark work of art from the period --
John Steinbeck's novel "The Grapes of Wrath."</TE>
<TE>   This is the month that Californians are encouraged to read and
discuss Steinbeck's book, as part of a statewide initiative by the
California Council for the Humanities, in partnership with the
California Center for the Book. The Lange and Bristol shows at the
Getty provide a precious opportunity to confront the very faces that
populate Steinbeck's tale.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, newly hired as a staff photographer for Life magazine,
Bristol proposed a photo essay, with text by Steinbeck, on the
migrant workers of California's Central Valley. He had been inspired
by Lange's work on the same subject and had even accompanied Lange on
some of her visits to photograph farm workers. The magazine's editors
dismissed Bristol's proposal as too much of a downer, but he and
Steinbeck headed out anyway, aiming to put together a magazine
article and possibly a pictorial book. They spent between five and
seven weekends of a particularly wet winter immersed in the lives of
the Dust Bowl migrants around Visalia.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol's pictures show the dismal, muddy plots where families set
up their tents, a line of workers hauling in barrels of peas, for
which they were paid a penny per pound, a family applying for aid,
and an assortment of the camp's desperate and weary characters.</TE>
<TE>   By the spring of 1938, Bristol told Steinbeck he had enough
pictures for a book, but Steinbeck shook loose of the partnership.
Unbeknownst to Bristol, he had already started writing a novel about
the lives they witnessed. (He had also previously published several
newspaper articles on Central Valley laborers, illustrated by Lange's
photographs.) When "The Grapes of Wrath" was published in 1939,
Steinbeck received the Pulitzer Prize. Bristol simply moved on to
another assignment, photographing the people of Bali. His photographs
never did make it into book form as he had hoped, but they appeared
twice in Life -- not on their own merits, but on the coattails of
Steinbeck's fame. Both magazine spreads are on display in the Getty
show. One compares stills from the 1940 film version of "The Grapes
of Wrath" with the Bristol photographs used as reference material.
Vivid similarities are noted, as are several compromises made in the
story's translation to the big screen. The 30 pictures in the Getty
show, "The Grapes of Wrath: Horace Bristol's California Photographs,"
convey bitter truths about the hardships of these migrant workers'
lives, but, ironically, the message came through louder and clearer
as fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Lange's work from the same period has a more distilled, epic
quality on its own. It represented her prolonged commitment to
exposing the plight of the rural poor and, through such educating, to
enact change. Although she knew as a teenager in Hoboken, N.J., that
she wanted to be a photographer, she didn't initially have social
documentation in mind. She trained briefly with Clarence White (who
disseminated Arthur Wesley Dow's compositional principles emphasizing
contrast, harmonious spacing and line), and set up a portrait studio
in 1918 in San Francisco. Her business thrived, she married painter
and illustrator Maynard Dixon, and they had two sons. They traveled
together to the Southwest, the source of Dixon's imagery, and there
Lange made some beautiful but mostly conventional portraits and
ethnographic studies of Taos Indians that make up the first section
of the Getty show.</TE>
<TE>   By the early 1930s, the circumstances of the Depression had thrust
themselves upon her and those around her with undeniable force. She
and Dixon split, and she began venturing out onto the streets to
photograph labor struggles, strike meetings, demonstrations and
unemployment lines. Her "White Angel Breadline" (circa 1933)
exemplifies her ability to illuminate a daunting social condition
through the description of a single individual, in this case, one
shabbily dressed man turned away from a mass of others, in finer
suits, waiting for a handout.</TE>
<TE>   In 1935, Lange married Paul Taylor, an economist and social
scientist, who taught at UC Berkeley and provided documentation to a
state emergency relief agency. Lange began making photographs to
supplement his reports and was soon hired by the federal government's
Resettlement Administration (later the Farm Security Administration)
to record the impact of drought, economic depression and mechanized
farming on rural life. Her photographs reflect the mission of the
agency, to illustrate the need for government relief and to testify
to the effectiveness of existing programs.</TE>
<TE>   Over and over in her photographs from the '30s, she distills a
subject to its essence, and in its particularity, it comes to
represent something far bigger than itself, something universal about
both suffering and dignity. In 1942, Lange was hired by the
government to document the implementation of Executive Order 9066,
calling for the internment of Japanese Americans. Only two
photographs from this commission appear here, but one is classic,
extraordinary Lange. It shows a little girl of Japanese descent at
school in San Francisco, before her evacuation. She stands in the
front row of her class, hand on her heart, reciting the Pledge of
Allegiance, hers just one in a sea of earnest, variably shaded faces.
The image attests to a fundamental human equality that the girl's
impending fate denies.</TE>
<TE>   Although the photograph (and others documenting this episode) was
meant to be tucked away in government files, it makes its poignant
plea still.</TE>
<TE>   As this exhibition succinctly demonstrates, Lange, in the course
of her career, photographed a surprisingly wide range of subjects:
street life in Oakland, the clean lines of a doorway in a Mormon town
in Utah, utopian communities in Iowa, the elegant tracery of Berkeley
oaks seen from below, tender family scenes of her son, pregnant
daughter-in-law and grandchildren. All of it, though, stems from the
same documentary impulse -- fiercely humanistic, lucid, and truthful.</TE>
<TE>   For 40 years, she kept on her darkroom door a quote by Francis
Bacon: "The contemplation of things as they are / Without error or
confusion / Without substitution or imposture...." Honesty, her work
attests, campaigns on its own behalf.</TE>

<LD>The Orquestra de Sao Paulo made its U.S. debut Friday with a
colorful, audience-friendly program of Brazilian music at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center. The concert, led by music director
John Neschling, was part of the Eclectic Orange Festival.</LD>
<LD>   The opening work, Edino Krieger's "Passacalha Para O Novo Milenio"
(Passacaglia for the New Millennium), signaled much of what was to
come. It began in strict classical European form, with repetition and
embroidery of a short, strongly profiled theme. Midway through,
however, the composer began introducing lively Brazilian march and
dance rhythms to create a new kind of sound.</LD>
<LD>   Villa-Lobos' "Uirapuru," a 1917 ballet named after a bird of the
Amazon, reflected contemporaneous Stravinsky and French composers'
influences, but with distinct rhythmic energy alternating with
passages of delicately scored exoticism.</LD>
<TE>   Similarly, M. Camargo Guarnieri's 1944 Symphony No. 2, subtitled
"Uirapuru" in its dedication to Villa-Lobos, showed its own rhythmic
take on Copland's clarity and Bernstein's interest in jazz, creating
a large but classically structured work.</TE>
<TE>   Brothers Sergio and Odair Assad were the virtuosic soloists in
Castelnuovo-Tedesco's Double Concerto for Two Guitars, a work of
courtly and engaging imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The orchestra played throughout with impressive energy and
precision.</TE>
<TE>   Claudio Santoro's short showpiece, "Frevo," was the single encore.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Paul McCartney has changed an iota or two on the second leg of the
tour that first hit Southern California last spring. Most notably,
his three-dozen song set list Saturday at the Arrowhead Pond in
Anaheim included "She's Leaving Home," a Beatles song he said he'd
never played live until this portion of his warmly nostalgic "Back in
the U.S." tour.</LD>
<LD>   He also added "You Never Give Me Your Money," left out "Mother
Nature's Son" and "Vanilla Sky," dropped his solo B-side obscurity "C
Moon" and replaced it with another Wings-era tune, "Let Em In." That
kept the ratio of Beatles (22 songs) to '70s-'80s solo (10) to new
songs (4), as well as the order they were played in, virtually the
same as before.</LD>
<LD>   He told most of the same anecdotes between songs, saluted departed
bandmates John Lennon and George Harrison with the same songs and
stories and tacitly paid remembrance to his wife of 29 years, Linda,
who died in 1998 of breast cancer, with many of the love songs she
inspired. He once again tastefully honored his new wife, Heather
Mills, with a freshly minted ballad called "Your Loving Flame."</LD>
<TE>   While McCartney's '60s peers Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones are
mixing things up more on their current tours by reaching deeper into
equally deep catalogs, McCartney's mirror-perfect replica performance
didn't feel the least bit repetitive -- just joyfully timeless.</TE>
<TE>   The one part of the show that gained clarity the second time
around was the surreal opening in which all manner of archetypal
characters parade around the arena before the Fab One arrived. What
it suggested this time was that countries, cultures, kingdoms and
epochs may come and go, but we'll always have Beatle music.</TE>

<HD>Preljocaj's opposing forces</HD>
<DH>The choreographer contrasts dramas of technology and
sexuality in 'Helikopter' and 'Rite of Spring.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Challenging himself by taking on two of the most formidable scores of
the 20th century, French choreographer Angelin Preljocaj created a
program of daring opposites at the Irvine Barclay Theatre on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   To Karlheinz Stockhausen's "Helikopter," a startling
end-of-century string quartet played (and recorded) inside four
helicopters in flight, Preljocaj brought cool, postmodern abstraction
coupled with visionary projection technology.</LD>
<LD>   To Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring," a century-defining
essay in volcanic neo-primitivism, he reexplored the dark view of
sexuality evident in a number of his previous dance dramas.</LD>
<TE>   Few companies could look equally comfortable at these extremes,
but the members of Preljocaj's 12-dancer ensemble made the sustained
energy output of the task-oriented "Helikopter" as exciting as the
visceral and often violent mating rituals depicted in "The Rite of
Spring."</TE>
<TE>   An overwhelming rhythmic impetus linked the two scores, but the
"Helikopter" rhythms came from the churning of huge rotor blades --
and Preljocaj never tried to match this superhuman power. Instead,
like the musicians, his six dancers contributed a graceful obbligato
to the Machine Age: a swift, deft affirmation of human resilience.</TE>
<TE>   How do you dance to a helicopter? The same way you live near an
airport: You stop hearing it, even if it inevitably conditions your
life. In prosaic practice clothes and kneepads, Preljocaj's dancers
thus executed a workaday cycle of actions that began and ended with a
solo by Claudia De Smet. Making an occasional reference to the
helicopters (windmill arms, for instance), they mostly, like all of
us, stayed absorbed in the onward rush of activity, not really
listening to the sounds that became part of the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, video designer Holger Forterer transformed that
landscape with a series of gorgeous environmental floor projections
intricately synchronized with the choreography. Sometimes the dancing
seemed to take place in a shallow pool, with each step sending out
rippling liquid circles. Elsewhere, the cast moved through a matrix
of pulsating computer numbers, or generated a vortex of billowing
clouds, or stepped across lines of light that suddenly blew away like
sand in a windstorm.</TE>
<TE>   No mere embellishment (a la the motion-capture animation in Merce
Cunningham's "Biped"), Forterer's video floor represented the
technological wonders of the modern world in contrast to the
relentless, mechanical propeller drone overhead. Techno magic and
techno nuisance have both become integral to our lives -- and
"Helikopter" gave them back to us in high relief.</TE>
<TE>   Laced with gallows humor, Preljocaj's modern-dress "Rite of
Spring" objectified another kind of duality: the conflict between
seeing ourselves as evolved, rational beings with freedom of choice
versus how we periodically behave when enslaved by the instinctual
procreative compulsions that link us to the animal world.</TE>
<TE>   You want a jazz-dance celebration of sexuality? Try somewhere
else. On Friday, the cycle of treat-me-rough, treat-me-nice
encounters began with the six Preljocaj men sniffing panties and, a
little later, his six women burying their faces in the men's
discarded shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, bold choreographic abstractions of intercourse took
place in front of and sometimes upon a green hillock designed by
Thierry Leproust that divided into bed-size platforms. But while
enforcing unanimity of impulse -- and especially the sense of
everyone eventually swallowed up and unhinged by the sex drive --
Preljocaj initially allowed each couple variations in pace and style.
So his dancers seemed to be people, not just a faceless corps, and
their descent to acts of nasty humiliation thus became all the more
shocking.</TE>
<TE>   Called "the chosen one" in an ironic reference to the sacrificial
maiden in Vaslav Nijinsky's original 1913 "The Rite of Spring,"
dancer Nagisa Shirai found herself cruelly corralled, roughed up (by
the women as well as the men), stripped, isolated and displayed as
trophy meat in the final body-lashing solo of the piece. But instead
of dancing herself to death (as in the Nijinsky version), she
survived unshaken.</TE>
<TE>   In easily the most provocative insight in this uncompromising
social portrait, Preljocaj showed contemporary women understanding
what they're in for in the mating game -- and strong enough to bear
it and move on. No illusions, no heroism, no protest. Just one more
sweaty roll on that hillock in what passes for modern romance.</TE>

<HD>Hitting a nerve</HD>
<DH>Adrian Tomine's comics connect with noirish tales of
loneliness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Timberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BERKELEY -- Consumerism and the counterculture collide hard on
Telegraph Avenue, where political posters fill the space between
chain stores. Three kids in hooded sweatshirts crouch on the
sidewalk: "Can you spare some change ... for pot?"</LD>
<LD>   Away from the clamor, inside Cody's Books, a few dozen people have
gathered to meet a reserved young man who could be a chemistry T.A.
with a good haircut. He's discussing "Optic Nerve" -- his chronicle
of lonely, good-looking Bay Area denizens who hold down negligible
jobs and struggle to connect. Adrian Tomine, who lives nearby and
seems dressed for anonymity, has spent 12 years producing a comic
that has more in common with the spare, disillusioned short stories
of Raymond Carver than with Batman and Robin. Visually, his style is
not far from that of Dan Clowes, whose "Ghost World" comic was made
into an art film last year: a mix of the clean lines of 1950s
magazine ads with touches of film noir and a careful, almost
documentary realism.</LD>
<TE>   This summer, Tomine released a hardback, "Summer Blonde," that
collects his last four issues, tales of a harried telemarketer who
meets her dream guy while making prank phone calls, a nebbish writer
who returns home to seduce an old crush's less appealing sister, and
a smooth ladies' man who's unceremoniously humbled. The only
character rendered without sympathy is Carlo, a guitar-toting
Casanova who would not look out of place at SkyBar or Erewhon. "He's
just the sort of young, good-looking ... extrovert that makes me
sick," a rumpled character tells his shrink. Despite the jaded tone
of the work, the frames are drawn with an intense concentration and
meticulous detail.</TE>
<TE>   Comics and "graphic novels," as non-superhero comics are sometimes
called, have been discovered lately by the intellectual mainstream,
from Michael Chabon's Pulitzer-winning novel, "The Amazing Adventures
of Kavalier and Clay," the tale of two comics creators, to the New
Yorker's recent Comics Issues. The critical success of Terry
Zwigoff's "Ghost World" made the reclusive Clowes a cultural hero
rivaling Robert Crumb. And films from "Spider-Man," "Road to
Perdition" and "Men in Black" all originated in comics. Comics are
reaching out of their subculture like they haven't in years, and
Tomine's work is one of the reasons. Obscure rock musicians have even
begun to take notice. "He really has the best taste of anyone I
know," says Eels leader Mark Everett, who's hired Tomine to draw
record covers.</TE>
<TE>   As the Cody's crowd stares longingly, the thoughtful,
self-contained and coolly detached Tomine, 28, has no trouble
stepping back from his own life, from his work, from his upbringing.
"I think there was part of them," he says of his parents, both
academics, "that would've preferred me to be outdoors and making
friends and stuff." Of his very short, frustrated career drawing
"Optic Nerve" as a studio art major at the nearby UC campus: "They
were waiting for me to put some ironic spin on it, like I was
commenting on lowbrow culture or something." Laughter. Of the
arduous, solitary life of a cartoonist: "It's not like 'Chasing Amy,'
" he says of the Kevin Smith movie, "where your drafting table is up
against your best friend's, and you're giving each other high-fives
over the table." More laughter. "It's why cartoonists go crazy in old
age."</TE>
<TE>   Few cartoonists have hit this hard this young. Perhaps as a
consequence, Tomine is both beloved and hated in the comics
subculture; the letters page in his comic book is a gallery of
hatred, fawning and almost academic close-reading.</TE>
<TE>   With 16,000 copies of his latest issue of "Optic Nerve," Tomine is
one of the five top sellers among alternative comics and the
bestseller for Drawn &amp; Quarterly, his Montreal publisher. He's also
one of the best regarded in the business, along with Clowes, Art
Spiegelman ("Maus") and Chris Ware ("Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid
on Earth"). Besides releasing "Summer Blonde," he's included in the
new, Dave Eggers-edited "The Best American Nonrequired Reading." And
starting this month, Drawn &amp; Quarterly's comics will be distributed
by Chronicle Books, allowing Tomine's work to get outside comic
shops, where it seems increasingly uncomfortable.</TE>
<TE>   After the reading, the cartoonist sits at the head of a long queue
of admirers waiting to get their books signed. For the most part it's
a well-behaved crowd -- Tomine is all too familiar with fans who are
physically trembling, who come to act out in public or to pass on a
strange, deeply personal artifact. But a good third of the crowd
seems to want something from him, from a corduroy-clad guy who puts
out a comic about erotic spanking, urging Tomine to revive a favorite
character, to a well-coifed man with a French accent who wants to
interest him in creating work for cell-phone screens. Tomine, who may
be the only writer in America who exudes a tangible fear of spelling
his devotees' names wrong, handles them all with cordial distance.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone in Cody's tonight is a fan. Two skinny blond girls,
about 8 years old, wander by; both seem to be recovering from recent
perm and dye jobs. "Why do they want him to sign their books?" one,
in a Princess University T-shirt, asks dismissively. "Oh," responds
the other. "He's some famous author guy or something."</TE>
<TE>   Feeling like an outsider</TE>
<TE>   Tomine grew up all over the West Coast, splitting time between a
psychology professor mother who moved every few years and his
engineering professor father in Sacramento. As a teenager he lived in
Germany, because of his mother's teaching stint, though he never
learned German, and he felt like an outsider even in the places he
lived the longest.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of cartoonists have that in common," says Tomine, sitting
in a cafe surrounded by students. "It's like the life of an Army
brat; you never make any strong connections with people." Tomine says
the cartoonists he knows -- Clowes and Richard Sala ("Evil Eye") are
among his best friends -- all have similar temperaments: "kind of
soft-spoken and reticent, pretty cynical, black sense of humor, a
fascination with human foibles. We're all kind of more observers than
participants." As he put it at Cody's: "My friends and I say, 'Never
trust a socially adept cartoonist.' "</TE>
<TE>   Tomine's high school experience, he says, was rigged by his moving
with his mom to Sacramento a few weeks before his freshman year
began. He started with no friends and gained little ground from
there. Tomine remembers the other students as affluent white kids; he
drove a yellow van to school that backfired so loudly it set off the
car alarms on his peers' new BMWs.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the things that made me unhappy as a kid led to things
that make me happy now," he says, with characteristic
even-handedness. "In high school all I wanted was to have a lot of
friends, or to go on dates with girls, and because none of that was
happening, I had a lot of time at home. Speaking now, at 28, I'm
grateful," he says, the rare artist who lives entirely from his art,
along with illustrations for the New Yorker and indie-rock records.
Had he been presented with a choice -- misery now and artistic
success later, or teenage glamour with an uncertain future -- the
cute girls and convertibles would've won in a second. "I would've
said, 'Forget the art, no contest.' "</TE>
<TE>   When he started drawing a comic book at 15 -- after years
eavesdropping on the corny superhero comics his older brother, Dylan,
brought home from 7-Eleven -- he was in a vacuum, not even sure where
to get pens and paper. In 1987, he stumbled upon the Hernandez
Brothers' "Love and Rockets," one of the first alternative comics
with its combination of magical realism within an L.A. punk-rock
setting, and saw that the medium didn't have to concern superheroes
in tight costumes. He kept his interest to himself. "It was bad
enough as it was. I certainly wasn't going to be, 'And by the way, I
like comic books!' "</TE>
<TE>   But soon after creating "Optic Nerve" and selling photocopied
editions at a local shop, he began to hear from other readers, and
the attention spurred him. He got letters describing his debt to
Carver, and picked up his stories for the first time, responding to
their emotional bleakness, unresolved tone and "the tiny, small
things charged with some kind of emotion."</TE>
<TE>   High school's trial behind him, Tomine headed to Berkeley, where
he intended to become an art major. "It didn't take me long to
totally hate it," he says, explaining how his comics were dismissed
while a wooden box filled with a feather and news clippings was
deemed politically charged high art.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that had the strongest impact on me, over my life, is
'Peanuts,' which looks nothing like what I do. People sell it as if
it's this uplifting, fun-loving thing. But if you read it, it can
make you cry. I still can't quite understand how such a neurotic,
original person like Charles Schulz became the most mainstream,
widely embraced figure of all time."</TE>
<TE>   Tomine is known as a "literary" cartoonist. "He's the guy who
creates comics as though he's a mainstream novelist," says Clowes.
"He really thinks in those terms." Switching his studies to English,
he was drawn to thorny work -- Nabokov, the Bible, Chaucer -- and
enjoyed the rigor they required. "Peeling back layers, seeing what's
beneath them. That's how I felt when I had 'Lolita' taught in a
class, that there's this whole other art beyond constructing a plot
or creating interesting characters." About this time, as a college
sophomore, he hooked up with Drawn &amp; Quarterly.</TE>
<TE>   "Adrian is kind of an anomaly in alternative comics," says
cartoonist Sala. "It's almost straight from the Art Student's League
circa 1950. His work is that disciplined and, in a way, conservative.
There is a total absence of expression or cartoon-y experimentation
in his latest work, which is ironic because it makes his art so
individual and instantly recognizable."</TE>
<TE>   Tomine used color imaginatively, and his drawing captures the
surfaces of West Coast post-graduate life, but the best thing about
"Optic Nerve" is its storytelling. Like a songwriter, he works in
miniature, finding gestures and phrases that define his characters,
who are almost instantly recognizable. He also gets loneliness and
disconnection pitch-perfect.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Raeburn, the Harold Bloom of the comics world, praises Tomine
in an essay in "Summer Blonde" that reads like a manifesto from 1919
Paris. "He's a very shy guy," says Raeburn, who calls Tomine's style
collegiate noir. "I'd describe him as nice. He tries as hard as he
can to be as outwardly normal and average."</TE>
<TE>   Spartan and disciplined</TE>
<TE>   Standing in his immaculate apartment, Tomine is surrounded by
books by Tobias Wolff and Chekhov, walls lined with intricate, retro
comics and vintage "Peanuts" paperbacks. His exacting taste led
Clowes to describe him as "a very picky guy, at a very early age."
While he's known in the often nostalgic cartoonists community as the
scribe least likely to own a big stack of 78s, he still seems stuck
in time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think my natural tendency is to be like a vampire and to steal
material from people's lives," says Tomine, who's considering his
own, in part thanks to his 10th high school reunion so his thoughts
about it kept him up all night. He feels 30 approaching and has
reached a plateau with a following, a serious girlfriend and more
illustration work than he can handle. While some artists might plan
to dive into screenplays or TV, Tomine's dedicated to "Optic Nerve,"
which requires so much work that he averages a page a week. Spartan,
disciplined, he's a comic-book ascetic.</TE>
<TE>   With eight issues and three books behind him, Tomine's planning
his next "Optic Nerve" as part of a larger cycle, three or four
issues, with Asian American characters; he wants to appease fans
who've suggested he was ignoring his Japanese heritage.</TE>
<TE>   His goal, Tomine says, is to mature without going soft, to take
criticism without pandering, to escape the trap of those who become
too successful too young. "Not that I was ever that huge a Michael
Jackson fan," the cartoonist says with his usual flatness. "But
here's someone who could definitely use some input from the outside
world."</TE>

<HD>From their pen to your screen</HD>
<DH>Documentary series that begins tonight on Bravo does
something very un-Hollywood: It puts the spotlight on the writers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the dawn of cinema, the screenwriter has always taken a back
seat to the director. Above-the-title credits usually state "A Film
by ..." or "A So-and-So Film," and that's the director. "Page to
Screen," a new weekly documentary series premiering tonight on Bravo,
aims to address the situation by emphasizing the achievements of both
novelists and the writers who penned the adaptations of their books.</LD>
<LD>   Ted Tally, who won an Oscar for his "The Silence of the Lambs"
screenplay, based on Thomas Harris' bestseller, eagerly agreed to
participate in the series' first episode profiling the 1991 Academy
Award-winning thriller starring Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.
Still, he couldn't quite believe anyone would actually do a
documentary revolving around writers. "When they told me about this
documentary," he says laughing, "I thought it was a joke or
something."</LD>
<LD>   Hosted by actor Peter Gallagher, "Page to Screen" examines the
process of transforming a novel into a movie. Each week the series
focuses on a different hit film, kicking off with "The Silence of the
Lambs," followed by "Jaws" on Nov. 4 and "Get Shorty" on Nov. 11.
Besides interviews with the screenwriters and novelists, each
hourlong installment will feature behind-the-scenes footage,
interviews with the filmmakers, actors and critics and excerpts from
the novels.</LD>
<TE>   Tally jokingly refers to himself as "Mr. Adaptation Guy" because
he's made his reputation during the past decade as a writer who knows
how to capture the essence of a novel. Besides "Silence of the
Lambs," he also wrote the screenplay for "All the Pretty Horses,"
based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, and the current "Red Dragon,"
Harris' first installment in the Hannibal Lecter saga.</TE>
<TE>   Tally was a playwright before he turned to screenwriting. Having
that earlier experience, he says, "made it easier to write
screenplays just because the narrative style of the two is very
similar. More than that I had a lot of experience in the theater with
collaboration and having to make actors happy and designers happy and
directors happy so that certainly pays off in the film."</TE>
<TE>   Though Harris is a recluse, Tally says the two are "amiable
acquaintances" and the novelist has been happy with his adaptations.
Tally says Harris is very aware that a novel and a movie are two
different animals. "Thomas Harris said to me one time, 'a book and a
movie have different agendas even if they have the same title,' " he
says. "That is the nature of two art forms."</TE>
<TE>   Movies, Tally says, generally have a poor time exploring the
interior life of characters. "Movies can only suggest. They can't
make it explicit. In a way, that's great. I mean if something is only
implied, then the audience has to use its own imagination and they
get more involved in the story itself."</TE>
<TE>   According to Tally, director Jonathan Demme was a marvelous
collaborator. "We were always on the same page," he says. "There were
very, very few changes as the movie was being made."</TE>
<TE>   There was one big change near the finale, though, when FBI agent
Clarice Starling tells Lecter about her childhood witnessing the
killing of the lambs. "In the script as it was written you are seeing
her say that to Lecter in a jail cell and you are seeing flashbacks
to the event she was referring to," Tally says. "In the end, Jonathan
said, 'You know, what we don't need is to see it because Jodie is
painting the picture so much in performance, to see it would be kind
of redundant. Also, we can save a million dollars by not shooting the
scene.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the case of "Red Dragon," he says, he just "forgot" that
Michael Mann had made the film 16 years earlier as "Manhunter." "I
knew the author was not happy with this adaptation," says Tally. "I
had to invent a lot of new scenes for Lecter that were not in the
book -- the opening and most of the scenes in the asylum. So that was
a challenge I had not faced in 'Silence of the Lambs' and that kept
it interesting."</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side of the writing coin, Elmore Leonard, who has
penned such gritty and often wryly humorous contemporary novels as
"The Big Bounce," "Stick," "Pronto," "52 Pick-Up," "Freaky Deaky" and
"Pagan Babies," had never been happy with the first few adaptations
of his novels. That hadn't been the case with the westerns that had
been adapted from his short stories and novels such as "Hombre" and
"Joe Kidd." But the westerns, he believes, were just easier to
transform into features because the characters weren't as complex.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not much attitude in the westerns," says Leonard. "There
is humor in the contemporary books but it's straight-faced and there
aren't laughs in it for laughs. This is the way these people are."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until director Barry Sonnenfeld and writer Scott Frank
teamed up in 1995 to adapt "Get Shorty," Leonard's acerbic novel
about a Miami loan shark named Chili Palmer coming to Hollywood and
getting involved in moviemaking, that the author found a team that
understood his writing style.</TE>
<TE>   "I talked to Sonnenfeld and I said, 'I hope when someone delivers
a funny line you don't cut to another actor to get a grin or a wink
or a laugh or anything like that because these people are serious,'
and he understood that."</TE>
<TE>   Leonard says he really didn't get to know Frank and Sonnenfeld
until he visited the set. "We weren't that collaborative," Leonard
says. "The funny thing about being on the set is there is Sonnenfeld
coming over after they cut and says, 'What do you think? Do you have
any questions?' "Normally, [directors] don't even know who the book
writer is much less invite them to the set."</TE>

<LD>Here they sit at the head of Maggie Shrout's fifth-period English
class, Hollywood's reigning sensitive male of the moment, Jake
Gyllenhaal -- dreamy eyed and all sexy, messy hair -- and his buddy,
Ethan Hawke, author of two books. They repeatedly encourage the
students at Dominguez High in Compton to fire away with questions, to
get serious with them about what's on their minds. As guest teachers,
they want to know.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Patino, 16, raises his hand. "Are you guys dating any
celebrities?"</LD>
<LD>   "That's not interesting," Hawke says politely and then turns the
tables. "Who are you dating? Any celebrities?"</LD>
<TE>   "No," Patino answers flatly.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm married," Hawke says, pausing, trying to get a jolt of
something out of the students. "I think Jennifer Lopez would excite
this room," he adds, as the teenagers laugh, breaking their shy and
reserved selves out of star-struckdom. Soon a conversation with the
actors results, ranging from moviemaking to making decisions about
life.</TE>
<TE>   After it was over, Gyllenhaal and Hawke -- and the 16 students --
were pleased with the session that was part of Friday's Teach for
America Week, an annual nationwide program in which professionals
became guest teachers at schools in low-income communities. Shrout,
23, was recruited at George Washington University by the Teach for
America program, which places recent college graduates at schools in
low-income neighborhoods for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Shrout's students lucked out not only with Gyllenhaal, who
co-stars in "Moonlight Mile" and "The Good Girl," but with his good
friend Hawke, who was not scheduled to be part of the visit. Over
dinner the night before, Gyllenhaal had invited Hawke.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an actor and have been in films since I was your guys' age,
16," Gyllenhaal told the class. "I went to college for two years,
dropped out and started making more movies. But my goal has been to
pick movies that have a political statement," he said. With Hawke's
help, he tried to engage the students in a conversation about the
movie choices they make, encouraging them to add thoughtful flicks to
the action-packed ones on their lists.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who have power over what you see and
you have a choice," he said. "It's more important to know what people
are saying to you. We have the power to speak our minds, to get more
than one opinion. When you go to the theater, just think to
yourselves, 'Why is it there? Who put it there? Why do they want me
to see this movie?' "</TE>
<TE>   Said Hawke: "The great democratic experiment seems to have turned
into the great capitalist experiment." Then came questions about what
it was like working with Denzel Washington in "Training Day."</TE>
<TE>   "He's an amazing person," Hawke said, using the opportunity to
share a story about education and success. Hawke said that while
working on "Training Day," kids would often come up to Washington and
say to the actor, "I want to be in a movie. I want to be a rap star."
Washington would ask the kids, "What college do you want to go to?
I'll pay your way through, right now." The kids would walk away, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has a dream. Everyone wants a dream. But the dream is
only good if you enjoy the work," Hawke said, encouraging the
students to work hard in school so they will succeed in college and
later in life.</TE>
<TE>   "But success in life is also measured by how you handle your
disappointment," he said, adding that he realizes how high school can
be tough, especially on self-esteem. "Your world here is small.
Someone might think you are not interesting, not funny enough, not
good. That is so not important. I felt incredibly repressed in high
school," Hawke said looking out at the kids, noticing a few yawns.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I lost you guys. Some of you are yawning," he said as the
students laughed. "Look, the point is to have a quality of life." And
to be interesting. "I've met a lot of people who make a lot of money
and they aren't interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Follow what you love, Gyllenhaal said, confessing that after he
graduated from Harvard-Westlake High School, he attended Columbia
University in New York but dropped out after two years to take up
acting full time. And he never used to like to read that much, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   "In college we read a book a day. It's not possible for me to read
a book a day. But now I pick the books I want to read," he said,
adding that serious reading has only been part of his life for two or
three years. "Books are important as movies," he added as the hour
came to an end, followed by a class photo with the stars and a few
autographs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not much older than these students," said Gyllenhaal, 21,
after the students left the room. "But I think they really understood
what I was talking about."</TE>

<TE>   I couldn't stop thinking about Halloween -- going house-to-house,
seeing the carved pumpkins on the porches, saying "trick or treat,"
having smiling people opening their doors and giving me candy. I
couldn't wait.</TE>
<TE>   When I finished thinking about the scary costume I was going to
wear, I tried to imagine what my friend, Timmy, would have on when he
came over to go out with me and my dad and our dog, Casey. I kept
asking Timmy all week what his costume was going to be, but he
wouldn't tell me. He just said, "I'm warning you, Jake, it's scarier
than yours!" After a while, I finally fell asleep.</TE>
<TE>   The next day I ran into the kitchen. "Hello, Mom. I can't wait
until tonight!" I said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Because it's Halloween!" I answered excitedly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what?" she said. "What are you talking about, Jake?"</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," I said, "Don't you know what day it is? Why are you acting
like you don't know it's Halloween?"</TE>
<TE>   "Because I don't, Jake," she said a little impatiently. "What's
Halloween?"</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday: Is Jake's mom serious?</TE>

<LD>It's a new school year on Fox's "Boston Public," and along with the
changing fall colors of the New England foliage, there have been
seasonal changes in the cast as well.</LD>
<LD>   Executive producer David E. Kelley, whose fine-tuning skills on
such ensemble dramas as "L.A. Law" and "Picket Fences" are legendary,
is tinkering with the chemistry on the third-year series, not only
giving it an injection of new blood, but also young blood.</LD>
<LD>   Joey McIntyre, the former New Kids on the Block heartthrob, has
joined the high school's faculty as Colin Flynn, who could pass for
the kid brother of some of his students. Ditto new science instructor
Zach Fisher, played by Jon Abrahams ("Scary Movie"). These two spent
most of last week's season debut as window dressing, but in tonight's
episode airing at 8, they share a memorable scene while bar-hopping
with colleagues. Who would have thought that NKOTB's little Joey
would one day be warbling "To All the Girls I Loved Before" on a
karaoke stage?</LD>
<TE>   Other additions include China Shavers ("Boston Public") as student
Brooke Harper, who also happens to be the principal's daughter; and
Cara DeLizia ("So Weird") as student aide Marcie Kendall.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the changes, most of the show's mainstays remain front
and center: gruff but caring principal Steven Harper (Chi McBride);
brooding and borderline-boring teacher Harry Senate (Nicky Katt); and
Senate's smoldering lawyer-turned-teacher gal pal Ronnie Cooke (Jeri
Ryan).</TE>
<TE>   Though some of the faces are new this season, it's the same urban
high school setting, which means that plot lines about drugs, sex and
violence are evergreens.</TE>

<HD>Grasping for answers to autism</HD>
<DH>Parents often take a chance on unproven therapies, some
very costly. Doctors say reliable research is sorely needed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The recent report that autism rates are skyrocketing in California
was bittersweet for many parents and children's advocates. Although
the study confirmed what they've long suspected, it did little to
answer other questions or ease the fight for services.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers have yet to identify what's behind the 273% increase
in autism cases between 1987 and 1998, detailed in the UC Davis
report. And parents often get little guidance on treatments,
therapies and long-term services, simply because doctors and other
experts don't know the answers.</LD>
<LD>   Moira Giammatteo, a West Hills resident who quit her job to better
manage the care for her 5-year-old autistic son, says the report
could lead to better information -- and more options -- for parents.
"There's more attention now," she said. "I think there's reason to
hope."</LD>
<TE>   Autistic kids typically begin to show signs of something amiss
around age 2 or 3. They may be unable to make eye contact or
communicate. Walled in their own worlds, they sometimes perform
repetitive behaviors, such as rocking and hand flapping, and can
become sensitive to sound or touch.</TE>
<TE>   With families often willing to mortgage their houses and go into
debt for the promise of expensive, unproven therapies, doctors say
there's a critical need for sound scientific studies establishing
which treatments work.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no one miracle cure for autism. If there was, we would
have found it by now," said Dr. Sarah Spence, medical director of the
UCLA Autism Evaluation Clinic. "Something you heard about as a
miracle cure is probably going to work in some kids. The key is to
predict this response."</TE>
<TE>   More specialists are needed as well. Too few speech, behavior and
mental health therapists have experience working with autism, and
parents often must wait months to see those who do. Some parents
don't get such help at all.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, few social, medical and residential services are
available for autistic children moving into their teenage and adult
years. What works when a child is 4, 5 or 6 doesn't necessarily help
when that child gets older, Emily Iland of Santa Clarita said. Her
autistic son, Tom, now 18 and attending college, is among many young
adults who need medication for anxiety or depression stemming from
social isolation. "They're smart enough to figure out they're
different and don't know how to fix it," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the complex and confusing world of autism treatment, only one
thing is sure, said Dr. Susan Schmidt-Lackner, who oversees autism
programs at UCLA and at Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services in
Los Angeles: "The earlier we diagnose the kid, the better the
prognosis."</TE>
<TE>   She said autistic children need 30 to 40 hours of structured,
one-on-one therapy each week.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say each child needs a range of therapies targeting his or
her ability to speak and communicate, to form relationships with
others, and to control repetitive behaviors and their sensory
overload. "The cardinal rule when we're looking for therapies ... is
to do no harm," Schmidt-Lackner said.</TE>
<TE>   Moira and Michael Giammatteo understand the difficulty of finding
appropriate treatment. They constantly explore non-drug treatments
for their son, Vico, whose language skills, ability to make eye
contact and overall health improved on a diet that avoids wheat and
milk products.</TE>
<TE>   Although the school district provides 40 hours a week of intensive
behavioral intervention, Moira recently was trained in "relationship
development intervention" therapy to bolster what her son is getting
from the district.</TE>
<TE>   The Giammatteos have consulted with doctors in Florida and
Illinois, and spend nearly $200 a month for supplements.</TE>
<TE>   "We have tried a lot of things," said Moira, who also hosts a
support group for parents. "We are leaving no stone unturned."</TE>
<TE>   Among behavioral therapies with the best track records are applied
behavioral analysis and discrete trial training, which reward
children for mastering certain tasks. Another is floor time, in which
the play between therapist and child simulates other social
interactions.</TE>
<TE>   But Schmidt-Lackner said that because so much about autism is not
known, it's hard to rule out even partially discredited therapies.
"If it works for one kid, it's as if you've saved an entire world,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, "I have to help my clients be savvy consumers,
not plug into the cure du jour and get themselves ripped off.
Unfortunately, autism is an epidemic, but it's also a business."</TE>
<TE>   Among more promising approaches, some doctors say, is the amino
acid l-carnosine, which improves language skills in some children.</TE>
<TE>   But while doctors debate which therapies work best, the
fundamental issue facing families is whether their children can get
the kind of attention that gives them a fighting chance to get
better.</TE>
<TE>   Sherlene Allen, executive director of the Burbank-based Autism
Alliance and the mother of autistic boys ages 3 and 4, said: "There
are just not enough funds to provide adequate or appropriate services
to all the children [and adults] with autism who need them."</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Easing effects of the disorder</TE>
<TE>   Although nothing cures autism, medications developed for other
disorders can alleviate some symptoms.</TE>
<TE>   Antidepressants (Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Celexa) can be
prescribed in very small doses to reduce repetitive behaviors and
anxiety and to improve social interactions.</TE>
<TE>   Antipsychotic medications (Risperdal, Zyprexa, Seroquel and
Geodon) can reduce outbursts of aggression, self-injury and
impulsiveness, and ease irritability and tantrums.</TE>
<TE>   Stimulants (Ritalin and Adderall) can help a child focus.</TE>
<TE>   Anticonvulsants (Tegrital and Depakote) can help children with
abnormal brain activity and can reduce major outbursts.</TE>

<HD>Yoga's outer self, all dressed up</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One look around the "yoga flow" class at Yoga Works in Santa Monica
and it's obvious this is no regular workout crowd. No saggy sweats
and stained gym T-shirts here. Instead, there are lots of skimpy
camisole tops and fitted tanks decorated with Buddha images or
tie-dye patterns, and body-hugging leggings worn mid-hip to reveal
intricate lower back tattoos.</LD>
<LD>   As yoga's popularity has zoomed and studios have sprouted like
Starbucks franchises, yoga has eased its way into the mainstream,
losing its funky, incense-scented reputation. Along the way it has
spawned a plethora of related products, including yoga mats, yoga
bags -- and clothes galore.</LD>
<LD>   This proliferation of clothes may seem to be the antithesis of
yoga principles, such as focusing on one's inner being, but not
everyone is bothered by some of the new aggressive marketing
campaigns.</LD>
<TE>   "There will always be companies that will see how far they can go
in exploiting something," says Max Strom, director of Sacred Movement
Center for Yoga &amp; Healing in Venice. "If they start making sexy lace
tops for yoga, I think that would be an intrusion on what we're doing
here....But we do need clothes, and there are now things just made
for yoga, and it's good. I don't see anything wrong with it."</TE>
<TE>   Independent L.A. yoga instructor Barbara Simon has noticed yoga
clothes appearing in almost every catalog that lands in her mailbox
-- including Victoria's Secret. "If people want to take advantage of
what they see is an opportunity, great," she says. "Some people come
in tights and a T-shirt, and some wear the most fashionable clothes.
If the clothes are what it takes for people to do yoga, I don't care.
We have to be realistic. We're living in a contemporary society, and
it doesn't matter what we wear, it matters what we do and how we feel
about ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   How people dress for yoga varies greatly, depending on the type of
studio and where it's located. Victoria Gregory, a production
accountant from Marina del Rey who takes classes at two Yoga Works
locations in Santa Monica and at Angel City Yoga in Studio City,
notices a distinct difference between the studios. "At Yoga Works on
Montana Avenue," she says, "it can be quite a scene. At Angel City
people dress down more, they'll wear sweats. In the past couple of
years I have noticed a change in how people dress. They're wearing
some cuter things, tops with little straps or halters. It looks like
they spent money on their clothes."</TE>
<TE>   While fashion may not be the first thing one associates with yoga,
yoga clothes are being produced by everyone from Target stores to
Nike to Donna Karan, and labels such as Hard Tail and OMgirl are
popular items in yoga studio boutiques. It is its own full-fledged
niche, and includes camisole tops decorated with sophisticated Asian-
and Indian-inspired graphics, low-rise boot-cut stretch pants and
cropped T-shirts. Pieces such as hooded jackets, wrap skirts and even
shoes are meant for after-class gallivanting to coffee, work or
errands. Prices range from $25 to $80 or higher. Athleta, a women's
athletic wear catalog, has seen its yoga-friendly Essentials line
grow from four pieces in 1996 to more than 15 in its current catalog.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to have fun with yoga clothes, and they're looking
for some type of individuality," says Jodi Petlin, general manager of
Yoga Works in Santa Monica. "People are wearing a lot of bright
colors -- reds and blues and yellows, and some look tie-dyed or have
things like a Buddha image on it. Sometimes classes look like a
Crayola box. But the clothes are extremely functional too."</TE>
<TE>   Proper construction and fabrics are integral to yoga clothes,
which are often sold at yoga studio boutiques. Stretching and holding
various poses demands clothes that don't bind, that reveal the body
without revealing too much, and allow the wearer to feel cool and
comfortable. In Bikram yoga, for example, the thermostat is turned up
to sauna levels. Yoga wear is available in natural fiber blends, such
as cotton/Lycra, as well as moisture-wicking microfibers.</TE>
<TE>   "We take into consideration what women need when they're
practicing yoga," says Tara Scully, head of design and merchandising
for Van Nuys-based Carushka, which specializes in dance and exercise
clothes. "If you had pants with a very wide, full leg, that could get
in the way of holding a pose. As for the neckline, you need some
support so you're not falling out of your top, but the fabric needs
to be softer than a lot of active wear so it can move with you when
you're doing poses. Some workout tops tend to ride up when you move,
so if you're tugging at it you can't hold a pose."</TE>
<TE>   Spaghetti-strap camisoles and sleeveless tops, popular items,
often come with a built-in shelf bra to eliminate the need for a
sports bra. Pants have drawstring or elastic waists that can be
folded down to hip level. While comfort is one goal, so is being able
to show the body's line.</TE>
<TE>   Design plays an important part, too. Most yoga wear has some type
of related graphic on tops and jackets, such as Chinese calligraphy
or Indian and Asian-inspired graphics. Carushka's current line
includes bold neon-hued Buddha images and iridescent accents. KA
Yogawear uses contemporary renderings of yoga poses on the front of
its tops and unitards. Satori Sport also uses Buddhas in contemporary
collaged graphics, as well as yin-yang symbols--as well as something
extra.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we'll put little 'notes' printed inside the clothes,"
explains owner and designer Jennifer Baca, "like 'Things to do today:
Inhale, exhale, inhale,' or "Abide in silence.' People love it. I
think people are more open to Eastern philosophy than they were 10
years ago. Now people are asking for the Buddha."</TE>
<TE>   About 15 million people practice yoga in the U.S., double the
number in 1994, according to Yoga Journal. Mike May, director of
communications for the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Assn., says he's
seen more yoga-specific clothing showing up at the group's yearly
trade show.</TE>
<TE>   Nike, known for producing copious amounts of gear for everything
from running to basketball, quietly launched its studio/yoga line a
year and a half ago with four pieces. It's now up to 15 and is often
prominently displayed in Nike Goddess stores.</TE>
<TE>   "I think women have latched onto yoga apparel because it's an
appealing, feminized version of athletic apparel," says Robin
Shepard, product line manager for women's training apparel. "There's
an element of ease without having it be like your boyfriend's or
husband's sweat pants."</TE>

<HD>Contacts you can wear for a month</HD>
<DH>New materials create lenses that can 'breathe' better than
any so far, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Valerie Reitman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new generation of recently approved contact lenses offer such a
dramatic improvement in comfort, convenience and safety that some
people are forgoing the popular laser eye surgery to correct their
vision.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to significant breakthroughs in lens materials, consumers
can now safely wear contacts around-the-clock for up to 30 days,
without the hassle of taking the lenses out at night, cleaning them
and putting them back in the morning. And the new lenses have been
shown to be safer to wear for extended periods than competing types
of lenses worn for less time, according to several eye doctors who
have tested them in clinical trials.</LD>
<LD>   "It's like the difference between DVDs and videos," said Dr.
Dwight Cavanagh, vice chairman of ophthalmology at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. "Once you've seen a DVD,
you don't buy any more videos."</LD>
<TE>   The new products are CIBA Vision's Focus Night &amp; Day soft lenses
and Menicon Co.'s Menicon Z rigid gas permeable lenses. The Food and
Drug Administration approved the products for 30-day wear in the
United States during the past year, but the new lenses have been slow
to catch on with consumers and doctors. Many eye doctors are not yet
familiar with the products, and some believe that existing contacts
are safe enough.</TE>
<TE>   But eye-care professionals say they expect public awareness to
grow.</TE>
<TE>   Some eye doctors recommend the lenses as an alternative for
consumers who are considering Lasik eye surgery, a popular
vision-correction technique used to treat nearsightedness. Although
many Americans have had Lasik surgery, some people have been
reluctant to undergo the costly procedure because of concern about
possible complications. The procedure carries a very low risk of
serious complications, such as blindness, but a somewhat higher rate
of less severe complications, such as dry eyes or glare. Many people
are wary of taking any risk when it comes to their eyesight.</TE>
<TE>   The new lenses allow at least double -- and in many cases, six to
eight times -- as much oxygen to nourish the cornea as the various
brands now on the market. Inadequate oxygen for the eyes is believed
to have been a chief cause of earlier problems with continuous-wear
lenses that led to sight-threatening infections and corneal
ulcerations. After approving some contacts for 30-day "continuous
wear" in the 1970s, the FDA in 1989 set tighter restrictions on the
lenses, allowing a maximum "extended wear" time of just seven days.</TE>
<TE>   The new lenses, which sell for between $200 and $500, including
fittings, are made of plastics that allow the eyes to breathe "just
like lungs do," says Mary Jo Stiegemeier, a Beachwood, Ohio,
optometrist who participated in the FDA trials of Menicon Z lenses.
She was initially apprehensive about allowing her patients to sleep
with their lenses on for weeks on end. After a month of continuous
wear, however, their corneas looked "like they'd never worn a contact
lens"--a significant improvement from the aftermath of wearing other
kinds of lenses for less time, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The new lenses also significantly minimize the adherence of
bacteria. The lens surface is more natural and "bio harmonious with
the molecules of the body, which is extremely important, said Joseph
Barr, a professor of optometry at Ohio State University and editor of
Contact Lens Spectrum, a medical journal. "The patients and the
practitioners, and I don't mean to demean them, really don't
comprehend the significance of this technological breakthrough," he
says. "In the past 20 years , we've been trying to make lenses like
this--with all that oxygen--that are comfortable, wettable and
bio-compatible."</TE>
<TE>   The two lenses are made from different materials and function
differently. Menicon's lens, which is thin and bendable but still
considered "rigid," is a copolymer of the materials siloxanylstyrene
and fluoro-methacrylate, touted as strong yet porous. To demonstrate
to visiting doctors how much oxygen it allows to reach the eye,
Menicon covered a fish tank with its polymer material. The fish,
which need oxygen to survive, continued to swim without problem,
meaning enough air was passing through the polymer to allow them to
breathe.</TE>
<TE>   CIBA Vision's soft, rubbery Focus Night &amp; Day lens are made of
silicone hydrogel. The FDA also approved a similar soft lens made by
Bausch &amp; Lomb, but CIBA Vision, sued for patent infringement,
successfully blocking Bausch from selling its "Pure Vision" lenses in
the U.S. However, Baush is appealing the decision and continues to
market them internationally. Still, convincing consumers that the new
lenses are safe to wear for a month may be an uphill battle,
considering the bad publicity that the first generation of
continuous-wear lenses received in the 1980s, when some patients
suffered severe corneal infections.</TE>
<TE>   The problems gave rise to disposable contact lenses, used for one
day and then discarded, such as Accuvue. With disposable lenses, "You
don't have to worry about cleaning them, and if you're traveling and
something happens, you just throw the lens away and put another one
in," says spokeswoman Kristie Madara of the Atlanta-based CIBA
Vision, which makes Focus Dailies as well as the new Focus Night &amp;
Day variety.Nevertheless, consumers generally aren't aware of how
much difference there is between brands of lenses -- even those in
the same general category such as soft or rigid gas permeable lenses.</TE>
<TE>   Menicon faces a particular challenge because about 85% of
Americans who wear contact lenses have soft lenses, which are more
comfortable initially. Indeed, relatively few eye doctors fit the gas
permeables. "Optometrists take the easy way out," says Barr, who is
an optometrist, "because soft lenses require less time to fit and
adjust."</TE>
<TE>   Yet for those with adequate tear production, gas permeable would
be the lens of choice, many doctors said, because the lenses move on
the eye better, promote better tear flow, correct astigmatism and
provide better visual acuity.</TE>
<TE>   "A well-adapted rigid gas permeable lens wearer will never switch
to soft" because their vision is sharper and clearer, Cavanagh said.
"But you've got to build up your wearing time and get used to them,
and you can't slack off, whereas the soft you can pop in at any time,
but you don't see as well."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Buffington, a Sacramento optometrist, said he has fitted
15,000 patients with the Menicon Z lenses since the FDA approved
their use for seven-day continuous wear in July 2000. He calls them
"probably the safest contact lens I've ever seen in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Brian Craven, 41, of New Orleans, had been seriously contemplating
Lasik surgery. While researching the procedure on the Internet, he
stumbled on information about Menicon Z and has been wearing the
lenses since.</TE>
<TE>   "I have such a terrific correction and all the benefits of Lasik,
such as being able to read the alarm clock at night and practically
no lens care regimen, without the risk of a poor outcome with Lasik
or the unknown long-term effects of this surgery," Craven said.</TE>

<DH>'Rapid detox' promises opiate addicts an easier out, but
some doctors call for more studies to prove its value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Daniel Costello</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lisa Hill, a 27-year-old prescription drug addict, lies in a hospital
bed in Tustin, about to undergo her third detox attempt. A few
minutes later, doctors give her anesthesia, stick a breathing tube
down her throat and then administer a liquid dose of Naltrexone.
During the next few hours, the drug cleans Hill's body and brain of
any remnants of the painkiller Vicodin that she has been hooked on
since a car accident in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   If Hill were awake, she'd be suffering hours of severe headaches,
vomiting, shakes, sweats and relentless abdominal pain. The doctors,
though, don't wake her for several hours, and later give her sleeping
pills to make it through the night. In the morning, she wakes up,
takes a shower and goes home. A few hours later, she no longer
craves.</LD>
<LD>   The treatment takes two days, from start to finish.</LD>
<TE>   This new and controversial drug detoxification therapy is known as
"rapid detox." Advocates say it's the next generation in drug
treatment, far easier and more effective than traditional methods,
such as 28-day programs or methadone clinics. It's primarily used for
people addicted to opiates, such as heroin, morphine or Oxycontin --
a highly addictive prescription pain medication -- because those
habits are considered the most difficult to kick. Other detox
programs that promise speedy treatment for people addicted to cocaine
and alcohol are beginning to be offered across the country, although
such programs are not yet common.</TE>
<TE>   "This is more successful than traditional treatments. And it's
more humane," says Clare Waismann, director of the Waismann Institute
in Beverly Hills, who brought the treatment to the U.S. five years
ago from Israel, a major center of research into rapid detox
programs. The number of patients undergoing treatment at the
institute's clinic in Tustin has tripled in the last two years,
Waismann says.</TE>
<TE>   Popularity and criticism</TE>
<TE>   The concept of rapid detox is appealing for a number of
reasons. As the name suggests, the treatment is faster and more convenient
than alternatives. Patients could enter treatment on a Thursday and
be back to work by Monday, without disrupting their lives for weeks
or attracting the attention of bosses, co-workers and friends.
Although medical insurance doesn't cover the treatment, which costs
about $10,000, the programs are less costly than some of the longer
and fancier drug treatment programs.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, by most accounts, traditional treatment methods don't
work for many patients. By some estimates, as few as 15% to 30% of
opiate addicts complete traditional treatments. Rapid detox clinics
claim success rates of up to 60%, although those claims have not been
validated by rigorous scientific studies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its growing popularity, many physicians and some prominent
addiction specialists are critical of rapid detox therapy. A key
concern is the lack of clinical studies demonstrating the benefits
and risks of the treatment. Several smaller studies, here and abroad,
have been inconclusive. Researchers at Columbia University are doing
a larger study comparing one-year success rates of rapid detox and
traditional therapy, but their work won't be completed for another
year.</TE>
<TE>   Because there is a small risk to any patient undergoing
anesthesia, many doctors say they won't recommend rapid detox until
more is known. "Our view is that there just isn't adequate scientific
evidence about [rapid detox] and that currently it involves an
unacceptable level of health risk," says Dr. Lawrence Brown,
president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, which serves
as the American Medical Assn.'s expert on addiction medicine.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, supporters of rapid detox say demand for their
programs is growing. There are no federal statistics on the number of
patients who have undergone the treatment, but officials at several
major clinics estimate that 5,000 people in the U.S. have had rapid
detox therapy this year. Several dozen clinics, from Miami to
Seattle, now offer rapid detox treatment, and one company, Los
Angeles-based CITA Biomedical, says it is expanding its program
nationwide next year.</TE>
<TE>   Treatment's key element</TE>
<TE>   At the heart of the treatment is Naltrexone, a nonaddictive,
non-mood altering drug that helps break down the physical effects
opiates have on the body over time. Opiates attach to receptors, or
proteins, in the brain and produce a sensation of feeling "high."
Naltrexone, known as a narcotic antagonist, helps to block those
receptors and to quickly clean the patient's system of any opiates.</TE>
<TE>   After treatment, patients take Naltrexone once a day for up
to nine months. Alternatively, they can have a Naltrexone pellet
inserted in their abdomens that releases the drug over six weeks. If
an addict takes an opiate while on Naltrexone, doctors say, they will
not experience a sensation of feeling high.</TE>
<TE>   While the drug-assisted withdrawal itself takes as little as four
hours, additional time is required to prepare patients for treatment.
Because many addicts often are in poor health, they must first
undergo extensive medical tests, including electrocardiograms, liver
and lung exams and pregnancy tests, the day before detox. They are
then given muscle relaxants, sleeping pills and an opiate so their
bodies don't start to go through withdrawal symptoms before
treatment. The next day, the treatment usually takes place in a
hospital intensive-care unit, overseen by an anesthesiologist and a
team of nurses and technicians. (Most rapid detox programs operate
through private clinics that contract with hospitals.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are risks. It is known that at least seven people
have died in the United States soon after undergoing rapid detox. Six
of those deaths occurred at one New Jersey clinic not located at a
hospital; the physician involved was later disciplined by the state
medical board for failing to take adequate medical precautions. While
doctors and researchers familiar with those cases say it is difficult
to know if the patients died because of the treatment, some critics
of the therapy believe it could have played a role.</TE>
<TE>   And because rapid detox programs are not regulated as consistently
as alternative treatments, such as methadone clinics, some doctors
are doing the procedures in their offices, without the support staff
and emergency equipment required in hospitals. Most doctors strongly
recommend against undergoing rapid detox therapy outside a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Opiate addiction rising</TE>
<TE>   Drug experts do agree that something has to be done to deal with
the growing number of opiate addicts around the country. There is,
after all, a serious health risk to remaining a drug addict.</TE>
<TE>   According to the National Institute for Drug Abuse, there are more
than 1 million opiate addicts in the United States and that number is
rising. Some of the reasons include the large number of Americans,
from baby boomers to the elderly, who are getting hooked on pain
medication for chronic pain.</TE>
<TE>   Oxycontin, a potent painkiller that health authorities say is
increasingly abused, is also playing a role. Overall use of the drug
rose by 140% last year, according to a recent federal survey on drug
use.</TE>
<TE>   Popular alternative treatment methods, such as methadone clinics,
have significant drawbacks. For one, the number of Americans seeking
methadone treatment far exceeds the number of openings at
government-approved treatment clinics. As a result, most clinics have
long waiting lists. What's more, methadone takes nearly a month to
clear the addict's system, compared with a week to 10 days for other
opiates, including heroin. Roger Brenner, 47, says he was addicted,
on and off, to everything from cocaine to heroin for more than 30
years. Six years ago, he started methadone, hoping to break his
heroin habit, but later found that it was more difficult to quit
methadone than the other drugs he had taken. The Vista, Calif.,
service manager underwent rapid detox treatment for methadone three
years ago. Although he felt "like a truck had hit him" when he woke
up after treatment, he said the method worked like "a miracle."
Brenner says he has been clean since.</TE>
<TE>   As more is known about rapid detox, doctors say they are learning
that the treatment works better for some patients than others. People
who have recently become addicted to painkillers, and older addicts,
who are often weary of using drugs and are more motivated to quit,
have better success. One group some doctors are hesitant to treat
with rapid detox is longtime chronic pain sufferers. Many still
experience pain after detoxing and return to drugs to ease their
suffering.</TE>
<TE>   Such is the case with Lisa Hill, the Costa Mesa woman who
underwent treatment at the Waismann's clinic in Tustin. Although Hill
says she didn't feel cravings for the drug immediately after
treatment last month, she ultimately thinks the therapy failed. She
still experiences pain in her back and leg, and she acknowledges that
she returned to taking a prescription painkiller, a few weeks ago. "I
feel there was too much hype around rapid detox," she says.</TE>
<TE>   The Waismann Institute disagrees that the treatment didn't work,
and says that Hill showed no signs of opiate withdrawal after the
procedure, such as abdominal pain or a runny nose.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say one of the most important aspects of rapid detox is
the care provided to patients after the procedure. Depending on the
clinic, post-treatment counseling is provided for two weeks to six
months.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of rapid detox say that intense post-treatment therapy is
the single most important part of addiction treatment and should
continue for up to two years. After all, many patients haven't felt
the pain of even a toothache, or clear emotions, for years and quick
sobriety can be a big shock. "Detox is different from treatment. For
some addicts, six months is a drop in the bucket," says Dr. Gifford
Gervitz, an expert in the field who conducted a small research study
on rapid detox at Tufts University in Massachusetts three years ago.
Gervitz says that his study had favorable results but that with only 20
patients, it wasn't large enough to be conclusive.</TE>

<TE>   Rapid versus traditional detox</TE>
<TE>   While most treatment experts recommend traditional detox therapies
such as 28-day programs, a new "rapid detox" is growing popular.
Under anesthesia, addicts are given the drug Naltrexone, which
rapidly cleans their systems and breaks their cravings.</TE>
<TE>   Length of treatments: Traditional, 28 days; rapid detox, one to
two days.</TE>
<TE>   Cost: Traditional, from $5,000 to $30,000 per month (covered by
some insurance plans); rapid detox, $10,000 (no insurance coverage).</TE>
<TE>   Success rates: Traditional, 15% to 30% of patients remain clean
for one year; rapid detox, as high as 60%, as reported by several
clinics, but the numbers haven't been confirmed in scientifically
rigorous studies.</TE>

<LD>Are there any drugs for cholesterol that aren't statins? My doctor
says, "Not really." But I know statins haven't been around all that
long, so there must have been something to control high cholesterol.
I can't tolerate statins and would welcome an alternative.</LD>
<LD>   You're right that doctors used to prescribe other medicines for
high cholesterol. Statin medications such as Zocor, Pravachol and
Lipitor are so effective at lowering cholesterol that many doctors
stopped using drugs like Questran or Colestid. But these medications,
and a newer one called WelChol, are options for people who can't
tolerate statin drugs. Other possibilities include Lopid or Tricor.</LD>
<LD>   With the fuss about the dangers of hormone replacement therapy, I
stopped taking hormones. Now I have developed vaginal dryness. What
can I do about this?</LD>
<TE>   Ask your doctor whether Estring would be a safe alternative for
you. This prescription vaginal ring lasts three months after
insertion. It releases 2 milligrams of estrogen over that time, which
is much lower than typical oral doses of estradiol.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Not long ago, a young family sat in my office, the baby securely
cradled in the father's arms. The parents looked very young, probably
still in their teens, a baby now making them a family. They waited
hopefully for the words that follow most well-baby checkups. "Your
baby is growing well, strong and healthy" are words that can reassure
even the most anxious parents.</LD>
<LD>   Today there would be no encouraging words. The infant had been
born with a condition called holoprosencephaly. In the first few
weeks of embryonic development, something had gone awry, leaving her
with a hollow shell of a brain, capable of only the most primitive
functions: regulation of heartbeat, breathing and withdrawal from
pain. Usually, these infants live only a few weeks, but with the aid
of a surgically inserted feeding tube, she was now several months
old.</LD>
<LD>   Doesn't she need immunizations yet? the parents asked me. When
will she learn to roll over? Her cousin is the same age, they said,
and can roll over and hold her own bottle.</LD>
<TE>   Rather than reply directly, I asked what they had been told about
her condition. I assumed they had been to many other doctors -- and
that they were searching for someone to offer them the antidote for
this rare and terrible condition.</TE>
<TE>   The couple acknowledged that they had been told their baby
wouldn't live. But look at her, they said, she's growing and doing
well -- she even smiled once.</TE>
<TE>   I saw nothing that resembled a smile, nor could I conceive of its
possibility. However, with the aid of her feeding tube, she was
growing and gaining weight. Without it, she would have died long ago,
either from pneumonia or of starvation.</TE>
<TE>   I reaffirmed what they had been told. I didn't know how long their
baby would live, but most infants with this condition rarely live
more than a few months. They stared at me blankly, no emotion
revealed on their faces. Did they understand what I had just said?</TE>
<TE>   I tried a more blunt approach. I measured her head, showing them
the growth chart that demonstrated how much smaller her head was than
even the smallest newborn. I told them she needed more brain to roll
over, to sit up, to smile, to eat.</TE>
<TE>   Can she still be immunized? was the response. They seemed to hope
that she would attend kindergarten someday and that they would need
to provide proof that she, like all the other 5-year-olds, had been
properly vaccinated.</TE>
<TE>   Weighing the options, I agreed to vaccinate their daughter. All
children deserve to be protected from measles, tetanus and whooping
cough.</TE>
<TE>   I saw the family several times over the next few weeks. The child
neither improved nor deteriorated. The parents never wavered from the
stance that she was a normal baby. Only one thing hinted at their
awareness of her handicap: They covered her head in a bonnet that
nearly disguised her deformity and hid her from the eyes of curious
strangers.</TE>
<TE>   Attempting to reassure them, I held her in my arms and told them
that her condition was an accident of nature and no fault of theirs.
They seemed more comforted by my gesture than by my words.</TE>
<TE>   Over those weeks, I treated her coughs and her colds and her
diaper rashes just as I would for other infants. I gave her the
prescribed immunizations. The parents beamed proudly when I reported
her weight gain. When they thought they saw her smiling or reaching
for objects -- something I knew was medically impossible -- I didn't
argue.</TE>
<TE>   She died peacefully in her ninth month of life. I was thankful she
had passed away in her own home, with her family. If her parents had
brought her to me in the last hours of her life, I doubt that I would
have had the courage to refrain from using life-prolonging
technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Although initially frustrated and perplexed by the parents'
stubborn refusal to see the inevitable, I gradually came to see that
their emotions were both necessary and natural. Necessary because it
freed them to provide her with the best possible care during her
short life. Natural because love blinds all parents to their
children's flaws, be they trivial or fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Parents' love can obscure logical thought and transcend medical
fact. It is, clearly, an expression of our humanity. When I called
the family to offer my condolences, I understood that they mourned
her as fully as other parents would have. To them, she was simply
their child.</TE>

<LD>The skinny-tire cycles once known as 10-speeds, largely ignored
during the '90s mountain-bike craze, are up to 27 speeds now -- and
sales are red-hot. Why? People miss going fast. The bikes are also
the best workout on two wheels, and bike makers have raised the
comfort quotient: New models have higher handlebars, hill-eating
"granny gear" and sloped aluminum frames that make it easier to get
on and off your cycle. Here are four good ones:</LD>
<LD>   Fully loaded for comfort</LD>
<LD>   Specialized Sequoia Sport: Best of the breed. Every imaginable
feel-good feature except a post-ride massage.</LD>
<TE>   Likes: Suspension seat post, carbon-fiber fork and thick gel
handlebar tape soak up road vibration. Adjustable stem lets you raise
or lower the handlebars up to three inches. Sexy raw-aluminum
clear-coat finish. Rack mounts. Safe, convenient extension brake
levers accessible at the top of the handlebars, where most of us hold
on.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: The wheel rims and 24-speed Shimano Sora drive train
have an economy-car feel, but still not bad considering the bike's
price.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $820. (800) 245-3462. www.specialized.com.</TE>
<TE>   The mountain-bike hybrid</TE>
<TE>   Marin Bear Valley: Hopped-up hybrid with mountain-bike handlebars
and fast, narrow road-bike wheels.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Off-road bars, brakes and gearshifters feel comfy and solid
on asphalt. Bar-ends (small extensions on the handlebar ends) allow
hand-position changes. Mounts for racks. Hot looks.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: Flat bars no match for a road bar's down-in-the-drops
aero tuck or efficiency in high speeds, headwinds or hills. Aluminum
fork can be harsh. No adjustable stem.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $599. (800) 222-7557; www.marinbikes.com.</TE>
<TE>   For the cross-country ride</TE>
<TE>   Giant OCR Touring: Terrific. High-end cross-country hauler with
superb all-purpose comfort and safety features.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Stretch-limo wheelbase smooths road, gives pannier
clearance and fits an air pump behind the seat tube. Disc brakes
handle heavy downhill loads and panic stops in traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Also, nifty hidden cables, adjustable-height stem, front and rear
rack mounts, three water-bottle cage mounts, clip-in pedals, 27-speed
Shimano 105 drive train. And it's beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: No suspension seat post or Sequoia-style brake extension
levers.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $1,300. (800) 874-4268. www.giantbicycle.com.</TE>
<TE>   The radical treatment</TE>
<TE>   Kona Kona: Road bike by renowned maker of radical mountain bikes.</TE>
<TE>   Likes: Vibration-eating carbon fork, stealthy all-black graphics.
Taut, fast feel.</TE>
<TE>   Dislikes: No rack eyelets, adjustable stem, extension brake
levers. For the price, I want clip-in pedals and more than a 24-speed
Shimano Sora drive train.</TE>
<TE>   Price: $900 (360) 366-0951; www.konaworld.com.</TE>

<KH>GETTING BETTER</KH>
<HD>Never too late to create a perfect smile</HD>
<DH>For health and cosmetic reasons, more grown-ups are
enduring the inconvenience and expense of orthodontia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Benedict Carey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A life on camera will expose even the most subtle imperfections in
appearance, as Renee Spei knows. An actress who does work in film, TV
and voice-over, she saw her face on screen several years ago and
noticed something she hadn't before. Her smile wasn't right. Once
pristine as pearls, her front two teeth now overlapped a bit; several
in the lower row leaned and bunched together.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think I lost any jobs because of it, but you never know,"
she said. "It was bugging me. You know how it is: It may seem a very
small thing to everyone else, but if it's bugging you, it's not so
small anymore."</LD>
<LD>   At a time when people regularly visit cosmetic surgeons to alter
the shape of their lips, noses and breasts, Spei found herself
contemplating in her mid-20s a cosmetic procedure that's so routine,
safe and socially acceptable that it's almost invisible -- on
13-year-olds. By adulthood, we're supposed to be beyond braces.</LD>
<TE>   A mouthful of steel scaffolding goes much better with ponytails
than with business meetings, car payments and dinner parties. Yet
even people who had straight, clean beauties into their teens often
discover years later that a few of their teeth, especially lower
teeth, are listing noticeably, said Spei's orthodontist, Dr. Patrick
Turley, a professor emeritus at UCLA now in private practice in Santa
Monica. Teeth tend to drift toward the front of the mouth with age,
and may eventually press together and slightly overlap, he said.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take much misalignment to cause food buildup, uneven
wear on the teeth and, eventually, gum disease. The number of adults
getting braces has increased about 30% since 1994, to more than 1
million in the United States and Canada, and many get them to combat
creeping gum problems, according to the American Orthodontists Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Spei learned that her alignment would only get worse with time and
decided that a spell in braces would ultimately help her career
rather than hinder it. She wasn't too worried about the shock value.
Her good friends would hardly care, and there was no one role that
would need rewriting because of the braces. "Most of all," she said,
"I knew in the end it would make me feel better about myself."</TE>
<TE>   Her biggest concerns were money and time.</TE>
<TE>   Compared with children's jaws, which are still developing, adult
jawbones may as well be cast in concrete, and correction typically
takes more time. Where youngsters often get their braces off in a
year or 18 months, adults may be smiling silver for months longer.
Costs range from $3,000 to $7,000. In her case, Spei learned that
doing the job right would cost about $6,000 and take three years --
putting her into her late 20s. The news was hard to digest, but there
was a small loophole: "If I got a big part, I could have them taken
off temporarily during filming," she said. "That made me feel better
about it."</TE>
<TE>   The first few days scored by far the highest on the discomfort
meter. "Your mouth is very sensitive, very tender, especially the
first 24 hours," Spei said, "and you stick to softer foods, soft
bread, ice cream, that sort of thing." After that, the teeth and gums
quickly adapt to the new rigging. Typically, adult wearers visit the
orthodontist every two months or so for tightening, followed by a day
or two of soreness, Turley said.</TE>
<TE>   In between visits, there's cleaning and more cleaning. This is no
less labor-intensive with modern braces than it was a generation ago,
when schoolchildren wore the full-metal-jacket bands and brackets.
After each meal, orthodontists say, wearers should brush and floss
carefully. "You're talking about five to 10 minutes or more every
time," Spei said. "It's a lot of work, and probably the most annoying
thing about this."</TE>
<TE>   Though clear, ceramic and plastic braces are effective, the steel
bands work faster and more precisely, Turley said. As a rule,
orthodontists say, young, single people tend to be more interested in
clear braces than those who are middle-aged and married. Clear braces
can cost 10% to 30% more than the steel variety and are usually worn
for longer, orthodontists say. Spei decided on the steel; she would
be upfront about it. "I lost one job because of them, I know that for
sure," she said.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't long, either, before some people at her local store and
gym and the Beverly Hills Playhouse, where she's a regular actor,
tagged her affectionately as "Renee-with-braces." Some of her friends
even questioned why she did it at all; they saw no problem with her
teeth.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in a few months' time, it ceased to be a topic of
conversation. She even landed recurring parts on the soaps "General
Hospital" and "The Bold and the Beautiful." "I even wore them for the
parts," she said. Though there's virtually no age limit for braces --
people over 80 now get them -- those with bone problems or a history
of serious, chronic gum infection often are not good candidates,
orthodontists say. When they are moved, the teeth dissolve jawbone to
create space, and new bone then grows into the space left behind. If
the bone doesn't regenerate, the teeth do not set as firmly.</TE>
<TE>   In Spei's case, there was an unexpected upside: The braces made
her look younger. "Once I had my hair in ponytails, with a baseball
cap on, and got myself carded at the grocery store," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The first thing Spei noticed when she got them off in March was
the size of her smile -- it seemed wider. In the months since, she
has been a lot more "herself" at auditions, she said, and more
confident. The reaction among her friends and colleagues to her reset
pearls was strangely muted. Some took weeks to notice the change.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times that happens," Turley said. "The way braces are
now, people see you for the first time after they're off and they're
not quite sure what the difference is. They say, 'What'd you do,
change your hair?' "</TE>

<LD>Yoga postures, such as this version of the "warrior pose,'' can
increase strength and flexibility throughout your body, and they will
help you to develop better concentration and balance. The pose shown
here is said to strengthen and stretch the legs and ankles, while
also stretching the groin, chest and shoulders.</LD>
<LD>   1 Stand on a level, nonslip surface with your legs wide apart.
Extend your arms. Turn your right foot out to a 90-degree angle and
turn your left foot in about 15 degrees. Your right heel should be in
line with your left instep, with equal weight over both legs. Turn
your head to the right, looking past your extended arm. Inhale.</LD>
<LD>   2 On the exhale, bend your right knee in a 90-degree angle. Your
right thigh should be parallel to the floor. Your right shin bone
should be perpendicular to the floor and your back leg straight.
Extend your arms out to the side with your palms facing down. Gaze
over your right hand. Make sure your torso is in an upright position,
centered over both legs. Hold this pose for 30 seconds while you
breathe fully and deeply. Repeat on the other side.</LD>

<HD>Doing surgery without scalpels, but sound waves</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Marsa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It sounds like something lifted from "Star Trek": High intensity
sound waves are beamed through the skin, enabling doctors to perform
surgery without making incisions. But this futuristic scalpel may
soon be available in the nation's operating rooms.</LD>
<LD>   Scientists at Indiana University in Indianapolis have devised a
tool that uses sound waves broadcast through a specially designed set
of speakers to destroy diseased or cancerous tissue. The waves, which
are at frequencies too high for people to hear, converge inside the
body -- an effect similar to using a magnifying glass to focus the
sun's light onto a piece of paper.</LD>
<LD>   "It burns at the focal point," says Narendra Sanghvi, an engineer
who helped develop this technology. "Because the energy level is so
high, the tissue gets extremely hot in less than a second, and the
cells die instantaneously."</LD>
<TE>   The device simultaneously beams lower frequency ultrasound waves
to create a three-dimensional picture for doctors, akin to how
ultrasound is used today to find tumors or to detect fetal
abnormalities. Consequently, the targeted region can be hit with a
pinpoint accuracy that rivals the precision of a scalpel, say
experts, and doesn't harm the surrounding tissue.</TE>
<TE>   This scalpel-free surgical tool, called the Sonablate 500, may be
the first high-intensity focused ultrasound device approved for use
in the United States, and is awaiting clearance from the Food and
Drug Administration for the treatment of enlarged prostates. In the
future, it could be used to remove various types of benign and
malignant tumors.</TE>
<TE>   Acoustic surgery, as it is known, has several advantages over
conventional surgery, its proponents say. By not breaking the skin,
risks of infection are diminished; there's no blood loss so
transfusions are unnecessary; patients experience less pain; and
recovery time is reduced. "This has a lower complication rate and
patients experience less side effects," says Dr. Richard Bihrle, a
urologist and member of the Indiana University ultrasound research
team.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana University researchers began working on their device in
the mid-1980s when ultrasound began to be widely used to dissolve
kidney stones. In order to adapt the technique for other types of
surgery, however, they needed to monitor exactly what the ultrasound
tool was doing to ensure accurate targeting of the beam.</TE>
<TE>   They ultimately invented a machine that can transmit
three-dimensional images from deep inside the body at the same time
it emits high intensity beams for treatment. This way, doctors get
immediate feedback.</TE>
<TE>   What made the technology practical, though, was the discovery the
body breaks down and excretes the tissue killed by the sound waves.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought dead tissue had to be surgically removed," says
Sanghvi, "but the body's own scavenging system" disposes of the
debris.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, they've used their device to reduce swelling in men
with enlarged prostates, and are testing it on prostate cancer
sufferers. Once this technology becomes widely available, predicts
Bihrle, "the potential applications are huge."</TE>

<TE>   Acoustic surgery's possibilities</TE>
<TE>   Acoustic surgery using ultrasound devices is being done in China,
Japan and Europe to treat bone, liver, kidney, pancreatic, prostate
and liver cancers. In the United States, researchers are
experimenting with ultrasound to destroy tumors and to patch leaky
blood vessels. Cooking tissue with intense heat triggers the
production of bodily chemicals that cauterize wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard University scientists, for instance, are using ultrasound
to treat uterine fibroids and to operate inside the skull.
Researchers at the University of Washington are doing ultrasound
procedures on animals to stop hemorrhages deep inside the body. In
the future, this technique may be used to close wounds during
surgery, stop the internal bleeding that often kills traffic accident
victims, and treat soldiers injured in battle, says Merilee Andrew,
an engineer in the University of Washington's Applied Physics
Laboratory.</TE>

<HD>A way to pierce smokers' cravings</HD>

<AU>Dianne Partie Lange</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At least 18 studies have attempted to establish whether acupuncture
helps smokers quit, but most of them were of poor quality. Now a
study designed to address the shortcomings of earlier research has
found that acupuncture does indeed help smokers quit, but it works
best when combined with an education program.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 smokers who had previously tried and failed to quit
received one of three treatments: acupuncture five times a week for
four weeks, acupuncture together with five weeks of a quit-smoking
education program or the education program and fake acupuncture. (The
fake acupuncture group had the needle treatment at ear and wrist
points close to the true points. The group that had the real thing
had acupuncture to five ear points commonly used to treat chemical
dependency.)</LD>
<LD>   Forty percent of those who got the combined treatment were able to
stop smoking, which was double the rate of the other groups. In
contrast to what most people expect, those who had the heaviest habit
-- smoking a pack a day for 20 years or two packs a day for 10 -- had
the most benefit, said the study's lead author, Ian D. Bier,
president of IB Scientific, a clinical research company specializing
in natural medicine.</LD>
<TE>   "This finding is extremely important, as it indicates that the
combined treatment protocol is effective in the population that is
most addicted and at the greatest risk of developing smoking-related
diseases," the authors reported.</TE>
<TE>   The long-term effects aren't known, said Bier, since most of the
participants were not available for interviews 18 months later. But
for those who were, the trend persisted. "If someone is smoke-free at
18 months," he said, "it's likely to be permanent."</TE>

<TE>   Newfound gene is believed to suppress breast cancer</TE>
<TE>   Inherited forms of breast cancer have long been linked to the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, allowing women to screen for the genes and
make decisions accordingly. But non-inherited cancers, so-called
"sporadic" forms, are nine times more common. Now scientists have
found a gene that plays a role in this type of the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The gene, called DBC2 for "deleted in breast cancer," is a tumor
suppressor that regulates cell growth. If the gene is not active or
is disabled, the cells that either lack the gene or contain a mutated
version can grow out of control. Unrelenting cell growth is the
hallmark of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York
discovered that the protein made by the DBC2 gene was present in
normal cells but was absent from the breast cancer cells of 11 of the
19 tissue specimens they examined. The researchers then inserted
either a damaged DBC2 gene or a normal one into cancer cells. The
cells with the mutated gene continued to grow, but those that
received the normal gene stopped growing.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Masaaki Hamaguchi, a member of the team that identified DBC2,
said the discovery could lead to new diagnostic and treatment
methods.</TE>

<TE>   Stroke symptoms in women likelier to be overlooked</TE>
<TE>   Women are more likely to die from strokes than men and to have
worse outcomes when they do survive -- and, new research shows, their
early symptoms are different too.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers reviewed interview transcripts and medical charts of
more than 1,000 men and women who had strokes over a two-year period.
In addition to the usual symptoms -- sudden weakness or numbness on
one side of the body; facial drooping; generalized changes in the
ability to walk, talk and see; and dizziness -- the patients were
asked about nontraditional symptoms such as headaches, face and limb
pain, weakness, shortness of breath and palpitations.</TE>
<TE>   Women were 62% more likely to experience sensations in the
nontraditional category than men and more likely to have complaints
not related to their nervous systems, such as chest pain and
shortness of breath. Also, the symptoms women tend to experience,
such as pain and disorientation, are generalized, which may delay
diagnosis.</TE>

<HD>The power of lifting weights</HD>
<DH>It's easy to blame added flab on a slow metabolism. But
there's a sure way to rev up the body's ability to burn fat: Build
muscle.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carol Krucoff</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most persistent myths about weight loss is that people who
have trouble shedding fat are simply cursed with a slow metabolism.</LD>
<LD>   "Metabolism is everyone's favorite scapegoat," says William Evans,
director of the Nutrition, Metabolism and Exercise Lab at the
University of Arkansas for Medical Science.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the metabolic rate -- a measure of how many calories your body
needs to function -- is rarely responsible for weight-loss woes. "The
metabolic rate is remarkably similar in most individuals," Evans
says, once you control for these two critical factors:</LD>
<TE>   Lean body mass, the percentage of body weight that comes from
muscle, bone and organ.</TE>
<TE>   Restrictive dieting, consuming significantly fewer calories than
you expend.</TE>
<TE>   Arguably the single most important determinant of metabolic rate
is lean body mass. "The more lean tissue you have," Evans says, "the
higher your metabolic rate."</TE>
<TE>   Muscle mass boosts metabolism because muscle is active tissue that
helps convert food into water, heat and energy. Fat is more passive,
acting primarily as a stored form of body energy. So when your body
is deciding what to do with the food you've eaten, the more muscle
you have, the more calories it can send to muscle cells to be burned.
This leaves fewer calories to go to fat cells to be stored.</TE>
<TE>   Their higher proportion of muscle explains why, in general, men
have higher metabolic rates than women and younger people have higher
metabolic rates than older people. Starting around age 30, muscle
mass in sedentary individuals declines by about 2% to 5% per decade,
says Evans, adding that caloric requirements -- and metabolic rate --
decline accordingly. This is why an active, muscular 20-year-old can
eat much more than a sedentary, pot-bellied 55-year-old without
gaining weight.</TE>
<TE>   Dieting also can ratchet down metabolism. "When you go on a
restrictive diet, your body senses starvation and slows your
metabolic rate to conserve energy," Evans said.</TE>
<TE>   As your body tries to save its fat stores, it breaks down muscle
mass for energy. This means that people who try to lose weight
exclusively through extreme diets also rob their bodies of muscle and
bone. This reduction in muscle further lowers the metabolic rate.
Then, when these people go off their diets and gain the weight back,
which is what typically happens, the regained weight is usually fat.
This spiral of muscle lost and fat regained is common, Evans says,
among people who try to lose weight solely by restricting calories.</TE>
<TE>   But muscle loss -- and the resulting metabolic slowdown -- isn't
inevitable. Strength-training exercises can help build and maintain
muscle mass, dramatically "revving up" the metabolism. "Every pound
of muscle we lose lowers our metabolic rate by about 30 to 50
calories per day, and every pound of muscle we gain raises our
metabolic rate by about 30 to 50 calories per day," says Wayne
Westcott, author of books and journal articles on strength training
and fitness research director at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy,
Mass.</TE>
<TE>   "What's remarkable is the change you can make in your metabolic
rate with strength training," he adds. "Several excellent new studies
suggest that formerly sedentary adults who do a program of strength
training for three months gain about 3 pounds of muscle -- that's a
pound of muscle a month."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers found that this 3-pound increase in muscle mass
boosted the participants' resting metabolic rate by about 7%,
Westcott says. "So with just three months of strength training you
can reverse decades of the aging process."</TE>
<TE>   Although growing older does cause some reduction in the metabolic
rate, Westcott, Evans and others say that most of the metabolic
slowdown attributed to aging comes from the physical slowdown.
Genetics also plays a role but Evans says its primary contribution is
"to the extent that your genes help dictate how much lean body mass
you have." In rare cases, a medical condition, such as a thyroid
problem, can affect the metabolic rate.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's possible to boost the metabolic rate by artificial
means -- such as cigarette smoking and certain drugs -- the risks far
outweigh the benefits, Evans says.</TE>
<TE>   Nicotine and compounds containing ephedrine stimulate the central
nervous system, which releases certain hormones that help speed up
the metabolism. "But the dangers of these drugs are becoming well
known," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Aerobic exercise is helpful for burning calories and improving
cardiovascular health, Evans says, but strength training is the key
to revving up metabolism. "Strength training builds the muscle that
boosts the metabolic rate," he says. "And the higher your metabolic
rate, the more calories you burn throughout the day -- even at rest."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Alpha lipoic acid may be the most potent of the antioxidants,
nutrients that help neutralize free radicals and prevent damage to
cells. (Free radicals are thought to play a role in many diseases.) A
vitamin-like fatty acid that contains sulfur, alpha lipoic acid is
made by the body and plays a large role in energy production within
cells. It is found in red meat and in small amounts in potatoes,
carrots, yams and spinach.</LD>
<LD>   Uses: Unlike vitamins C or E, alpha lipoic acid is both water- and
fat-soluble, meaning it works inside cells and within fatty cell
membranes. Alpha lipoic acid supplements have been touted as a
general preventive and as possible treatments for diabetes,
Alzheimer's disease, age-related macular degeneration, cataracts and
HIV.</LD>
<LD>   Dose: Lipoic acid usually is sold in capsules of 100 to 300
milligrams. Doses of 600 milligrams a day are recommended for some
ailments, although 30 to 300 milligrams a day are thought to be
sufficient for healthy people.</LD>
<TE>   Precautions: The long-term effects of taking alpha lipoic acid
supplements are not well understood. Studies have shown that
extremely high doses of antioxidants may damage cells in much the
same way free radicals do. Doses of up to 600 milligrams a day have
been shown to be safe in some studies.</TE>
<TE>   Research: Alpha lipoic acid is not accepted in mainstream medicine
as a treatment for any condition. However, the federal government has
funded studies examining its effect on cell function among people
with HIV and multiple sclerosis.</TE>
<TE>   Dietary supplement makers are not required by the U.S. government
to demonstrate that their products are safe or effective. Ask your
health-care provider for advice on selecting a brand.</TE>

<HD>Scientists warn a germ-phobic nation against going too far</HD>
<DH>They call for more exposure to disease-causing microbes to
help build the immune system and prevent illness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Antibacterial soaps, disinfectants and dust-free environments may be
doing as much harm as good, we're now learning. But for a nation that
thinks the only good germ is a dead germ, going cold turkey on the
microbe-killers is unlikely.</LD>
<LD>   So scientists are trying to compensate for our obsession with
cleanliness, even as they attempt to better understand how our
allergy and asthma-wracked bodies may be the casualties of overkill.</LD>
<LD>   Some researchers are trying to kick-start our immune systems by
exposing them to microbes they wouldn't otherwise encounter. Others
are trying to help people who already suffer from allergy, asthma or
autoimmune diseases.</LD>
<TE>   "We are at a point where we know our original ideas -- that germs
were bad and dogs were bad for allergies -- were oversimplified and
not correct," said Dr. Marshall Plaut of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infection Diseases. But, he said, "we don't know the
right balance between bacterial exposure being harmful and bacterial
exposure being beneficial."</TE>
<TE>   What they suspect is that, by purging our environment of many
germs and microbes, we've deprived our immune systems of the chance
to recognize them as a natural part of the environment. When we do
encounter such substances, in the form of bacteria, viruses, fungi,
along with pet dander, dust, pollen and similar irritants, our bodies
overreact. We wheeze and sneeze.</TE>
<TE>Asthma rates have soared in the last 20 years. Not only has the lung
disorder become one of the most common diseases of childhood, it's
become increasingly fatal. At the same time, autoimmune illnesses
such as Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease (a
painful inflammation of the intestines) are all on the rise.</TE>
<TE>   Louise Varbanov, mother of a healthy 3-year-old, has been paying
close attention to the recent reports on germs and illness. The
Cresskill, N.J., resident has taken a page from her Bulgarian-born
husband, who was raised with a more casual attitude about dirt and
germs.</TE>
<TE>   "I keep my house clean, but I don't keep it germ-free, and I
purposely don't use antibacterial cleansers," she said. "I think it
will not allow him to develop immunity to things that we're exposed
to in the everyday world."</TE>
<TE>   In fighting mode by age 3</TE>
<TE>   For thousands of years, men and women lived in a fairly
contaminated environment, surrounded by a sea of bacteria and other
microbes. Our bodies learned to sense their presence and respond
appropriately. This ability, scientists have shown, becomes rooted in
the first six to 24 months of life. By age 3, our bodies have learned
all they need to know to unleash fighting cells against invaders.</TE>
<TE>   But by insulating ourselves so well and interfering with early
exposures that should set the body's sensors correctly, we've
disturbed the system. Work from a growing number of research teams is
reinforcing the hygiene hypothesis, which holds that exposure to
microbes and getting infected with some of them strengthens the
body's natural immune system against allergies. Without it, they
contend, we're more liable to see the part of our immune system
responsible for wheezing, inflammation and other allergic symptoms
run wild.</TE>
<TE>   The theory has recently been expanded to incorporate autoimmune
diseases too, in which the immune system goes into overdrive and
begins attacking itself.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, European researchers, reporting in the Sept. 19 New
England Journal of Medicine, showed that German, Swiss and Austrian
children living on farms and exposed naturally to bacteria from
animals had just half the allergies and less asthma than children of
similar socioeconomic backgrounds living in villages.</TE>
<TE>   Before that, U.S. researchers had shown in several studies that
kids who are exposed to other children's colds and infections in
day-care have less asthma and fewer allergies later in life. Other
studies have shown that kids who have a cat or dog from a very young
age have less asthma and fewer allergies than those who have grown up
without pets.</TE>
<TE>   However, Dr. Juan Celedon, a researcher into the genetics and
epidemiology of asthma at the Channing Laboratory at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, says this doesn't apply if your mother
has asthma.</TE>
<TE>   He recently co-authored a study in the medical journal Lancet
showing that exposure to high levels of cat allergen protected
against wheezing in the first five years of life only in those
children whose mothers did not have asthma. Exposing kids with
asthmatic moms to high levels of cat allergen "was associated with
higher levels of wheezing in ages 3 to 5."</TE>
<TE>   He predicted that within 10 years, "we're going to be able to
identify things that are going to be protective and make some
recommendations."</TE>
<TE>   Using power of microbes</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Fernando D. Martinez of the University of Arizona's
Respiratory Sciences Center, is among those looking to harness the
power of microbes for the prevention of allergy, asthma and
autoimmune disorders. Instead of constantly trying to battle the
things that make us scratch, sneeze or cough, he wants to find
approaches that would let us live more harmoniously with the plethora
of microbes and animals around us.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, exposing a child to the bacteria that protected farm
kids in Europe is a tricky proposition because it could make them
sick.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Martinez says: "What I want to find is a product that
imitates exposure without having to go to the farms."</TE>
<TE>   While he's focused on prevention, others, like Dr. Eyal Raz, a
researcher at UC San Diego, are trying to find ways to help asthma
and allergy sufferers. Raz is using synthetic DNA that can provoke or
stimulate the immune system the way bacterial DNA does, but without
making the patient sicker.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, he said, "we tried to domesticate the dirt, to purify
the dirt." So far, his work is being done in animals, where Raz said
it has succeeded in inhibiting diseases such as Crohn's.</TE>
<TE>   But all the strides taking place in the laboratory don't mean we
shouldn't wash our hands before we eat or that we should bring the
livestock indoors. Nor does it diminish the power of clean water,
sterile operating rooms and vaccination against childhood diseases to
help most of us, unlike our ancestors, survive well beyond our first
birthdays. Martinez tells parents to get a pet if they'd like, unless
their child already is allergic. If they want to place their children
in day-care early on, he advises them not to feel guilty about it,
unless the child has so many recurrent infections that the
pediatrician says it's unhealthy. And if a child drops some food on
the floor, it's probably just fine to pick it up, wipe it off and eat
it because "children are perfectly capable of eating non-sterilized
food."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't pay too much attention to the excessive protection we have
set as a rule," said Martinez, noting that kids living in Eastern
Europe, where the rules are much more lax, have few allergies and
little asthma.</TE>
<TE>   Varbanov, the New Jersey mom, even takes a laissez faire approach
to the colds and viruses her son picks up in day-care and preschool.
"You're kind of toughening them up, so when they get into grade
school, they're less likely to take sick and fall behind."</TE>

<HD>39 Deaths Linked to AstraZeneca Drug</HD>
<DH>Many more cancer patients in Japan suffer debilitating lung
injuries after taking Gefitinib, which is seeking FDA approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>More than three dozen patients in Japan have died from side effects
after taking a cancer-fighting drug made by Anglo-Swedish company
AstraZeneca, and Japanese health authorities were expected to
investigate, a company spokeswoman said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The drug, Gefitinib, has caused debilitating lung injuries such as
interstitial pneumonia in 125 patients, including the 39 who have
died, said spokeswoman Fumiko Muramoto.</LD>
<LD>   "We knew about the possibility of these side effects from our
clinical trials," Muramoto said. "But the number of safety incidents
is increasing very rapidly. It's alarming, and that's why we're
issuing the warnings."</LD>
<TE>   Japan is the only country that has approved Gefitinib for advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer. The Food and Drug Administration is
reviewing London-based AstraZeneca's application to sell the drug in
the United States, as are Swiss drug regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Gefitinib, sold under the Iressa brand, has been taken by at least
10,000 cancer patients since it was cleared for use in Japan in July,
Muramoto said.</TE>
<TE>   She said Japan's Health, Welfare and Labor Ministry plans to
investigate the company's Osaka-based subsidiary. Health ministry
officials could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 15, AstraZeneca issued a safety warning to doctors after
the company received reports of severe side effects in 22 patients,
including 11 who died, Muramoto said. The company later raised the
figure to 26 affected patients, including 13 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, she said, the company had reports of 65 cases of
side effects, including 27 deaths, but had not gone through all the
cases to confirm their link to the drug. She said the company
reported only the confirmed cases at the news conference, and it took
10 more days to give the final results to the health ministry.</TE>
<TE>   Muramoto said the company had reported the figures within the 30
days required by law and had no intention of concealing the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "But the health ministry has made it clear they are not happy with
the slow pace of reporting cases," Muramoto said, adding that the
company was trying to speed up its filings.</TE>

<HD>Firm Says Law Stifles Fair Use</HD>
<DH>Software developer is trying to prove his DVD Copy Plus
does not violate copyright law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert H. Moore, a software developer on the outskirts of St. Louis,
built a multimillion-dollar business out of helping people copy DVDs.</LD>
<LD>   Now he's trying to prove that his products are legal.</LD>
<LD>   Moore's wares enable the copying of discs even if they are
scrambled to prevent duplication, as are most movies sold on DVD.
This sort of product, officials at the Motion Picture Assn. of
America say, blatantly violates a 1998 federal law against picking
the electronic locks on copyrighted works.</LD>
<TE>   Moore disagrees, saying the public has the right to make backup
copies of the DVDs it buys. His company, 321 Studios of Chesterfield,
Mo., has asked a federal judge to rule that its DVD Copy Plus product
does not violate copyright law. As an alternative, the company asked
the judge to declare unconstitutional the anti-circumvention
provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</TE>
<TE>   The case is one of several high-stakes battles in courts and in
Washington that pit consumer rights against copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   These fights center on new technologies such as online
file-sharing networks, digital television broadcasts and personal
video recorders that enable people to make -- and in some cases,
distribute -- high-quality digital copies of music, movies and other
creative works.</TE>
<TE>   Film studios, record companies and publishers say digital piracy
poses an unprecedented threat to their businesses. Electronics
manufacturers, technology companies and civil libertarians argue that
the protections demanded by copyright owners would roll back consumer
rights and stifle innovation.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, these groups say, Congress already has given the
copyright owners too much control. They argue that the technical
provisions of the law squash the historical so-called fair-use rights
people have to make personal copies of the media they buy.</TE>
<TE>   "If you circumvent [electronic locks] to get access to content
that you may have a perfect, fair-use right to get, you are still
subject to criminal penalties," said Gary S. Klein, vice president
for government and legal affairs at the Consumer Electronics Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Moore says he knew nothing about these issues when he started
selling DVD Copy Plus last year. At that time, he didn't even think
he was building a business.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing's a fluke," said Moore, who has spent the last
two decades advising companies on database management and other
software issues. Hoping to interest his son in his line of work,
Moore said, he set up his laptop on his kitchen table and built a Web
site that could sell products electronically.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't have a product, so his son suggested that he write an
instruction manual for copying DVDs -- something Moore had been doing
as a hobby. He slapped together the manual with software freely
available on the Internet, then started selling the package from the
new Web site for just under $20.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has sold 100,000 copies of DVD Copy Plus, offering
increasingly polished and expensive versions over time. He also has
moved the business from his home in House Springs, Mo., to offices in
Chesterfield and hired about two dozen employees.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA spokeswoman Marta Grutka said there's a clear line between a
legal and an illegal product. If it circumvents the scrambling
technology on a DVD, "then the developer of the software or device is
exposing themselves to criminal prosecution" under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act.</TE>
<TE>   To Moore and his attorneys, that's the wrong question. They argue
that consumers use DVD Copy Plus to make backup copies of the movies
they buy, protecting their investment in the delicate plastic discs.
This kind of personal copying is exactly the kind of fair use that
other provisions of federal copyright law allows, they say.</TE>
<TE>   The program is slow -- it takes six to 20 hours to copy a DVD --
and it doesn't make exact duplicates. Instead, it squeezes videos
into a lower-quality format that can fit on a CD, enabling buyers to
use a CD recorder instead of a more expensive DVD burner.</TE>
<TE>   Those limitations crimp the value of DVD Copy Plus to potential
pirates. But early next month, 321 Studios is releasing a new product
for consumers with DVD recorders, dubbed DVDXCopy, that is designed
to make perfect copies of DVDs in 60 to 90 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to allay Hollywood's concerns, the new version injects
electronic barriers into the copies it makes to prevent them from
being duplicated further. It also inserts digital watermarks and
identifying information that Moore said can trace the source of any
file that's transmitted over the Internet, a feature that the studios
are trying to include in the next generation of DVD recorders,
players and discs.</TE>
<TE>   Moore said these protections could conceivably be circumvented
too, but they should deter piracy. "It's our way to try to bridge the
gap between pirates and fair use," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to enabling people to make backup copies, Moore said,
the new program can restore scratched and unplayable DVDs by taking
advantage of the ability of computer DVD drives to correct for
errors.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of 321 Studios' products, however, can tell the difference
between a DVD that's owned and one that's rented, borrowed from a
friend or checked out of the library. As a result, people can just as
easily copy DVDs they don't own as ones they do.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Ken Jacobson, a senior anti-piracy official with the
MPAA, told a reporter that DVD copying programs violated federal law,
and that the MPAA had asked the FBI to investigate. Those comments
prompted 321 Studios to file suit in U.S. District Court in San
Francisco, asking the court to protect the company.</TE>
<TE>   The nine studios named in the company's complaint -- including
Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Time Warner Entertainment Co.,
Universal City Studios Inc., Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and
Disney Enterprises Inc. -- argued in court papers that the suit was
premature because they haven't threatened to sue 321 Studios.</TE>
<TE>   They also argue that the company is trying to avoid being sued in
New York, where an appeals panel has upheld the constitutionality of
the anti-circumvention provisions of the 1998 Copyright Act.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for 321 Studios, a federal judge in the Bay Area
ruled shortly after Moore filed his lawsuit that anti-circumvention
provisions are constitutional. However, the ruling, out of U.S.
District Court in San Jose, isn't binding.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as you are engaged in production of tech that's primarily
designed for circumvention, you're in the cross hairs," said Harvard
University law professor William W. "Terry" Fisher III. The
constitutional challenge to the 1998 law "is unlikely to go anywhere
until it's presented in a more traditional free-speech context," such
as circumvention for academic research, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act may preserve the public's
right to copy DVDs, said Pamela Samuelson, a copyright law expert at
UC Berkeley. But there's no such protection, she said, for the
companies that make circumvention products.</TE>
<TE>   Daralyn J. Durie, an attorney for 321 Studios, countered that her
client's products aren't primarily designed to circumvent electronic
locks. They're designed to copy DVDs, some of which have no locks.</TE>
<TE>   And as much as Moore's company has benefited from the booming
popularity of DVDs, it's also feeling the pain of digital piracy:
Copies of DVD Copy Plus are freely available on Internet file-sharing
networks, and pirates frequently trade serial numbers to unlock
unauthorized copies.</TE>

<HD>Halloween Costumes Less Scary This Year</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve James</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the ghouls, ghosts and things that go bump in the night.</LD>
<LD>   This Halloween, after more than a year of Al Qaeda attacks, talk
of war with Iraq and, most recently, the Washington-area sniper,
scary and violent are out. Whimsy and fantasy are in for American
trick-or-treaters.</LD>
<LD>   Even last year's popular police and firefighter costumes are
likely to be more scarce Thursday as cartoon and fantasy characters,
musketeers and fairies seek candy on the front stoops of the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Martha Stewart may even make, ahem, a stylishly late appearance.</TE>
<TE>   An enterprising California man has a successful line of Martha
Stewart items. Gary Mittin, who works in real estate in the San
Fernando Valley, has Web sites cashing in on Stewart's notoriety. He
said he was doing brisk business in his $9.99 line of T-shirts.
There's an orange "Department of Corrections" with Martha on the
chest, a "Surrender Martha" and a "Martha Stewart Living in Jail"
written behind prison bars, a nod to Stewart's namesake magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not sold a lot of gory," said Valerie Murray, co-owner of
United Masks &amp; Party Manufacturers in Sebring, Fla. She said the
hottest item is angel or fairy wings. "It's probably our No. 1 item.
I've been shipping them all over the world."</TE>
<TE>   Although Halloween has become the second-biggest shopping holiday
behind Christmas, manufacturers and retailers are not expecting a
bonanza this year.</TE>
<TE>   A survey by the National Retail Federation forecast that U.S.
sales of candy, costumes and decorations for Halloween will be flat
compared with 2001 at about $6.9 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Many retailers, such as Gap Inc.'s Old Navy, promote special lines
of Halloween products seasonally.</TE>
<TE>   "Our top sellers are frogs and firemen for baby, and the all-time
favorite, the pumpkin," spokesman Jonathan Finn said.</TE>
<TE>   George Garcia, manager of Chicago's huge Fantasy Costumes, said
cheerleaders are big, this year, including themed zombie cheerleaders
and patriot cheerleaders.</TE>

<HD>Bad News May End Market Rally</HD>
<DH>Disappointing jobless and consumer confidence reports,
doubts on earnings forecasts could rattle investors, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The October stock market rally may stall this week, analysts say,
because of a still-sluggish economic recovery and growing pessimism
about the accuracy of fourth-quarter earnings forecasts.</LD>
<LD>   Economic reports due this week are expected to show higher
unemployment and faltering consumer confidence, experts said.</LD>
<LD>   The economic numbers "will be disappointing," said Joseph
Battipaglia, chief investment officer for Ryan, Beck &amp; Co. "The
short-term trader will take profits and someone looking to commit
cash will hesitate on the news. I see the market shading a little
lower."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some analysts believe that fourth-quarter earnings
projections may prove too optimistic and cast a pall on the market.</TE>
<TE>   Earnings estimates for the fourth quarter already have begun to
slide, according to Thomson First Call, a firm that compiles
statistics about equity research. Equity analysts now expect
fourth-quarter profit growth for the S&amp;P 500 to rise 17.3%,
contrasted with the 20% hike they had been predicting this month and
the 22.9% increase that analysts had forecast in early September.</TE>
<TE>   And if companies are forced to account for the losses they have
suffered in employee pension plans and the current cost of providing
stock options, the prognosis for 2003 may be even worse.</TE>
<TE>   "The real problem comes next year," said Richard Dahlberg, fund
manager at Grant ham Mayo Van Otterloo, a $20-billion fund company
based in Boston. "It looks like you're going to gouge earnings pretty
good through the pension fund adjustments."</TE>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., a New York-based rating firm, said last
week that its calculation of core earnings -- the profits companies
would have reported from operations if they were forced to account
for pension and stock option costs -- were 30% lower than reported
earnings for the year ended June 30.</TE>
<TE>   S&amp;P's calculation of core earnings is for the 500 companies that
make up S&amp;P's big-company stock index.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that offer defined-benefit pension plans tend to suffer
when stock prices fall because they are forced to put more money in
their pension programs to fund future benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a growing segment of investment professionals want
companies to start showing the cost of providing employee stock
options to workers on their balance sheets -- a cost that's currently
hidden. A new accounting oversight board was appointed by the
Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which could bring both
issues to the forefront.</TE>
<TE>   Although the nation's gross domestic product is expected to show a
3.6% annualized rise for the three months ended in September,
according to a Bloomberg News survey, economists are predicting that
the relatively strong growth rate would fall to 2.2% in the final
three months of 2002. That could prompt more layoffs before year-end.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short term, there's more negative news than positive,"
said Liz Miller, a fund manager for Trevor Stewart Burton &amp; Jacobsen
Inc., which manages $750 million in investor funds. "Even if there's
a strong GDP number, any enthusiasm will be burst by a weak consumer
sentiment number."</TE>
<TE>   A stagnant job market, a depressed stock market since the
beginning of the year and the threat of war in Iraq are weighing on
consumer confidence. The Conference Board's measure of consumer
sentiment is expected to fall to 90 for October, the lowest since
November 2001, and down from 93.3 in September, economists said. The
New York-based research group's report is due Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Stagnation in the job market may be causing consumers to retrench.
The nation's unemployment rate is expected to have edged higher
during October, to 5.8% from 5.6% in September.</TE>
<TE>   Yet while economic data and worries about future earnings may
command much attention in the next several months, much of this
week's market activity may ride on the shoulders of a handful of big
companies that are scheduled to report quarterly results.</TE>
<TE>   Companies set to report earnings this week include Procter &amp;
Gamble Co., Electronic Data Systems Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ChevronTexaco Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Better-than-expected results at Microsoft Corp. and Bank of
America Corp. helped trigger the gains of the last three weeks, which
lifted the S&amp;P 500 index 16% from a five-year low reached on Oct. 9.
But some analysts say optimism is now built into market prices. If
the next spate of earnings releases prove to be lackluster, the
market could start to limp.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, the election of Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva as Brazil's
next president will dominate Latin American trading. Brazilian shares
could carry on a recent rally this week after the left-wing Workers'
Party candidate eased some investors' fears of economic
mismanagement.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's main Bovespa stock index has rallied almost 20% in seven
sessions from a 3 1/2-year low close on Oct. 16 as investors began to
think they may have oversold the risks of the first-elected left-wing
government.</TE>
<TE>   Lula's Workers' Party pledged to cut taxes on capital markets,
reform pensions and respect spending and debt contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to say, but the market has shown that it has priced the
folly in too much," said Concordia trader Tomas Taterka. "It is too
early to say it will not go up any more."</TE>

<HD>Japan, Mexico to Discuss Free Trade Agreement</HD>
<DH>Talks will begin next month, and the two nations hope to
complete a deal in a year. Agriculture is among the sensitive issues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LOS CABOS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Mexico and Japan said Sunday that they will begin negotiating a
wide-ranging free trade agreement in November to help end nearly a
decade of static trade growth between the two nations.</LD>
<LD>   In a joint statement on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation leaders' summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, Japanese Prime
Minister Junichiro Koizumi and Mexican President Vicente Fox said
they hoped to complete talks in a year.</LD>
<LD>   "In order that Japan and Mexico will benefit, without delay, from
the strengthening of the bilateral economic partnership, the two
leaders shared the view that the two governments should start
official negotiations for the agreement in November 2002 in Tokyo,"
they said.</LD>
<TE>   Since Mexico entered the North American Free Trade Agreement with
the United States and Canada in 1994, Japan's share of Mexican
imports has fallen to 4.8% of the total, from 6%. Mexican sales to
Japan fell to 0.3% from 1.6% of Japanese imports.</TE>
<TE>   A free trade agreement with Japan would give Mexico access to the
world's second-largest economy and provide Japan with another gateway
to the coveted U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   "Japan can buy a great quantity of agriculture and livestock
products from us. We are complementary in this sense; they send us
industrial products, opening markets for these products, and we will
be able to send them a great quantity of agricultural products,"
Mexican Economy Minister Luis Ernesto Derbez told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Far from a match made in heaven, a successful Mexico-Japan free
trade agreement would have to overcome opposition from powerful
political lobbies over rules for movement of farm goods.</TE>
<TE>   A face-off between Japan's powerful farming lobby, which
traditionally opposes any competition, and struggling Mexican
farmers, desperately in search of new markets, could turn nasty.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican farmers, many in crisis as prices for their goods fall
below the costs of production, accuse the government of having
ignored their needs when Mexico joined NAFTA in 1994, with Canada and
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition legislators recently called on Fox to renegotiate the
treaty's agriculture chapter.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese officials at the APEC leaders' summit said there is no
intention of excluding agriculture from the free trade talks with
Mexico, although one government spokesman did say it "could be one
field" of difficulty in negotiating a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Tadakatsu Sano, a senior international affairs official for
Japan's economy and trade ministry, said that 20% of the goods Mexico
already exports to Japan are agricultural and that it would be
impossible to exclude the issue from talks.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's lead government trade negotiator, Angel Villalobos, said
negotiators agree that no sector will be excluded.</TE>

<HD>Edison Field's Halo Effect</HD>
<DH>Sponsor of the Angels' home ballpark is getting plenty of
free publicity, which irks its critics</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Frammolino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edison International executives have been all aglow from the loads of
publicity the company has garnered each time Edison Field, home of
the world champion Anaheim Angels, has been mentioned during World
Series broadcasts.</LD>
<LD>   Yet that's just what has utility watchdog Doug Heller so steamed.</LD>
<LD>   "It's particularly sour to see Edison's name in lights because
consumers in Southern California are shelling out billions of dollars
to bail it out," said Heller, senior consumer advocate at the Santa
Monica-based Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "It's
unsavory to see their name associated with the baseball glory of the
Angels."</LD>
<TE>   Within the last several years, a veritable stampede of
corporations has paid tens of millions of dollars to have their names
put on ballparks, stadiums and professional hockey arenas. The goal
is to raise their corporate profile with a flood of consumer
"impressions" every time their names are mentioned in print or are
captured on television.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, it works, according to sports marketing expert
Dean Bonham.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is that naming rights, by most measures,
is the most effective investment in sponsorship today," said Bonham,
whose Denver-based firm has analyzed or negotiated more than 25 such
deals. His firm's estimate of the naming-rights value for two rounds
of baseball playoffs and a seven-game World Series: an extra $1
million to $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Edison officials declined to say how much they paid for the 1997
agreement that changed Anaheim Stadium (long known as the Big A) to
Edison International (now called the Big Ed or just the Ed) for 20
years. But estimates have ranged from $30 million to $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say the deal has been a valuable way to earn
goodwill, lead consumers to Edison's Web site and promote energy
conservation among the 12 million residential and business customers
of Southern California Edison, its regulated subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   They also say the strategy has enhanced "receptivity" for the
company's unregulated ventures, such as selling home-security
systems. And the World Series in particular, they add, has extended
Edison's reach all the more, including to potential investors and
Wall Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're associated with a very positive experience," said Charles
Basham, a senior project manager at Edison. "It lends itself to what
you look for in naming rights -- the halo effect."</TE>
<TE>   But corporations have also faced shareholder criticism that naming
rights -- which typically cost about $2.5 million a year for baseball
and hockey and $3 million to $4 million for football -- are a
frivolous use of money. What's more, they can become a source of
embarrassment, such as when fallen energy giant Enron Corp. was
forced to strip its now-ignominious name from a Houston sports
stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The Edison name is hardly in the same league as Enron's when it
comes to disrepute. But critics maintain that Edison deserves a share
of the blame for the ill-conceived deregulation setup that led to
California's 2000-01 energy crisis. They say Edison and other
utilities helped to shape deregulation in a way that benefited them
early on, and then when things went awry, they leaned on state
regulators to bail them out.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, Edison officials say they never really favored
deregulation in the first place. In addition, they assert that the
company itself has been a victim of high power prices, thanks in part
to manipulation of the wholesale market by others.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, a San Francisco consumer-advocacy group called the
Utility Reform Network, or TURN, has sued Edison to recover an
estimated $3.5 billion in higher rates charged to customers.</TE>
<TE>   By getting the company's name on the Angels' stadium, Edison is
putting itself "right up there with Walt Disney, Gene Autry and all
of these family-friendly images while they're ripping off the
families of Southern California for $3.5 billion," said Mike Florio,
a senior attorney at TURN. "It's a little false advertising there."</TE>
<TE>   Heller, the other consumer advocate, found himself a bit
conflicted during much of the World Series. He said he rooted for the
Angels but felt a twinge of frustration each time the name Edison
Field was uttered.</TE>
<TE>   Though company officials say that Edison International
shareholders paid for the naming rights, Heller insists otherwise. He
is convinced that the money ultimately came from Southern California
Edison ratepayers.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, as the Angels and San Francisco Giants were battling it
out for baseball supremacy, the state's Public Utilities Commission
approved another surcharge, Heller noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Edison should be a local pariah," he said. "But through the
Angels they get their name in lights every night."</TE>
<TE>   The situation hasn't been quite as contentious for SBC Pacific
Bell, which paid $51 million to have the Giants' new stadium in San
Francisco called Pacific Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesman John Britton noted how, after the Giants beat the Angels
16-4 in Game 5, TV broadcasts kept returning to the stadium as
announcers crowed: "It's one giant party at Pac Bell!"</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a grand slam home run for the company," said Britton,
also noting the prominence of the name of Pac Bell in newspaper
headlines. "You never know; we might have gone the 24 years of
sponsorship without getting to the World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials say they have no immediate plans to change the
ballpark's name by adding SBC, for SBC Communications Inc., the San
Antonio-based company that acquired Pacific Bell after the
naming-rights deal was struck in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just fine with Regina Costa, a lifelong Giant fan and
telecommunications research director for TURN.</TE>
<TE>   Costa said consumer advocates respected the old Pac Bell but have
issues with SBC, which they accuse of abusive marketing practices,
declining service and the recent announcement of 3,000 California job
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were SBC, it would be bothering me a lot," she said about
the stadium name. "That company doesn't deserve good press."</TE>

<TE>Pacific Bell and Edison each paid as much as $50 million for naming
rights to their stadiums, but that is far less than others have

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Truck maker Navistar International Corp. said Sunday it had reached a
definitive five-year labor contract with union workers at its U.S.
plants.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement covers about 7,100 United Auto Workers members. A
company spokesman said about 54% of the union's members voted to
ratify the contract, after it was hammered out in last-minute
bargaining last week.</LD>
<LD>   The Navistar spokesman declined to offer comment on the terms. UAW
officials said that it included some concessions, including an
agreement to perform obligatory overtime work and some lower
health-care benefits.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Navistar rose 84 cents Friday to close at $21 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Warrenville, Ill.-based Navistar, which makes heavy- and
medium-duty trucks, school buses and diesel engines under the
International brand name, widened its fourth-quarter loss forecast to
a range of 72 cents to 77 cents per share.</TE>
<TE>   Navistar, under pressure to cut fixed costs and return to
profitability, will begin making heavy trucks for the U.S. market in
Escobedo, Mexico, next year.</TE>

<HD>Palm to Introduce 2 Hand-Helds Today</HD>
<DH>One features built-in Bluetooth technology; the other
offers support for corporate networks and real-time chats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ron Harris</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Palm Inc. is expected to introduce two new hand-held computer models
today, each aimed at getting into the hands of tech-savvy mobile
professionals and early technology adopters.</LD>
<LD>   Palm's new Tungsten T, with a suggested retail price of $499, is
the company's first hand-held with built-in Bluetooth technology.
That allows it to communicate wirelessly with a host of
Bluetooth-enabled devices such as printers and cell phones and other
equivalent Palm devices.</LD>
<LD>   Phone numbers called up on the Tungsten T's address book can be
clicked, causing a nearby Bluetooth-enabled phone to start dialing
the number.</LD>
<TE>   It's also Palm's first unit powered by the ARM 144-megahertz
processor, a processor similar to more powerful ones already a
standard in competing Pocket PC devices.</TE>
<TE>   The Tungsten T also comes with voice recording capabilities, a
five-way navigation button and a sleek collapsible design revealing
Palm's Graffiti character recognition screen, tucked away until
needed.</TE>
<TE>   Milpitas, Calif.-based Palm said it hopes the unit will be seen as
an upgrade for potential customers currently using the Compaq iPaq,
which runs on Microsoft Corp. software.</TE>
<TE>   The Tungsten W, the other new model to be introduced today for
shipment first to Europe, features a small keyboard at the bottom
styled after the popular RIM Blackberry wireless messaging devices.</TE>
<TE>   The Tungsten W, with a suggested retail price of $549, runs Palm's
4.1 operating system and features a less powerful processor, Motorola
Inc.'s DragonBall 33 MHz, than the Tungsten T.</TE>
<TE>   The unit focuses on wireless connectivity and features tri-band
GSM/GPRS radio technology and support for corporate virtual private
networks and real-time chat messaging.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Palm shares rose 57 cents to close at $11.78 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>British Firms Plan Merger to Lead in Screen Technology</HD>
<DH>Cambridge Display Technology's purchase of Opsys unit would
give it control of a method to create organic light-emitting diodes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>AMSTERDAM</DL>
<LD>Two British companies announced plans early today to merge to become
a world leader in the technology of so-called glowing plastics.</LD>
<LD>   Cambridge Display Technology announced the acquisition of the
research activities of rival Opsys, giving it control of another
major method to create organic light-emitting diodes (OLED).</LD>
<LD>   Financial details were not disclosed.</LD>
<TE>   The two closely held companies sell their know-how to major
electronics manufacturers, such as Seiko Epson Corp., Philips, DuPont
Co. and Siemens, some of which have just opened factories for the
first generation of monochrome OLED displays used in cell phones. As
the technology matures it will be used for full-color screens.</TE>
<TE>   Cambridge Display is taking on U.S. photo giant Eastman Kodak Co.,
which is one of the pioneers of OLEDs. The Cambridge University
spinoff claims to have found a more efficient production method,
which effectively prints a special type of OLED on a surface.</TE>
<TE>   The market for OLEDs is expected to rise from just $85 million
this year to $3 billion by 2007, according to a recent survey by U.S.
market research group DisplaySearch.</TE>
<TE>   Hopes for the technology are high because polymers that emit light
do not require a backlight used for the current generation of
flat-screen liquid crystal displays (LCDs). It makes them energy
efficient and much thinner -- so thin they can be folded.</TE>
<TE>   Opsys, spun out of Oxford and St. Andrews universities in 1997,
uses polymers called dendrimers, which are brighter and more energy
efficient than Cambridge Display's light-emitting polymers. The two
companies hope to blend their technologies to improve the life span
of the dendrimers.</TE>
<TE>   Cambridge Display Chief Executive David Fyfe said he expected that
by 2005 the technology would be mature enough, and the price per
display competitive enough, that OLEDs would start replacing LCD
full-color flat screens, which recently started replacing 70-year-old
cathode ray tube technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The attraction is that [OLEDs] are much more energy efficient. It
doesn't generate as much heat, and the light goes only in one
direction," he said.</TE>

<HD>Port Tensions Worry Retailers, Growers</HD>
<DH>Christmas merchandise lies dormant on cargo ships and
citrus shipments to Asia may be disrupted as labor impasse continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Continuing labor tensions at West Coast ports have retailers and
citrus growers nervous about the prospects for the holiday season and
beyond.</LD>
<LD>   As union and shipping officials pointed fingers at one another
over the nagging backlog of container ships that need to be unloaded,
retailers moaned that Christmas presents were lying dormant in crates
as the holiday season was set to start.</LD>
<LD>   "There are an awful lot of Christmas presents sitting out on those
docks," said J. Craig Shearman, spokesman for the National Retail
Federation. "For us, it doesn't matter what the reason. The fact
remains the goods aren't coming into the stores as quickly as we need
them."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, citrus growers are worried that their navel orange
shipments to Asia for Chinese New Year could be disrupted because the
exporting season starts at the end of December -- about the same time
as the court-ordered cooling-off period ends.</TE>
<TE>   "If a strike happens then, it would be very disruptive," said Russ
Hanlin, vice president of International Sales at Sunkist Growers, a
marketing cooperative.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping companies
and terminal operators, and the International Longshore and Warehouse
Union are in the midst of a contract impasse that has been going on
since April. The negotiations broke off in September, with a 10-day
lockout that ended Oct. 9, when a judge ordered the ports to reopen
for 80 days.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, however, shipping lines have accused longshore workers
of deliberately slowing work, while labor has said management isn't
doing enough to secure dockworker's safety.</TE>
<TE>   "The union is moving much more slowly than we had hoped," said
Steve Sugerman, spokesman for the Pacific Maritime Assn. "There is no
question that companies all over America are waiting for their goods,
and it's still unclear how some companies are going to fare for
Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Steve Stallone acknowledged that unloading
containers from ships is progressing slowly, but he cited management
as the cause.</TE>
<TE>   "Employers are not doing a thing to solve the logistic problems
out there," Stallone said. "They would just as soon have work move
slowly so that they can blame the union."</TE>
<TE>   If dockworkers and their employers don't reach agreement on a new
contract before the cooling-off period ends, another lockout or a
strike could occur.</TE>

<LD>Amex, Chevron Among Earnings Reports Due</LD>
<LD>   Although economic data will command much of the attention this
week, earnings from a few market heavyweights will exert some pull.</LD>
<LD>   Financial services company American Express Co. and Kellogg Co.,
the No. 1 U.S. cereal maker, are expected to post quarterly results
today, while the earnings of consumer products maker Procter &amp; Gamble
Co. are due Tuesday. Wednesday will bring results from computer
services company Electronic Data Systems Corp. Report cards from oil
and gas companies ChevronTexaco Corp. and Exxon Mobil Corp. are
expected Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Stocks have rallied in recent weeks as surprisingly strong
corporate earnings have boosted sentiment. So far, 358 companies in
the S&amp;P 500 have reported quarterly results. Of those, 59% have
beaten Wall Street's lowered expectations by an average of 3.1%,
according to market research firm Thomson First Call. About 14% have
missed analysts' forecasts, First Call said.</TE>
<TE>   But investors say the better-than-expected results are largely
built into stock prices and they need to see companies forecasting
stronger growth.</TE>

<TE>   Vivendi Universal is seeking more time to consider thwarting
Vodafone Group's bid of $12.8 billion to buy France's second-largest
phone company, Cegetel.</TE>
<TE>   The world's No. 2 media company is suing Vodafone in Paris'
commercial court to extend the deadline for a potential counteroffer.
A hearing at the Tribunal de Commerce de Paris is scheduled for today</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi owns 44% of the French phone business and needs time to
raise funds to prepare a counter bid, analysts said. It must choose
between raising debt to strengthen the hold on its most profitable
unit or cutting debt by severing ties with a business accounting for
a third of its operating profit.</TE>
<TE>   Jean-Rene Fourtou, Vivendi's chief executive, is struggling to
reduce the company's $18 billion of debt. Last week, he agreed to
sell Vivendi's French, Spanish and Latin American publishing assets
to Lagardere for $1 billion. Vivendi is still seeking higher bids for
its U.S. unit, Houghton Mifflin.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi is weighing whether to vie for control of Cegetel or cut
debt by accepting Vodafone's $6-billion offer for its stake in
Cegetel. To keep control of Cegetel and its mobile-phone unit SFR,
Vivendi must at least match Vodafone's $4-billion bid to BT Group for
its 26% share.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi has until Nov. 10 to bid. It wants the commercial court to
extend that deadline and will argue that Vodafone didn't allow for a
30-day period to conduct due diligence.</TE>

<TE>   Koizumi to Unveil Plan on Japan's Bad Loans</TE>
<TE>   Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi's government will unveil
a package this week focusing on the nation's nonperforming loan
problem, but there are signs that harsh action on the banking sector
will be watered down amid fierce political opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Few investors doubt that the package will mark a step forward in
Japan's slow reform efforts.</TE>
<TE>   But questions still hang over the degree to which chief bank
regulator Heizo Takenaka will be forced to dilute his radical ideas
on attacking bad loans estimated to amount to at least $418.3 billion
in the face of stiff opposition from ruling politicians and banks.</TE>
<TE>   Many politicians fear a backlash from voters and their traditional
industry supporters if the government goes for a "hard landing"
approach that could trigger bankruptcies, job losses and a stock
market sell-off.</TE>
<TE>   Banks, too, are staunchly opposed to Takenaka's apparent plans to
impose strict new capital requirements on them that could open the
way for a government fund injections and sweeping management changes.</TE>
<TE>   Takenaka met the heads of major banks today for the third time in
a week, hoping to patch up differences which on Friday saw the bank
chiefs accuse the minister of steering the fragile economy toward a
credit crunch.</TE>
<TE>   An official at one of the four banks said Takenaka again failed to
outline specifics of his program.</TE>

<TE>   EC to Propose Rules on Music, Film Piracy</TE>
<TE>   The European Commission will propose new legislation next month
aimed at strengthening the fight against music and film piracy, a
business worth $4.3 billion a year globally for pirated discs alone,
EU sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules would create tougher minimum standards for each of
the 15 EU member states, filling existing gaps and loopholes allowed
by the current legal fragmentation. But it would not go as far as
imposing mandatory criminal sanctions for pirates.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal has been eagerly awaited by the industry, which says
it faces an increasing flow of illegal copies of CDs, video tapes and
DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is very pleased that the European Commission is
going to address the serious problem of piracy. We look forward to
strong measures," said Thomas Dillon, legal counsel at the Motion
Picture Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Rampant piracy has partly accounted for the slowdown in global
music sales.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals are expected to include standardized procedures for
searching, seizure and proof by national authorities and criteria for
calculating damages.</TE>
<TE>   The draft bill also would create tighter cooperation between
national authorities to reduce administrative requirements and speed
up action, industry sources said.</TE>
<TE>   For the film industry, the Motion Picture Assn. estimates that in
the United States alone, $3 billion a year in potential revenues are
lost because of piracy.</TE>

<HD>TV Movie About NYC's Giuliani to Be Shot in ... Montreal</HD>
<DH>USA Network's 'Rudy!' will be filmed primarily in Canada,
where production is cheaper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Big Apple becomes La Grande Pomme next month when a TV movie
about former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his handling of the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks starts shooting -- in Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   Although some outdoor scenes will be filmed in New York, the
decision to shoot the USA Network movie "Rudy!" primarily in Canada
marks another symbolic setback in stemming the migration of films and
TV programs to cheaper foreign locales, even when story lines are
distinctly American.</LD>
<LD>   "As with all productions set in New York, we make every effort to
encourage them to shoot on location in the city," New York City Film
Commissioner Katherine Oliver said. "There is no viable substitute,
and our crews are second to none."</LD>
<TE>   Last year, the TV series "Pasadena," set in Hollywood's backyard,
was instead shot in Vancouver, Canada. The film version of the
best-selling Civil War novel "Cold Mountain" is shooting in Romania.
Hollywood unions say these and other productions crystallize the
ongoing threat of runaway production to foreign countries, even with
filming here now running at a healthy pace.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, this is a perfect example of what the unions have
been trying to explain to legislators across the country," said Pamm
Fair, a national director for the Screen Actors Guild. "A story about
an American icon is being filmed outside of the borders. American
viewers may never know the difference, but American workers will."</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour film is based on the unflattering "Rudy! An
Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani" by Village Voice writer
Wayne Barrett that was published in 2000. The movie, to be shown on
USA's cable network, will intersperse scenes showing Giuliani's
political rise with others showing him leading the city after the
terrorist attacks, which won him international praise and earned him
Time magazine's prestigious Person of the Year honor. James Woods
will star as Giuliani, with Penelope Ann Miller cast as Donna
Hanover, his ex-wife.</TE>
<TE>   Neither USA Network nor "Rudy!" producer Carlton America would
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Canada has increasingly lured American productions with the help
of the U.S. dollar's strong purchasing power and the Canadian
government's financial incentives. French-speaking Montreal played
host to such major films as Tom Clancy's "The Sum of All Fears" and
the upcoming movies "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," "Timeline" and
"Human Stain."</TE>
<TE>   In a report issued last month, the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. warned that although the Southern California film
industry has bounced back after threatened strikes by actors and
writers in 2001, "there is still the serious issue of runaway
production." What's more, it added, "Canada is not the only culprit.
The Czech Republic is a hot spot, while China and Mexico are both
making a push to obtain more production." Australia and New Zealand
also are making major inroads in enticing U.S. projects.</TE>
<TE>   Studies have estimated that more than $3 billion in direct film
and TV production leaves the U.S. annually, primarily to Canada, with
the overall effect estimated at $10 billion when that loss ripples
through the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, Giuliani as mayor frequently championed shooting films
and TV shows in New York in lieu of places such as Canada. His
efforts included making it easier to get film permits, working with
unions to trim costs and lobbying to end a state tax on purchases
made by production companies.</TE>

<HD>United Union Proposes Giveback</HD>
<DH>Flight attendants offer to take a 3.6% pay cut in
negotiations with the airline, which is trying to stave off
bankruptcy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>United Airlines' flight attendants union, one of five unions
negotiating with the airline to cut labor costs by billions of
dollars and stave off bankruptcy, has offered to take a 3.6% cut in
pay, a union spokeswoman said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Sara Dela Cruz of the Assn. of Flight Attendants said the proposal
made to the financially strapped airline includes an agreement to
forgo a lump-sum payment in 2003 and a raise in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Dela Cruz said the 25,000-member union is the first of the five
unions in negotiations with the company to inform its members of a
proposal. This year, the flight attendants refused to participate in
financial recovery talks initiated by management.</LD>
<TE>   The nation's No. 2 carrier is seeking $5.8 billion in cutbacks
over 5 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Dela Cruz would not say how much money will be saved with the 3.6%
pay cut. She said the proposal is just one step in the negotiating
process. If United accepts it, she said, then the tentative agreement
would be put to the union members for a vote.</TE>
<TE>   This month, UAL Corp.'s United reported an $889-million
third-quarter loss. It has been losing money from its operations at a
rate of $7 million a day.</TE>
<TE>   Dela Cruz said news last week that United paid its new chief
executive a $3-million bonus to sign a five-year contract was "a
tough pill to swallow to anyone staring down the barrel of
concessions."</TE>
<TE>   But she said the fact that CEO Glenn Tilton made the bonus public
is "evidence that this CEO is being forthright with his employees and
not trying to hide anything."</TE>

<HD>Las Vegas Bets Heavily on Better Economic Times</HD>
<DH>Casino companies are expanding resorts as statistics show
the city has nearly recovered from travel slowdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bonnie Harris</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Downturn, schmownturn. Vegas is back, baby.</LD>
<LD>   The nagging travel slump that has most of the nation's tourism
industry facing a recovery crapshoot has positioned Las Vegas as a
high-stakes winner -- with packed hotels, rebounding room rates and
profits for the city's leading casino giants.</LD>
<LD>   Vegas has emerged as a strong bet in an uncertain economic climate
largely because more leisure travelers and convention goers are
driving to Sin City rather than flying to places such as San
Francisco and New York since the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Gaming and tourism statistics show that Vegas has almost fully
recovered from the travel slowdown that paralyzed the country
immediately after the terrorist attacks, and analysts note that the
industry's high-rolling companies are spending with bullish
confidence, seemingly oblivious to the worst bear market in decades.</TE>
<TE>   "Everywhere you look in Vegas says there's huge bets being placed
on the future," said Keith Schwer, director of the Center for
Economics and Business Research at the University of Nevada. "There's
growth, crowds, construction ... and the latest earnings suggest not
everyone is giving away rooms at significant price reductions
anymore. There are considerable profits being made."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, much of the gains reported by casino companies last week
were attributed to higher hotel revenue; the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority said weekend rates have returned to pre-Sept. 11
levels and the city is running at a consistent 93% hotel occupancy
rate. Overall, average daily room rates were about $76 through August
-- down about 5% from a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Park Place Entertainment Corp., the largest casino
company and operator of Caesars Palace, Paris Las Vegas and other
Vegas marquee names, said net income for the third quarter was $40
million, or 13 cents a share, compared with a loss of $101 million,
or 34 cents, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   MGM Mirage, the No. 2 casino company, reported a $69.6-million
third-quarter profit after a $14.4-million loss a year earlier. And
Harrah's Entertainment Inc., the No. 3 company, said its profit rose
63%. All three companies also raked in more revenue during the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "Gaming revenues like this indicate rising consumer confidence and
an improvement in discretionary spending," said David Givens, an
associate economist with Economy.com. "It's believed to be an early
indicator of economic growth."</TE>
<TE>   Givens pointed to the construction boom underway in Las Vegas,
including a new tower at MGM Mirage's Bellagio hotel that will add
925 rooms to the resort and increase its capacity by nearly 25%, as
well as a $225-million expansion of the Mandalay Resort Group's
Mandalay Bay hotel and casino that will add 1,125 rooms.</TE>
<TE>   And Steve Wynn, the casino mogul who led the city's transformation
of the last two decades with the creation of theme-oriented resorts
such as the Mirage, Treasure Island and Bellagio, is preparing for a
comeback after selling his Mirage Resorts Corp. to MGM Grand Inc. two
years ago. Last week, he took his company, Wynn Resorts Ltd., public
and raised at least $400 million to finance plans to build a
$2.4-billion, 2,700-room casino and resort called Le Reve on the
Strip. Groundbreaking is scheduled for this month, with opening set
for April 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "When you come here you do not think 'slowdown,' " said Erika
Brandvik, a spokeswoman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
Authority. "When you see everything that's going on here you do not
think 'downturn.' "</TE>
<TE>   Still, shares of the top Vegas casino operators fell after
earnings were reported last week. Analysts speculated that was
because forecasts were either lower than expected or the companies
didn't provide enough guidance for the future.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Ader, a gambling analyst with Bear Stearns Cos., said he
anticipates another two or even three "tough quarters" for the
high-end gaming industry as consumers resume their search for travel
deals in what continues to be an unsettled economy.</TE>
<TE>   "Competition for the tourist dollar is going to remain high," Ader
said. "Vegas is recovering better than most destinations, but they
can't claim they're completely out of the woods yet."</TE>
<TE>   City tourism officials say a full recovery isn't far away, due in
large part to an increase in convention business that has already
exceeded 2000 levels for the year. Nearly 4 million convention goers
had traveled to Las Vegas through August, bringing in about $4.4
million for the city during their stays. That compares with 3.8
million for all of 2000, when convention spending totaled $4.2
million.</TE>
<TE>   And while the number of visitors arriving by air was down 6.2%
through August, drive-in traffic increased 11% for the same period --
a jump that is attributed mostly to Californians, who account for a
third of the city's annual visitors of 35 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have some work to do, but we are sitting a lot prettier
than most places and we got here a lot faster than we expected to,"
said Brandvik, noting that overall visitor spending was up 2% through
August.</TE>
<TE>   Also helping Las Vegas, according to travel experts, is the wide
offering of special events -- from concerts to sports -- and the fact
that the city is not typically regarded as a family destination.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Reichartz, vice president of sales at Travelscape.com, a
local subsidiary of Expedia Inc., said Las Vegas remains the Web
site's No. 1 destination for online bookings. Even as room rates
continue to creep back up, demand hasn't slowed, he said. Bookings
for the holidays are already up over last year, when visitor numbers
pushed hotel occupancy levels to 97% throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   "Vegas has a lot going for it right now," Reichartz said. "First,
it's a destination that attracts more risk-takers to begin with. It's
also not a total family vacation spot like Orlando, which relies
heavily on people traveling with their children. And finally, it's
still a great deal."</TE>
<TE>   Brandvik notes that Las Vegas has a history of performing better
than the economy as a whole when times are tough.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess it pays to offer people an escape from reality at a time
when they probably need it the most," she said.</TE>

<CX>   Las Vegas tourism -- A story in Monday's Business section about
resurgence in Las Vegas' tourism industry incorrectly stated the
economic effect of conventions in that city. Convention business
generated $4.2 billion in 2000 and $4.4 billion through August of
this year for the city. The story misstated the figures in millions.</CX>

<HD>For SBC's Chairman, a Distance to Go</HD>
<DH>Ed Whitacre discusses the phone firm's frustrations as it
seeks to expand in California.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass and James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ed Whitacre is not a happy guy these days.</LD>
<LD>   The chairman of SBC Communications Inc., the parent of SBC Pacific
Bell, is exasperated about the rates that regulators in California
and elsewhere say it can charge rivals such as AT&amp;T Corp. in return
for use of the lines and equipment needed to compete for local
telephone customers. Whitacre says the rates have been set so low,
SBC can't recover its costs.</LD>
<LD>   Nor is Whitacre's company having an easy time getting into
California's $10-billion-plus long-distance market. The California
Public Utilities Commission recently ruled that though the company
has complied with the necessary federal conditions to expand into
long-distance, it has failed for now to meet a separate state
requirement. Regulators say the company still must prove that its
move into long-distance would create "no substantial possibility of
harm" to competition in the state.</LD>
<TE>   All the while, SBC has been taking its share of shots. AT&amp;T, for
one, last week attacked Whitacre's company for its "whining" and
"Chicken Little, sky-is-falling rhetoric." And in the last 18 months,
lax service, abusive marketing and improper billing by the phone
company have triggered regulatory rebukes, refunds and more than $50
million in fines from the PUC.</TE>
<TE>   In the face of all this, Whitacre sat down Friday for an interview
with The Times. Later in the day, he was set to meet with the five
PUC commissioners to discuss many of the same issues.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What's your take on the state of the industry?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: The telecom industry's in a heck of a turmoil and has been
for some time. It's not getting any better, and probably is getting
worse. Part of the reason is the economy. Part of the reason is there
is some substitution and technological change, and part of the reason
is regulatory-related.</TE>
<TE>   Q: In the regulatory arena, you have been critical of the prices
for something called UNE-P, which is the package of local lines and
equipment you lease to competitors for a single wholesale price.
What's wrong with that system?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're having to sell [wholesale access to the company's
competitors] at below our costs, and that's the unfair part. It's
like McDonald's cooking a hamburger and Burger King being able to buy
it for a nickel and putting their name on it. It's exactly the same
thing. No business, no matter how large, can do that for very long.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How many customers do you figure you're losing to competitors
such as AT&amp;T as a result of this situation?</TE>
<TE>   A: We're losing 1 million customers a quarter, and roughly a third
of them are in California. But that number will probably go up,
because our competitors have only started aggressively selling here
in the last couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Currently, you are charging your competitors around $15 per
customer to use your lines and equipment. And you claim that you need
that figure raised to $30 to cover your costs. Isn't the pricing
debate really centered on whether the costs are what you say they
are?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is a huge debate, but all we have to do is look at SBC's
audited financials and the data we turn in to the FCC [Federal
Communications Commission]. That's really a fake argument.</TE>
<TE>   Our revenues are down 6%. They're down mostly because of [the low
wholesale rates], though the economy is a piece of that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Why isn't that revenue loss just a function of losing market
share in a newly competitive market, just like AT&amp;T loses
long-distance market share every year?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm going to have fewer customers with competition, and I don't
mind competition. I'll sell to AT&amp;T, I'll sell to MCI WorldCom, but
don't make me sell it below my cost. What's going on is not
competition; it's confiscation of SBC's network.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When California set new interim wholesale rates this year,
regulators said you defied orders to provide them with cost data. So
how can you now complain that current prices don't reflect your
costs?</TE>
<TE>   A: I won't say we're totally blameless in this, but they have cost
data now.</TE>
<TE>   Q: If you get your way, and California regulators double the
current wholesale package price, wouldn't that just discourage
competition for some 10 million local phone customers here?</TE>
<TE>   A: No, I don't think so at all. I've already got a lot of
competition. You have cable telephony; you have Cox [Communications
Inc.] down in San Diego that's got a ton of customers, you've got
AT&amp;T here with a ton of business customers.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You have slashed investment in your telephone networks, and you
are saying that, too, is because of the bad wholesale pricing. How
so?</TE>
<TE>   A: When [rival companies] get a huge discount, I'm not going to
spend anything because I can't get my cost of capital back. You
destroy all the incentive to invest with this artificial,
regulatory-created competition. It's economically not sound.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are regulators receptive to that kind of an argument, or do
they feel like you're using capital investment as a bargaining chip?</TE>
<TE>   A: They probably feel like I'm using it as a bargaining chip, and
AT&amp;T has said that about us. And others have said we're trying to
apply pressure. But really we're not. When your revenues go down 6%,
any business then would move to reduce its costs.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How will you resolve the PUC's recent split ruling on your
long-distance application, where you have passed federal muster but
not state?</TE>
<TE>   A: The California commission recently voted that we had done
everything required by the law. And now it's at the [FCC], and they
vote yes or no, and if they vote yes, we're in long-distance.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So not passing the state requirement won't stand in the way?</TE>
<TE>   A: Absolutely not. This is a federal law. It's at the FCC for the
last 90 days, and since we've spent years and hundreds of millions to
dollars to comply with the federal law, and since it's good for
California, I hope it goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are you going to do in California should you get approval
to sell long-distance?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm going to bundle it with other services. We would hope to
bundle things like local service, long-distance, wireless and DSL
[digital subscriber line service] with Yahoo. We would hope to sell
that in a bundle for a set amount of money.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The 3,000 people who are going to be laid off in California by
the end of the year, where are they coming from?</TE>
<TE>   A: Most of those people are coming from the side that does new
capital investment. So these are not people that affect day-to-day
service, like installation, maintenance. These are people who do new
construction. We're striving very hard not to have any impact on
service, and we can pull that off.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You own roughly half of Cingular Wireless, a company that is
said to be in talks to merge with either T-Mobile International
(formerly VoiceStream Wireless Corp.) or AT&amp;T Wireless Services Inc.
What's the status?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'd like to consolidate. I'd like to buy. But I'm not going any
further than that with my answer.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles County residents already are taxed by the state of
California for trauma-care services. But the state has continued to
cut trauma-care funding to the county.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of holding the governor and the Legislature responsible
for providing this vital program, proponents of Measure B are
attempting to add a new tax on property.</LD>
<LD>   Measure B is the wrong medicine for Los Angeles County for a
number of reasons.</LD>
<TE>   Although every property owner would be taxed, trauma care would
not be provided in all areas.</TE>
<TE>   As an example, residents of northern Los Angeles County would be
mandated to pay nearly $9 million in additional taxes but would not
have adequate access to trauma services.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B would create a property tax for services not related to
property. This is an assault on homeowners, renters, those on fixed
incomes, small businesses and the spirit of Proposition 13.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents want the public to believe that increasing property
taxes is the only alternative to meeting trauma-care needs.</TE>
<TE>   But the fact is that Los Angeles County provides medical care
above and beyond that of any other county in California.</TE>
<TE>   And though Measure B also purports to add only 3 cents per square
foot on property tax bills, there is no cap on future increases.</TE>
<TE>   The sky is the limit, again harming senior citizens and others on
a fixed income.</TE>
<TE>   Another disturbing fact is that there would be no oversight
committee to ensure that taxes collected were spent for trauma care.</TE>
<TE>   Just as we are being taxed by the state for trauma care and not
getting it, there is no guarantee that money collected from Measure B
wouldn't be misappropriated.</TE>
<TE>   Michael D. Antonovich represents the 5th District on the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, including the northern San
Fernando Valley and the Antelope, Santa Clarita, Pomona, Crescenta

<DH>They don't make monsters the way they used to</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Griswold</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Halloween nearly here, with ghouls and ghosts about to pound on
our doors, this may be the time of year to consider the fortunes of
scariness in children's stories.</LD>
<LD>   It used to be that youngsters would sit around the fire and listen
to hair-raising tales about the evil queen in "Snow White" and the
wolf in "Little Red Riding Hood," about witches and ogres, about La
Llorona and Baba Yaga. Nowadays, I am sorry to say, monsters aren't
what they used to be.</LD>
<LD>   The most frightening children's book ever, most Europeans would
agree, is Heinrich Hoffmann's "Struwwelpeter." First published in
Germany in 1845, Hoffmann's illustrated storybook went on to be
translated into dozens of languages and sell so many millions of
copies that scholar Jack Zipes has called it "the most famous
children's book in the world."</LD>
<TE>   Hoffmann aimed to scare children into being good with tales, for
example, about Harriet, who plays with matches and is burned up, and
Augustus, who refuses to eat his soup and shrinks to stick-like
proportions, dying in five days.</TE>
<TE>   But the consensus is that the most frightening of these is "The
Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb," in which Conrad is warned by his mama
about his habit but, when her back is turned, he puts the digit in
his mouth. The Scissor-man bursts through the door and snips off the
boy's thumbs. The last picture shows a chastened and amputated
Conrad.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was a child, 'Struwwelpeter' terrified me," author Marina
Warner wrote about the book. "I did not find it funny because I
sucked my thumb and I was truly afraid [the Scissor-man], drawn like
a leaping pair of scissors, would come to get me and cut off my
thumbs, as he does to little Suck-a-Thumb.... I must have been around
7 when I read 'Struwwelpeter,' and it took such possession of me that
I kept going back and looking at the Scissor-man until I could bear
it no longer and took the book to my father when he was gardening and
asked him to burn it on the bonfire."</TE>
<TE>   A little more than 100 years later a different scary book came
down the pike when Maurice Sendak published his now beloved "Where
the Wild Things Are." Max is misbehaving in the opening of Sendak's
story and then finds himself in a land of monsters -- the Wild Things
-- that seem as horrific as Hoffmann's Scissor-man: "They roared
their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled
their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws."</TE>
<TE>   But in the next scene, Sendak departed from tradition and
indicated that this was not your grandparents' scary story. Sendak's
Max is not intimidated. After the monsters do their best to terrify
him, Max gives them a start and "tamed them with a magic trick of
staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once and they
were frightened." Then, as the story continues, Max marshals these
critters to do his bidding, and they all play together.</TE>
<TE>   As much as I love "Where the Wild Things Are," it must be said
that Sendak's book marked the downfall of monsters.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Roald Dahl in "The BFG" would tell the story of the little
girl Sophie who is abducted by the Big Friendly Giant and transported
to monsterland, where they trump a miscellaneous band of oversized
ogres (Bonecruncher, Childchewer, et al). It wouldn't be long before
the scary story would be retold from the sympathetic point of view of
a frightened monster (Philippe Corentin's "Papa!" is only one
example), and Raymond Briggs (in "Fungus the Bogeyman") would provide
a comic account of everyday life in monsterland.</TE>
<TE>   A final stage in the domestication of fears was reached when
Mercer Mayer published his bestselling "There's a Nightmare in My
Closet," where it is the monster who is terrified by the child and
has to be tucked into bed and consoled.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true in films. Nowadays, thanks perhaps to
overcautious parents, children are introduced to lovable monsters --
our buddy Shrek and the bogeys uncertain about their profession in
"Monsters Inc."</TE>
<TE>   All this seems a long way from the heart-pounding moment in MGM's
"The Wizard of Oz" when Dorothy is accosted by the Wicked Witch, who
cackles, "I'll get you, my pretty, and your little dog too." It used
to be that our children's stories taught youngsters the very useful
knowledge of what it is to shiver, have your heart thump and hair
stand on end. Where is MGM's Margaret Hamilton when we need her?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine the day after victory in Iraq. The U.S. Army will be in
charge of 23 million people, a few of whom have ruled brutally over
most of the rest for more than 20 years. The Shiite Arab majority
will feel liberated from their Sunni Arab oppressors, Kurds will have
their own armies and territory in the north, and other minorities
will want to regain property and status. All will claim a share of
the world's second-largest oil reserves.</LD>
<LD>   Is the U.S. ready for that chaotic day? Hardly.</LD>
<LD>   The world has seen power vacuums before: in Bosnia in 1996, when a
weak civilian international representative struggled to implement the
Dayton peace accords; in Kosovo in 1999, when NATO ground forces
entered before the U.N. could name a civilian head of its
administration; in Afghanistan, where the national government's
authority hardly extends past the capital.</LD>
<TE>   What has the U.S. learned from these previous interventions, and
what should it do to avoid future mistakes?</TE>
<TE>   The first lesson is that power after war grows from the barrel of
a gun. The U.S. military will own Iraq, like it or not. It needs to
behave like an owner: Gradualism and half-measures do not work in a
post-conflict situation.</TE>
<TE>   Everything the military does in the first days after a victory
will resonate for years to come. When a U.S. colonel marches into a
municipality in central Iraq, an English-speaking Iraqi in a suit and
tie will greet him, claiming to be an enemy of Saddam Hussein and
offering all the help his liberators require. Does the colonel
accept, empowering his new friend, or does he arrest the fellow
because another Iraqi has whispered that he is a Hussein crony and
murderer?</TE>
<TE>   In Bosnia, the international community ignored this conundrum and
empowered ethnic nationalists who are still winning elections six
years later. In Kosovo, the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army became
the legitimate authority in most municipalities, a decision that is
being belatedly reversed three years later by elections and
indictments. In Afghanistan, the U.S. is battling its own
contradictions, the military and CIA having found it necessary to
employ warlords who reject the designated political leader.</TE>
<TE>   Governing is an unavoidable burden on the day after victory, but
the burden should be lifted from the military as quickly as possible.
This requires detailed civilian-military planning, executed with firm
unity of command and purpose.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. military needs a realistic schedule by which it will turn
over authority to civilians, whether internationals or Iraqis or some
combination.</TE>
<TE>   In Bosnia, the plan -- one year of military presence and then
withdraw -- was clear but unrealistic, and not coordinated with the
buildup of civilian authority. In Kosovo, it took a year just to get
international police in place, allowing criminals to entrench
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement has to arrive with the troops, not months later.
Post-conflict chaos and revenge lead to protection rackets and
organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   Rule of law also requires governing authority. One approach would
be to accept the existing institutions as legitimate, once the
leadership loyal to Hussein has been booted out. The U.S. might use
Iraqi expatriates as advisors, helping to get rid of Hussein's
cronies and to identify technocrats within state structures who are
not excessively compromised by the crimes of the old regime.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal and provincial authorities should be elected first. This
will allow political forces to form around issues that directly
affect people's lives. It was a mistake to hold national elections
first in Bosnia -- it froze the country in a pattern of ethnic
division that is hard to overcome. The international community did
better in Kosovo, where unhurried municipal elections provided a
first test and allowed relative moderates to win.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. also will need to take on conflict prevention. It should
be working now to avoid violence among Iraq's ethnic groups and to
prevent its neighbors from trying to impose their wills. Success will
require that the U.S. play a strong role in protecting Iraq's
territorial integrity and in developing its new democracy.</TE>

<LD>The state's financial malaise is best described by Charles Dickens:
"Annual income 20 pounds, annual expenditure 21 pounds, result
misery."</LD>
<LD>   The deficit in the state's general fund has been given in official
statements as $23.6 billion -- a meaningless figure that is nothing
more than a hodgepodge of past deficits and future projections. A
more reliable number comes from the state controller's office, which
reported that 2001-02 disbursements exceeded receipts by $13.8
billion.</LD>
<LD>   So far, short-term loans have kept the state afloat, and probably
will continue to do so through election day. And the recently passed
budget contains a variety of revenue enhancements that include
borrowing against future income, hoped-for funds from the federal
government, reshuffling of money among state funds, and spending
cuts. But after election day further changes will be necessary, and
they won't be pleasant.</LD>
<TE>   California's fiscal misery has many causes. The state relies
heavily on volatile taxes on income and capital gains. At the same
time, California has a large and growing low-income population with
needs for education, health and other services. Even an economic
turnaround, which may be slow in coming, will not quickly resolve the
imbalance.</TE>
<TE>   Longer-term fixes must be adopted to restore California's fiscal
health as well as the trust of voters and the financial community.
The state's tax system has not been subjected to a thorough review
for decades; a review is sorely needed.</TE>
<TE>   As a starting point, the state needs to rethink its focus on
capital gains taxes. Almost any alternative tax will provide more
stability than one that relies heavily on capital gains; a sales tax
on services, imposed at the state level, is one example of a
productive and stable revenue source. And although property taxes are
protected by the sacrosanct Proposition 13, there is no avoiding the
fact that the property tax is also relatively stable since it is
based on wealth.</TE>
<TE>   Facing the tough prospect of new taxes or revisions of existing
ones must be part of a comprehensive review. But it is possible to
live with volatility of receipts as long as the state has a cushion
of a substantial rainy-day fund. Such a fund cannot be accumulated,
however, unless the Legislature takes steps to ensure that in good
times it does not spend every dollar that it receives.</TE>
<TE>   California faces a recession and a "budget crisis" about every 10
years; the current crisis cannot be dismissed as a surprise.</TE>
<TE>   California's universities and research institutions can help
review the tax system and formulate targets for an adequate rainy-day
fund. But the leaders of both major political parties must first be
willing to put all of the possibilities on the table.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining time before the election offers an opportune moment
for the gubernatorial candidates to share their plans for dealing
with the state budget. Voters have a right to know.</TE>

<HD>County Choice on Health Care</HD>
<DH>Measure B would help preserve trauma and emergency centers</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Each of us -- whether rich or poor, insured or uninsured -- is only
one car crash, street crime or industrial accident away from a trauma
center or emergency room.</LD>
<LD>   Measure B on the Nov. 5 ballot offers Los Angeles County voters a
choice: to preserve the county's lifesaving network of trauma and
emergency services or hasten the day of its collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Trauma care uses highly trained surgeons, state-of-the-art
equipment and a rapid-response paramedic system to rescue people who
could die within that "golden hour" following their accident.</LD>
<TE>   Take, for example, victims like Treve Broudy and Benjamin Kadish.</TE>
<TE>   Broudy, 33, of West Hollywood, was beaten into a coma with a
baseball bat last month. But for the fact that he was only minutes
away from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's trauma center, he might be
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Benjamin was 5 when he was shot and gravely wounded in the vicious
1999 attack by a white supremacist at the North Valley Jewish
Community Center. A paramedic arrived within minutes and took
Benjamin to Providence Holy Cross Medical Center's trauma center.</TE>
<TE>   The county trauma network had 22 centers in 1985. Today it has
withered to 13, and large swaths of the Antelope Valley, the San
Gabriel Valley and the Pomona Valley are functionally without trauma
services.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B's modest charge, which amounts to an annual increase of
$42 on a 1,400-square-foot home, is less a tax than it is a
supplement to our health insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by a Harvard researcher found that advances in
trauma care reduced the national murder rate by saving assault
victims who otherwise would have become homicide victims.</TE>
<TE>   We are told that health care is a national issue, that state and
federal officials aren't paying their fair share, that county
taxpayers shouldn't have to shoulder the burden. True enough, in a
perfect world. But in this world, politicians fiddle while our
health-care system burns.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 5, we can regain some control over our destiny before it's
too late.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B can help ensure that our trauma and emergency services
will be there if we need them. Because in a few terrible seconds, the
next Treve Broudy or Benjamin Kadish could be you or me.</TE>

<HD>Touch-Screen Voting Pushes the Envelope</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Touch-screen voting last week (my first time doing it) was a bit
frustrating. The on-screen ballot did not match the sample ballot in
layout or content. On screen, the page breaks were different, and the
easy-reference punch numbers were missing. This slowed me down. The
machines' huge screen and type size diminished the secrecy of voters'
ballots. As soon as I entered the room, I could see the layout and
choice pattern of someone else's ballot. (A poll worker said that was
because the voter chose to sit.) With such big, bright screens, each
machine should get a booth with a curtain. Election workers should at
least turn the machines around so that each screen faces a wall and
people don't stand behind voters.</LD>
<LD>   The software was good but not great. A scroll button you might use
to verify your selections is right next to the "cast ballot" button,
which you might thus hit by accident. If you go back to cast a
missing vote, you cannot return to your vote summary screen without
going page by page to the end of the ballot. In this era of software
bugs, accounting fraud and occasional blackouts, it would have been
nice to see a real ballot go into a locked box. Still, I like to
master computers and found satisfaction in completing the
touch-screen process.</LD>

<LD>Re "War Clouds Again Shield N. Korea," Commentary, Oct. 24: War
clouds shield no one anywhere. In fact, they rain terror wherever
they gather. From what we can see now of the disastrous effects of
policies of violence, both personal and national, it is increasingly
obvious that the world is growing beyond war as a method of foreign
policy. Everything indicates that peace-building through practicing
patience, understanding, compassion and justice is the better path to
the future. Look at it this way: The human race now resembles one
huge butterfly, ever so slowly emerging from its dark cocoon into the
sunlight.</LD>

<LD>In his Oct. 24 letter, Ken Artingstall wrote that "there may be 41
million uninsured Americans, but each of them can find some kind of
coverage at reasonable cost with a little effort and by making
sacrifices between luxuries and necessities. The nanny state does not
have to be the solution."</LD>
<LD>   Not only is this a cruel and unsympathetic attitude toward the
uninsured, many of whom are unemployed, elderly and/or seriously ill,
but it is naive about private insurers. Private insurers are in the
business to make money. They will not insure people with serious
health conditions. Those they do insure will have no coverage for
"preexisting conditions," and renewals are not guaranteed.</LD>

<TE>   Wake up and smell the roses. Get sick, lose your job, try to put
food on the table and maintain housing and that insurance premium is
unaffordable. Lose your insurance and try to buy it back. Then you
find out you have a "preexisting condition" with your former longtime
insurance carrier and can't get coverage at any price. It happened to
me.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re your "no" recommendation on Proposition 52, editorial, Oct. 20: As
an experienced polling-place worker, I oppose this proposition for
two reasons. First, poll workers are difficult to recruit and retain,
especially when more laws require more paperwork on election day.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, workers are paid to work those 16-plus hours at the polling
places, but most workers I've met are there because they feel that
they're doing their civic duty. Some workers are overwhelmed by the
new fail-safe procedures and complicated ballots and have stopped
working on elections.</LD>
<LD>   Second, I believe that citizens who are concerned about what
happens in their government will register to vote ahead of time. We
have lots of publicity about deadlines for registering. We have
safeguards in place to ensure that registered voters will be able to
vote if they have moved and have not re-registered. Our country
depends on an informed electorate, not on people who, on a whim,
decide to vote at the last minute.</LD>

<LD>In "How to Get Clothes Clean?" (Oct. 21), Jon Meijer, vice president
of the International Fabricare Institute, calls perchloroethylene
"fabulous" for its ability to remove stains "without damaging
fabric." It must be a peculiar luxury to put clothing ahead of
people's health and safety. As the son and grandson of dry cleaners,
I am relieved that action is underway to eliminate this chemical.
This work should have begun a generation ago, when health agencies
first spotted the carcinogenic trail of "perc." The National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health advised workers to treat
the chemical as if it were a carcinogen as early as 1978. I see
nothing fabulous about perc.</LD>
<LD>   My father died in 1993 of kidney cancer linked to
perchloroethylene exposure. Will multibillion-dollar chemical
corporations and the trade associations they support delude another
generation of mom-and-pop dry cleaners into complacency, illness and
death?</LD>

result, it is necessary to create a more efficient economic system
that more closely aligns the true cost of dry cleaning with its total
cost to society. If some dry cleaners are forced to go out of
business, then it is in the name of a more efficient economic system.
Like tobacco and other toxins, perc is a dangerous substance that
should not be paid for by society at large.</TE>

<TE>   I am a second-generation dry cleaner who has worked in the
industry since I was a child. As a 28-year-old businessman, I own a
dry-cleaning plant and have studied this business and all aspects of
the industry. My family came here in 1979, from Iran, with my father
having master's degrees in both chemistry and metallurgy. Regardless
of his degrees, owning a small business was the only way we could try
to obtain the American dream.</TE>
<TE>   The 350 people or so who have voiced their disagreement at the
banning of perc are a small fraction of the voices out there. In the
past 50 years, the dry-cleaning industry has improved dramatically,
and machines today are 10 times more efficient than 15 years ago. The
amount of toxins you inhale when you pump your gas in one day are far
more dangerous and hazardous to your health than having your clothes
cleaned in perc for a year.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to cleaning quality and price, there is no possible
way you can compare perc to the other options, such as silicone and
hydrocarbons (which are hazardous); a $7.50 dry-cleaned suit will
cost about $10.50 if the plant did not use perc. The dry cleaners
that the majority of our city uses will disappear, and the average
cost to clean one piece will be $4 to $6 rather than $1.50 to $3. Our
economy depends on the small-business owner, and this plan will only
hurt the minority business owners and the public, which will have to
pay at least 30% more for dry cleaning.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The corporate conglomerates whose billboards have turned so many Los
Angeles streets into eyesores are whining that the City Council has
violated their civil rights. Hardly.</LD>
<LD>   It seems that the annual inspection fee the City Council finally
approved last summer strikes these companies as just so unfair. The
fee will pay for the extra inspectors the city badly needs to figure
out which of the 10,000 billboards across the city sprang up
overnight, without a city permit, and get them removed. No one knows
how many of these illegal signs are there -- estimates put the number
at 4,000. For neighbors who live in the shadow of one of these
hulking, illegal signs, even one is too many.</LD>
<LD>   And the onerous fee? We're talking $314 for a billboard that can
rake in as much as $100,000 a year. Compare that with the $100 that
city residents have to pay every year to license a dog if it's not
spayed or neutered.</LD>
<TE>   The city ordinance applies only to so-called off-site signs, those
giant billboards erected on a steel pole. It does not apply to the
sign on top of the video rental store advertising new releases; in
"cityspeak," these are called on-site signs. The billboard advocates
call this distinction unconstitutional, or in legal parlance,
"discriminatory treatment based solely on the content of the
message." This argument is quite a stretch, even for the 1st
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Today lawyers from the city attorney's office are scheduled to
face off in federal court against the high-powered corporate law firm
representing Clear Channel Outdoor, Viacom Outdoor and National
Advertising. The three companies are asking the judge to impose a
temporary restraining order barring the city from collecting its $314
a sign, which was due Oct. 1. We hope the judge can keep a straight
face and tell the billboard companies to quit griping and start
paying up.</TE>

<LD>For celebrity-watchers, it's the trial of the new century. Princess
Diana's long-time retainer, Paul Burrell, has been accused in
England's famous Old Bailey court of pilfering no fewer than 310
objects from her estate. A police raid a year ago on Burrell's home
in Cheshire turned up everything from china crockery with the Prince
of Wales' feather monogram to autographed photos of Prince William
with supermodels Naomi Campbell and Claudia Schiffer.</LD>
<LD>   This latest installment in the Windsor family's soap-opera-like
drama has England and much of the world wondering: Was Burrell trying
to protect her legacy from a "conspiracy," as Burrell has stated? Did
he simply cherish the objects as a way of preserving her memory for
himself? Or was he simply a common thief out to profit from her
legacy, as the prosecution asserts?</LD>
<TE>   Almost every hanger-on and associate of Princess Di has tried to
extract something from her memory. But Burrell was supposed to be the
exception. By all accounts, he was a model butler -- the one person
Princess Di could count on for obedience, loyalty and, above all,
discretion. During 22 years of service, he had risen from being a
Buckingham Palace footman to Princess Di's personal butler. Burrell
was the only mourner at her burial who did not belong to the royal
family. But now Burrell is playing hardball with the family he once
so devotedly served. He may, he said, feel forced to divulge personal
details about Diana's life.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt such details would further titillate the professional
Diana-watchers who helped make her life such a torment. But even if
he has to hand over the objects, Burrell could render his former
princess one last service by keeping quiet and showing that the
greatest of butler virtues hasn't gone by the wayside -- a stiff
upper lip.</TE>

<HD>Will Bratton Keep His Vow?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the day Mayor James K. Hahn named him police chief, William H.
Bratton told a crowd of East Los Angeles mothers that he would end
gang slaughter.</LD>
<LD>   "Every day, the men and women of this department will be in that
ring, fighting for you," he said, waving a pinstriped sleeve toward
the roped canvas where gold medalist Paul Gonzalez once boxed his way
to Olympic history and now coaches kids to stay out of trouble. "The
fear that you feel will be a distant memory, one your children and
grandchildren will never have to feel."</LD>
<LD>   Today Bratton officially begins his job as Los Angeles' top cop in
a Police Academy ceremony with bagpipes and a helicopter flyover.
Whether he keeps the promise made to hopeful, skeptical moms in that
gymnasium on East 1st Street will determine his legacy.</LD>
<TE>   That early appearance at Hollenbeck Youth Center, which is
supported by local businesses and neighborhood volunteers,
underscores his understanding of the one-two punch -- cop and
community -- needed to knock down crime.</TE>
<TE>   As the nation's gang capital, Los Angeles has tried everything
from monstrous battering rams to gang truces. But the people running
the federal, state, county and city efforts don't always talk to each
other, and private programs compete as much as cooperate, each
grabbing at the same grant money. Bratton has ordered a who-does-what
evaluation of the Los Angeles Police Department. He should do the
same with anti-gang programs, demanding a rigorous assessment, and
then refuse to support failures, such as DARE, the drug abuse
prevention program.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he should champion what does work. Example: The
Pacific Division's Community Law Enforcement and Recovery program.
CLEAR focuses on one area and it houses in one office the cops who
investigate gang crime, district attorneys who understand the
difficulties of gang prosecutions (witnesses who wind up dead, for
instance) and probation officers who can track gangsters as they
cycle in and out of jail. Reserve officers volunteer to work with
truants and curfew violators to make sure they don't take the next
step into worse behavior. The result: Violent crime dropped for two
years running, while climbing in other divisions.</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to William Q. Wilson's astute theory that ramshackle
houses turn into crack dens when broken windows go unrepaired,
Bratton plans to target "quality of life" violations, especially
graffiti. Smart move. Anyone who has watched tired men and women in
work clothes avert their eyes as swaggering young toughs deface a
city bus knows how spray cans can embolden bad guys and make the good
feel impotent.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Rocky Delgadillo's neighborhood prosecutors are already
out busting blight. Against all odds, artists and other activists are
reclaiming parts of the Los Angeles River once best suited for
dumping bodies. A police chief whose favorite college class was art
appreciation could make unlikely alliances.</TE>
<TE>   But chief, please make sure you hold those alliances together,
because this city has a sorry history in trying to stay almost any
anti-gang course. Example: A few years ago, a Rand researcher and a
UC Irvine professor started a pilot project in Boyle Heights based on
Operation Cease-Fire, a collaboration in Boston among cops, social
workers and preachers. Boston went two years without a juvenile
homicide -- until complacency set in again and homicides soared. What
happened in Los Angeles was worse. Police commanders and officers
never stuck around long enough for the partnership to take hold.</TE>
<TE>   Some cops still think it's wimpy to fight crime alongside anyone
who doesn't carry a gun. Bratton needs to break his troops of that
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the cop's job," retired L.A.County Sheriff's Detective Wes
McBride says, "to make the criminal lifestyle uncomfortable." But
that task will remain Sisyphean as long as potential criminals see no
other route, the sage on gang behavior adds. "Most of the bangers
I've dealt with come from some kind of dysfunctional family," McBride
says. "If they can't read and write -- and most of them can't very
well -- they work low-wage jobs. Their kids run on the streets and
become more little gang members."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles' anxious mothers need help. They need a tough chief
who will track down and jail the gangbangers who kill their children.
They also need someone who will work with them to keep good kids from
turning bad. Only then will their children and grandchildren live
free of fear.</TE>

<LD>Re "Prejudice and Politics Mix in Slurs on Israel," Commentary, Oct.
24: I would like Norah Vincent to explain what is "hysterical" about
pacifism (a belief held sacred by millions of Hindus, Buddhists,
Quakers and others, including Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King
Jr.) and multiculturalism (the idea that no one culture has a
monopoly on truth or goodness).</LD>
<LD>   I also wonder what her definition of postmodernism is, and whether
she would dismiss every bit of Marxist doctrine -- for example, the
belief that capitalists derive their wealth by paying labor less than
it produces, a proposition shared by Marx and Adam Smith, the founder
of capitalism. Finally, I challenge Vincent to clarify why opposing
Zionism is "by definition" anti-Semitic, particularly when some of
Zionism's most outspoken opponents are Orthodox Jews who believe only
the Messiah can lead the Jews back into Israel and that a secular
state is a betrayal of biblical principles.</LD>
<LD>   Vincent is usually much more measured and thoughtful, but in this
piece she has adopted the knee-jerk, superficial anti-liberalism of
the most reactionary elements of the right wing.</LD>

<TE>   Re Vincent's column: Every word tried and true. Our campuses
suffer from three diseases: anti-Israelism, anti-Semitism and
anti-Americanism. Hand in hand with these three go pro- fanatic Islam
disguised as being pro-Palestinian, terror and a goal to silence
every voice defending Israel, Jews and America.</TE>
<TE>   Our schools are sick. With Vincent's piece we are finally
beginning to hear the heartbreaking story of what is going on at our
universities, using our tax dollars to spread these three awful
diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Batya Dagan</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vincent's assertion that comparison between apartheid and the
treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza is erroneous
"because blacks in South Africa were not in the habit of sending
suicide bombers into Johannesburg" is not a valid argument. It might
not be a perfect comparison, but there are plenty of similarities.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank, about 200,000 settlers control almost 45% of the
land, with a majority of the water resources in an area where water
is a precious commodity. There are settler-only highways slicing up
the West Bank into "cantons" of Palestinian land. In order to protect
these settlers, Israel has to impose restrictions on millions of
Palestinians. This is taken to ridiculous extremes in Hebron, where a
few thousand settlers' safety has forced hundreds of thousands of
Palestinians to deal with checkpoints and curfews for years. If this
is not apartheid, I can't imagine what is.</TE>
<TE>   This system of ruling the West Bank and Gaza has been in place
since before any suicide bomber was sent to any Israeli city. Vincent
tries to paint the occupation as an effect of terrorism, which is in
direct contradiction to the facts.</TE>

<HD>Winton Blount, 81; U.S. Postal System Chief, Philanthropist</HD>

<LD>Winton M. "Red" Blount, billionaire contractor, philanthropist and
the last Cabinet-level postmaster general of the United States who
stripped the postal system of political patronage and established the
more businesslike U.S. Postal Service, has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Blount, who was named postmaster general by President Nixon in
early 1969 and chaired the Postal Service from its inception in 1970
through 1971, died Thursday at his summer home in Highlands, N.C.,
after a long illness. His official residence was in Montgomery, Ala.</LD>
<LD>   "It was quite a wrench. One day I was a Cabinet officer; the next
I was a has-been," Blount joked in an Op-ed article he wrote for the
Washington Post in 1995. But he was clearly proud of his achievement
in restructuring the post office and was citing that as an
illustration of the benefits in privatizing some public enterprises.</LD>
<TE>   Blount's stature in public service was immense. Before taking the
Nixon appointment, he had served as president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce under President Johnson, warning businesses and corporations
to police themselves or face increasing government regulation. As a
conservative Republican in Alabama in a time and place, a colleague
once noted, that Republicans could fit into a phone booth, he ran
unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 1972. Despite his failed bid
for office, he virtually established the party in his state.</TE>
<TE>   For 32 years, Blount served as a trustee of the University of
Alabama, including throughout the historic confrontation in 1963 when
Alabama Gov. George Wallace defied federal court orders and tried to
block racial integration of the university. According to Culpepper
Clark's history of that debacle in his 1993 book, "The Schoolhouse
Door: Segregation's Last Stand at the University of Alabama," Blount
put aside his personal feelings and worked closely with the
Democratic Kennedy administration to help end the crisis and
integrate the school.</TE>
<TE>   Two years earlier, when white supremacists were openly beating
civil rights freedom riders in Alabama, Blount worked with the
federal Justice Department and urged state business and civic leaders
to take a strong stand for law and order. In 1964, although he
personally opposed the Civil Rights Act, he urged compliance with it.</TE>
<TE>   When Nixon appointed Blount to his Cabinet, critics noted that the
conservative businessman employed no blacks, was active in an
all-white church and had backed local segregationist candidates. Yet
Blount believed staunchly in obeying laws and realized integration
was happening. "I suppose that you would basically call me a
conservative," he told Nation's Business in 1968, "but I try to think
of myself as a progressive."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-3 redhead stood even taller in his chosen career than
in public service. His Blount Inc., which he sold in 1999 for $1.35
billion, constructed the launch pad at Cape Canaveral that sent
Apollo 11 and man to the moon in 1969. It also built the first
nuclear power plant in Tennessee, the first intercontinental missile
base in Wyoming, the New Orleans Superdome and the $2-billion King
Saud University in Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   After Desert Storm in 1991, Blount and his company rebuilt the
superstructure and literally turned the lights back on in Kuwait. In
Southern California, he built projects ranging from solar energy
fields in the Mojave Desert to major facilities for Lockheed and
other aerospace companies.</TE>
<TE>   As a philanthropist, Blount donated $10 million to the National
Postal Museum, a part of the Smithsonian, and served as president and
backer of actor Tony Randall's National Actor's Theater in New York.
He was a major supporter of the National Endowment for the Arts, and
urged other businessmen and state and federal governments to support
artistic projects.</TE>
<TE>   But he primarily concentrated on Alabama and particularly on
Montgomery. He created the now 300-acre Blount Cultural Park, where
he built the $21.5-million Carolyn Blount Theater to house his pet
project, the Alabama Shakespeare Festival. He named the theater for
his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "His legacy is that Shakespeare theater, one of the glories of our
nation," Randall told the Montgomery Advertiser after Blount's death.</TE>
<TE>   Blount also made room in the park for the Montgomery Museum of
Fine Arts and donated his corporate art collection, valued at some
$15 million, to the museum. His adjacent Georgian style mansion,
Wynfield, eventually will be donated to the park.</TE>
<TE>   Among his gifts were $5 million to Rhodes College in Memphis,
where he was also a trustee; $5 million to Huntingdon College in
Montgomery and some $8 million to the University of Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Union Springs, Ala., Blount started working for his father
in railroads and building materials businesses when he was 13,
earning 10 cents an hour. He spent a year at Staunton Military
Academy in Virginia and a couple of years at the University of
Alabama before enlisting in the Army Air Corps during World War II.
He became a B-29 pilot and instructor although he was never sent into
battle.</TE>
<TE>   In 1946, Blount and his brother, Houston, pooled some inherited
funds and a loan from their mother to form what started as Blount
Brothers Corp.</TE>
<TE>   They bought four Caterpillar tractors and began building fish
ponds. Except for his time in government service, Blount served as
president and chairman of the board until he sold the revamped
company in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Blount's autobiography, "Doing It My Way," written with the help
of Richard Blodgett, was published in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Blount is survived by his wife, Carolyn; his brother; five
children, including Los Angeles architect Thomas A. Blount; two
stepchildren; 14 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for today in Montgomery. Memorial
contributions can be made to the Blount Cultural Park, 6055 Vaughn
Road, Montgomery, AL 36116.</TE>

<HD>Mauro Bruno, 78; Emmy-Nominated Musician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mauro Bruno, trumpet player, music arranger and composer of classical
works and scores for films and such television programs as "Barnaby
Jones," has died. He was 78.</LD>
<LD>   Bruno died Oct. 3 of lung cancer at Providence Saint Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   The musician was nominated for Emmys for his work on a television
special, "The Magic of David Copperfield VI"; the series "Barnaby
Jones"; and a segment of "Hallmark Hall of Fame" titled "The
Rivalry."</LD>
<TE>   Born in Boston, Bruno studied trumpet and piano at the Peabody
Conservatory of Music in Baltimore, Md., and earned a bachelor's
degree in composition at Catholic University in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   While in school, he played trumpet with the National Symphony
Orchestra in Washington and arranged music for the inaugural balls of
Presidents Harry S. Truman in 1949 and Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953.</TE>
<TE>   Later, he became an arranger and conductor for the nightclub acts
of Ray Bolger, Pinky Lee and others in Las Vegas and Los Angeles. He
also arranged music for recordings by the Platters and Tina Turner.</TE>
<TE>   Earning his own credits as composer, he scored several low-budget
motion pictures in the 1970s, including "J.D. and the Salt Flat Kid"
and "Smokey and the Good Time Outlaws."</TE>
<TE>   Bruno was perhaps best known for his work on police television
series in the 1970s and 1980s, notably "Barnaby Jones," "Streets of
San Francisco" and "Police Story."</TE>
<TE>   Among Bruno's prodigious output were some two dozen classical
pieces, many of which were recorded. Widowed last June by the death
of his wife, Betty, Bruno is survived by one son, Christian of Silver
Springs, Md.; one stepson, Michael Malone of Sherman Oaks; four
grandchildren; three sisters; and one brother.</TE>

<HD>Roy Hord Jr., 67; Ex-Ram Guard and Riverside Raceway
Executive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Ram football guard Roy Hord Jr., who later was general manager
of Riverside International Raceway and long was active in politics
and community projects in Riverside, died of cancer Thursday. He was
67.</LD>
<LD>   Hord was born in Charlotte, N.C., on Dec. 25, 1934. He attended
Duke University, where he played defensive tackle and offensive
guard, and was named first-team All-American in 1957.</LD>
<LD>   He was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in 1960, and eventually
played guard for three seasons. He also played one season each with
the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Jets.</LD>
<TE>   Hord previously served in the Army for two years, where his
athletic prowess caused a stir. His overseas unit trained at Bitburg
Air Force Base in Germany, and when it was learned that Hord had been
drafted by the Rams, the base commander demanded that he play for Air
Force teams in Europe instead of Army teams.</TE>
<TE>   Hord, who was 6 feet 5 and weighed 260 pounds in his playing days,
played football, basketball and baseball for the Air Force in 1958
and 1959 before starting his pro career with the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   After his NFL career ended in 1965, he became general manager of
Riverside International Raceway, a job he held until 1983.</TE>
<TE>   The raceway closed shortly after he left to become legislative
aide to Riverside County Supervisor Norton Younglove. Hord also was a
legislative aide to Riverside County Supervisor Tom Mullen until
December.</TE>
<TE>   Hord was recognized as a football legend at Duke in 1998, and
inducted into the school's sports hall of fame in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In Riverside, where he lived for 33 years, Hord helped found the
boosters club for Riverside Community College, and served on the
city's Chamber of Commerce, Planning Commission, downtown partnership
and community college foundation.</TE>
<TE>   He also was on the boards of Inland Empire National Bank and
Riverside Community Hospital, and was active with Young Life
Christian Fellowship and the Boy Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't say no to anything," said his wife of 45 years, Jo.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Hord is survived by three sons, Trip,
Chip and Randy, all of Riverside; and four grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Services will be at 11 a.m. Friday at Calvary Presbyterian Church
in Riverside.</TE>

<HD>A Pledge to Fight Terrorism</HD>
<DH>Pacific Rim leaders will increase efforts that include
greater vigilance of cargo ships and borders. Bush's agenda achieves
mixed success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CABO SAN LUCAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Calling terrorism a threat to free trade, Pacific Rim leaders pledged
Sunday to introduce by 2005 tighter, high-tech monitoring of cargo
and passengers moving across their borders and to reinforce cockpit
doors on their airliners by next April.</LD>
<LD>   The commitments, expected to cost tens of millions of dollars,
marked an advance in the U.S.-led war on terrorism. The Bush
administration pushed for their adoption by the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, or APEC, whose 21 members account for nearly half
of all international trade and contain most of the world's busiest
seaports and airports.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush also left APEC's two-day gathering here with
backing from its members for a demand that North Korea give up its
recently disclosed effort to build nuclear weapons.</LD>
<TE>   Though his agenda dominated the talks at this Baja California
beach resort, Bush achieved only mixed success. Japan and South Korea
persuaded him to forsake an outright condemnation of North Korea,
arguing that one would be counterproductive. And Bush failed to gain
support here for a U.S.-sponsored proposal in the United Nations on
using force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   APEC was formed 13 years ago to promote free trade, but security
issues have taken over its last two annual gatherings. Last year's
came weeks after the Sept. 11 hijackings; this year's followed
terrorist attacks in Bali and the Philippines and unfolded during the
deadly siege of a Moscow theater by Chechen separatists.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorism can come from anywhere," Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Sunday, emphasizing the sense of vulnerability that
drove the discussions here.</TE>
<TE>   The group's members are Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China,
Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Korea,
Taiwan, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the security measures agreed to Sunday are already being
put into effect in the United States, Japan, Canada and Western
Europe. A number of Asian leaders voiced concern here that a wider
application would be expensive, undermine trade and slow economic
growth.</TE>
<TE>   But some countries with busy ports, such as Singapore, argued that
they would lose cargo traffic unless they became more
security-conscious. Eventually, a consensus emerged that security
today is simply another business cost that cannot be avoided. The
U.S. and other wealthier countries agreed to help the poorer ones pay
for the new measures.</TE>
<TE>   APEC nations pledged to require by 2005 electronic identity
beacons on ships using their ports. They also agreed, by that year,
to introduce electronic systems to screen baggage at airports and
enable customs inspectors to quickly identify high-risk shipments.</TE>
<TE>   And they pledged to act "expeditiously" to require electronic
seals on international cargo containers and to exchange passenger
lists ahead of the arrivals of aircraft and ships.</TE>
<TE>   To suppress the financing of terrorism, the leaders vowed to
promote better monitoring of charities, nonprofit groups and
money-transfer systems such as the ancient Middle Eastern honor-based
hawala, believed to have been used by Al Qaeda and the Sept. 11
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   The steps outlined Sunday are voluntary, and officials
acknowledged that some deadlines are extremely ambitious.</TE>
<TE>   Next April's deadline for reinforced cockpit doors will be met
"wherever possible," according to the APEC leaders' statement.
Officials explained that the bulletproof doors, which cost about
$30,000 apiece, might be ready for international flights but not all
domestic ones.</TE>
<TE>   In another step forward for the U.S.-led campaign, Malaysia
announced this weekend that it would set up a regional anti-terrorist
center so that U.S. security specialists can train their counterparts
in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "Globalization has turned the world into an interconnected
village, a village where, if a house burns, no one is safe," said
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, Malaysia's deputy prime minister.</TE>

<HD>Mt. Etna Spews Lava That Sparks Blazes</HD>
<DH>Volcano sends flow toward popular tourist spot in Sicily
after series of quakes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CATANIA, Sicily</DL>
<LD>Rivers of lava poured down Mt. Etna on Sunday, engulfing small
buildings and threatening a mountain lodge after a series of
earthquakes awakened Europe's highest and most active volcano.</LD>
<LD>   Pine trees caught fire as the heat of the lava engulfed them, and
the stench of sulfur filled the air as cracks opened up in the
ground, witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Civil protection officials in Catania, Sicily's second-largest
city, surveyed the mountain by helicopter and were set to send
water-carrying planes to fight the fires.</LD>
<TE>   Catania's airport was shut until this morning after a thick
blanket of volcanic ash fell on the runway.</TE>
<TE>   The eruptions began early Sunday after a series of small
earthquakes shook the eastern edge of Sicily and parts of mainland
Italy.</TE>
<TE>   The strongest quake was magnitude 4.2, according to the National
Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology.</TE>
<TE>   The volcano, Europe's highest at 10,990 feet, pumped out huge,
dark clouds of ash and spurted streams of lava at least 300 feet into
the air.</TE>
<TE>   The heaviest flow was descending on Piano Provenzana, a popular
area for tourists to take mountain walks in summer and for skiing and
other activities in winter.</TE>
<TE>   The flow pushed over ski-lift pylons, knocked down power lines and
swallowed a ski-school hut before surrounding an empty mountain hotel
and lodge.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said no one was injured.</TE>

<HD>Theatergoers Sat With Fear for Three Days of Hostage Crisis</HD>
<DH>Survivors recount ordeal at the hands of Chechen captors
and the police raid that freed them. One woman was just rows from a
bomb.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>For Anna Artyomova, one of more than 750 hostages held for three days
in a Moscow theater, a terrible moment came when terrorists planted a
large bomb just three rows in front of her.</LD>
<LD>   But it was not the worst experience.</LD>
<LD>   That came after the hostages' Chechen captors announced Wednesday,
the first day of the siege, that children would be allowed to leave,
and she realized she must be separated from her 11-year-old daughter,
Anastasia.</LD>
<TE>   "I understood that was maybe the only chance to save her life. But
my heart was literally breaking when I saw her being led away,
looking at me over her little shoulder with tears in her eyes,"
Artyomova recalled Sunday after her own release from a Moscow
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "This picture lodged in my head and in my heart, and I tried to
push away the insistent thought that it would be the last I would see
of my daughter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Near her in the theater, a couple in their 60s had their
granddaughter, aged about 11, with them. They agonized, but when the
time came to release children, they did not send the girl out.</TE>
<TE>   "This old woman would not let go of the child. She said: 'What
will I tell my son if something happens to her? No, I can't let her
go.' So they sat there, all three, embracing each other all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, the fate of the child and the couple could not be
ascertained, although authorities reported the youngest casualty of
the rescue operation that ended the siege early Saturday was a
13-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   At least 60 hostages were released from Moscow hospitals Sunday
after treatment necessitated by authorities' use of a gas to knock
out both the terrorists and their captives before the rescue
operation.</TE>
<TE>   Hostages who endured the three-day ordeal recalled the growing
edginess of the terrorists as the siege wore on. They described their
fear that they would all die if Russian troops tried to storm the
building.</TE>
<TE>   For most, the last thing they recalled was the smell of the gas
before they regained consciousness in the hospital. Some described
the effects of the gas: feelings of floating or slow motion,
distorted hearing, weakness in the limbs and an inability to move.</TE>
<TE>   Artyomova said the fact that her daughter was safe was her only
comfort during the siege. She was sure that she would die after
terrorists placed the bomb so close to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat there and watched that bomb all day, and I could not take
my eyes off it. There was my death sitting right in front of me, and
that was how it looked. I just sat there and couldn't think of
anything else," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, the second of the crisis, Artyomova said, hostages
could clearly hear footsteps on the roof of the theater, as though
someone was running.</TE>
<TE>   "All the Chechens jumped up, pointed their guns at the ceiling and
ordered us to lie down on the floor. I thought that the assault was
beginning and we should prepare for the worst. It was very scary,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alexandra Smyk, 22, said all the hostages were praying for a
peaceful solution to the crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very afraid of the storming. I thought it would definitely
kill us all. But as the days dragged by, everyone grew tired and
edgy, both hostages and terrorists," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was getting more and more tense, and I thought the situation
could get out of hand at any time."</TE>
<TE>   Smyk said that at one point, one of the female Chechens fell
asleep in her seat and dropped her pistol with a thud.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave us a real shock. She could have pushed some button in the
explosive bag around her waist in the same way, and that would have
detonated all the other explosives around us and we would have been
blown to pieces before we knew what had happened."</TE>
<TE>   On the last day, Artyomova said, the leader of the terrorists,
Movsar Barayev, told the hostages that they would all be killed
unless Russian President Vladimir V. Putin sent his envoy, Viktor
Kazantsev, to negotiate a withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Barayev said, 'If Kazantsev doesn't come by 11 a.m. tomorrow and
no deal is made, we will begin to slaughter you and throw your heads
out.' It was a horrible moment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Another terrible moment happened when a man who was sitting not
far from the bomb jumped up and threw a glass bottle at a Chechen
woman and began running toward her like mad.</TE>
<TE>   "Somebody shot at him and he fell, but he was not hit. Another man
was shot in the eye, and a woman. The man probably died immediately,
but the woman was screaming and moaning. She was sitting with her
husband and daughter and they were screaming: 'You killed her! She is
dying! She needs help!'</TE>
<TE>   "Then some male hostages carried them out of the auditorium
escorted by Chechens with guns ready." Both shooting victims died.</TE>
<TE>   As the tension built and the siege entered a third day, some
hostages, like Smyk, began longing for a storming operation, although
they had dreaded one earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so sick of it at the end that I was ready for the
storming," she said. "I just couldn't stand the uncertainty any
longer."</TE>
<TE>   At the end, as the smell of gas reached those in the theater, the
hostages said, the Chechen gunmen grabbed masks or pieces of clothing
to cover their faces and rushed toward doors leading out to a
corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember how somebody, I think it was a Chechen on the stage,
screamed out, 'Gas!' " said another hostage, Anna Guseva, 27, who
fell to the floor but felt little effect from the gas.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some shooting, then silence. Then I stood up."</TE>
<TE>   She crawled toward the stage, where confiscated mobile phones had
been collected, so she could call her family. But she felt too weak,
and then a soldier helped her out of the hall.</TE>
<TE>   Hostages interviewed by The Times had not learned what gas was
used in the operation, nor did they have any idea of what injections
were administered as antidotes.</TE>
<TE>   "They never told me what kind of gas it was," Smyk said. "But I
never really asked -- I was so happy to be alive."</TE>

<HD>Bodo Rebels Blamed for Attack That Kills 22, Hurts 12 in
India</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GAUHATI, India</DL>
<LD>Suspected separatist guerrillas knocked at the homes of villagers in
India's remote northeast just after midnight, asked men to come out
and then killed 22 of them, survivors and police said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Another 12 people were wounded in the attack on Dadgiri, a village
in Assam state close to India's border with Bhutan, said P.K. Bhuyan,
a local police officer.</LD>
<LD>   The attackers told the village's women that the men would return
in the morning. Instead, they lined them up and fired, police quoted
Babulal Yadav, a villager who survived the attack, as saying.</LD>
<TE>   Despite bullet wounds in his left shoulder, Yadav escaped and made
it to a nearby police station, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty people were killed in the attack. Two others died on the
way to hospitals in Kokrajhar, about 155 miles west of Gauhati, the
state capital, police said.</TE>
<TE>   No group claimed responsibility for the killings, but police
blamed rebels of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland. Bhuyan
said the killings were carried out by about 15 suspected insurgents.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, who belong to the ethnic Bodo tribe, are fighting for
an independent homeland. They accuse the federal government of
exploiting the region's rich timber and mineral resources while
neglecting the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,000 people have died during the decade-long
insurgency. The rebels operate from bases in Bhutan, staging
hit-and-run strikes in Assam. Bhutan has appealed to the guerrillas
to move out.</TE>

<HD>Dealing in Death Still Good Business in Kashmir</HD>
<DH>Corpses keep coming despite hopes for a political solution
to separatist violence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>While pundits hope a recent election here in the Indian-held part of
Kashmir will help end 13 years of secessionist violence, Mohammed
Maqbool, 60, says he knows better. Maqbool takes his cue from his
work, and the five or so tombstones he carves each day for shaheed,
or martyrs, show no sign of a letup.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm sure peace won't come for a long time," the gravestone maker
said, chipping away at a chunk of a local rock called devar. "I've
become an old man hearing about peace over and over again. I doubt
I'll live long enough to see it."</LD>
<LD>   A few blocks away, a cemetery devoted to martyrs on the edge of
Srinagar's Idgah fairgrounds has only a few plots left. A sign near
the entrance reads, "Lest we forget, we have given our 'Today' for
'Tomorrow.' "</LD>
<TE>   Mohammed Yaseen, 32, a gravedigger, says Islamic ritual calls for
a body to be washed at home, wrapped in a white shroud and brought to
the graveyard. In the case of shaheed, however, washing isn't
necessary because the body is already considered pure.</TE>
<TE>   "The hardest part are the bodies that arrive without limbs, a head
or the mutilated torsos," he said. "Unfortunately, I've had to become
used to it."</TE>
<TE>   In mid-October, voters here in Jammu and Kashmir state ousted the
entrenched National Conference party. Since then, India has pulled
back some of its troops from its tense border with Pakistan, which
has pledged to do likewise. But Islamic militants continue to call
for independence from India, vowing to keep up a struggle that has
cost 60,000 lives since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Yousef, 32, a local businessman, visits his brother's
grave at least once a week. As he points to a simple Arabic-inscribed
headstone slightly larger than a legal pad, he details his brother's
death nine years ago as though it just happened.</TE>
<TE>   "The army took him in for questioning and shot him in cold blood,"
he said. "We heard reports on the radio one night in early 1993 that
a big, important leader had been killed with lots of weapons in his
possession. It turned out to be my brother. It was all trumped up. He
was never a radical, and he had no weapons. He was just a
businessman."</TE>
<TE>   Most shaheed gravestones have an inscription from the Koran saying
that while mortals may not be able to see martyrs, they remain alive,
said Sheik Shaukat Hussain, a law and Islamic studies professor at
Kashmir University.</TE>
<TE>   The past decade of strife has made death almost routine. But it
has also redoubled popular support for independence, Hussain said,
given how much people have sacrificed.</TE>
<TE>   "We miss [our brother] so much," Yousef said. "How can I ever
support a government that killed my brother and lied about his being
a terrorist? It's just wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Other mourners tell similar stories of injustice, which are
difficult to corroborate. Pervez Imroz, president of Srinagar's Assn.
of Parents of the Disappeared Persons, adds that Indian-held Kashmir
has seen widespread human rights violations at the hands of
government security forces.</TE>
<TE>   But Kumar Rajendra, inspector general with the Kashmir police,
said all allegations of human rights violations are thoroughly
investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the anger and resentment that quickly well up in many
pro-independence Kashmiris suggest how little trust exists in a
region that has been the subject of two wars between India and
Pakistan since 1947.</TE>
<TE>   "My brother is buried here, because this is where martyrs belong,"
said Mohammed Ismael Kaloo, an auto rickshaw driver visiting the
grave of his brother, who he says was shot by state security forces
last year. "We're determined to show the world Kashmir's will to be
free."</TE>
<TE>   Yaseen, the gravedigger, gives an impromptu tour, highlighting
headstones of the most prominent of the graveyard's 1,400 occupants.</TE>
<TE>   "There's Maqbool Bhat, one of the founders of the Kashmiri
independence movement," he said. "We keep a space for him, but he was
hanged in [New Delhi's] Tihar jail and his body never came out."</TE>
<TE>   "And here's Lone," he said, pointing to a large headstone of a
moderate politician who espoused independence through nonviolence. It
reads: Abdul Ghani Lone, Martyred on 21st May 2002 for Espousing the
Cause of the Kashmir Nation. "He was shot just a few hundred [yards]
from here," Yaseen adds.</TE>
<TE>   With most of this graveyard's plots filled, more families are
burying their dead on the outskirts of Srinagar, the summer capital
of Jammu and Kashmir, in one of the several hundred new cemeteries
that have cropped up in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   In a sad commentary on how bad things have become, the gravestone
business is among the few industries doing well these days.</TE>
<TE>   "We're handling tombs mostly for young people," master carver
Maqbool said, adding that 100 young men have been killed in his
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   The price of a headstone has remained relatively constant over the
past decade -- $10 to $12 for a small, flat plaque and up to $750 for
a top-of-the-line tiered memorial. But the huge number of deaths has
caused an explosion in the number of companies and employees.</TE>
<TE>   Carvers say Srinagar now has 50 gravestone companies -- often
little more than a couple of guys crouched next to a roadside rock
pile -- up from five in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Aziz, 50, another master carver, scoffs at claims that the
militant movement is weakening due to the government's
counter-insurgency tactics. "How could it be dying out?" he says,
pointing to a large pile of rock. "Look how many stones I have to do
today."</TE>
<TE>   As a large truck backfires nearby and sitar music blares from a
small radio, Aziz takes a breather. "I hope this ends someday," he
says. "Even if it destroys my business, I'd still hope peace will
come."</TE>

<HD>Leftist Wins Brazilian Presidency</HD>
<DH>Ex-factory employee Lula appeals to poor and working class
as well as business leaders.</DH>

<DL>RIO DE JANEIRO</DL>
<LD>Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a leftist former factory worker and
shoeshine boy, won Brazil's presidential election in a landslide
Sunday, riding a wave of popular discontent with unemployment and
inequality in Latin America's most populous nation.</LD>
<LD>   With 99% of the votes counted, the man known universally here as
Lula was defeating challenger Jose Serra of the ruling center-right
alliance by 61% to 39%.</LD>
<LD>   "The responsibility of governing will be very great," Lula said
late Sunday, claiming victory on a day that also happened to be his
57th birthday. "We will create a country that is more just, a country
of brotherhood and solidarity."</LD>
<TE>   Lula won by promising social reforms for the poor and working
people, including food subsidies; more spending on health and
education; and an increase in the minimum wage. But he also formed
alliances with groups traditionally hostile to his Workers' Party,
including business leaders and evangelical Christians.</TE>
<TE>   Those alliances, and a highly sophisticated media campaign, helped
guarantee him a huge show of support -- more than 50 million votes in
all -- on his fourth attempt at the presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Lula will be the country's first working-class president and is
the first left-wing candidate elected to the position. The victory
for his Workers' Party -- an amalgam of activists that includes
everyone from Marxists to environmentalists -- marks a turn of events
not just for Brazil but for Latin America as a whole, where
militaries and small elites have usually held a tight grip on power.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula told me the victory wasn't just for us but for a whole
generation which fought for democracy in this country," Jose Dirceu,
president of the Workers' Party, said Sunday after the first results
came in. The party helped lead the movement to restore Brazilian
democracy in the 1980s after two decades of dictatorship.</TE>
<TE>   "Now we are already thinking about the future," Dirceu added.</TE>
<TE>   The Workers' Party has said it will push to seek better terms for
Brazilian producers in negotiations with the Bush administration over
the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Lula has said the current
proposals amount to an "annexation" of Brazil by the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One while returning with
President Bush from an economic summit in Mexico, White House
spokesman Ari Fleischer said: "The president congratulates the winner
of the election and looks forward to working productively with
Brazil."</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of people, many carrying red Workers' Party
flags, gathered to celebrate Lula's victory Sunday evening on Avenida
Paulista in the center of Sao Paulo, the industrial core of Brazil
and the place where Lula got his first job as a factory worker in the
1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Many sang over and over the chorus of Lula's ubiquitous campaign
song: "All you have to do is want it, to make it happen tomorrow....
Vote and say, 'Lula, I want Lulaaa!' "</TE>
<TE>   In downtown Rio de Janeiro, thousands gathered in the Cinelandia
square.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a victory that goes even further back than the 20 years
of the party's history, to the long wait for justice in this
country," said Chico Alencar, a congressman-elect from the Workers'
Party.</TE>
<TE>   Before Lula, Brazil's last leftist leader was Joao Goulart, a vice
president who assumed power in 1961 after the centrist president
resigned. Goulart served 2 1/2 years before being deposed by a
right-wing military coup.</TE>
<TE>   Lula will take the oath of office Jan. 1 in Brasilia, the nation's
capital. He will take charge of a country of 174 million people that
has sunk into economic crisis in the last year after nearly eight
years of stability and modest economic growth under outgoing
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who was prohibited from seeking
reelection by term limits.</TE>
<TE>   About 11 million Brazilians are unemployed, and the national
currency, the real, has dropped steeply in value. Investors and
market analysts fear that a Workers' Party government will be forced
to default on Brazil's $230-billion foreign debt to pay for its
ambitious social programs.</TE>
<TE>   In recent days, however, Brazilian markets have rebounded as
financial leaders here and abroad have come to accept the idea of a
Lula presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a great deal of weeping and gnashing of teeth and
jumping up and down ... about what would happen if the Brazilians
decide, in a democratic way, to have a president who believes a
little more in social justice," New York Federal Reserve President
William J. McDonough said Friday. "This country should be given a
chance."</TE>
<TE>   In August, Lula joined the other presidential contenders in an
"emergency" meeting with Cardoso to discuss the country's delicate
financial situation and its negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, Lula suggested, without saying explicitly, that
he would adhere to the strict budgetary restrictions laid down by the
IMF as a condition of its $30-billion bailout.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a Workers' Party government will be very prudent," said
Jairo Nicolau, a political scientist at the Rio de Janeiro University
Research Institute. "They don't really have room to be adventurous.
They are going to have to try and work to overcome a lot of
distrust."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Lula economic advisor Guido Mantega said the new
administration could seek to renegotiate the due date for upcoming
loan payments to the IMF and other international lending agencies.</TE>
<TE>   At home, Lula will face the challenge of trying to meet the
demands of the millions of impoverished Brazilians who helped elect
him.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't win a presidential election in Brazil with more than
60% of the vote without having a massive number of poor people vote
for you," said Adriano Lopes da Gama, a pollster with the Estado de
Minas newspaper in Belo Horizonte. "What poor people in Brazil want
is jobs. And they expect Lula to provide them."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, as it became clear that Lula would coast to
an easy victory over Serra, Workers' Party leaders have tried to
downplay early expectations of a Lula presidency.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to be working with the view that 2003 will be a year
of crisis," Workers' Party President Dirceu said Saturday. Most
likely, he said, the party will not be able to make many changes in
the last budget of Cardoso.</TE>
<TE>   "During the campaign, people became aware that the international
situation is grave," Dirceu said.</TE>
<TE>   In Rio, most voters in Rocinha -- Brazil's largest favela, or slum
-- appeared to be casting their ballots for Lula, saying they
expected his presidency to help ease a variety of problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Lula promised me a raise, and I'm expecting to get it," said
Leila Maria Oliveira, 48, a fare collector on Rio's buses who makes
about $125 a month. "If he doesn't give it to me, I'm going to have
to go to his office and collect it."</TE>
<TE>   Rita da Silva, 61, said she hoped Lula's administration will allow
her to qualify for disability benefits and social security payments
she says have been denied her by the current government. She's forced
to recycle cans and bottles to make ends meet.</TE>
<TE>   "If I didn't, I would go hungry," she said as she stood at a bus
stop, leaning against a pair of crutches. "There isn't anything for
the older people in my community. We are all left to make do on our
own."</TE>
<TE>   Workers' Party officials said last week that they might draw on
public pension funds in an attempt to pay for social programs until
Brazil recovers from its economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   Any attempts by a Lula administration to push through reforms will
be helped by his party's strong showing in congressional elections
earlier this month. The party won 91 seats in the lower house of
Congress, becoming the largest party in that house for the first
time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even with its center-left allies, Lula will be able to
count on the support of no more than  193 members of the house --
well short of a majority.</TE>
<TE>   Even within the Workers' Party movement, there are elements far to
the left, such as the Landless Peasant Movement, which is famous for
takeovers of farmland, especially in central and southern Brazil,
including property belonging to Cardoso.</TE>
<TE>   "If Lula can't contain the radicals like the landless movement, he
runs the risk of chaos," said Helio Jaguaribe, a Rio political
scientist. "A government cannot allow illegality."</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts agree that Lula has sharpened his political skills
in this campaign season and that his powers as a negotiator should
serve him well as leader.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, he managed to persuade a conservative political
leader and industrialist, Jose Alencar, to be his vice presidential
running mate.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after finishing at the top of a six-candidate field in the
first round of voting Oct. 6, Lula convinced the third- and
fourth-place finishers, both center-left candidates, to support him.</TE>
<TE>   Lula is scheduled to meet with Cardoso on Tuesday to discuss the
presidential transition.</TE>
<TE>   In all, about 115 million people cast electronic votes in 400,000
computerized ballot boxes Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Gas Killed 116 Moscow Hostages</HD>
<DH>Undisclosed agent was fatal to captives weakened by ordeal,
Russian officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Daniszewski and David Holley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>The hostages had feared their lives would end in gunfire or the
explosion of suicide bombs by Chechen rebels. Instead, Russian health
officials acknowledged Sunday, 116 of the 118 captives who died at a
theater here succumbed to the effects of a powerful gas that rescuers
pumped into the auditorium through air ducts.</LD>
<LD>   Announcing that the toll in Moscow's 58-hour hostage siege and
rescue had climbed by 28 to 118, the chairman of the City Health
Committee said for the first time that only two victims died from
gunshot wounds.</LD>
<LD>   The rest, he said, perished because of the effects on their
weakened systems of the mysterious, fast-acting gas chosen by Russian
authorities to knock out the Chechen militants before they could
begin executing or blowing up hostages.</LD>
<TE>   Officials so far have refused to identify the gas, but they
compared it Sunday to a surgical general anesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors of the rescue operation spoke of the gas' powerful and
almost instantaneous effect. As hospital discharges began Sunday,
they also expressed gratitude for their rescue mixed with sadness
that so many of their fellow hostages had lost their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Health Committee Chairman Dr. Andrei Seltsovsky appeared to bend
over backward to avoid saying at a sometimes testy news conference
Sunday that anyone had died of gas poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, he argued, the gas exacerbated existing infirmities, such
as heart and lung problems, in a group that spanned all ages and had
been held prisoner for 2 1/2 days under extremely stressful
conditions, with inadequate sleep, food and water.</TE>
<TE>   Seltsovsky added that 646 ex-hostages remained hospitalized, 150
in intensive care and 45 of those in critical condition. An estimated
50 hostage-takers were killed during the rescue.</TE>
<TE>   "So what you're saying is that if we put the gas in here, with
healthy people, everyone would be fine?" one journalist inquired with
skepticism. The physician answered: "I can't say."</TE>
<TE>   As to the nature of the gas, Dr. Yevgeny Yevdokimov, the city's
senior anesthesiologist, called it a narcotic substance "basically
similar to a general anesthetic in surgery. As you increase the dose,
natural bodily dysfunctions occur."</TE>
<TE>   A doctor who treated dozens of hostages, who permitted himself to
be identified only as Valery, told The Times that most of those
killed had died of "exacerbation of their chronic diseases and
hypoxia [lack of oxygen] from overdosing on the gas."</TE>
<TE>   He drew an analogy to a medical patient who goes into surgery and
receives anesthetic without proper monitoring.</TE>
<TE>   "As with medical anesthetics, a dose that exceeds the maximum for
this or that patient causes respiratory depression, low blood
pressure, cardiac depression and finally death," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of an auditorium full of hostages, he said, "it was
impossible to post an anesthesiologist next to every single person in
the room, who would turn the tap off when the dose ... reached its
limit. Hence the dead bodies."</TE>
<TE>   Those who died were in areas where the gas was most concentrated,
or those who were starved and weak or had high blood pressure, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Valery said he recognized that the planners of the operation
faced a dilemma.</TE>
<TE>   "They had to do it in such a way that would not make it possible
for terrorists in one corner of the auditorium to notice that their
comrades in the other corner are falling asleep. The only way to
solve this was to reach a very high concentration of the agent --
which happened to be excessive for some people."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, the use of the gas has become the most controversial
aspect of the rescue operation.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses after the assault on the theater said that when they
first entered the hall where the hostages had been held, the prospect
resembled a room full of corpses. Survivors described the gas as
causing them to lose consciousness almost before they knew what was
happening.</TE>
<TE>   "I noticed that the air began to fill with some very subtle blue
tint. I immediately covered my face with my hands and fell on the
floor," said ex-hostage Anna Guseva, 27. Moments later, she said,
"all the hostages and the terrorists in the auditorium, from what I
could see, were slumped in their chairs or on the floor fast asleep.
The entire hall looked like a huge sleeping room."</TE>
<TE>   "I just started to tremble, almost shake uncontrollably, then took
one breath after another and it was like I floated away into total
darkness," said Anna Artymova, 33. "My last thought was, 'There is an
explosion, and I am being thrown up in the air by its force, but
somehow very slowly, like in a slow-motion video.' "</TE>
<TE>   Later, after being transferred to a hospital, Artymova had
considerable difficulty regaining consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I would never properly wake up again," she said. "My
body and my senses were very dull and wouldn't listen to me. The
doctor asked me my name, and that was the first word I said -- it
must have been the most difficult word in my life."</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in the last 24 hours is the direct result of the
incompetence of our military toxicologists," said Lev Fyodorov,
president of the Union for Chemical Security, a Russian environmental
group, during an interview with the radio station Echo of Moscow. He
said that authorities should have had a better understanding of the
gas before they administered it to so many people of different ages
and with different health risks.</TE>
<TE>   Outrage was also expressed by people who may have lost loved ones,
such as Liana Usvaliyeva, 41, who had not been able to find her
19-year-old daughter, Yevgenia. She said Sunday that it was a bitter
joke that the government's first response after the rescue was to
boast that hostages had been set free thanks to unique Russian
know-how: "They used a kind of know-how that sets hostages free but
kills them anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Another parent, Sergei Sinelnikov, 55, in search of his lost son,
called the rescue operation utterly incompetent. Noting that his son
was reported in perfect health before the raid, he said, "We lost him
in an assault that was carried out in an unprofessional, haphazard
way.... What was the point of using a gas that would kill so many
hostages anyway?"</TE>
<TE>   But among those who survived and their families there was also
gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Rozovsky, a prominent theater director, was unable to contain
his natural joy as a parent when he learned that his daughter had
survived the hostage ordeal. With a beaming smile, he said in an
interview on Russian television that "after all, it was a happy
ending."</TE>
<TE>   Quickly realizing his blunder, Rozovsky added that, sadly, many
other people had died.</TE>
<TE>   Released hostage Alexandra Smyk, 22, said that in the early stages
of the ordeal, she was terrified that special forces would assault
the theater but that by the end she had decided that there was no
other way.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted something to start moving, to start happening. And it
did," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was the right decision. They wouldn't have let us free
anyway, no matter what they said."</TE>

<HD>Suicide Bomber Kills 3 Israelis in West Bank</HD>
<DH>People at the Ariel settlement grappled with the attacker
before his device went off, thus minimizing casualties, a medic and
guard say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARIEL, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Everyone who saw him, it seemed, knew what the young Palestinian in
telltale bulky garb intended to do as he walked through the gates of
the West Bank's second-largest Jewish settlement Sunday morning: the
woman who screamed, "Suicide bomber!"; the gas station attendant who
grabbed for him; the Israeli soldiers who rushed to tackle him.</LD>
<LD>   But despite all that, the man's bomb went off, killing three
Israelis along with their assailant and injuring 20 others. The army
later confirmed that all three of the Israeli dead and 10 of the
injured were soldiers, including two who were severely wounded.</LD>
<LD>   The Palestinian militant group Hamas claimed responsibility for
the attack and said the bomber was a 22-year-old man from the
northern West Bank city of Nablus. Initially, another Palestinian
group, the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, said it had dispatched the
bomber, but it later withdrew its claim.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's attack, the second deadly suicide bombing in this region
in a week, came six days after 14 passengers died in a bus
conflagration in northern Israel. It was also the second such strike
in seven months at the same spot: the entrance to Ariel, a sprawling
settlement of about 20,000 inhabitants set amid rocky terraced hills
and olive groves 20 miles north of Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Large Jewish settlements like this one have the look of a
prosperous American suburb, with neat red-roofed homes, careful
landscaping and mini-malls. At Ariel's entrance is a gas station, its
overhang gaily striped in red, blue and yellow.</TE>
<TE>   On Sundays, the adjoining cafeteria, just off one of the West
Bank's main highways, is usually bustling, full of Israeli soldiers
on their way back to base after their weekend leaves. Sunday is the
start of the workweek in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses' accounts of what happened in the chaotic moments after
the bomber was spotted about 11:30 a.m. differed in some details, but
all agreed on key points: that soldiers rushed the man; that the gas
station attendant and another man seized him and shouted that he was
wearing an explosives-laden belt; that shots were fired, either by
soldiers or other onlookers, striking the assailant; and that the
bomb went off almost immediately after that, as he was pinned on the
ground by several soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw three soldiers sitting on someone, holding his arms and
legs," said Israel Werner, a 37-year-old security guard at a nearby
supermarket who said he left Hollywood 16 years ago and emigrated to
Israel. "I was [30 feet] away when all of a sudden there were two
gunshots, and then the explosion.... I saw body parts flying in the
air, and a ball of fire."</TE>
<TE>   The army said it was investigating whether shots fired at the
bomber had detonated the device or whether the bomber had managed to
set it off himself. He carried about 12 pounds of explosives strapped
around his waist, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Medics Arrive</TE>
<TE>   The settlement has a sophisticated medical clinic, and paramedics
were on the scene almost immediately. Yiftach Levy, a paramedic who
was in the clinic's intensive care unit, said he arrived less than a
minute after the blast.</TE>
<TE>   "We could see the injured scattered all around," he said. The
first person he tried to treat, a soldier with gaping chest and
abdominal wounds, died as he was being worked on, he said. The gas
station employee who had grappled with the bomber was seriously
injured but was still alive hours later after surgery, doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the attack could have been much worse.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lucky it was in the open air," Levy said. Bomb blasts in
enclosed places typically claim a greater toll, as an explosion's
shock wave is magnified and victims suffer massive internal injuries
as a result.</TE>
<TE>   The attacker was about 30 yards from the station's gas pumps when
the bomb detonated -- "If he had gotten to there, the whole place
would have blown up," said Werner, the security guard.</TE>
<TE>   Hours after the attack, Israeli soldiers shot and killed two
Palestinian gunmen in Nablus, six miles to the northeast. The army
said the soldiers were trying to arrest the men when they were fired
on and fired back, but Palestinians described the two deaths as
assassinations.</TE>
<TE>   Nablus is under the control of the Israeli military, but curfews
on its Palestinian population have been lifted intermittently. The
curfew was eased Sunday morning so residents could shop for food, the
army said.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Shot Dead</TE>
<TE>   Another Palestinian man -- described by the army as a gunman,
though Palestinians said he was unarmed -- was shot dead in the
northern West Bank city of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops took over Jenin early Friday, moving in with
hundreds of troops and dozens of armored vehicles, after saying they
had determined that a cell of the radical group Islamic Jihad
operating there had been responsible for Tuesday's bus bombing
outside the northern Israeli town of Hadera.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the latest violence, a political dispute over funding for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip has been brewing
in the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. The center-left
Labor Party, a partner in his coalition, has said it will vote
against next year's budget because it wants money that is earmarked
for settlements to be devoted to welfare spending instead.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary parliamentary vote on the budget has been set for
Wednesday, and the Labor ministers could defy Sharon and then either
be dismissed by him or resign.</TE>
<TE>   If Sharon's coalition fell apart, elections would be called within
90 days.</TE>
<TE>   However, shows of brinkmanship are common in Israeli politics, and
a compromise could be struck before events come to that.</TE>

<HD>Bitter Tears Fall for Lost Hostages</HD>
<DH>Family members of the missing lose hope and fill with anger
over the rescue and 'coverup.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Dixon and John Daniszewski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>They came looking for their loved ones with photographs in their
hands and tears in their eyes.</LD>
<LD>   For many people who had not found their relatives after commandos
stormed the House of Culture theater in Moscow early the day before,
Sunday was cold, sodden and hopeless.</LD>
<LD>   They had been summoned to a "vigil center" set up in a school,
where they anxiously scanned lists put up on a wall.</LD>
<TE>   But the lists contained only 568 names, while Moscow health
authorities said 646 people were hospitalized.</TE>
<TE>   Those who could not find the names they were looking for were
assuming the worst, many bitterly blaming the authorities for a
rescue operation they saw as cruelly botched.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was anxious, quiet, sorrowful. One woman clutched an old
photograph of her mother in a bathing costume, standing in the surf
at a seaside resort. Others held faded military photos of men in
uniform. Some brought personal documents, and others had simply
scrawled out descriptions of their loved ones on note paper.</TE>
<TE>   Pavel Sinelnikov, 21, had just graduated from medical school.
Survivors who knew him described him giving first aid to hostages in
the theater during the siege.</TE>
<TE>   His father's heart nearly burst with pride at the account friends
gave of his son acting like a professional amid the terror.</TE>
<TE>   "My eyes welled with tears when I pictured Pasha walking among
bearded and masked terrorists and doing his job," said Sergei
Sinelnikov, 55, a burly man with salt and pepper hair who had not
found Pavel by Sunday. "He behaved like a real man and did not forget
about his professional duties even in such a horrible situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very bad feeling about it. In fact, I am pretty sure now
that we have lost our son forever," said Sinelnikov, who was
unshaven, with red-ringed eyes, and looked exhausted.</TE>
<TE>   His face collapsed, and tears flowed as he struggled to contain
his fear and grief.</TE>
<TE>   "We did not lose hope until today," he said. Like many relatives,
he was furious at what he saw as lies or evasions by the authorities
about the gas used in the storming and the apparent attempt to cover
up what he saw as a bungled undertaking.</TE>
<TE>   "The authorities' main concern is to hide and cover up all
mistakes that were made during the storming operation," he said,
angrily criticizing the use of a gas that apparently killed so many
hostages.</TE>
<TE>   At night, he and his wife cannot sleep, Sinelnikov said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just sit down on the edge of the bed, hold Pasha's photo in
our hands, stroke it and silently cry," he said, weeping.</TE>
<TE>   "And the authorities do not see the death of my son as a tragedy.
To them, it is only collateral damage. It is twice as horrible to
realize that Pavel was killed in downtown, in peacetime, while
watching a musical."</TE>
<TE>   Sinelnikov's anger and frustration reflected the feelings of many
others at the vigil center.</TE>
<TE>   Liana Usvaliyeva, 41, with mournful circles under her eyes, had
not found her 19-year-old daughter, Yevgenia, known as Zhenya.</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid that the most horrible thing could have happened and
Zhenya is dead. I do not know where to turn now and whom to ask to
help me find my daughter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The authorities lie to us about everything. First they lied to us
that they would not storm the theater, then they lied about the
negotiations, and now they are lying about the gas and the number of
victims. So, how can we trust them?</TE>
<TE>   "What was the point in the storming operation if the hostages are
free but they continue to die in packs after they used this strange
gas on them?</TE>
<TE>   "They call the operation unique and successful. They say that they
used some original Russian know-how. But it all sounds like a very
bad joke. It only corroborates the popular belief that everything is
screwed up in Russia," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Although relatives of those missing saw the rescue operation as a
failure, many other Russians felt there was no alternative but to
storm the theater and use an incapacitating agent to prevent
terrorists from triggering explosions that could have killed many
more people.</TE>
<TE>   Leonid Roshal, a pediatrician who helped deliver water and
medicine to the hostages and give first aid, said that in hostage
release operations, 20% are often sacrificed to save 80%.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always a moral problem in defining the maximum
acceptable number of victims in any forcible operation beyond which
the operation stops being a rescue and turns into slaughter," Roshal
said. "In any case, the mothers of those who died will never be able
to accept the deaths of their children, even if this death was
justified by the fact that hundreds of people lived."</TE>

<HD>Earning Degrees in Survival</HD>
<DH>Iraq's once-prized educational system has crumbled, leaving
generations of children unschooled and no one to rebuild a civil
society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Slackman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Martabha Saleem earns $4 to $5 a week peddling packs of cigarettes,
more than a teacher, doctor or engineer gets in a month. The
14-year-old attends school, but the most important lesson he says he
has learned while hawking goods up and down the streets of central
Baghdad is that no amount of studying will help him, or his family,
survive.</LD>
<LD>   Survival is a lesson that Sheda Ibrahim, 15, is busy learning.
Unable to attend classes for two years, she spends her time sitting
in front of a television or helping her aunt in the kitchen. She says
she can read but blushes and slams a book shut when asked to try.</LD>
<LD>   She'd like to go to class, but her widowed mother insists that
school was, is and will be impossible.</LD>
<TE>   "I forced my daughter to leave school because of a shortage of
money," said Iftekhar Ibrahim, 42. Classes are free, but the family
cannot afford the paper, pencils and books. "I don't have enough
money to spend," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The outlook for Iraq, whether or not the U.S. makes good on its
announced policy of getting rid of President Saddam Hussein, is grim.
Much of the reason is the collapse of the educational system. Many
Iraqis, especially youngsters like Martabha and Sheda, have already
given up hope for a decent life and now are abandoning any dreams for
the future as well.</TE>
<TE>   "There is the full possibility that Iraq could break down as a
state," said Wamidh Nadhmi, a political science professor at Baghdad
University, adding that the deterioration of education has had a
"profound effect" on society. "The regime may stay on, but there will
be no longer such a thing as Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq was once a nation that prided itself on its schools. Parents
from around the Arab world, and beyond, used to send their children
here to study in the universities. But those days are well in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two years of war and international sanctions have turned
Iraq into a nation of have-nots headed by an entrenched regime that
stands above the day-to-day reality of how its citizens are forced to
live. The government can no longer guarantee electricity, running
water or health care, and so its citizens look to family, faith and
their tribes for solace and security.</TE>
<TE>   Individually, each shortfall hurts. But collectively they have
doomed the education system, widely viewed as the foundation of any
society. One in four children do not go to school and those who do
receive less than four hours of instruction a day. Curricula haven't
changed in 20 years. Instructors are hard to find, and those who are
in the classrooms employ methods abandoned by the West decades ago,
such as learning by rote.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's run-down infrastructure and a lack of funds to repair
it have conspired to make it nearly impossible for the school system
to function. Impoverished families rely on their children to beg and
peddle just so they can eat. Malfunctioning sewers leave many schools
without functioning toilets, so children must run home in the middle
of class to use the bathroom. Intermittent electricity means studying
in the dark. No heat means cold classrooms in winter. Limited cash
means too few school buildings, too few teachers, too few textbooks,
too few pencils.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been generations of uneducated or under-educated
children. Less than 10% of eligible children are enrolled in
kindergarten. More than 31% of girls are not attending primary
school, and dropout rates for intermediate and preparatory levels
have increased to as high as 38% in some grades. Literacy has
plummeted, especially among women, from 87% in 1985 to 45% in 1995,
the most recent year anyone has been able to keep statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "The education is so poor here, parents feel what is the point,"
said Carel de Rooy, regional representative of UNICEF, which is
renovating some schools and supplying chairs and desks to others. "A
taxi driver can make more than an engineer."</TE>
<TE>   The sanctions, which deny Iraq access to cash and limit its
ability to import supplies, have played a large role in the
deterioration of education, but they are not the only culprit. The
besieged regime has not made education a priority, so it is not
building schools. Experts said the nation needs 5,000 new schools
just to meet its current demand. Because of the shortfall of educated
professionals, the future is also a question mark. Gone are the
specialists who might someday be able to rebuild the nation -- not
only the infrastructure, but civil society itself.</TE>
<TE>   "It will take over two generations just to get the country back to
where it was in the '80s," said De Rooy. "It can take two, three,
four years just to sort it out if we really focus on it. By the time
you graduate the first professional, it will be 15 years."</TE>
<TE>   There are fancy cars and wealthy neighborhoods in Baghdad, but the
vast majority of the people, even those with decent jobs, are in debt
and scraping to get by. Many streets are filled with men, women and
children in filthy, worn clothing, tired expressions and stooped
shoulders. They survive on government handouts of food but must
scrounge additional money to buy meat and vegetables, which the
authorities do not supply.</TE>
<TE>   Reports by UNICEF speak of physical and psychological suffering
among children, usually undernourished and often depressed. But the
impact of that deprivation is on display at the used-book market on
Al Mutanabi Street. It is in one of the oldest parts of the city on a
narrow street bordered by once elegant buildings, now turned to
squalor. Peddlers line the pavement with books, trying to sell
collections taken from family shelves to help pay for rent and food.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Rahman Ziad, 12, is a fourth grader. In fact, he has been in
fourth grade for three years because of poor grades.</TE>
<TE>   The boy's clothing is tattered, and he spends his one day off a
week trying to sell sodas, pushing a battered wooden cart through a
crowded downtown market. He has to do it because his father is
unemployed, he said, and spends his days sitting idly at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be an engineer someday," Abdul Rahman said as he pushed
his cart off into the thick crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Hossein, 15, is helping his father sell books. The
teenager has failed sixth grade twice because the school did not have
enough textbooks, he said. His school in the Abu Disheer neighborhood
of Baghdad has no running water or heat. But at least he can read.</TE>
<TE>   Shama Ahmed is 10 years old and can't read or write. She walks up
and down through the crowd, trying to sell single sticks of incense.
She is working the market alone because her parents are at home with
her brothers and sister.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't been to school ever," she said, running away because
she apparently was afraid a government worker would take her to a
"corrective home" for boys and girls.</TE>
<TE>   The hopelessness starts with the children and, by the time they
are teenagers and in the job market, it gets worse.</TE>
<TE>   Adel Khudair, 19, never had time to learn. He is too busy loading
sacks of flour into people's carts at a food distribution center in a
run-down neighborhood. He dropped out of school in second grade to
help support his nine brothers and sisters. His mother doesn't work,
and he says his father earns $45 a month picking dates.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is difficult," he said. "It's better to work"</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, in a more middle-class neighborhood, Ahmed Abdu
Sattar, 14, is sitting alone in a one-room shop at the end of a small
alley. He is busy hand-stitching pillows, and his fingers work the
needle with speed and precision. He has been doing this for two
years, since dropping out of school to help his family survive. He
makes the equivalent of 50 cents a day for nine and a half hours and
says proudly that he has ambitions for the future.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like to do just pillows," he said. "I want to make
carpets and shades some day, too."</TE>
<TE>   Even the children who stay in school find their opportunities
limited by the decayed conditions, crowded classrooms and lack of
adequate teachers. Al Mutanabi Elementary School is one of the better
facilities in Baghdad. It runs two shifts a day, from 8 a.m. to noon
and 12:30 to 4 p.m. It has windows and an outhouse. There are no
desks for teachers. The playground is busted-up concrete and two
basketball stands without hoops. And the school does not have enough
teachers for its 627 enrolled students.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a lot of vacancies because people don't like to depend on
government salaries of $4 to $5 a month," said the school
headmistress, Hanaa Farhan. The problems extend into the university
system as well, said Nadhmi, the political science professor. He said
he used to lecture undergraduate classes but gave it up because his
students stopped paying attention. He said they showed up in class
exhausted because they could not afford a taxi or bus and had to walk
miles to get there. Dormitories were closed or in such deplorable
condition that students were forced to live three or four to a room
in cheap motels.</TE>
<TE>   His students were unapologetic about their classroom attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "They said to me, 'Even if we improve our attention, what
future do we have with a degree in political science?' " he recalled
recently. "I was very sad. To sell cigarettes is more profitable than
a degree."</TE>

<TE>   In the Netherlands, the storm disrupted train and highway traffic
and caused major delays at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The government of Belgium urged people to stay inside. Part of the
roof of Antwerp's 10,000-seat Sports Palace was blown off, as were
chimneys and tiles on countless homes around the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The damage is enormous," Antwerp Mayor Leona Detiege said.</TE>
<TE>   In Germany, winds reached 62 mph. A couple died when a tree fell
on their car near Frankfurt. A 39-year-old Dutch woman was killed in
Bocholt, near the Netherlands border, when a tree fell on her
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   In France, two people died when a tree fell on their car north of
Paris. Another was crushed by a collapsed roof in Caumont.</TE>

<HD>For Halo Faithful, Series Victory Is Just the Icing on

<LD>"I didn't care nothing about the Series. Win or lose, I would have
been satisfied."</LD>
<LD>   Pop Fisher, long-suffering manager, in film adaptation of "The
Natural"</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   We didn't care nothing about the Series.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was glorious to send home the big-and-bad Giants, to
uphold Southern California's honor, to bring a world championship
trophy to Anaheim and to watch street celebrations erupt in the
quietest of Orange County cul-de-sacs.</TE>
<TE>   But while rooting as hard as we could for the Angels this weekend,
longtime fans had already been celebrating. We wanted this World
Series, the first we ever played in. But we didn't need it.</TE>
<TE>   It's bad manners to worry about death when you've cheated it
longer than you ever thought possible.</TE>
<TE>   Take Bruce Gevirtzman. When he got married five years ago, he and
his wife wrote their wills on a home computer. The La Mirada High
School English teacher was particularly specific on the subject of
his cremated remains.</TE>
<TE>   His beloved Angels were so inept, so seemingly cursed whenever
they approached the playoffs, that he would take no chances. His
ashes "should be scattered around home plate at Angels stadium, so
that one day I can see a World Series."</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, Gevirtzman -- still very much alive at 53, with a
young child and a new baby on the way -- sat in Edison Field watching
the Angels play. At times, the emotions and nerves were too much and
he left his seat for the concourse, preferring to judge the game's
progress by the noise of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Angels had won Game 2, their first Series victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm good, I'm happy. Why do I need anything more?" he said. "The
mantra of every Angel fan I've ever known has been: Let's get to that
World Series once. Whether we win it, that doesn't matter."</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning of the World Series, I've heard Angel fans say
versions of the same thing. "Getting here is the accomplishment,"
said Garrison Draper, 22, in the Edison Field parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Jay Boyarsky, an Angel fan who works as a deputy district attorney
for Santa Clara County, stood in front of Pac Bell Park last week and
pitied the Giant fans. "They're not having as good a time because
they feel they have to win this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   It feels greedy to demand something that goes beyond even
fictional frames of reference. Some Angel fans last week were quoting
a line from the film "The Natural," in which long-suffering manager
Pop Fisher -- who, like the Angels, had never reached the World
Series -- declares that all he ever wanted was to win the National
League pennant. A movie perhaps dearer to Angel fans, the 1994
picture "Angels in the Outfield," climaxes with the team winning the
American League West, not the Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to break bread with Gene Autry," says former Anaheim City
Councilman Irv Pickler, who attended every World Series game. The
longtime Angels owner, he says, "always talked about getting to the
World Series some day. I don't recall him ever saying anything about
winning it."</TE>
<TE>   To their credit, the Angels, while still pining for a Series
title, recognized this. Word leaked out last week that Disney had
planned a postseason victory rally for the team, with or without a
Series victory. In the Edison Field parking lot, the players will be
toasted, deservedly, as the best team in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, they clinched that honor three weeks ago, surpassing
all expectations with a record 99 victories in the regular season and
an upset of the Yankees in the playoffs' first round. In interviews,
the players themselves have described having fun as their first
priority in this World Series. Most did not expect to be here.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the deliciousness of surprise and the realization of
long-standing dreams, I suspect there's one more reason for the
widespread joy created by this year's Angels.</TE>
<TE>   This is the first authentic Southern California team -- born and
raised and still living here -- to amount to anything.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, the Dodgers -- even the Raiders when they were here --
all won, but each brought a history and personality from somewhere
else. Those teams may be beloved and beautiful but they will always
be imports, the sports versions of the otherworldly pretty people you
see on the tonier side of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   These Angels, with three big hitters from the Valley and a top
reliever from Riverside, resemble the unwashed rest of us, the people
for whom Southern California is and always will be home.</TE>
<TE>   They are not always pleasing to the eye. They often go unnoticed,
25 more people on the freeways. But they work hard and play hard.
They are aggressive as folks in a giant metropolis must be, but they
know that good manners and generous spirits are signs of strength,
not weakness. They respect opponents and don't talk trash. After so
many years of frustration, these Angels not only made us fans
celebrate them, they made us believe in ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when we're down six runs, these guys taught us we can always
come back," fan Thomas Byrd told me last week. "What better lesson is
there than that?"</TE>
<TE>   When heckled by Giant rooters this week, Angel fans smiled rather
than lashing out. Those smiles reflected the confidence of the
faithful: Nothing, not even a Series loss, could throw their stride
-- because their place in heaven had already been assured.</TE>
<TE>   In truth it was happiness, not thunder sticks, that made Angel
playoff crowds so buoyant. They didn't need to be ahead to be loud.
They didn't need to look cool. Fans were simply ecstatic to be there,
to see the team playing in the Series, to wear red and wave the
monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowds in Anaheim are the best and most exhilarating I've
ever seen," says Stan Spero, the only surviving member of the
six-executive team that worked under Autry and helped launch the
Angels in 1961. "There's a personal connection between fans and the
team. We're all speaking the same language."</TE>
<TE>   Many Angel fans pulled for the World Series to go seven games,
giving them as many opportunities to see the 2002 team as possible.</TE>
<TE>   For the same reason, we fans have been dreading this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Even with a victory, the World Series of our dreams is over.</TE>

<HD>Dynamics Changing in Battle for Desert</HD>
<DH>Conservationists lose ground as the Bush administration
seeks to satisfy users who say they've been locked out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Cart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHUCKWALLA BENCH, Calif.</DL>
<LD>The shallow indent of the desert wash appears to shimmer in the
cauterizing heat. Along its sandy banks, a thicket of gangly
ironwoods, palo verde and smoke trees offer up intermittent shade.
Nothing moves or makes a sound under the relentless sun save the
steady thrumming of cicadas.</LD>
<LD>   Here, just south of Desert Center along the desolate Bradshaw
Trail, it's still too hot for hikers, too soon for snowbirds, and the
terrain is not challenging enough for dune buggy drivers. There's
nothing and no one, clear to the horizon.</LD>
<LD>   The emptiness is misleading. Twenty-six years ago the battle for
the California desert was joined, and, today, it rages anew. A White
House sympathetic to developers, mining companies, ranchers, the
military and motorized recreation is drawing a bead on the
conservation policies of the last decade.</LD>
<TE>   Once the state's outback, the desert is now the most accessible
playground for many of California's fast growing interior
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The Mojave and Sonoran deserts sprawl across San Bernardino,
Riverside and Imperial counties and define the southern part of the
state to the borders with Arizona and Mexico. The region is a
pastiche of state, federal, military and private land, beloved by
hunters, hikers, campers, rock hounds, off-road vehicle enthusiasts
and winter visitors parked for months in recreational vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Congress gave special protection to much of the state's
25 million acres of Mo- jave and Sonoran deserts -- nearly one
quarter of California -- and declared the area "extremely fragile,
easily scarred and slowly healed." A new national park was created in
the eastern Mojave. Death Valley and Joshua Tree were elevated from
national monument to national park status and their boundaries
expanded.</TE>
<TE>   Now, federal land managers -- at the behest of the Bush
administration -- are striving to accommodate groups who say they
have been locked out of the desert by the policies of the previous
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Building Where Barren</TE>
<TE>   At least some of those interests are having better luck. In
eastern Imperial County, the U.S. Department of the Interior reversed
a previous decision and may give permission to a Nevada mining
company to gouge a 900-foot-long open pit gold mine on land sacred to
members of the Quechan Indian tribe. The mine claim had been the
first ever to be denied by the Interior Department, which argued that
the operation would do "undue degradation" to the tribe's cultural
and religious sites.</TE>
<TE>   Next door to Joshua Tree National Park, Ontario-based Kaiser
Ventures LLC is poised to begin operating a landfill designed to
daily handle thousands of tons of trash from Los Angeles. The trash
will arrive on a train hauling it across the desert.</TE>
<TE>   Joshua Tree officials have strenuously objected, arguing that an
industrial operation with its noise, odors and blowing trash has no
place next to a national park. Furthermore, they are concerned that
birds of prey drawn to the dump will end up feasting on park
wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Land Management is proposing to reduce protected
areas for the threatened desert tortoise by 25%, opening up thousands
of acres to allow new roads and mining claims.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Defense is seeking to exempt the Navy's
Chocolate Mountain gunnery range from environmental laws. An
exemption would mean that the military would no longer have to
consult with wildlife management agencies about the impact of aerial
bombing on rare plants, big horn sheep and wild burros.</TE>
<TE>   The BLM still hasn't completed a 26-year-old order to identify and
map desert roads and trails. With new roads being blazed in the
desert every year, environmentalists say that by the time the BLM
identifies and designates legal routes, hundreds of unsuitable tracks
across fragile terrain will be included in the official count.</TE>
<TE>   Conservation groups are especially concerned about the impact on
desert washes and dry stream beds, more of which will be open to
off-road vehicles under BLM plans.</TE>
<TE>   "Desert washes are the vessel of biodiversity -- it's where things
happen in the desert," said Steve Hartman, a representative of the
California Native Plant Society who served on a BLM advisory council.
"Not every wash and not every watershed should be open to vehicles.
We need to protect some of them."</TE>
<TE>   In what may be the most hotly contested policy reversal, the BLM
has called for opening up 50,000 additional acres of the Algodones
Dunes to off-road vehicles. The huge dune field in Imperial County
harbors dozens of plant and animal species found nowhere else. The
Clinton administration closed the 50,000 acres. Reopening it would
remove protection for all but a small slice of dunes that is
designated wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Activists on all sides claim this contested land is at a critical
crossroads. The direction taken now, they say, will require the
courts to untangle and will take generations to reverse.</TE>
<TE>   For environmentalists who spent years campaigning for protections,
the policies emerging under the Bush administration represent a giant
step backward.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the template for the future of the desert, and it's a bad
template," said Elden Hughes, the Sierra Club's veteran desert
expert. "We see a weakening of environmental laws, at the least. If
it's a model for the West, then we are in serious trouble."</TE>
<TE>   The Bureau of Land Management is preparing six plans that will lay
down a blueprint for how the 11 million acres it controls in the
desert will be managed. Each of the plans addresses a different piece
of the desert.</TE>
<TE>   The plans are the result of eight years of effort to accommodate
disparate, highly polarized groups. Dick Crowe, the BLM manager who
is in charge of developing one of the plans, believes that the
process is giving all sides a say. But the veteran manager suspects
the work will likely end up where previous desert plans have -- in
the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "They are all going to get shellacked by lawsuits -- from all
sides," Crowe said, looking out at the sun-baked wash and sighing.</TE>
<TE>   During President Clinton's two terms, ranchers, miners and
recreationists believed environmentalists enjoyed privileged access
to the Oval Office.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the roles are reversed, and it's the environmental
community's turn to complain about special interest groups gaining an
audience with the administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The BLM's mission is multiuse, but that doesn't mean you have to
have every single use on every single acre," said Daniel Patterson, a
desert ecologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, which says
it will take the agency to court over the plans. "Their ideology is:
We're going to continue to run the desert as an off-road vehicle
destination."</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists, recreationists, and other users have always been
critical of the multiple-use doctrine that has guided BLM decision
making. Multiple use may be the most democratic solution to appeasing
conflicting interests. But the principle clashes with
environmentalists' vision of public land as a refuge for rare and
fragile wildlife, recreational users' desire to fully explore the
landscape aboard a vehicle, and miners' and ranchers' need to use the
land free from restrictive rules.</TE>
<TE>   Fierce Competition</TE>
<TE>   Sixteen groups have filed protests against the BLM's new desert
strategy, even before four of the agency's six plans have been made
public.</TE>
<TE>   Several groups maintain that more than 100 vulnerable species of
plants and animals will be harmed by the proposals. In particular,
environmentalists fear that the plans will jeopardize the habitat of
the imperiled California desert tortoise, whose numbers have declined
because of disease and intrusions into its habitat.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the desert already carries the scars of man's presence. In
the Mecca Hills Wilderness Area, atop the San Andreas Fault, eons of
tectonic activity have produced a series of low-slung undulating
mountains. Although these mountains were designated wilderness areas,
they are crosshatched with mining roads.</TE>
<TE>   Crowe said as long as the BLM's mandate is to promote multiple
use, people -- and animals -- are going to have to learn to get
along.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a vision, that we have enough land here to take care of
all of these issues. It's an enormous, enormous place. I try to tell
people that there's enough room for critters and people. I hope there
is."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, events have outdistanced the government's ability to referee
competing uses.</TE>
<TE>   In the eight years since Congress called for special handling of
the California desert, dozens of imperiled species have been
identified, but little has been done to protect them.</TE>
<TE>   Development has rushed to the edge of the desert and visitors have
followed, flocking to casinos and resorts strung along Interstate 10
through the Coachella Valley. In the Imperial Sand Dunes alone, a
quarter of a million off-road enthusiasts gather on some weekends.</TE>
<TE>   But even though their access in the dunes is doubled, off-road
groups say the new plan is still too restrictive.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Denner, president of the Off Road Business Assn., a San
Diego-based trade group, calls for opening the 27,000-acre section of
the dunes set aside as wilderness, saying the vehicles do little harm
to the area.</TE>
<TE>   Off-road advocates also point to the proposed closure of two small
off-road recreation areas elsewhere in the desert that the BLM said
were little-used.</TE>
<TE>   "We are heading for disaster, [environmentalists] want to close
the entire California desert," Denner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The BLM is hellbent on closing lands -- it's the easiest course
for them to take," he said. "All of this is going to court. We won't
allow it."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates on all sides are grimly determined. Their wildly
different views share only one common theme: litigation. Land
managers say lawsuits create inertia, prevent them from doing their
jobs and quickly consume budgets.</TE>
<TE>   That may be precisely the goal for many activists.</TE>
<TE>   "What these plans say is that future land management decisions are
going to be removed from the hands of the BLM and put into the hands
of federal judges," Patterson said. It's sad, but that's where we're
headed. If these two plans are any indication of what's to come,
there will be no peace."</TE>

<HD>Lone Challenger Faces 3 Council Incumbents</HD>
<DH>Traffic and affordable housing are among top issues in
crisis-free Camarillo, which is enjoying a period of economic health.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With a robust local economy, no major crisis on the horizon and just
one candidate challenging them, Camarillo City Council members are
hoping for easy reelection Nov. 5.</LD>
<LD>   Charlotte Craven, a 16-year council veteran, said she has run
against as many as 12 opponents in the past and hopes the lack of
contenders this year indicates public support for the council.</LD>
<LD>   "But I'm still running a campaign," she said. "I'm not taking any
chances."</LD>
<TE>   Council members Mike Morgan and Jan McDonald are also seeking new
terms but running scaled-back campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   The incumbents are challenged only by Carlos Cruz, 62, a tailor
and retired California Highway Patrol officer.</TE>
<TE>   With its popular premium outlet stores, malls and movie theaters,
Camarillo sales tax revenue has surged and the city's reserves have
swelled to $57 million, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   That is a far cry from the late 1980s, when Camarillo's
$19-million budget was $4 million in the red. The city lost $25
million in bond investments and its employee pension fund was empty.</TE>
<TE>   The outlet stores helped Camarillo climb out of its fiscal hole.
Last year, the city posted retail sales of more than $336 million,
about $8.5 million in net revenue to the city, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   But Camarillo still faces major challenges. Affordable housing is
in short supply, traffic is increasing and the opening of Ventura
County's first four-year public university has major implications.
And a proposed library has raised concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, who lost in his first council run two years ago, concedes
this will be another uphill battle but says "sometimes an outsider
can win."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz said affordable housing is the most critical issue facing the
community. "The cost of housing has quadrupled over the years," he
said. "Camarillo has made a lot of effort to bring business here, but
there is no place for people who work in those businesses to live."</TE>
<TE>   The median home price in Ventura County has steadily risen to
$334,000. Median prices in Camarillo range from $350,000 in the
western half of the city to $380,000 in the newer eastern half.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me that more work should be done with [the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development] to get funds for
high-density building," Cruz said. "We should increase some
apartments from two to three stories."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz, who runs Cee's K.L.C. Tailoring from his home, moved to
Camarillo in 1980 and retired from the CHP five years later. He is
married and has a 14-year-old son at Camarillo High School and a
12-year-old daughter at Hillcrest Christian School in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz said the city needs a new library. Camarillo has filed for a
state grant to fund a larger library, but Cruz believes there is no
strategy to pay for the project if the grant falls through.</TE>
<TE>   Craven, 58, said a new library has been in the works for at least
14 years. The cost is estimated at $20 million and the grant would
cover 80%, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't get the grant we will have to sit down and look at
our checkbook or go ask the voters," Craven said. "We may need to ask
them to raise property taxes about $6 a year for the library."</TE>
<TE>   She said the Cal State Channel Islands campus, about three miles
outside of town, will increase traffic and bring thousands of
students to the Camarillo area. Over the next five years, both Lewis
and Pleasant Valley roads will be widened and bike paths added to
ease congestion to and from the campus.</TE>
<TE>   Craven said many students will want to live off campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help provide housing while maintaining the integrity
of the neighborhoods," she said</TE>
<TE>   She also advocates building more affordable housing.</TE>
<TE>   "If the city has to buy land, then we should buy land," Craven
said. "Maybe we can work with a developer or a nonprofit group."</TE>
<TE>   McDonald, 52, Camarillo's mayor, is completing her first term on
the council. She said the city is in great shape.</TE>
<TE>   "The new college will present challenges but we see the benefits
as far greater than the challenges," she said. "Traffic is the No. 1
challenge, but we have projects that will hopefully alleviate that."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan, 55, has been on the council for 22 years and lost two bids
for county supervisor. He is pleased with the city's cash reserves,
but said they could be drained easily on a highway project or other
unforeseen need.</TE>
<TE>   He believes the total effect of the university won't be felt for a
few years. Many students will commute from nearby cities, he said,
alleviating pressure on local housing.</TE>
<TE>   "They are building more than 900 dormitory [rooms] out there on
campus," he said. "That will be a stopgap for a while. We will also
have to meet the demand for housing and make it less intrusive on the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Morgan hopes to continue the revitalization of Old Town Camarillo
-- the city's traditional downtown -- and turn the defunct Fire
Station 54 on Ventura Boulevard into a cafe. The former probation
officer also wants to keep Camarillo among the safest cities in the
county.</TE>
<TE>   "We have citizen patrols, over 50 Neighborhood Watch programs,
police on bikes, police on motorcycles and police in the school
system," he said. "All this has made us a safe and secure community.
We want to keep that going."</TE>

<HD>Money Game, Not Davis' Mastery of It, Is at Heart of
Problem</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>Sacramento</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis has raised an eye-popping $67 million in campaign
funds since taking office. He has reached into the pockets of
business execs, labor bosses, obliging appointees and billionaire
buddies.</LD>
<LD>   Many donors have benefited from his official actions, some
personally.</LD>
<LD>   And what does this make Davis? It makes him the all-time champion
gubernatorial fund-raiser.</LD>
<TE>   Does it make him corrupt? The whole system is corrupt. The
annoying truth is, Davis works this system better than any politician
ever has.</TE>
<TE>   Legally, far as anybody can tell. Works right up to the line.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray's an easy mark [for critics]," says one veteran lobbyist.
"He's not charming at all about it."</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Davis the best, he relishes playing the game. Plays it
without shame, never blushing while begging. After all, he reasons,
some rich opponent -- an Al Checchi or a Bill Simon Jr. -- may be
financing his own campaign.</TE>
<TE>   The governor has collected at least $27 million this year alone,
$3.6 million during the first three weeks of October. He's pouring $3
million per week into TV ads, but as of Oct. 19 still had $12.1
million in cash. Republican Simon had only $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That color you see in the faces of Republicans is green for envy
rather than the purple of outrage," says Garry South, Davis' chief
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   "Pay for play," cries Simon, accusing Davis of selling public
policy for private donations. "A coin-operated governor."</TE>
<TE>   That would be illegal, of course. There are odorous episodes --
like the prison guards union giving Davis $800,000 and its members
getting a 37% pay hike -- but nothing illegal ever has been proved,
despite Simon's clumsy attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Because Simon can't generate much money -- potential donors
consider him a lousy investment -- he has personally "loaned" his
campaign $10.25 million. That raises its own ethical questions.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon were to pull an upset Nov. 5, the new governor-elect
could hit up special interests for money to put directly into his
pocket as repayment of the personal loans. These would be legal
shakedowns.</TE>
<TE>   "My criticism of Davis," says reformer Bob Stern, president of the
Center for Governmental Studies, "is that he leaves the impression
that, in order to get his attention, you have to contribute to his
campaign. He has carried that much farther than anyone else."</TE>
<TE>   That certainly is the impression of most Capitol lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't look into the mind of every donor and tell you why
they're giving," South says. "Do some donors give because they want
something in return? Sure. You'd be a fool to say some didn't.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's less important than whether a recipient of the
contribution acts in an official capacity to do something in return.
That's illegal."</TE>
<TE>   That's the repetitive Davis spin -- any politician's spin: There's
absolutely no link between a political donation and a policy
decision.</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, right, say the lobbyists. Even a governor can't repeal human
nature. In this system, donors give to get. Politicians know favors
often must be returned.</TE>
<TE>   One experienced lobbyist explains his donation decisions this way:
"As the manager of my client's money, I have a fiduciary duty to
invest it wisely. I think I may get favorable treatment or I wouldn't
invest the money."</TE>
<TE>   It's why Sacramento Democrats, from Davis to rookie legislators,
have been showered with many times more special interest dollars than
Republicans. The GOP has no power.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, this centrist governor has been regarded by the
business lobby as its protector against the liberal Legislature. So
it has helped bankroll him.</TE>
<TE>   Call it a protection racket.</TE>
<TE>   It's the system we've set up -- "we" being especially the courts.
They've eviscerated some voters' reform attempts that were opposed by
the political establishment. Got to keep those big bucks rolling into
the campaign industry and the politicians' slush funds.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 34, approved in 2000, will take effect for the next
gubernatorial race and limit individual contributions to $20,000.
That's a start.</TE>
<TE>   The best answer is public financing of campaigns with spending
limits. Some version. Like other states have. Either the public buys
the politicians, or the private interests continue to.</TE>
<TE>   Conservative Arizona voted in a "clean money" public financing
system four years ago. Swear off private money, agree to spending
limits, get public funds.</TE>
<TE>   "People turn on the candidates for raising lots of money, but it's
the system in place that makes it possible -- and actually
necessary," says Arizona State University professor Ruth Jones, who
heads the Arizona Clean Elections Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Don't like our governor's aggressive fund-raising? You shouldn't.
Nor any state politician's groveling before private investors. But
blame our corrupt system. And change it.</TE>

<HD>Surf City Sees Cash Flow in a New Credit Card</HD>
<DH>Huntington Beach stands to gain as much as $1.2 million a
year from a proposal to issue a Visa or MasterCard bearing the city
logo to residents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Reyes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The city that pioneered beach marketing in Orange County now plans to
issue its own credit card, hoping to cash in on Huntington Beach's
Surf City logo.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal is patterned after similar credit cards offered by
nonprofit groups and retailers to their members and customers.</LD>
<LD>   "We were talking one day and realized we already were sending out
mail to residents about aerobic classes and recreation activities,"
said Mike Hennessey, a consultant to the city on special projects.</LD>
<TE>   "And, we said, 'Hey, look: We can put an ad in with the mail and
tell people that there's a Surf City credit card.' If residents want
to sign up, the city will get a portion of the purchases."</TE>
<TE>   City residents would be encouraged to sign up for a credit card
with the city logo that would be issued by a major credit-card
company such as Visa or MasterCard.</TE>
<TE>   A percentage of credit-card sales -- as designated by credit-card
holders -- would go into city programs or the city's general fund.</TE>
<TE>   City newsletters would help market the program, and merchants
offering discounts to cardholders would be included in city
advertising posters.</TE>
<TE>   For cash-strapped Huntington Beach, it could mean as much as $1.2
milliona year, Hennessey said.</TE>
<TE>   The plan is still taking shape and is expected to go before the
City Council for approval in January.</TE>
<TE>   Some privacy advocates have expressed concern about the city using
data about consumer spending -- or selling that data.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be very wary of participating in the program if the city
is going to get data about purchasing patterns of people who
participate in this program," said Beth Givens, director of the San
Diego-based Privacy Rights Clearinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   Hennessey said the city will not share cardholder information:</TE>
<TE>   "The city will never give away marketing information and will not
hand out any private or confidential information. If we were to do
that this idea would be dead in the water."</TE>
<TE>   Merchants like the idea, said Joyce Riddell, president of the
Huntington Beach Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "The individuals who buy the card will get benefits from merchants
that offer discounts for people who use the card, and a portion of
that money will go back to the city for the city to use," Riddell
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very entrepreneurial."</TE>
<TE>   According to the League of California Cities, no other city in the
state has considered such an idea.</TE>
<TE>   Surf City card users would be able to earmark a small amount of
money for city programs, including cultural services, parks and
recreation and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   Those services suffered a total of $900,000 in budget cuts in this
year.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '90s, Huntington Beach became the first Orange County
city to use sponsorship and advertising deals with private companies
to pay lifeguard and beach expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Chevrolet provides 20 pickups for lifeguards, who also ride Yamaha
personal watercraft. Also, the city allows companies such as Simple
Green to advertise on lifeguard towers.</TE>
<TE>   "All those raise thousands of dollars a year without costing a

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenants of a poultry ranch in Napa say there is nothing wrong with
raising roosters and selling them to people who stage cockfights in
Mexico, but California law doesn't agree and animal rights advocates
say it's just plain cruel.</LD>
<LD>   Although it is a misdemeanor to raise fighting fowl, Capt. Mike
Loughran of the Napa County Sheriff's Department says he can't search
the Napa ranch unless evidence links roosters on the property to
cockfights in other places.</LD>
<LD>   Unless deputies find fighting paraphernalia nearby or can follow a
shipment of fowl to Mexico and observe their fate, there's little the
department can do, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The ranch is owned by a Vallejo lawyer, Stephen Camden, who has
rented out the property in 12 sections to tenants who raise roosters,
chickens, hens and rabbits. The property's manager, Alvaro Castro,
said tenants have to follow only one rule: no cockfighting on the
premises.</TE>
<TE>   Castro said he was unaware that it is a misdemeanor to raise
fighting cocks in California. He also said he didn't know about the
2002 Farm Act, which will make it illegal to ship the birds across
state lines. That law will take effect next year.</TE>
<TE>   "I agree that if they catch someone fighting, bust them up, make
them pay for it," Castro told the Napa Valley Register. "As for
raising them ... I don't see anything wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Castro said fighting cocks must be at least 2 years old before
entering a ring, where they fight to the death. For this reason, he
said, they have a better life than those raised for supermarkets.</TE>
<TE>   Animal rights groups disagree. Amy Rhodes of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals said cockfighting is a blood sport that
no one supports except for those who make money from it.</TE>

<HD>'Gadfly' Gets Unusual Reward--a Victory</HD>
<DH>Self-appointed council watchdog won lawsuit against
Lawndale when judge said that a ballot measure was misleading and had
to be rewritten.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Merl</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When voters in the small South Bay city of Lawndale read down to the
local section of their Nov. 5 ballot, they can thank -- or blame --
Fred Siegel for what they see. And for what they don't see.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Siegel, after three years of regular railing
against what he considers municipal injustice, went to court over a
ballot proposal designed to give the city's redevelopment agency
broader powers.</LD>
<LD>   And he won.</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge David Yaffe last month
agreed with Siegel and his attorney that the wording on Measure N was
misleading and improperly stacked the deck in favor of a "yes" vote.</TE>
<TE>   Yaffe in essence rewrote the measure. His wording explains that
Measure N would repeal the city's prohibition on eminent domain,
which is the government's taking of private property, with
compensation, for a public purpose. He also wiped out a wordy phrase
spelling out all the good things Measure N purportedly would do.</TE>
<TE>   The court victory bestowed on Siegel a degree of success uncommon
among his fellow "gadflies," those self-appointed government
watchdogs who keep sharp eyes on their city councils and other
officials.</TE>
<TE>   Their dedication in scrutinizing agendas and speaking out at
public meetings sometimes borders on obsession, and they can become
quite passionate -- some would say shrill -- when it's their turn at
the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "They get me all worked up," said Siegel of his many beefs with
the officials on the dais. He has lost track of the number of times
he has been escorted from the council chamber by the sheriff's deputy
posted to keep order at the meetings.</TE>
<TE>   He records all his appearances and listens to the tapes to see how
he might have improved his delivery -- or to catch City Atty. William
Wynder, "the bureaucrats" or council members in missteps.</TE>
<TE>   Across California, officials often dismiss the watchdogs' many
complaints as ill-founded or trivial, a sort of civic form of crying
wolf. But occasionally someone is "right and determined enough to get
results through the courts," says Terry Francke. Francke is general
counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, a nonprofit in
Sacramento that promotes open government.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unusual for someone to follow through and even rarer to
win," added Francke, whose organization helps those, including
Siegel, having difficulty participating in their governments.</TE>
<TE>   "This gives me more legitimacy," Siegel said of his win. "The city
is always trying to cut me down. They say I'm out of order when I try
to talk about this at council meetings. This time, they couldn't
muzzle me."</TE>
<TE>   Lawndale officials, however, say Siegel has done a disservice to
voters by getting the court to strip away the "context" and
explanation of how eminent domain could be used to help spur commerce
and bring in more jobs and tax dollars. The city also has criticized
his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   'Uniformly Critical'</TE>
<TE>   In a court document filed in connection with Siegel's suit, Wynder
said Siegel turns up at virtually every council and redevelopment
agency meeting and is "uniformly critical" every time he reaches the
lectern.</TE>
<TE>   "He objects to, rails against and criticizes the council
collectively, and individually," Wynder said. In addition, the
attorney continued, Siegel has been involved in several other court
matters with the city and is "philosophically opposed" to eminent
domain.</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Wynder informed the court, Siegel ran for mayor last April
and "received the second fewest votes of all candidates." (That was
three: Mayor Harold Hofmann got 1,061 votes, Siegel, 298, and Enrique
Salazar, 43.)</TE>
<TE>   Siegel, a slightly built man of 57 who rides his bicycle the few
blocks to City Hall from the rustic cottage that serves as his home
and the office for his real estate and income tax business,
acknowledges that he has battled the city on several fronts -- and
that he believes the use of eminent domain is never justified.</TE>
<TE>   He added that it didn't help his attitude when officials included
his home, and the rental property he owns next door, in the
redevelopment project area. (They are trying to lure a BMW dealer and
other lucrative businesses to town and say they need the property
condemnation powers to assemble enough land for maximal success.)</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, voters turned down civic leaders' desire to
form a state-authorized community redevelopment agency, but
proponents later sold the idea by promising that the agency (whose
board members are the City Council) would be forbidden from using
eminent domain. (Wynder has said that the prohibition is likely
illegal as state law overrides city measures that conflict with it.)</TE>
<TE>   Siegel believes the city's recent criminal prosecution of him for
refusing to trim the overgrown hedges (which he insists are trees) at
the front of his property was in retaliation for his activism.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the only one they ever cited like this," he grumbled,
producing a letter from the city that confirmed he was the sole
person to be criminally prosecuted for a hedge violation. However,
the letter added that criminal charges were about to be filed against
a second property owner for the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel wound up with a $270 penalty after going back and forth
with his attorney, the prosecutor and the city, agreeing to settle by
making the required trims to his beloved yuccas and then changing his
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Even Siegel's defense attorney, Richard F.G. Thomas, expressed
frustration in a letter to his client.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly cautioned you that it would be better if you let me do
all the talking, but you told me that you wanted your 'day in court,'
" Thomas wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Civic Pride</TE>
<TE>   Siegel is part of a small, second-generation group of civic
watchdogs (his role model died last year) in Lawndale, a blue-collar
town of nearly 32,000 residents that proudly bills itself as the
"Heart of the South Bay."</TE>
<TE>   The population is 52% Latino, 21% white, 12% black and 10% Asian
or Pacific Islander. Lawndale's neighborhoods of modest bungalows and
apartment buildings are bisected by busy Hawthorne Boulevard, and
residents can easily reach their immaculate Civic Center.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly two-square-mile community incorporated in 1959 to avoid
being swallowed up by neighboring Hawthorne or Redondo Beach. From
its beginnings, many active town residents have displayed not only a
strong civic identity and pride but also a deep suspicion of big
government.</TE>
<TE>   But Siegel is hardly content with his victory.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that the city has authorized a $35,000 "voter education"
campaign for Measure N, he recently stepped up his efforts to defeat
it.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel was hosting meetings in the large backyard he shares with a
family of half-feral cats until a sympathetic businessman offered the
use of his restaurant. Siegel and his small band of comrades write
fliers, post signs, plot strategy.</TE>
<TE>   He says he has pretty much neglected his business in favor of
campaigning against Measure N, but expresses no regrets. Win or lose,
he'll be back at City Hall after the vote, ready for the next battle.</TE>

<TE>   New Wording on Nov. 5 Ballot</TE>
<TE>   Lawndale activist Fred Siegel won a court battle when a judge said
the city's wording of Measure N was misleading.</TE>
<TE>   Original:</TE>
<TE>   To provide the ability to create local jobs; attract business;
generate revenue to repair streets, potholes; expand anti-drug and
gang programs; improve parks, libraries, senior services without
increasing taxes; shall the City Council be directed to amend the
General Plan and shall Ordinance No. 920-02 be adopted repealing the
municipal code chapter 2.74 to allow use of eminent domain to
eliminate blight in commercial and industrial (not residential) zones
only within the redevelopment project area?</TE>
<TE>   Current:</TE>
<TE>   (1) Shall Ordinance No. 920-02 be adopted to do the following:
repeal in its entirety Chapter 2.74 of the Lawndale Municipal Code,
which prohibits the redevelopment agency from using its power of
eminent domain to acquire property which is zoned for residential
purposes or developed with residential structures of 4 units or less?
And (2) Shall the City Council be directed to amend the General Plan
to permit the use of eminent domain to eliminate blight only in
commercial and industrial, but not residential zones, within the
redevelopment project area?</TE>

<HD>Davis, Simon Appeal to Party Loyalists</HD>
<DH>The governor and his Republican challenger ask for a big
turnout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones and Matea Gold</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the attention of much of the state fixed less on politics than
the intrigues of baseball, the two major candidates for governor of
California campaigned among their parties' most loyal backers Sunday
as the election got down to the simple math of who can lure more
voters to the polls.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, Gov. Gray Davis defended his first term and asked
for a second, speaking to African American voters, the Democratic
party's most dependable bloc. In Elk Grove, a Sacramento suburb, Bill
Simon Jr. and other members of the Republican ticket basked in
support at a GOP barbecue and rally. Simon continued to portray
himself as an underdog finishing the campaign with a surge against
the incumbent governor, much as he closed strongly against the
front-runner for much of the GOP primary, Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan. As he has repeatedly in recent days, Simon depicted Davis as
desperately trying to cling to a dwindling lead in the polls -- a
characterization that Davis has dismissed as Republican fiction.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll tell you this: Gray Davis is a desperate man," Simon told
his cheering supporters, packed into the sun-drenched courtyard of a
local community hall nine days before the Nov. 5 election. "He
promised one week ago he'd be running only positive ads because he
was up by so far in the polls. One week later, Gray Davis once again
broke his word. And the reason why he's running negative ads is that
he knows he cannot persuade Californians that he's been a good
governor." During his quick swing through northern California, Simon
appeared with state Sen. Bruce McPherson, the GOP candidate for
lieutenant governor, and other Republican candidates for statewide
office.</TE>
<TE>   Simon and McPherson both stressed the importance of a strong
turnout by Republicans, who are 1.5 million shy of Democratic
registration numbers. "Talk to your friends and get them out to the
polls, because I believe it's going to be a close election," Simon
said. Simon touched on the familiar themes of his campaign -- lower
taxes and less government -- and accused Davis of mismanaging the
state's finances. Alluding to Davis' overwhelming advantage in
campaign funds, which Simon has partially offset with more than $10
million in personal loans to his campaign, the Republican candidate
accused his opponent of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis is not afraid to sell public policy as we go, so as a
result he's outspent me 5-1, and we're still within 3 or 4" points,
Simon said. Davis has repeatedly denied any links between campaign
contributions and his appointments and policy decisions. After his
stump speech, Simon donned a blue apron and picked fat steaks off a
smoky grill. Speaking to reporters later, Simon blamed Davis for the
looming state budget crisis and the projected shortfall of at least
$10 billion that awaits the next governor.</TE>
<TE>   Simon declined to specify what programs he would cut if he won the
election. He also refused to say whether he would cut programs like
Cal Grant scholarships for college-bound students and Healthy
Families, which provides health care for children in low-income
families. As governor, Davis has significantly expanded both
programs.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going to be specific today, but there will be difficult
decisions that will have to be made," Simon said. "But I believe if
we are fiscally prudent, we'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, in his one public appearance Sunday at the First AME Church
in central Los Angeles, touted his record on education and health
insurance and promised to do more if reelected.</TE>
<TE>   A large church choir was belting out a hymn when the governor
arrived for the noon service along with Rep. Diane Watson (D-Los
Angeles). As Davis embraced Pastor Cecil Murray, the congregation of
several hundred cheered loudly. In his short address, Davis cited
what he said were achievements in his administration.</TE>
<TE>   "I have kept in mind all the days I've been privileged to serve
the people of this great state that we are all God's children," Davis
said, "and that all of us honored to be in public service should do
what we can to lift the opportunities and spirits of every human
being God put on this planet every chance we get." The governor said
that, on his watch, test scores have gone up and local schools are
improving.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a long ways to go, but I think you can see in your
schools, things are getting better," he said. "It is a long road,
and, with God's help and your help, we will get there." Davis also
noted that 300,000 new college scholarships have been created for
low-income students and that the number of African American children
with health insurance has increased 400% in the last 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is to move us all forward, move us all forward for four
more years," Davis said. After he spoke, Watson addressed the
congregation, calling Davis her "friend and partner in politics." She
urged the audience to go to the polls on Nov. 5. "Are you going to be
for the progressive team?" she asked. "Yeah!" responded the
congregation. "God bless you!" she said.</TE>

<HD>Health Care Out of Hope?</HD>
<DH>Two federal bailouts delayed a reckoning for the county's
troubled system. But lack of reform may doom aid this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicholas Riccardi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Clinton flew to the rescue seven years ago, landing on the
tarmac of Santa Monica Airport to announce a $1-billion bailout for
the county's teetering health-care system. It was a dramatic gesture,
meant to spur great reforms and quell recurring fears of collapse.</LD>
<LD>   Now, skidding toward a $500-million to $750-million health-care
deficit, county supervisors are scheduled to consider Tuesday whether
to end inpatient services at two of four full-service hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   Even after the 1995 bailout and a $1.2-billion second helping in
2000, the Los Angeles County health system is sitting just about
where it started: in deep financial trouble.</LD>
<TE>   Unable to count on a third federal rescue, county supervisors are
back to the cutting board. And they are asking voters to approve a
$168-million parcel tax to sustain core medical services: the
emergency room and the trauma network.</TE>
<TE>   But as they plead for more money from Sacramento, Washington and
their own constituents, the supervisors are running into some
skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   "The L.A. County hospital system was supposed to be reforming and
becoming more efficient, and it basically hasn't," Tom Scully, the
top Bush administration health official who runs the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in an interview last month.</TE>
<TE>   Said Jon Coupal of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn.: "It seems to
us that the burden of proof should be on the county showing that they
have met their efficiencies before they go out asking for more
money."</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the 1995 bailout, the county pledged to cut the
size of its hospitals, increase the number of cheaper outpatient
visits and streamline its health department. It fell short, to
varying degrees, on all three promises.</TE>
<TE>   But as the massive deficit looms closer, supervisors have begun to
take the bad-tasting medicine they long avoided.</TE>
<TE>   In June, for example, they voted to end inpatient service at High
Desert Hospital. On Tuesday, they will discuss whether to close
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center, a rehabilitation hospital in
Downey, or turn it into a self-supporting entity. They are moving to
consolidate specialty care and to centralize their records to better
track patients' care.</TE>
<TE>   All those reforms had been discussed -- and postponed -- in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   County supervisors argue that they have made real, if incomplete,
progress. They cite expansion of outpatient care and note that they
have kept their budget from climbing, even as medical costs soar,
private hospitals close and the number of uninsured residents rises.</TE>
<TE>   Other reforms, they say, are tougher to implement because of
entrenched opposition from special interests.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you try to change anything, you're an ogre,"
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said. "All the unions say we can't
lose any workers. [Medical schools] tell us, 'Well, you're going to
destroy the medical schools' " that count on county hospitals for
physician training.</TE>
<TE>   Some reforms the county did make are returning to haunt it.
Consider the attempt to shift to outpatient services.</TE>
<TE>   Normally, the federal government pays much more for treating
Medicaid (Medi-Cal in California) patients in hospitals. As part of
the bailout deals, county clinics could get extra money for
outpatient care. But as the latest bailout begins to expire, the
county will receive far less money for its now-expanded clinic
system.</TE>
<TE>   To some, that shows that the county's problems are not all of its
own making.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't as if there haven't been any mistakes and there hasn't
been some faulty management," said Robert Tranquada, a former USC
professor who helped create the Department of Health Services in the
1970s. "But the whole thing is set up so it can't be solved."</TE>
<TE>   Some medical experts and county officials argue that even if the
health system were run perfectly, it would face periodic crises
because it has been chronically underfunded and the county has among
the highest rates of uninsured people in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the true reasons for the county's predicament, an
enormous system serving 800,000 patients a year is at stake. Most of
them are the uninsured working poor, but the county's trauma system
serves everyone, treating more than half the victims of car accidents
and gunshot wounds in the region.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a huge disservice to the public" if more funds were
not forthcoming, said Dr. Brian Johnston, an emergency room physician
and former president of the county medical association. "We can deal
with governance and efficiency later, but at the moment the system is
starved for funds."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 1995 bailout was touted as a national model for how to expand
treatment of uninsured people while saving money.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people all over America will be learning a lot from what
you are doing," Clinton said that day on the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the county itself learned some hard lessons.</TE>
<TE>   It was unable to cut its health budget significantly, even as it
tried to scale back expensive hospital care and concentrated on
outpatient services.</TE>
<TE>   Some medical experts and supervisors say that, in retrospect, the
bailout deal may not have been the best medicine for Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   "They never should have said they could fix it," Tranquada said,
"because until the system of funding these services is fixed, they
can never fix [the county health department]."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors say their experiment shows that there is no way to
care for the uninsured on the cheap.</TE>
<TE>   "Turned out that the more people you saw in an outpatient setting,
the more maladies you saw and diagnosed -- which required those
people to go into a hospital," Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said.</TE>
<TE>   He argued, though, that the endeavor was worthwhile. "I think it's
been a significant, partial success," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the boldest part of the county experiment involved signing
contracts, beginning in 1996, with about 100 private clinics to treat
the uninsured. In one move, the county tripled the number of sites
where it could provide outpatient care.</TE>
<TE>   But over time, the county failed to meet its targets for
outpatient visits. The deal called for the county to have 3.9 million
by 2000; it fell 900,000 short, angering federal officials.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, those officials expanded the bailout -- but with a catch.
The money would begin to dwindle after two years, running out in
2005.</TE>
<TE>   But the county would have to continue to see as many people on an
outpatient basis each year as it had been.</TE>
<TE>   So far it has done that, but supervisors say the strategy is
unworkable over the long term.</TE>
<TE>   The county has had even less success in directly cutting
health-care costs.</TE>
<TE>   It promised to find about $300 million in savings in the 1995
deal, but came up with only about $90 million.</TE>
<TE>   It was only this year, with deficit projections deepening, that
the county's new health director, Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, proposed
cuts that over time could save $300 million annually. The supervisors
approved them in June.</TE>
<TE>   Politics have complicated matters. Perhaps nowhere is that more
evident than in efforts over the years to scale back hospitals, often
the pride of a supervisor's district.</TE>
<TE>   The county has cut the number of hospital beds it operates by 30%,
slightly less than the 33% reduction it promised in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   A fight over rebuilding earthquake-damaged County-USC Medical
Center on a smaller scale dragged on for three years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, the board majority angered fellow Supervisor Gloria
Molina, whose Eastside district includes the hospital, and Latino
lawmakers in Sacramento with its decision to build a replacement with
600 beds rather than the planned 750.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen such a vitriolic attitude within the state
Legislature," Burke said. "They almost wanted to recall us."</TE>
<TE>   The county ultimately compromised with Sacramento and Molina, and
agreed to build an 80-bed satellite hospital in the San Gabriel
Valley. Those plans are on hold because state funding that had been
promised has not arrived, a county spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors also have wavered on whether to close or sell off
hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1995 health crisis, they voted to privatize Rancho Los
Amigos, a nationally recognized rehabilitative hospital. Two years
later, after the bailout, they reversed themselves. Now they are
considering a proposal to make the hospital self-supporting, saving
about $35 million.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the 76-bed High Desert Hospital in Lancaster,
county health officials for years conceded privately that it could
serve more patients at lower cost as an outpatient facility.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments were made in private for fear of angering Mike
Antonovich, whose district includes the hospital. Last year,
then-health Director Mark Finucane backtracked on a proposal to close
the hospital after being scolded by Antonovich. Months later,
Antonovich led a group of supervisors who forced Finucane from his
job.</TE>
<TE>   In December, even as board members spoke of the need to cut the
health department, they directed its medical officials to study
expanding High Desert Hospital by adding an emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Garthwaite proposed that the hospital instead be
converted into an outpatient facility. Antonovich and the other
supervisors now agreed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In November 2000, as the board put off one of a series of votes on
proposed cuts in the health department, Supervisor Molina bemoaned
the forces keeping the county from reforming health care.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're also saddled with is a Board of Supervisors who talk
tough ... but cut our clinics, cut our hospitals; we go out screaming
in the streets," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Now, most supervisors insist, they are genuinely ready to make the
tough choices.</TE>
<TE>   They surprised many observers by making a round of deep reductions
in June without dissent.</TE>
<TE>   This week, they are poised to consider more severe cuts, such as
ending inpatient services at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center near Torrance
and Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had five years to begin those cuts," Antonovich said last
week. "Every year we delay is going to [make it] worse."</TE>
<TE>   But even as the supervisors gird for cuts, they have shown a
willingness to spend money. Earlier this month, they narrowly
approved $18 million in raises to minimum-wage home- care workers.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, one county health official privately marveled: "They
did it again."</TE>

<HD>Hollywood Seeks Friendly Ghosts, Good Witches</HD>
<DH>A family Halloween celebration is planned, with food, music
and a positive image.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Ramos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While talk of Hollywood secession is new, the old practice of
promoting Tinseltown as the place to be goes on.</LD>
<LD>   After ballyhooing the Hollywood Christmas parade, New Year's Eve,
the return of the Oscars and other galas, organizers and a Hollywood
business group have come up with a new idea to attract a crowd: a
family-oriented Halloween night celebration on Hollywood Boulevard
that they hope will be the world's largest costume party.</LD>
<LD>   The event, dubbed Hollywood Halloween, will be staged within a
closed stretch of Hollywood Boulevard between Highland Avenue and
Vine Street. It will feature street entertainers, a karaoke stage,
tents for food and beverages, musical performances, a celebrities'
autograph tent and balloon rides.</LD>
<TE>   As many as 30,000 are expected to attend.</TE>
<TE>   "Halloween should be a destination event for Hollywood," said
Kerry Morrison, executive director of the Hollywood Entertainment
District, a business improvement group for the boulevard. "Like Mardi
Gras in New Orleans or New Year's Eve in New York City, the potential
for a new tradition is endless."</TE>
<TE>   Admission will be $10 for adults; children under 12 get in for
free.</TE>
<TE>   The Halloween celebration represents a departure from most
Tinseltown events because organizers are targeting families. They
have given out fliers at schools and community centers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely for families because we'll have face painting, a
rock-climbing exhibit, a kids' costume parade, a giant Ferris wheel
and a large balloon for rides for the kids," Hollywood publicist Kim
Sudhalter said.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, crowds of mostly young adults, from 80,000 to as
many as 200,000, have descended upon the boulevard for informal
celebrations of Halloween. Police officials have closed the boulevard
for crowd control and have experienced only sporadic problems.</TE>
<TE>   Still on the minds of some in Hollywood is the unofficial 1988
celebration that turned into an ugly melee. It came at a time when
Hollywood was seen as a less-than-glamorous place plagued by
prostitution, runaways living on the streets and drug dealing.</TE>
<TE>   On that October night in '88, some in the crowd of 100,000
Halloween revelers tossed bottles at police, smashed windows and
looted stores on Hollywood Boulevard. It took 170 officers in riot
gear, backed up by mounted units and two helicopters, about two hours
to restore order.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-eight people were arrested and six others, including two
police officers, were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Saying that about 300 Los Angeles police officers will be on duty
at this year's event, authorities expect few problems, based in part
because of past years when few, if any arrests, were made.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, it'll be just another big crowd," said Sgt. Mike Arminio,
who handles police arrangements for large-scale events in Hollywood.
"If they don't throw anything at me, I'll be fine."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure the event's family nature, organizers have decided to
ban Silly String, the ubiquitous nontoxic foamy tendrils, that seems
to be part of any celebration since it was introduced to the gag-gift
market in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison said that Silly String has been an increasing problem in
Hollywood and that empty aerosol cans littered the streets after
previous Halloweens. Eventually, they make their way into storm
drains and the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to be environmentally safe," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, illegal street vendors, who frequent many public events to
sell food and other items, will be discouraged.</TE>
<TE>   If there's a risk in this Halloween event, it's being taken by the
producers staging it.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Sakow, who puts on the annual AIDS Project Los Angeles Summer
Party on a back lot at Universal Studios, says she and two others are
putting up $200,000 to $250,000 of their own money to stage the event
because there was little time to attract major sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "It could take as many as two or three years" to make money at the
event, Sakow said. She noted that many merchants -- "good citizens"
-- had held down costs to help event organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because they also believe in Hollywood," she said.</TE>
<TE>   An effort to attract Latinos, who make up a good portion of
Hollywood's residents, is being undertaken.</TE>
<TE>   Promotions are being aired on KSSE-FM, a Latin contemporary music
station known as "La Super Estrella."</TE>
<TE>   To lessen opposition among the boulevard's merchants, the
sidewalks will not be closed, a broad hint to area bars and
restaurants to remain open.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Red Line subway stations at Hollywood and Vine
and Hollywood and Highland will be open. For the Academy Awards
ceremony at the Kodak Theatre in March, the Hollywood and Highland
station was closed.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the time needed to set up rides, booths and stages,
Hollywood Boulevard will be closed between Highland and Vine,
beginning at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday. It is to be reopened to traffic
by 6 a.m. Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of how many end up at the event, organizers say it will
likely be recognized as the world's largest costume party by the
officials at the Guinness Book of World Records. At this time, there
is no record for such a category.</TE>
<TE>   So, organizers are hoping for large crowds with many Hollywood
look-alikes mixed in with the monsters and the ghouls.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to scare anybody at a Halloween party," said Todd
Graham, 29, of Los Angeles as he window-shopped on Hollywood the
other day.</TE>
<TE>   "If I come to the Halloween thing here, I'll come as a Beatle. I
just love their music ... yeah, yeah, yeah."</TE>

<HD>Real Estate Booms in Humboldt County</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Emily Gurnon</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>EUREKA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>It's long been known for giant redwoods and marijuana cultivation.
But in the last two years, Humboldt County appears to have been
discovered as the home of "the most affordable coastal real estate in
California," as one agent put it.</LD>
<LD>   Prices for single-family homes in Humboldt, whose county seat of
Eureka lies about 100 miles from the Oregon border, have shot up
since 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The median price for a single-family home in the third quarter of
this year was $188,000, up from $138,500 just two years ago,
according to the Humboldt Assn. of Realtors. In the last three
months, prices have jumped $10,500, or 6%.</LD>
<TE>   Those numbers look tiny to Southern Californians, Bay Area
residents and other outsiders. That seems to be a large part of
what's driving the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "In our office, about 50% of the buyers who come to us are from
outside the area," said Sue Forbes, a real estate broker. "Two years
ago, it would be maybe 20[%] or 25%."</TE>
<TE>   Some come to retire, attracted by the affordability, natural
beauty, small-town atmosphere and relatively cool temperatures. Some
telecommute to jobs in bigger cities. Others, real estate agents
said, decided after last Sept. 11 to get away from cities and
skyscrapers that terrorists might target.</TE>
<TE>   When they sell their pricey homes in San Francisco, Sacramento or
Southern California, many pay cash for property here, sometimes
buying a place sight unseen.</TE>
<TE>   "All you need is a couple people to come up, somebody pays cash
without an appraisal and guess what? That sets the price," said Debi
August, a broker in the town of Fortuna who has sold houses here for
30 years. "It's a snowball effect. A willing buyer and a willing
seller determine value."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the people coming through her office are from elsewhere,
primarily the Bay Area and Sacramento, and they arrive with a lot of
money, August said.</TE>
<TE>   "They come up here and say, 'You're kidding! I can pay this for
that?' " she said.</TE>
<TE>   With the stock market's collapse, real estate looks like a smart
investment, and the low interest rates don't hurt.</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino resident Jeraldine Beres, 58, just paid $254,000 in
cash for a house in the town of McKinleyville, which she plans to
live in with her daughter, a freshman at Humboldt State University in
nearby Arcata. She sold her three-bedroom home in Tustin for
$350,000.</TE>
<TE>   "I bought a beautiful little duplex. She's going to live on one
side and me the other," Beres said. Her husband had wanted to retire
here, and, with his sudden death this summer, "my daughter and I need
each other," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The five-bedroom, 1,850-square-foot home is in "a prime area -- I
can walk to the store, post office, library, senior center," Beres
said. "Everybody's telling me I'm going to be depressed" by the cool,
often foggy weather. "I don't think so."</TE>
<TE>   The proximity of Humboldt State, with its intellectual and
cultural offerings, is a prime attraction for many transplants. And
it's common for parents to buy homes here for their children to live
in while attending college, said Charles McCann, an Arcata broker.</TE>
<TE>   As outsiders snap up what they see as bargains, locals view the
rising prices with alarm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unbelievable. It scares me to death," said August, the
Fortuna broker. "I worry about our children. It used to be affordable
and now there is not anything affordable. That's just absolutely
crazy."</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the area's logging and fishing industries have
fallen on hard times. For most residents, salaries are modest; the
county's median household income is $31,226. "We are not seeing any
increase in income. In fact, we are seeing people being laid off as
the mills struggle to stay open," August said. "We are finding people
with less income to spend."</TE>
<TE>   Erika Young said she and her husband, Nathan, struggled for nearly
a year to find a home for their family in Arcata -- the liberal
college town that one real estate agent dubbed the "epicenter" of the
price quake. There, buyers are hard-pressed to find a three-bedroom
home for less than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   Time after time, the Youngs lost out on modest houses, whose
prices shot up in bidding wars -- in one case from $140,000 to
$180,000 for a 1,000-square-foot tract home, said Young, a Humboldt
County native.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, their landlord raised their rent from $1,100 to $1,400
-- an increase they couldn't afford.</TE>
<TE>   "The sensation was disbelief and desperation, because we really
needed to find a home to buy," said Young, 35, a mother of three. The
couple finally bought a two-bedroom, $119,000 house in Willow Creek,
a mountain hamlet 40 miles east of Arcata, where her husband does
computer programming from home.</TE>
<TE>   Officials worry that housing prices will change the fundamental
character of their towns.</TE>
<TE>   "The city of Arcata doesn't really want to become an elitist
community," said Jim Test, Arcata's mayor. "We don't want to become a
Marin [County]."</TE>

<HD>Laguna Robber Is Identified</HD>

<LD>Laguna Beach police have released the identity of the masked robbery
suspect who died in a shootout with officers Wednesday afternoon
following a botched attempt to rob a small herb shop along South
Coast Highway.</LD>
<LD>   Nathaniel James O'Connor, 26, was killed in a gunfire exchange
with police after he walked into the Herbal Import Co. wearing a ski
mask, demanded that one employee fill a paper bag with cash and shot
another employee in the back.</LD>
<LD>   Police said O'Connor was a Los Angeles resident most recently
employed as a smog technician and construction worker. Investigators,
who say they believe O'Connor acted alone, remain puzzled by his
actions.</LD>
<TE>   The small shop a few blocks south of Main Beach was unlikely to
have much cash on hand, and is miles from the nearest freeway escape
route. And it is unclear why O'Connor shot store clerk Jacques
Nenijian, 26, while another employee was filling O'Connor's bag with
cash.</TE>
<TE>   Nenijian, of Laguna Beach, is expected to recover fully, as is
Officer Larry Bammer, 24, who was shot in the abdomen when he arrived
at the scene shortly after 2 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The shootout at the small purveyor of herbal medicines, incense
and smoking paraphernalia shattered the serenity in the beach town
Wednesday, sending sidewalk strollers running for cover. The last
time a Laguna Beach officer was shot on duty was in the 1950s, police
said.</TE>

<HD>Library Checks Out for Reopening</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karima A. Haynes</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Navarro furiously scribbled notes on a yellow legal pad as he
walked through the $3.6-million renovated and expanded West Valley
Regional Library in Reseda.</LD>
<LD>   As senior librarian, Navarro wanted to take note of every detail
as library staff and construction crews put the finishing touches on
the library before its grand reopening Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The modern steel and glass structure on Vanowen Street is the
latest Los Angeles Public Library branch completed with funding from
a $178.3-million bond voters approved in 1998 to expand, renovate or
rebuild 32 library branches citywide.</LD>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has one of the largest public library systems in the
United States, and a project of this magnitude is one that very few
public libraries can undertake," said Jo Ann Pinder, president of the
Public Library Assn., a division of the American Library Assn. "This
can only set the bar higher for other library funding authorities to
make sure that their facilities are the best they can be."</TE>
<TE>   In the last four years, library officials have overseen the
simultaneous construction of the 32 projects at sites stretching from
San Pedro to Chinatown to Woodland Hills. An additional library is
being planned for the harbor area as a result of savings and interest
earned from the initial bond funds.</TE>
<TE>   So far, six libraries have been completed and the remaining 27
facilities are either ahead of schedule or on schedule, library
officials said. All construction is expected to be completed by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of two libraries in the San Fernando Valley hit a
snag last summer when the contractor walked off the job because of
financial problems, said Fontayne Holmes, a director of the library's
facilities division.</TE>
<TE>   The contractor, Anderson/White of Orange County, notified its bond
company, Hartford Fire Insurance Co., that it could not meet its
contractual obligation to complete the Sun Valley and Chatsworth
branch libraries, Holmes said. Work stalled for two months before
resuming earlier this month after the insurance company and library
officials hired another builder.</TE>
<TE>   "We were quite frustrated by the delay," Holmes said. "But we were
ahead of schedule on both projects, and we will be bringing them both
in on schedule."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, West Valley Regional Library rolled toward completion
as crews stripped the single-story structure to its steel beams,
overhauled its interior and built a 1,500-square-foot addition.</TE>
<TE>   The state-of-the-art facility includes the main library, a
children's storytelling area with tiered seating, a teen area with
leather and chrome chairs, 31 computers with Internet access and a
community room with vaulted ceilings and a wall of windows looking
out onto a park and pine trees.</TE>
<TE>   When the library reopens Wednesday, Navarro said he hopes the
library's mix of aesthetics, resources and knowledgeable staff will
attract readers from varying backgrounds who will embrace the library
as a center of the community.</TE>
<TE>   With its exposed beams, suspension lighting and inviting
mint-and-mocha color scheme, Navarro hopes the library will draw
upscale patrons whose tastes run toward trendy bookstore cafes.</TE>
<TE>   The library's selection of educational audio books, videos and
DVDs could lure younger readers who may be reluctant to pick up a
book, Navarro said. "We may capture a child's attention with a
popular book on tape, and then encourage them to read classic books
with similar themes."</TE>
<TE>   Teens should be pleased with their own reading area, computers
with Internet access and a young adult librarian on staff, Navarro
said. "Kids need quiet time away from siblings and friends," he said.
"We want to make this a comfortable and safe place for them."</TE>
<TE>   City Librarian Susan Kent said the best part of her job is
welcoming patrons back to refurbished libraries across the city -- as
she plans to do on Wednesday -- and seeing the excitement on their
faces.</TE>
<TE>   "I welcomed one little boy and his mother to one of the renovated
library branches," she recalled. "After a few minutes, he came back
to me and said, 'This is the best place in the whole world!' "</TE>

<HD>Vote Will Help Shape Ventura</HD>
<DH>Measure A would allow building 1,390 homes in the
foothills, preserving 3,050 acres as open space. Campaign has set a
spending record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jenifer Ragland</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven years after voters passed Ventura's first anti-sprawl law,
residents are facing a crucial test: They will decide next week, in
one trip to the ballot box, how the seaside city will grow over the
next two decades.</LD>
<LD>   If passed, Measure A would allow 1,390 homes to be built on
scrub-covered hillsides and canyons north of Ventura during the next
15 to 20 years -- part of a complex deal that also includes a
3,050-acre gift of public open space.</LD>
<LD>   The campaign leading to the Nov. 5 vote has been one of the most
divisive in recent memory, pitting neighbor against neighbor.</LD>
<TE>   It also has been the most expensive growth-related ballot
initiative in the history of the county, which is a national
pacesetter when it comes to growth controls.</TE>
<TE>   For both sides, a lot is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Lloyd Properties, the family partnership that
sponsored the measure, say this is their one shot to do something
with all the property they have owned in Ventura for more than a
century.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters believe the landowner has offered a fair trade: the
right to apply for 139 housing units a year for 10 years in exchange
for preserving 80% of their 3,800 acres as trails, parks or untouched
public open space.</TE>
<TE>   The project also includes preserving the Two Trees hilltop,
featuring a pair of blue gum eucalyptus trees that have served as a
visual landmark in Ventura for generations.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they came up with a plan that is far-seeing and really
beautiful," said Eunice Koch, 77, a 33-year Ventura resident. "They
have really addressed the complaints of most people."</TE>
<TE>   But opponents -- a mix of Ventura County slow-growth leaders,
project neighbors and other Ventura residents -- say the development
is too big for the pristine hillsides that overlook their city of
100,000. They'd rather see the Lloyd ranch purchased and preserved
entirely as open space.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very picturesque area, and we'd like to keep it that way,"
said Martha Zeiher, president of Citizens for Hillside Preservation.
"We're not anti-growth; we just don't want growth in the hillsides."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents say the project would pour thousands of cars a day onto
city streets, crowd local schools and erode hillsides -- complaints
that backers of the measure say are overstated.</TE>
<TE>   Many opponents worry that traffic from new homes would clog
two-lane Foothill Road and Poli Street. Their traffic study predicts
a doubling of car trips on Foothill.</TE>
<TE>   Landowner consultants said those figures are wrong and predicted
that Foothill would have one-third as many trips as opponents
estimate.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A is on the ballot partly because Ventura voters last
November overwhelmingly passed Measure P, which requires a public
vote before the City Council can approve hillside development.</TE>
<TE>   Measure P was an offshoot of the city's historic 1995 ballot
measure that requires voter approval before projects can be built on
most of the city's remaining open space and farmland.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, every major city in the county has followed suit by
approving its own Save Open Space and Agricultural Resources law.</TE>
<TE>   A chief criticism of Measure A is its timing, coming before
completion of environmental and fiscal studies that must be submitted
before the City Council can allow construction.</TE>
<TE>   If Measure A passes, opponents think it could set a statewide
precedent for allowing virtual pre-approval of projects with unknown
flaws.</TE>
<TE>   "We're presented with one option -- yes or no, take it or leave it
-- and we don't know enough to make intelligent decisions," said Bill
Fulton, a planning expert whose hillside home is near the project. "I
am concerned about an approval process entirely driven by the
landowners."</TE>
<TE>   Supporters, however, say the Lloyd project is precisely the kind
of development SOAR and Measure P were intended to produce: lots of
public open space, limited development and new parks.</TE>
<TE>   And approved by voters.</TE>
<TE>   "If a project with this many benefits cannot win voter approval,
it will call into question the validity of voter-approved
growth-control measures everywhere," said Doug Halter, a downtown
business owner and citizen activist.</TE>
<TE>   Halter and others also are concerned that hard feelings caused by
a bitter campaign -- marked by personal attacks, misinformation and
vandalism -- could keep residents from working together to solve city
problems in the future.</TE>
<TE>   Halter said he receives dozens of hateful e-mails every day.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Merryman, a longtime Avenue area activist who was hired
as the landowners' spokeswoman, said residents who back Measure A are
afraid to put signs in their yards because of possible retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not attacking the plan; they're attacking the people,"
Merryman said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Lloyd Properties complained to police after activists
vandalized signs posted along Foothill Road by spray-painting "No"
over the "Yes on A" message. One opponent was cited criminally for
stealing a sign.</TE>
<TE>   Zeiher said her group was not behind the sign damage and condemned
the perpetrators. The anti-Measure A side has suffered similar
attacks, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our group has operated with integrity and truthfulness, and we
encourage all supporters to do the same," Zeiher said. "We believe
the election can be won solely by educating the community."</TE>
<TE>   But, Zeiher said, proponents have not been completely honest.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some mailers and television ads by Lloyd Properties have
focused only on "saving open space and stopping overdevelopment,"
never mentioning that the Measure A plan also calls for 1,390 homes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is actually pretty shocking to those of us who haven't been
involved in campaigns before," Zeiher said. "I asked, 'Isn't there a
truth in advertising law?' The answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents have also complained about the money Lloyd Properties
has invested in its campaign. As of last week, the landowners had
spent $1.33 million. SOAR had raised about $194,000 to battle three
growth-related campaigns countywide.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A covers about 3,800 acres in the rolling hills and
canyons north of Foothill Road that stretch five miles from Ventura
Avenue on the west to Victoria Avenue on the east.</TE>
<TE>   It is by far the largest single piece of vacant residential land
remaining in the Ventura area. Its 700 acres for houses compares with
about 400 acres left for homes elsewhere in the city.</TE>
<TE>   The project calls for six neighborhoods, varying in size from 20
estate homes to 435 townhomes and houses. These neighborhoods would
be connected by bike and hiking trails, said project manager Jim
Anderson.</TE>
<TE>   Two back-canyon neighborhoods farthest from the city would include
40,000 square feet of shops, stores and markets. No schools are
planned.</TE>
<TE>   The land is in unincorporated Ventura County and would have to be
annexed by the city, except for one 218-acre parcel already inside
the city limits.</TE>
<TE>   That site could be developed with up to 480 homes without a public
vote, Anderson said. Measure A proposes to build 180 houses there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a better deal for the public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents don't like the plan because they say it doesn't provide
affordable housing, which the city needs. Luxury homes in the hills
would only attract Santa Barbara commuters, Fulton said.</TE>
<TE>   Many opponents are equally frustrated by the ballot-box approval
of projects before they've been thoroughly analyzed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if our City Council had negotiated this, we would have a
much better project," said Ventura County Supervisor Steve Bennett, a
SOAR co-founder, leading Measure A opponent and hillside resident.</TE>
<TE>   "Citizens should vote at the end of the process, not in the
beginning," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not required by new SOAR-related laws approved by
voters and championed by Bennett, said Amy Forbes, the landowners'
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot argument for last year's Measure P, in fact, said a
public vote should come before a developer applies to the city.</TE>
<TE>   The public is protected, she said, because a new project such as
Measure A would then be fully analyzed by the City Council. And
council members could reject it if problems cannot be fixed or offset
by changes that are good for the city.</TE>
<TE>   Fulton rejects that reasoning, insisting that no council would
force meaningful change in a project endorsed by a majority of
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the City Council will sink it if voters have
already approved it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes notes that the landowners are taking a risk as well. If
Measure A passes, all 3,050 acres of open space must be preserved in
a land trust, even if no homes are ever built.</TE>
<TE>   "The nefarious intent everyone is trying to assign to this just
isn't there," Forbes said.</TE>

<HD>Mean Street Resurrected Into a Safe Haven</HD>
<DH>One of the toughest neighborhoods in Santa Ana celebrates
its renewal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For some Santa Ana city officials and longtime residents, it's hard
to believe: Minnie Street is now three blocks of tree-lined parkways
and clean sidewalks, a place where residents can walk in safety day
or night.</LD>
<LD>   It once was one of Santa Ana's toughest neighborhoods, where
immigrants stuffed themselves into low-rent apartments only to live
around drug dealers, prostitutes and gang members who ruled a
community of 3,500 people living in 527 apartments.</LD>
<LD>   "You really couldn't leave your apartment at night," said Araceli
Elias, a 30-year-old mother of three, who has lived on Minnie Street
six years. "Now, we'll even go and get bread at 8 or 9 p.m. without
fear, if we need to."</LD>
<TE>   The will of residents and a publicly sponsored improvement project
of 48 privately owned buildings provided the impetus for change. On
Saturday, the city celebrated completion of the exterior improvements
with food, mariachis, other entertainment and presentations by City
Councilman Jose Solorio, Assemblyman Lou Correa (D-Anaheim), and Rep.
Loretta Sanchez (D-Garden Grove).</TE>
<TE>   Improvements to apartment interiors are continuing. The
neighborhood once known as "Minnie Street" now bears a sign with gold
letters on a slate slab at its entrance that spells its new name:
Cornerstone Village. "I do remember when [an improved Minnie Street]
seemed like a pipe dream," Solorio said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, the city began an incentive program that offered
money to apartment owners for exterior improvements on the condition
they would do interior upgrades and limit to five the number of
people in each one-bedroom apartment. The goal was to sign up all
apartment owners.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of us didn't even know if we could accomplish that
task in front of us," said Pat Whittaker, Santa Ana's housing
manager.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, the city last week signed an agreement with the
last of the neighborhood property owners to join the program.</TE>
<TE>   City Housing Program Coordinator Shelly Landry Bayle said Valerie
Humphries' properties "stick out like a sore thumb. Now there will be
a nice continuity."</TE>
<TE>   Humphries, 86, who lives in Sausalito, was unavailable for
comment. Her property manager, Jim Ferryman, said he agrees and is
pleased that Humphries has agreed to the renovations.</TE>
<TE>   The apartments were built as military housing by the U.S.
government in the 1960s. About 10 years later, they were sold to
several private owners who rented them, but did not keep up with
maintenance. Dirt-cheap rents lured Mexican and Southeast Asian
immigrants. Rents remain low -- about $600 a month for a one-bedroom.</TE>
<TE>   Bayle said $6.4 million in local, state and federal money was used
to improve the building facades, stairways, decks, parkways and
sidewalks. An additional $7.8 million in bonds was issued by Santa
Ana's housing authority to help pay for the acquisition and
rehabilitation of 278 units purchased by two nonprofit organizations,
the Orange Housing Development Corp. and Jamboree Housing Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were temporarily relocated during the renovations.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Pena has lived on Minnie Street for 10 years. The truck
vendor, who sells candies, fruits and sodas, never imagined her
apartment and the street would look so good.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, just about everybody is inside by 9 p.m. Before, you could
have gotten shot out here," she said.</TE>
<TE>   At Araceli Elias' apartment, a few women who live in Cornerstone
Village have come together to examine jeans and trendy tops on a
recent afternoon. Each marvel at her new carpet, about the men
working on new steps outside her door, and the new parkways.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike before, they have hope that remaining problems --
including leaking bathroom ceilings, leaking gas stoves, cockroaches
and mice in their units -- will be addressed. About half the
neighborhood's apartment interiors have been fully renovated while
others have been partially completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We would tell them about the problems before," said one of the
women. "That we needed new paint, new plumbing. They'd say, 'If you
don't like it, go somewhere else.' Now, we feel like they have

<LD>More than 500 people stood face to face with death in Santa Ana on
Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   At a Bowers Museum event commemorating Mexico's Day of the Dead,
they saw tiny skeletons playing pool, sunbathing and posing as police
officers and mariachi musicians.</LD>
<LD>   The skeletons, some matchbook-sized and others as big as Barbie
dolls, were among more than 1,000 figures and art pieces brought to
the museum by a trio of folklore collectors from Garden Grove who
call themselves Amigas de la Cultura.</LD>
<TE>   The annual Day of the Dead event, which the Bowers has held for
nearly a decade, also included Ballet Folklorico, arts and crafts
projects for children and sugar skulls for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "Americans honor the dead," said Carole Vargas, president of the
Hispanic Arts Council of the Bowers Museum. "In Mexico, they
celebrate the dead. They put out their favorite foods, the toys they
liked to play with."</TE>
<TE>   These objects, plus the deceased person's favorite food and drink,
are traditionally placed on altars in Mexican homes to honor
ancestors or friends. On the Day of the Dead, celebrated primarily
Nov. 2, they go to the grave sites to sweep the area and bring food
to eat with the dead.</TE>
<TE>   "People in California have heard of Day of the Dead, but they
don't know what it is," said Garden Grove first-grade teacher Terri
Rocco, who with Sylvia Krenzien, and Alice Rumbaugh form the Amigas
de la Cultura. "They look at the skeletons and they see they are not
ugly. They are funny. They poke fun at death.</TE>
<TE>   "What we are trying to show is that this is definitely not
Halloween. It's something that has a deeper meaning to many people in
Mexico."</TE>

<HD>'Our Time Now,' Say Jubilant Fans</HD>

<LD>From the shores of Huntington Beach to the parched chaparral hills of
Cleveland National Forest, Angels fans basked in the glow of a World
Series victory Sunday night and boasted that Orange County has
finally bested its overbearing neighbor to the north.</LD>
<LD>   "This is an unbelievable moment!" a hoarse James Thorn, 43,
shouted as he rose from his seat at Edison International Field to the
roar of thunder sticks and fireworks. After 42 years of taking abuse
from Dodger fans, "it's our time now," he crowed. "All that L.A.
superiority and all that stuff about the Orange Curtain. It all goes
out the window tonight."</LD>
<LD>   Primed by Saturday night's adrenaline pumping come-from-behind
win, Angels fans were more than ready to celebrate Sunday's 4-1 win
over the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<TE>   Most fans did so peacefully, but there were reports of a few
unruly mobs roaming along State College Boulevard near the stadium,
setting fires and creating havoc in the roadways. Anaheim police
officials said they dispersed thousands of revelers at the
intersection of State College and Ball Road who were trying to
overturn cars and set them ablaze.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the street celebrations, Angels fans in the rest of Orange
County said taking the World Series was more than a long-awaited
victory for the home team, it was a watershed event in their lives --
and in the history of a county that has been lost in the tall, cold
shadow of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be talking about this for the rest of our lives," said
Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly. "I think this is an event that can unite a
county and remind everyone about character, determination and class.
The Angels showed all of those qualities this year."</TE>
<TE>   In a fit of after-game pride, Daly called the Angels' triumph as
significant as the opening of Disneyland almost a half-century ago.
And Daly was not alone in saying so.</TE>
<TE>   "I would imagine most people in the United States who never heard
of Anaheim, now know who we are," said Fred Smoller, chairman of the
political science department at Chapman University in Orange.</TE>
<TE>   For the average Orange County Joe, the Angels' feat far outstrips
the significance of the county's historic bankruptcy in 1994 and, in
this era, even outpaces the notoriety of the tumultuous White House
reign of the county's favorite son, Richard Milhous Nixon.</TE>
<TE>   Smoller said that for a region without its own network television
outlet, and without a unifying political personality like San
Francisco Mayor Willie Brown or former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani,
the Angels managed to do what no one else has done: unify the patch
work of suburbia, ethnic enclaves and laid-back beach cities that
define Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   At the National Sports Grill in Santa Ana, Edgar Rodriguez, 24,
was one of a dozen men who snatched at a line of shot glasses and
guzzled tequila as soon as the game was called.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally!" he shouted. "Orange County has some bragging rights in
the sports world .... We rule!"</TE>
<TE>   At another packed watering hole -- the sawdust-strewn Goat Hill
Tavern in Costa Mesa -- speakers blared Gene Autry's "Back in the
Saddle Again" while fans cried and danced and men kissed.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd live long enough to see the Berlin Wall come
down, and I never thought I would live long enough to see the Angels
win the World Series," said Gil Wiggin, 62, of Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Angels fans will gather for a victory parade Tuesday at 11 a.m. at
Arrowhead Pond.</TE>
<TE>   The parade route will run 1.3 miles from the Pond, to Edison
Field's parking lot. The event will end about 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Many Angels fans throughout the county tuned into the game or took
their seats at Edison Field with sky- high hopes Sunday night. They
were not disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   Moments before the opening pitch, Angels fan Scott Brown predicted
a slaughter. Dressed in red shirt, pants and shoes, his face swabbed
with red paint, the 37-year-old Fullerton resident resembled a
walking fire hydrant.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not predicting a close game," Brown said as he made his way
to his seat in the Diamond Club. "After last night's game, I am
confidant that it's in the bag.This team is just that good. They're
just awesome."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday night's drama struck a deep chord throughout Orange County
and played out over booming home entertainment centers, car stereos
and by word of mouth.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County has been bonded by this," said Michael Macko, 49,
of Irvine. He watched the game from the Steelhead Brewing Co. "You
know every single person in their car out there is thinking about the
same thing, and it is all good."</TE>

<HD>The Long, Lonely Nights on Windy Ridge Take Their Toll</HD>
<DH>Graveyard-shift clerks manning booths on California 241 are
busy battling boredom. Cars and time pass slowly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midnight on Windy Ridge. What little traffic there was has trailed
off. A transformer hums loudly, powering the huge lights that box out
the enfolding darkness in a 16-lane-wide rectangle of yellow glare.</LD>
<LD>   "Hullooo out there," Wendy Fox chirps to a young driver who pulls
up way wide of the open window.</LD>
<LD>   "Oops, sorry," says the young woman breathlessly, diving for
change on the floor before arching out of the car window toward the
toll taker's patiently outstretched hand. Then she is gone, and it is
quiet again.</LD>
<TE>   Night after night for four years, Fox has assumed her post at
Windy Ridge North on Orange County's Eastern toll road -- California
241. The futuristic, burnished steel toll plaza was hacked out of a
horizontal land mass thrusting up between Orange and Riverside
counties, then took its name as well.</TE>
<TE>   At midnight, the plaza atop the middle of nowhere is Hitchcock and
Edward Hopper rolled into one fluorescent, caffeine-edged movie set.
Other than the security guard, John Lumpkin, who hunkers down in an
office chair alongside the one open lane, perhaps a few dozen people
will make fleeting contact through the night with the toll-taker.</TE>
<TE>   There is a giant sense of waiting. Waiting for the houses, the
strip malls, the traffic, to surge up from the flatlands and engulf
the empty darkness on either side of the ancient ridge. The Irvine
Co. wants to build 7,500 homes here, but for now, there are just twin
parabolic necklaces of lights swooping down toward the glowing bowls
that are Irvine to the south and Corona to the north.</TE>
<TE>   Road to Development</TE>
<TE>   It is a testament to human will that the toll plaza exists.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Bren, sole owner of the Irvine Co. and of all the land on
both sides of the road, cut a deal with the California Legislature,
donating open space in exchange for public backing of bonds to
bulldoze private toll roads through the formerly impenetrable
mountainous reaches of his ranch. Even the Irvine Co. couldn't afford
the cost of roads needed to open the land to development.</TE>
<TE>   To get it built, earthmovers excavated 67 million cubic yards of
dirt, rock and brush, a quarter of the total dug for the Panama
Canal. That included 16 million cubic yards taken out of Windy Ridge,
then stacked in piles 300 feet high in canyon beds below.</TE>
<TE>   Paving crews dodged mountain lions and rattlesnakes seeking the
warmth of the freshly laid asphalt -- or the insides of their
machines. When herds of cattle wandered across, complete with angry
bulls, workers on at least one occasion clambered up on the paving
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the road opened Oct. 18, 1998, a celebratory picnic
had to be relocated from Windy Ridge and its majestic views of three
counties to a tunnel 10 miles away, after shrieking winds blew down
displays, destroyed one tent and blew another up a nearby hill.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, winter winds still whip $20 bills out of toll
attendants' hands. Huge rattlers still stretch out on the southbound
side.</TE>
<TE>   Pay as You Go</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, it is mostly human life along the road that startles.</TE>
<TE>   Mahesh S. giggles nervously when fellow employees tease him about
the limo that pulled through his lane the night before -- with four
naked women in back.</TE>
<TE>   Southern Californians, who consider freeways their birthright,
aren't used to toll roads. Vestigial memories of the New Jersey
Turnpike may linger for some, but for others, the spectacle of being
forced to slow down and pay is astonishing. The labyrinthine nature
of the transportation corridors -- which require payment for each
segment -- doesn't help.</TE>
<TE>   Like slightly cranky children on a long trip, motorists pull in
exclaiming, "I just paid! I have to pay again?" or "How much longer
is this road? How many more times do I have to pay?"</TE>
<TE>   The evening crew -- Marie C., Mahesh S., Mike P., and Wendy F., as
they are known by the name plates on the side of the tollbooths --
have learned to murmur soothing replies: "This is the last toll
before Riverside," or "Three miles to the 91," and, in kindhearted
Marie's case, when she can't change a $100 bill: "I know, I know, it
doesn't seem fair to the customer, does it?"</TE>
<TE>   In the predawn hours, the drunk, the wired and the rebellious stop
by -- or don't. Some speed up the long, steep grade, then, once they
realize there really is a tollbooth, make a U-turn on the empty road
and defiantly head the wrong way back to the 91 or the 5 freeway.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a truck driver come in scared to death one night," Fox
recalls. "Someone had just passed him going the wrong way at 80 mph."</TE>
<TE>   It is unsettling to sit in the narrow, tall cubicle and watch the
twin headlights speeding toward you again and again, then
miraculously parting left or right at the last second. Marie, who
trains new hires, says she can tell within half an hour who is going
to last on the job and who isn't, just by their reaction to the
traffic.</TE>
<TE>   "One gentleman just walked out halfway through his first shift,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   For the faint of heart and the curious, here are answers to
questions drivers may have: Yes, the toll clerks can see the
discarded fast-food wrappings, moldy gym clothes and other detritus
in your back seat, and they can hear the
rap/pop/hip-hop/oldies/NPR/baseball/Rush Limbaugh blasting out of
your speakers.</TE>
<TE>   No, they don't go to the bathroom in the booth. Evening-shift
workers get two 15-minute breaks and a half-hour break in an
eight-hour shift, leaving them just enough time to dart into the
small white office building next to the plaza to wash up, eat, or
catch a snippet of television.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the customers are regulars, hotel and construction workers
heading inland over the ridge to sleep off another day of labor in
the wealthy coastal cities. Often they come bearing trinkets. "It's
the Snapple man!" exclaims Marie on a recent Friday night. He smiles
and hands her a sample of the drink company's new flavor before
roaring off.</TE>
<TE>   Marie carefully freshens her makeup each time she takes a break.
Many of the women have elaborately manicured nails, which are, after
all, the most visible part to the customer.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, the night owl, is more casual.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the bartenders of the road," she jokes. From 30-second
interactions week after week, she knows which customers are pregnant,
which are studying for college degrees, which are going to Las Vegas
to get married that night. Once a man came through the south side
headed for New York City. Fox kindly told him that he was taking the
long way, considering his car was pointed toward the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Even the language of the computer inside the booth bespeaks an odd
intimacy -- once someone pays, the machine blinks "COMMIT" to let
them through. If someone whizzes though without paying, the machine
is "VIOLATED."</TE>
<TE>   Sleeping-Bag Blues</TE>
<TE>   In spite of the instant intimacy, there are unconscious boundaries
on both sides of the booth. Customers can give, but they have more
difficulty receiving. Fox gave a Christmas card to one regular, and
he never showed up in her lane again. But when a strange man
approached Fox in her regular grocery store smiling and waving, she
was taken aback.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I drive one of the red trucks, don't you recognize me?'
" she recalled. "I said, 'No, I do not.' "</TE>
<TE>   A Brit from industrial northern England who divorced her American
husband nearly 20 years ago, Fox never expected to find herself
working a tollbooth.</TE>
<TE>   Pay is less than $10 an hour, less than $400 a week before taxes.
She lives with her daughter in a mobile-home park in Corona and frets
when the price of a cup of coffee rises from $1.08 to $1.29.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who is studying history at UC Riverside, says she would never
be able to work a day job and go to school. She studies for several
hours each night, listening to her favorite rock 'n' roll DJ on a
boombox. At 2 a.m., the shift manager arrives and gives her an hour
break.</TE>
<TE>   She unrolls an old sleeping bag in the office inside.</TE>
<TE>   "I sleep under the table," she says. "You can't turn the lights
out."</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-eight minutes later, the phone rings -- the manager calling
from the booth. Sometimes she bangs her head on the underside of the
table sitting up, and she often loses track of where she is, here and
at home.</TE>
<TE>   Too groggy to concentrate on the textbook print anymore, she
spends the rest of the predawn hours doing crossword puzzles or
reading mail and newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to tell yourself sleep is not an option," she says.</TE>
<TE>   If she struck it rich, Fox would buy a piece of land in the
country and open an animal sanctuary. She can't bear to hear about
the deer and mountain lions that venture onto the toll road and too
often are struck and killed.</TE>
<TE>   By 4:30 a.m., the morning traffic begins to roar and throttle and
whine up the hill. She has made it through another night.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 a.m., as the sun pinks the mountain tips, she wearily removes
her thin orange vest and heads for her Saturn. As she drives down the
long artificial slope, a cheery mechanical message by the side of the
road, spelled out in dingy yellow dots: "Life's Too Short Not to Do
This All Over Again Tomorrow."</TE>

<HD>Rehearsing With Prop. 49? Maybe He'll Be Back</HD>

<LD>Arnold Schwarzenegger -- box office to ballot box. There's a lot at
stake for the brawn-and-bratwurst-born action hero, whose Prop. 49
gets its out-of-town tryout across California next Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   It's Schwarzenegger's baby -- perhaps, it's muttered, his first
real stab at public policy before running for public office. And it
would take more than half a billion dollars each year out of the
state's general fund for before- and after-school programs. This is
the same pretty unstocked pot that the state has been scraping the
bottom of this year to try to fund health and safety and other
existing programs; Schwarzenegger says not to worry: "Revenue growth"
will make up the difference.</LD>
<LD>   But there's another multimillion-dollar expenditure to which
Schwarzenegger is just saying "nein."</LD>
<TE>   An avant-garde art forum in his Austrian hometown of Graz wants to
put up a 60-plus-foot-tall Terminator monument, sketched out by
Russian artists, of the hometown hero posing Atlas-like with a globe
on his shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Price: more than $4 million. In a letter to the statue
enthusiasts, he described himself as "very flattered and honored that
such a monument would be considered" but suggested the money "be used
for much more important efforts," such as charity.</TE>
<TE>   Which, as we all know, begins at home.</TE>
<TE>   Fruits of Victory for City Boy Simon</TE>
<TE>   When a reporter from a Central Valley newspaper sandbagged Bill
Simon with the agricultural equivalent of the "how much does a gallon
of milk cost" question often posed to (male) candidates, Simon scored
20%.</TE>
<TE>   But hey, who knew? At an exhibit at the Central Valley's Heritage
Complex in Tulare about the difference between fruits and vegetables,
a Sacramento Bee columnist asked Simon which of the following is a
fruit: cucumbers, peppers, squash, corn and tomatoes. Simon guessed
cucumbers. Technically, all five are fruits, so clip this and put it
on the refrigerator for whoever is telling you to eat your
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Simon has received the endorsement of the vast
California Farm Bureau Federation. It praised his understanding of
"the complex issues facing our industry [and] the value of our
farming community in the state's economy," but did not pose any trick
animal-vegetable-fruit-mineral questions.</TE>
<TE>   Capitol Expose at X-Ray Machine</TE>
<TE>   A clear case of X-ray vision. New security screening at the state
Capitol began requiring virtually everyone and everything to be
X-rayed, including brown-bag lunches. "I'll show you a million items
you can put in a baloney sandwich that will hurt people, kill people,
maim people or blow people up," said Tony Beard Jr., the Senate's
sergeant-at-arms, in the Capitol Morning Report.</TE>
<TE>   (It's like the old file-in-the-cake trick in prison movies ... but
then again, the stuff baloney's made of may already pose its own
hazards.)</TE>
<TE>   Some Capitol workers got to worrying that this was like having
their food irradiated -- which Beard says it is not -- so a
compromise was arrived at: Anything that can be adequately inspected
in a clear container, a plastic bag or bottle, can bypass the zapper.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of people may take the new security personally, says Beard,
"and I understand that -- we're checking them although they've been
here 25 years." Is anybody exempt? "The governor will probably walk
around it," says Beard. "The thing with the governor is, he's with a
protective detail and we defer to them ....The [staff and security]
people with him will walk through it."</TE>
<TE>   The state Senate signs Beard's paycheck, and state Senate
President John Burton, a very recognizable and prickly character, is
therefore Beard's boss.</TE>
<TE>   "If John Burton walks around it," Beard acknowledges, "I'm not
gonna tell John Burton to walk through it. He's not a threat ...
[but] he certainly complies with it, and he realizes his role -- he's
pretty good about it."</TE>
<TE>   Who's Standing Between Chief and City Attorney?</TE>
<TE>   What city attorney of California's biggest city has had, as of
last reports, no -- repeat no -- face time with new LAPD Chief Bill
Bratton, meaning the city of Los Angeles' top prosecutor has not yet
met with the city's new top cop?</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that the mayor of Los Angeles is keeping his new
appointee joined at the hip, considering that the city attorney,
Rocky Delgadillo, is being bruited about as a possible candidate for
mayor himself?</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * In the category "Secession," the answer is "Alex Trebek," and
the question is: "What quiz show host, who lives in Studio City, gave
$100 to the San Fernando secession movement?"</TE>
<TE>   * History-minded David Gershwin, the spokesman for L.A. City
Council President Alex Padilla, finds it noteworthy that election
day, Nov. 5, the day the city votes on whether to endorse the San
Fernando Valley's insurrection, is Guy Fawkes Day in Great Britain --
commemorating the day in 1605 that Fawkes and his band tried to blow
up Parliament, a plot that was foiled. The jingle recited ever since:
"Remember, remember/the fifth of November/gunpowder, treason and
plot."</TE>
<TE>   * How good was the World Series for Orange County? The Nixon
Library's press release about its Johnny Cash exhibit informed the
press that the Yorba Linda library is just "15 minutes from Anaheim
Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   * In the four years since he died in a skiing accident, Sonny Bono
has had his name appended to a 40-mile stretch of Interstate 10, a
wildlife refuge at the Salton Sea, and now an airport concourse --
the Sonny Bono Concourse, at Palm Springs International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   * Who was that mystery guest? During a Fox TV showing of a World
Series game in Anaheim, the camera kept cutting to Disney's jefe,
Michael Eisner, and identifying him as such, but no mention was made
of the man next to him -- Gov. Gray Davis.</TE>
<TE>   * Ballpark bets: Anaheim area Reps. Chris Cox and Loretta Sanchez
made the standard World Series wagers, Disney tickets against the
wine and chocolates bet by San Francisco Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Tom
Lantos. Ah, but then Cox upped the ante, offering to sing "I Left My
Heart in San Francisco" while wearing a tie-dyed shirt and flowers in
his hair (from the sappy 1960s song that goes in part, "If you're
goin' to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair").
And Lantos countered that he would sing "Back in the Saddle Again,"
the theme song of the Angels' late owner, Gene Autry, while kitted
out in cowboy hat, holsters and pistols. Sanchez and Pelosi agreed to
sing harmony. Surely someone will record this for posterity?</TE>
<TE>   * Gary Mendoza gave up his choice post as a young attorney at a
white-shoe law firm in 1988 to work for his pal, Rep. Chris Cox. Now
Cox returns the favor, becoming the single biggest contributor in
Mendoza's run for state insurance commissioner. Cox gave the
Republican Mendoza $25,000, and a $100,000 loan. Mendoza got another
$20,000 from his former law partner, ex-L.A. Mayor Dick Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   ''Mr. Bradbury, you are a cowardly, lying D.A.!''</TE>
<TE>   Ventura County gadfly Carroll Dean Williams, unforgiving to the
last, at a Ventura County Board of Supervisors meeting, where
Williams took his parting shot at retiring Ventura County Dist. Atty.
Mike Bradbury, who has spent 24 years on the job and has been a
favored target for Williams' ferocity. After his on-the-record blast,
Williams walked to Bradbury with a request for copies of public
records, then paused, and handed them instead to Bradbury's
successor, Greg Totten. Bradbury slapped Totten heartily (and
relievedly) on the back.</TE>

<TE>   CAMPAIGN TRAIL GEAR: Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon
Jr., sporting a lei on a recent San Diego stop, signs a surfboard for
a charity auction after speaking engagement with former New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis, far right with

Gary Sim, wears less festive attire during a tour of the DNA Database
Crime Lab in Richmond for a review of the state's DNA Cold Hit

police said.</LD>
<TE>   "We are trying to determine what occurred between where the body
came to rest and where the blood leads to," said Sgt. Rick Martinez
of the Anaheim Police Department. "It's difficult to tell."</TE>
<TE>   The body was in an area just over the city line in Orange.</TE>

<HD>7th Heaven as Angels Win Series</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forget the decades of heartache. The big games that always ended in
frustration. Forget all those wait-until-next-years.</LD>
<LD>   The Anaheim Angels have won the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   They won in nothing less than a deciding seventh game, with
nothing less than a come-from-behind 4-1 victory over the San
Francisco Giants.</LD>
<TE>   To make the triumph sweeter, they won at Edison Field before
44,598 of the faithful who had suffered with them.</TE>
<TE>   "These fans have been waiting a long, long time," third baseman
Troy Glaus said. "And I know we're all happy to be part of the team
to bring it to them."</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk of a California rivalry, north vs. south, the
Series was more about a ballclub confronting its own demons.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels overcame 42 years of futility in storybook fashion.</TE>
<TE>   They got off to the worst start in franchise history but rebounded
with late-inning victories in dozens of games through the regular
season and playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Their rallying cry was "Win One for the Cowboy," a reference to
Gene Autry, who owned the team through lean years and did not live to
see this title.</TE>
<TE>   Even Orange County earned a bit of redemption, celebrating its
first championship team, commanding a national spotlight while
leaving glitzy Los Angeles and its Dodgers in the shadows.</TE>
<TE>   But most of all, this victory was about fans who had watched their
team reach the playoffs three times in the last two decades only to
fall one game, one out, even one strike short of crucial victories.</TE>
<TE>   Not this time.</TE>
<TE>   After the final out, Edison erupted in a frenzy of cheering. Fans
yelled and screamed but could not quite describe their joy, returning
again and again to words such as "unbelievable" and "incredible."</TE>
<TE>   From his seat in right field, Steve Deleon of Los Alamitos said:
"The ghosts are gone."</TE>
<TE>   They might have flown north to San Francisco, where the Giants
have now lost all three of their Series appearances since moving from
New York in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   This time, they came within six outs of clinching the title in
Game 6.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a difficult time right now," San Francisco Manager Dusty
Baker said. "Your heart is heavy."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no one felt the pain more than Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The last two seasons, the Giant outfielder has been historic at
the plate. He hit a record 73 homers in 2001, then returned this
season to lead the league with a .370 batting average and establish
another record with 198 walks. The records continued to fall in
postseason play, which had always been a bugaboo for the leftfielder.</TE>
<TE>   But critics -- and with the prickly Bonds, there are many --
continued to ask: Can he lead a team to the championship?</TE>
<TE>   Not this time, not against this Angel team.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of this hotly contested Series, fans in both
cities watched the momentum shift in ways both subtle and powerful.</TE>
<TE>   Subtle was the bunt that rolled foul, then curved back fair to
ignite a Giant rally in Game 4. San Francisco won twice at Pacific
Bell Park to lead three games to two. Powerful -- almost unbelievable
-- was the Angels fighting back from a five-run deficit Saturday to
tie the series at three games each.</TE>
<TE>   The deciding game began in familiar fashion with the Giants taking
a 1-0 lead in the second inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels followed with their now trademark rally, tying the game
on catcher Bengie Molina's double in the bottom of the inning.</TE>
<TE>   They scored the decisive runs in the third, Garret Anderson
nailing a high fastball down the right field line for a three-run
double and a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   That was all the offense his team needed. Pitcher John Lackey
became the first rookie starter to win a seventh game in 93 years,
and reliever Francisco Rodriguez added another strong performance.</TE>
<TE>   But no Angel game would be complete without a little anxiety. The
Giants put two runners on base in the ninth before closer Troy
Percival ended the game by inducing a fly out to center field.</TE>
<TE>   At a park in San Francisco, a giant screen showing the game went
blank as fans walked quietly away. Rory Davis, 17, bemoaned the
Giants' collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "We had it in the bag," he said. "This was the one chance for our
generation to get the Series, and now we'll have to live with this."</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown had confidently predicted victory
two days ago but now has lost a wager with Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and
must wear a cowboy hat in the style of Autry.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing my staff will do in the morning will be to
confirm Mayor Brown's hat size," Daly said. "I have a feeling it may
have shrunk a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Anaheim fans will get a chance to celebrate with the
team Tuesday during a parade that begins at 11 a.m. at the Arrowhead
Pond and travels west along Katella Avenue. There will be a ceremony
in front of Edison Field lasting until 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to use a Disney line, but it's definitely a Cinderella
story," said Greg Parham, 42, of Glendora. "Coming from the absolute
worse start in franchise history to this victory, this team is
nothing short of magical."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, named the Series' most valuable player, will be on hand to
address the crowd but might not have much more to say than the
cheering masses at Edison on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point," he said after the game, "I don't know how I'm
feeling except ecstatic."</TE>

<LD>The three conference tables were arrayed in an angular U, but, lest
the configuration signal any sort of unneighborly disconnection at
its open end, that part was closed by a semicircle of brightly
colored plastic chairs.</LD>
<LD>   Around the tables and in the chairs sat 20 people, variously clad
in denim and tailored wool, tasseled loafers and cowboy boots. All of
them live in, work in or otherwise have an interest in Sun Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The "stakeholders" in the nascent, Los Angeles city-certified Sun
Valley Area Neighborhood Council's formation committee gathered in a
conference room at Industrial Metal Supply on a recent weekday
evening to sift some of the finer elements of democratic process and
mold them into usable shape.</LD>
<TE>   At the behest of the city Department of Neighborhood Empowerment,
which oversees neighborhood councils, the participants had come to
wrangle their bylaws into harmony with their proposed guidelines for
electing a board of directors. The discussion turned to late write-in
candidates who might file to run after a cutoff date to be determined
by the council's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is," said Louis Avila, a county deputy district
attorney, "this says the date is to be set by the board of directors.
Well, we won't have a board of directors yet. That's what the
election will be for."</TE>
<TE>   "Shall we say, 'As set by the formation committee,' then?" offered
Tony Bracy, who works for a local nonprofit rehabilitation center for
the homeless and drug users called People in Progress, and who led
the others through the proposed bylaw changes.</TE>
<TE>   "But as soon as we elect a board of directors we, as a formation
committee, will be out of business," said a neighborhood activist,
Victoria Burch.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would we want people to be able to run if they miss the
deadline to apply anyway?" asked a real estate broker, Sam Khalaf.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," said a Mission Valley Bank vice president, Carol Dignard,
the meeting's chairwoman, "It's a protection. Some of the
neighborhood councils aren't doing a good job reaching out to people.
We don't want stakeholders coming by after the deadline and saying,
'I didn't know about this.' Our goal is maximum participation."</TE>
<TE>   "It's more democratic," affirmed Jerry Piro, an activist with the
Sun Valley Neighborhood Improvement Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be proud of our Sun Valley Neighborhood Council,"
said a flooring contractor, Jose Garcia. "If somebody comes to us
late, we say 'Welcome!' "</TE>
<TE>   Such patient inclusiveness is a hallmark of the Sun Valley group
and, observers believe, of many of the other 50 (and counting)
neighborhood councils that have been certified by the city of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The councils, established as advisory bodies under the new city
charter, have been a favorite rhetorical target of secession-movement
leaders in the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood, who have dismissed
them as impotent and irrelevant, a sop to residents' legitimate
dissatisfaction with the way City Hall does business.</TE>
<TE>   The dichotomy between neighborhood councils and secession,
however, may not be quite that clear-cut. Last week, the
city-sanctioned Woodland Hills Neighborhood Council became the first
such body formally to endorse San Fernando Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   Although members of the Sun Valley Neighborhood Council were hard
at work under the auspices of the city, an impromptu poll on
secession showed that fully 13 of them favored seceding; five were
undecided.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter if we're part of the city of Los Angeles or
not," said Victoria Burch. "We are very committed to our community."</TE>
<TE>   No matter the outcome of the secession vote on Nov. 5,
neighborhood councils seem destined to become permanent fixtures in
local civic life. Even secession supporters say they would like a new
Valley city to have some kind of councils.</TE>
<TE>   If Los Angeles remains whole, the councils could well be the
principal champions of greater City Hall responsiveness to the needs
of neighborhoods, one of the rallying cries of the secession
movement.</TE>
<TE>   That's a commentary on the councils themselves -- groups of
dedicated citizens are always hard for politicians to ignore -- but
it also speaks to the nature of L.A., a city with few power centers.
In such a place, any concentration of influence captures the
attention of elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   That politicians are already paying attention is evident. Present
at the Sun Valley gathering were Manny Figueras, a field
representative for state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar), and David
Hernandez, an insurance adjuster who is running simultaneously for
mayor of the proposed Valley city and for Congress in the 28th
District.</TE>
<TE>   Neighborhood councils such as Sun Valley's, Hernandez said, are
made up of "individuals that by their actions demonstrate their
loyalty to the community, and any city that doesn't avail itself of
them is really shortsighted."</TE>
<TE>   "The power neighborhood council members are going to have is that
they're connected, and their neighbors are going to look to them at
election time. What the city of L.A. has done is wake a sleeping
giant."</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Sun Valley body were undeterred by the advisory
nature of their assigned role in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe, after a few years, they're going to see they need us,
and L.A. will change its mind and give neighborhood councils more
power," said Roy Garcia, a Sun Valley resident who is running for a
city council seat in the proposed San Fernando Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Observers have been impressed by how hard the councils have worked
at being inclusive, making sure that stakeholders -- ranging from
residents and businesses to volunteer organizations and churches,
from public-affairs veterans to callow novices -- are embraced.</TE>
<TE>   Not that inclusiveness doesn't have its limits.</TE>
<TE>   After finally wrestling the bylaws into submission, the Sun Valley
council participants agreed to examine a final complete draft of the
rules at the next week's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   "And remember," said the discussion leader, Tony Bracy, "the
changes we made today will be only on pages 2, 3 and 4 of the
bylaws."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," cautioned Chairwoman Dignard. "Some of us have been working
on this for a year, and so, if you're a newcomer and next week you
decide you want changes on page 20 -- look out!"</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Soccer Teams Seek Level Playing Field</HD>
<DH>As participation outgrows available facilities, some
involved say the city is devoting resources to other sports instead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every Saturday morning, the patchy brown and green field at Fremont
Intermediate School in Oxnard is carved into a crowded hodgepodge of
small soccer fields for almost 2,000 youngsters.</LD>
<LD>   The 10-acre site, owned and maintained by the Oxnard Elementary
School District, has holes and dirt mounds, brown grass where it
should be green, dirt where there should be grass.</LD>
<LD>   The conditions are not ideal. But the children make the best of
it, because they know everyone else is in the same boat.</LD>
<TE>   In Oxnard, more than 5,000 kids play organized soccer on 14 city
and school fields.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, as the number of youth soccer players swells and the
field space remains the same, coaches say they are left to their own
ingenuity to accommodate so many. They've shortened playing times and
reconfigured fields to take up as little space as possible, but these
measures only help for a while.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches say they need more fields, they need them soon and they
want City Hall to take notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago nobody mentioned this was a problem, but now we're
kind of waking up," said Ruben Munoz, commissioner of the American
Youth Soccer Organization in Oxnard. His north Oxnard division has
grown from 102 to 182 teams in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like the city doesn't know the number of kids we're dealing
with," Munoz added. "They seem like they sympathize with us, but
there's never any action."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches say they've written letters, signed petitions and attended
countless meetings, but the city just doesn't respond. They say they
need to become more organized and get more working parents involved.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of these kids' parents, they work late and don't have time
to go to meetings," said Arnulfo Carbajal, treasurer of the Ventura
County Youth Soccer League. "We really don't have that kind of pull
out here."</TE>
<TE>   City leaders say they support youth sports and understand the
concern, but the city's parks must accommodate all types of sports
for people of all ages and that takes time, planning and patience.</TE>
<TE>   "We do understand that there is a need, and we're doing our best,"
said Richard Arias, of the city's recreation and community services
department. "There might never be enough space for the number of
players we have in all sports of different ages."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches for the larger leagues don't think they can wait much
longer.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that next year we probably won't have the room,"
Munoz said of his organization, which has about 3,000 players. "We're
just praying that we don't have to cut registration."</TE>
<TE>   Relief will come when the 74-acre College Park undergoes a
$15-million make-over, officials have said. The city's improvement
plan calls for development in coming years of five baseball and
soccer fields, a lighted basketball area, a fenced skate park and a
26,000-square-foot community center with a gym.</TE>
<TE>   But soccer coaches and parents point to College Park as proof that
the sport is treated like a second-class citizen.</TE>
<TE>   Original plans for the south Oxnard park included 10
regulation-size soccer fields. But 10 fields of that size would have
turned the park into a soccer facility, and residents wanted a mix of
activities.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an attorney and soccer mom, said soccer will
never catch up to older, more established sports in town if not given
appropriate facilities.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up playing baseball, frankly, but we're living in a
different world," Macri-Ortiz said. "I feel that they aren't ready
for the concept of saying we're so behind in soccer that we should
have more of a percentage of fields."</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Torres, a coach for the Aztecas team, composed mostly of
farm workers and children of workers from the Pictsweet Mushroom
Farm, said the city's College Park plan demonstrates the low priority
given to the largely Latino soccer community.</TE>
<TE>   "All we're trying to do is give these kids something to do, to
keep them off the streets, out of gangs, and they don't give us what
we need but do all they can to accommodate the people who want to
build a museum?" Torres said, referring to plans to build a heritage
farm museum at the park. "It just seems like we're not a priority."</TE>
<TE>   Macri-Ortiz is more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a bias in the community," Ortiz said. "It's easy to
dismiss soccer because some still think of it as the foreigners'
sport, the Latinos' sport. The truth is a lot of farm workers and
their children play soccer. But those are the kinds of problems
people don't like to talk about."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Manuel Lopez said he doesn't think other sports are
considered more important.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer hasn't been in town as long as other sports, so it's going
to take some time for them to catch up, but we're trying," Lopez
said. "Running a city is like having a big family. Your children will
accuse you of playing favorites, but you treat all of them the same."</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard's children don't seem to take notice of the controversy.
But older players such as Jennifer Santiago, 17, say they remember
the days when they weren't so cramped.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to play on regular-sized fields, but every year they
rearrange us," said Santiago, who has played soccer in Oxnard since
she was a little girl. "When you play soccer, the whole idea is to be
spread out. You can work with the smaller space, but it makes a
difference."</TE>

<LD>Eager but humble, the silver-haired politician waits politely while
the front door swings open.</LD>
<LD>   "Hi, Mary, I'm Roger Stanton. I don't know if you remember me," he
says with a smile.</LD>
<LD>   "I sure do; you bet," responds Mary Talbot, a senior citizen who
has lived on a quiet Fountain Valley cul-de-sac for years.</LD>
<TE>   Stanton, 65, is campaigning with a vengeance for a seat on the
Fountain Valley City Council -- and political redemption.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, Stanton was one of Orange County's rising political
stars, a dominant figure on the Board of Supervisors often talked
about as a candidate for Congress or statewide office.</TE>
<TE>   But that was before 1994, when Orange County plunged into
bankruptcy. Stanton, chairman of the board at the time, was harshly
criticized for letting the financial crisis happen on his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Eight years later, Stanton says he's "refreshed and ready" to
reenter the political fray.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran political observers, longtime foes and even old friends
said they are stunned by his run, especially because he says he wants
to restore fiscal accountability to the city.</TE>
<TE>   "I just almost fell off my chair," said Mark Petracca, a UC Irvine
political science professor. "I guess in Fountain Valley it is
possible to run away from your past."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton seems to be banking on the fact that many voters don't
remember or care about the county bankruptcy, and his strategy could
prove to be a winning one.</TE>
<TE>   Many voters either don't remember Stanton, and are glad to see a
candidate at their front door, or seem to be willing to let bygones
be bygones.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought he was pretty good to us when he was up at the
county," said Gemma Novello, 79, vice president of the Fountain
Valley Senior Club. "He got money for us."</TE>
<TE>   Ghosts of the past do pop up.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I won't vote for him," said Jack DeFratus, a Fountain Valley
resident since 1966. The bankruptcy "was pretty stupid. All these
politicians, they think you forget it, what they did in the past.
Well, we remember. I'd vote to keep him out."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton responded that everyone is entitled to an opinion and that
he will be grateful for every vote. He said he decided to run again
while having coffee this summer with other former city politicians
who thought it was time for a change. The day before the deadline, he
went to City Hall and filed. For a council race, he is conducting an
aggressive campaign, gathering endorsements that include Sheriff
Michael S. Carona; Gaddi Vasquez, Peace Corps director and also a
former supervisor; other former and current supervisors; and school
board trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly all of his reported contributors so far are from outside
the city, including longtime county lobbyist Frank Michelena, former
Irvine Co. executive Gary Hunt and other developers. Stanton is not
using the $120,000 he still has in the bank from county races. He
would not rule out using those funds for possible future, higher
office -- perhaps a run for Assemblyman Ken Maddox's seat in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "Never say never," he said with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   The race in this tidy, older bedroom community of 57,000 could be
close, and the field is crowded. Since Mayor Laurann Cook chose to
step down after five terms, seven candidates, including three
incumbents, are seeking to fill three seats. Stanton is returning to
the public stage after spending six years in academia, as a professor
of business management at Cal State Long Beach and as a fellow at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. A 22-year veteran of public
office, he says that he would support a city ballot for term limits
if that's what the voters want and that it's time for "new blood" in
government.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm new, experienced blood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chairman of the board when the county lost $1.7 billion through
bad investments, he is now campaigning on a platform of fiscal
accountability. He says that sitting council members have spent way
too much money -- more than $800,000 -- on a "gaudy" new fountain in
front of Fountain Valley City Hall and that seniors and kids are
being wrongly charged fees for paramedic services and access to ball
fields.</TE>
<TE>   Current officials seem almost bewildered by the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard one citizen complain about the fountain," said
veteran council member John Collins, who notes that Stanton endorsed
him in 1994 by saying, "Collins is a tough fiscal manager whose
leadership and hard work have saved taxpayers significant money."</TE>
<TE>   Collins and city staff say the fountain and plaza were paid for
with a $100,000 donation from a software company, set-asides from
developer fees, and redevelopment money.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime foes question Stanton's campaign platform.</TE>
<TE>   "Fiscal accountability? That is the most hysterical thing I have
ever heard, for a guy who was in charge of the board at a time when
the county went bankrupt," said former county administrative officer
Ernie Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   He and others note that Stanton voted to approve $600 million in
speculative investments that eventually led to the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton and two other county officials faced civil misconduct
charges -- eventually dismissed -- for failing to prevent the
bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Stanton said comparing county investments and city expenditures is
like comparing apples and oranges. He usually avoids mention of his
tenure as board chairman during the bankruptcy, saying, "It's history
that's been told a thousand times." He refers to himself in campaign
literature as "the city's representative on the board of
supervisors."</TE>
<TE>   But when pressed, he defends his work then, as do many supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I stayed. I did my job," he said. "I helped get the county out of
it, as well as providing 14 other years of service."</TE>
<TE>   Former Fountain Valley Mayor Ben Nielsen, who is backing him, said
that Stanton did nothing wrong before the bankruptcy by listening to
financial advisors and county staff and acting on their advice on
investments.</TE>
<TE>   After the collapse, he said, "Roger was a stabilizing force on
that board; he was one of the guys who got us through it. There were
other supervisors who quit."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton, known as temperamental -- at times pugnacious -- is also
working hard to project himself as a courteous man of the people.
Many local and county officials declined to comment about him on the
record. Those who did didn't mince words. "Roger is very difficult to
work with," said Mayor Cook. "I've been on the other side of the
podium as an elected official, and as president of the League of
Cities, and he was difficult to deal with. All I can say is Roger is
known to be abrupt; he is hard on his staff."</TE>
<TE>   But Cheryl Brothers, a former Stanton aide also running for the
Fountain Valley council, said, "He always was very much a gentleman
and a professional with me."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton said: "My model is to be cooperative, to be cordial. I
believed very strongly in what I was doing. If somebody feels
differently, that's their privilege."</TE>
<TE>   After years in academia, he clearly relishes being back on the
trail. He studies local precinct sheets like a field marshal, has
stacks of yard signs and piles of fliers printed on his home computer
and has already knocked on more than 1,000 doors.</TE>
<TE>   After winning a promise of a vote recently from Mark Loukides, 44,
who has lived in Fountain Valley for 13 years, Stanton said: "The
last time I was here was the year before they moved in. I remember
things by election years; the last time I walked this precinct was
1988."</TE>
<TE>   Stanton pauses, tired but elated after successful politicking on a
quiet side street. Seven people answered the door, none said anything
negative. One man was studying his absentee ballot when Stanton
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "That's money in the bank," he said. "They'll all vote for me;
those are all positives."</TE>

<LD>A man has been arrested in connection with the presumed death of a
man who was thrown off a party boat in San Francisco Bay, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses told police they saw someone being thrown overboard
about 11:30 p.m. Saturday, Police Inspector Sergio Chin said. About
275 people were aboard for a Halloween party.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested the suspect when the boat, the Royal Prince,
returned to the pier, Sgt. Neville Gittens said. The unidentified man
was being held Sunday on suspicion of murder, he said.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. Coast Guard used helicopters and a cutter to search
through the night, but hadn't found anyone by midafternoon Sunday, a
Coast Guard spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators boarded the boat at Pier 43 1/2 to interview
witnesses. Chin said it was unclear whether alcohol played a role in
the attack. The victim's girlfriend and several friends were with
him, Chin said.</TE>

<HD>9th District Hopefuls Put Focus on Safety</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Krikorian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Canoga Park and Winnetka neighborhoods that would comprise most
of the 9th District of the proposed San Fernando Valley city have
some of the lowest crime rates in Los Angeles. But public safety
issues are still the top priorities of most of the nine candidates
for the council seat.</LD>
<LD>   "Crime is a big issue," said Jerry Wang, 33, a computer programmer
who lives in a Winnetka condominium. "My car was broken into and it
took six hours for the police to take a report. It shouldn't take
that long. I want to make this a safer place."</LD>
<LD>   The district is bounded roughly by Roscoe Boulevard on the north,
Topanga Canyon Boulevard on the west, Vanowen Street on the south and
Wilbur Avenue on the east. It includes a small part of Reseda.</LD>
<TE>   The 14-member council will take office only if Valley secession
wins on the Nov. 5 ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Wang said that, if elected, he would encourage residents to help
the police by being their "eyes and ears."</TE>
<TE>   Retired elementary school teacher Wilma Bennett said that cracked
sidewalks, graffiti and weeds can worsen crime by creating the
appearance of a neighborhood in decline.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many wonderful neighborhoods here, but many have
little problems that lead to major problems," said Bennett, 62.
"Research has shown kids do better in a troubled home in a good
neighborhood than in a good home in a troubled neighborhood. We need
to fix things before they get out of hand."</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Clary said he has heard residents talk a lot about crime as
he campaigns in this mostly middle-class, ethnically mixed district.
But he said he also hears complaints about a general lack of
services.</TE>
<TE>   "They talk about potholes and roads that are not fixed," said
Clary, an estate planning attorney. "Yes, security issues are big,
but a lot of it is due to the perception that there is a lot of
crime."</TE>
<TE>   Clary, 49, said he wants to sit on the council so he could
"continue the work I've been doing in revitalizing downtown Canoga."
He is president of the volunteer supporters of the 5-year-old Madrid
playhouse, which replaced the X-rated Pussycat movie house.</TE>
<TE>   Michael N. Cohen, 58, who has been active in Valley VOTE for two
years, admitted that running for Valley council may not be the wisest
move. "We all have to be idiots to run for a position that doesn't
exist and would pay $12,000 a year," said Cohen, a financial manager.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Cohen said he wants average residents to have more local
control over city government. "People are almost barricaded in their
homes," said Cohen, a former block captain in his Reseda
neighborhood. "The cops are spread too thin."</TE>
<TE>   Retired schoolteacher Linnea Eades has lived in her Winnetka home
for 40 years. She's seen her quiet neighborhood afflicted by "the
same problems you see all over the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   "The rising crime rate shows we need more police," said Eades, 64,
who plays violin for the San Fernando Valley Symphony Orchestra. "The
homeless are a problem too. You might not see them because they try
to hide. We need to have a place for the homeless."</TE>
<TE>   Robert Lamishaw, another longtime Winnetka resident, agreed with
new Los Angeles Police Chief William J. Bratton's recent statement
that stopping graffiti is crucial to fighting crime. "Graffiti is a
substantial problem that is indicative of potentially more serious
problems if allowed to go unchecked," said Lamishaw, 53. "I want to
help make Canoga Park and Winnetka one of the most desirable and
solid middle-class areas in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Only one candidate, Leonard Miropol, says crime is not a major
problem in the area.</TE>
<TE>   "Crime is not a big concern," said Miropol, 54, who grew up in the
Fairfax district and has lived in Winnetka for two years. "It's
pretty low, especially compared to other parts of town."</TE>
<TE>   Miropol, a teacher, said easing traffic congestion is a more
urgent need. He wants to add bus lines to the district.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Topaloff, a former Marine, is among those concerned about
crime. "I used to give my kids 50 cents to go buy something at the
corner store," said Topaloff, 66, a retired salesman. "Now I wouldn't
send my wife."</TE>
<TE>   Several attempts to reach candidate Matthew Lynch were
unsuccessful.</TE>

<HD>No Love for Simon in Republican Stronghold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE>One in an occasional series of conversations with California
voters.</SE>
<AU>Michael Finnegan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>Debbie Lueck winces when breakfast conversation at Zingo's truck-stop
diner turns to Gray Davis and Bill Simon Jr.</LD>
<LD>   "They're both slime," she said over a plate of biscuits and gravy.
"You can't trust either one of them."</LD>
<LD>   Simon, the Republican candidate for governor, seems "sneaky" to
the 42-year-old bank-vault registrar.</LD>
<TE>   "He's hiding stuff," she said. "He's got an agenda that he doesn't
just spit out and tell you what it is."</TE>
<TE>   In every election she can remember, Lueck voted for the Republican
at the top of the ticket: George W. Bush, Dan Lungren, Bob Dole. But
next week, she plans to skip the contest for governor and cast votes
only in races lower on the ballot. To her, Simon is no better than
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "Their integrity is in the gutter," she said. "Both of them."</TE>
<TE>   Lueck and many other Republicans in this GOP stronghold knew
little about Simon when they voted for him in the March primary,
apart from his endorsement by former New York City Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani.</TE>
<TE>   Given what they have learned since then, many Republicans here
view Simon as a flawed -- in some cases unacceptable -- alternative
to the Democratic governor.</TE>
<TE>   "They're both clowns in my opinion," said Sam Stewart, 40, a
Republican motorcycle mechanic who plans to vote for Simon despite
his low regard for the Pacific Palisades investment banker.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of enthusiasm for Simon in Bakersfield illustrates the
party's difficulty in drawing a strong turnout of Republicans in the
Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see them voting for Gray Davis; I just see them staying
home," said GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's lackluster support within his own party mirrors the
trouble that Davis faces with many Democrats, particularly liberals.
Among likely voters, only two out of three Republicans support Simon,
as just two out of three Democrats back Davis, according to a poll
released last week by the Public Policy Institute of California.</TE>
<TE>   But in a state with 1.4 million more Democrats than Republicans,
tepid backing among party loyalists poses a more serious challenge to
Simon -- especially with polls thus far showing Davis well ahead
among independents. So a strong Republican turnout is crucial for
Simon in Bakersfield and other GOP bastions in the Central Valley.</TE>
<TE>   To gauge likely Republican turnout, Bakersfield GOP strategist
Mark Abernathy keeps tabs on applications for absentee ballots in the
area. So far, he said, the party's share is falling below
expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "Republican enthusiasm seems to be low," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's campaign team is counting on a final spurt of TV ads
bashing Davis to galvanize Republicans. Indeed, most of Simon's
firepower in the general election has hewn to the notion that if
voters can be reminded that they dislike Davis, they will
enthusiastically endorse Simon.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, however unpopular Davis may be, it's clear that much of
Simon's support is halfhearted in this Republican farm and oil
region. Republican housewife Laura Lamas of Pumpkin Center, just
south of Bakersfield, said Simon "doesn't know what's going on" in
agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   "What in his background gives him the knowledge of what's going on
in this valley, this breadbasket?" she asked as she climbed out of a
pickup to buy dog food at Bugni Bros. Hardware and Feed.</TE>
<TE>   Among party loyalists, what has most wounded Simon is a perception
-- fed in large part by Davis attack ads -- that he is a dishonest
businessman.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't trust him as far as I can throw him," Republican
hairstylist Christy White, 20, said while a co-worker did her nails
at a Bakersfield salon. Outside the salon, Lori Christian, a
Republican elementary schoolteacher, said: "I just don't feel like
he's real honest." Both White and Christian are tilting toward Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Simon is heavily favored in Bakersfield. Republicans
-- even those who lose statewide -- typically trounce Democratic
rivals here. In the 1998 governor's race, Lungren lost statewide by
20 points, but clobbered Davis in Bakersfield, 58% to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Many Bakersfield voters are from the families of Dust Bowl farmers
who migrated from the South and Midwest in the 1930s. Others are
transplants from Texas, Louisiana and other oil states; they followed
jobs to the Bakersfield area, where bobbing pumps are as common as
crop dusters.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, Simon is philosophically in sync with the
city's conservative electorate, notably in his opposition to abortion
rights and gun control.</TE>
<TE>   "This is Kern County; everybody and their uncle's got a gun," said
John Carlson, 56, a barber who manages a trailer park. "I've got
three of them."</TE>
<TE>   At Carlson's barber shop next to a lumberyard in hardscrabble
Oildale, on the northern outskirts of town, a portrait of John Wayne
hangs on the mirror next to a Veterans of Foreign Wars sticker.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson, a Vietnam vet, is a loyal Republican who blames Davis for
a spike in power costs during the energy crisis. The governor
"bankrupted a lot of people over that energy stuff," he said. "It was
just awful."</TE>
<TE>   Elderly residents of Carlson's trailer park relied on church
handouts to pay their power bills, Carlson said, lathering the back
of a customer's neck and taking to it with a buzzing razor.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the seniors were really sucking wind over there," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   To Carlson, the main attraction of Simon is that he "says he's not
going to be swayed by lobbyists and stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody's better than Davis," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans view that anti-Davis sentiment -- widely shared in
Bakersfield -- as their prime motivator for party turnout.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon's votes are driven by the Davis haters," said veteran GOP
strategist Tony Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   Those who dislike Davis most are conservative Republicans, Simon's
political base. Among them is Judy Davis, a former oil-truck driver
having breakfast at Zingo's with her husband, Bob Davis. What bothers
her most about the governor is his endorsement by environmental
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I check into who's backed by the Sierra Club," she said. "If
they're backed up by the Sierra Club, I vote against them, because
I'm an off-roader."</TE>
<TE>   At a picnic table outside Zingo's, Republican truck driver Lance
Rosen, 36, said he was leaning toward Simon, but with misgivings.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen, who hauls propane and butane around California, has
lingering doubts about Simon's "business dealings." He also wonders
why Simon's proposals are so vague. Rosen watched the sole
Davis-Simon debate. To him, Simon seemed too focused on attacking the
governor.</TE>
<TE>   "Have an agenda," Rosen said as traffic roared along California 99
behind Zingo's. "Tell people what you're going to do."</TE>
<TE>   Simon has promised to cut state spending, reduce taxes and improve
California's road, water, power and school systems. But his TV
commercials say close to nothing about his agenda; instead, they
attack Davis.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Simon has also tried to steer clear of abortion and
guns. But his conservative positions on those issues continue to
appeal here. Wanda England, 51, a Republican whose family runs a
Bakersfield garbage hauling company, said Simon might not be "the
most honest person," but "the life of an unborn person is a lot more
important" than a woman's right to an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Bench agrees. A Republican minister at the nondenominational
Riverland Church in Bakersfield, he only backs candidates who oppose
legal abortion. Nonetheless, he refuses to vote for Simon.</TE>
<TE>   "He's inept, and he doesn't know what the real world is like,"
Bench said. "When you live that high up on the economic tower, I
don't think you have any concept of people losing their jobs, their
savings."</TE>
<TE>   Bench has an equally dim view of Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd sell his grandmother's bones for the key to the cash
register," Bench said after picking up mail from his postal box at a
Bakersfield strip mall.</TE>
<TE>   So Bench plans to vote for a write-in candidate whose name he
could not remember.</TE>
<TE>   "The wrong people are running," he said. "It's sort of like the
last presidential campaign."</TE>

<HD>2 Huge Wetlands Projects Advance</HD>
<DH>Science, engineering are put to the test in the Bolsa Chica

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Biologists are embarking on massive efforts to reclaim a pair of
California wetlands -- campaigns that will take decades to unfold and
push the limits of science and engineering.</LD>
<LD>   The projects -- to restore oil fields in Orange County and salt
ponds in South San Francisco Bay to their natural, estuarine states
-- are the biggest, most expensive such wetland projects in the
Western United States. Both are nearing major milestones.</LD>
<LD>   In Northern California, officials are weeks away from signing a
$135-million agreement to buy and begin restoring roughly 26 square
miles of Cargill Inc. salt ponds along the south bay. In Southern
California, experts working on the $100-million Bolsa Chica
restoration are nearing agreement with an oil company over removing
toxins and selling oil rights.</LD>
<TE>   These steps are just the beginning. Given the evolving science of
wetlands restoration and other challenges ahead, biologists say they
may not even see the fruits of their efforts in their lifetimes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so hard for man to create nature," said Marge Kolar, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service manager of the Don Edwards San Francisco
Bay National Wildlife Refuge that will expand to include restored
ponds. "There's no instant gratification."</TE>
<TE>   The restoration efforts are among hundreds being undertaken
throughout the state. Most are at least partly experiments. It's
often impossible to know precisely how a site looked and functioned
before it was disturbed. Scientists also must reckon with existing
pollution and plan for potential effects of future land uses in
surrounding areas.</TE>
<TE>   Decades ago, wetlands were called "swamps." Railroads and power
lines were built over them. They were dammed, diked, filled or paved
to make way for new development. As preservation efforts gained steam
in the 1970s, the passage of the federal Clean Water Act and the
California Coastal Act stemmed the destruction -- but not before
nearly all coastal marshes had been eliminated or severely degraded.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an absolutely horrible history of destroying wetlands in
California, especially Southern California," said Jack Fancher, a
federal biologist overseeing Bolsa Chica's restoration. "The massive,
large-scale destruction of wetlands pretty much stopped with the
enactment of those two laws."</TE>
<TE>   Economic Benefits</TE>
<TE>   Now, wetlands are viewed as vital filters of urban runoff, way
stations for migrating birds and habitat for endangered species. They
generate economic benefits by restocking commercial fisheries. And
communities get recreation spots for nature lovers, hikers and
birders.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at one of those historic moments when people's thinking has
evolved to the point that we recognize that not only are wetlands
valuable for shorebirds or for what they do for coastal water
quality, but if you can really restore functioning wetlands, you can
achieve a whole range of different ... goals," said Mary Nichols,
Gov. Gray Davis' resources secretary.</TE>
<TE>   At Cargill, salt production dating to the Gold Rush has left some
patches 10 times saltier than the ocean. Sea water is moved through a
series of diked ponds that are colored red, orange and other bright
hues by microscopic bacteria. As water evaporates, the remaining
brine becomes saltier. The process results in sunken fields so
encrusted with salt they appear covered in thick sheets of ice.</TE>
<TE>   Under an agreement announced in May, Cargill will be paid $100
million for 16,596 acres and get a federal tax write-off of $143
million. The company also would give up salt-making rights on another
9,000 acres. The purchase, to be completed by Dec. 15, would be
funded by $72 million in state bond money, $8 million from the Fish
and Wildlife Service, and $20 million from four Bay Area nonprofit
groups.</TE>
<TE>   The private foundations and the state and federal governments also
will provide $35 million to draft a plan and care for the wetlands
until restoration can begin.</TE>
<TE>   The planning itself is expected to take five years. Once
scientists agree on the types of habitat to be created, levees will
be breached and briny water released into the bay carefully so as not
to overwhelm fragile ecosystems with too much salt. The levees have
long protected South San Francisco Bay cities from storm flooding, so
any changes also must ensure the safety of those cities. That could
mean building new levees closer to populated areas.</TE>
<TE>   All that work across Cargill's roughly 26 square miles could cost
as much as $1 billion and take decades to complete.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes time for all the vegetation to return and for all the
invertebrates to get back in and to make it a real functioning
wetland," Kolar said. "I would hope that in my lifetime, the initial
construction would be started and some wetlands would be vegetated
and others would be in the process of being restored."</TE>
<TE>   An earlier restoration of south bay ponds in the 1980s took more
than a decade before a channel of flowing bay water nourished the
former salt-crusted fields, coaxing it into a lush marsh of
pickleweed, cord grass and reeds and providing habitat for endangered
harvest mice and other life.</TE>
<TE>   Still, "every wetland really is different," Kolar said. "You can
learn a little bit [from other projects], but this is Mother Nature.
This is biology. ... It's never exactly the same."</TE>
<TE>   Though the Cargill acquisition and planning are funded, wildlife
officials still must find the restoration money. "Our hope is that
because it will be happening over a period of years, it won't be as
hard to gulp as one fell swoop," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Uncertain Funding</TE>
<TE>   Other salt ponds acquired in the Napa-Sonoma Marshes Wildlife Area
eight years ago offer a lesson in the perils of uncertain funding.
More than 9,000 acres were bought then left untended while scientists
worked on a restoration plan. The ponds grew drier, saltier and far
less hospitable to wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   Planners involved in the upcoming south bay restoration said
that's why they made sure they had money to maintain the ponds while
the long-term restoration plan is drafted.</TE>
<TE>   "You need to be ready now to do something with the ponds," Kolar
said. "You can't buy them and plan to do something over the years."</TE>
<TE>   Human influence at Bolsa Chica has been more invasive.</TE>
<TE>   A duck hunting club cut off the wetlands from the ocean in 1899,
diking ponds to make it easier to catch their prey. Oil drilling
began after World War II, then homes were built on nearly half the
wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   There are 1,200 acres left, mostly cracked, dusty brown earth
dotted by pumping oil rigs. Decades-old access roads divide the site
into puzzle pieces fringed with pickleweed and ice plant.</TE>
<TE>   If all goes well, Bolsa Chica -- site of a raging 27-year
development battle -- will once again become a thriving coastal
estuary and major migratory bird stop on the Pacific Flyway along
with an adjacent state preserve. At $100 million, it would be the
second most expensive wetlands restoration in state history.</TE>
<TE>   The plan calls for cutting a 360-foot-wide channel through Pacific
Coast Highway and five acres of sandy beach that lie between the
ocean and the wetlands, then building a bridge to reconnect the road.</TE>
<TE>   Backhoes and bulldozers will excavate 2.7 million cubic yards of
soil to form the inlet and a tidal basin. Dredged soil will be turned
into levees and nesting islands. Some will replenish sand at Bolsa
Chica State Beach and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Invasive ice plants will be replaced by cordgrass, underwater eel
grass beds, beach primrose, rare coastal woolly heads and other marsh
flora. One of the last acts, which could happen in 2006, will be to
remove a dam and restore tidal flows. The surge of seawater will
carry in juvenile halibut, crabs, plankton and other microscopic
creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the former oil field will attract nesting California
least terns, light-footed clapper rails and other marsh birds.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best feeling. The best reward I have professionally is
when they're open and they come to life," Fancher said. "You invest
part of your life, your personal life, in these things that are so
big and so complicated and sometimes contentious battles."</TE>
<TE>   A 248-acre portion will continue to produce oil until it's no
longer economically viable, then it, too, will be restored.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest obstacle to a revived Bolsa Chica -- or "Little
Pocket" in Spanish -- is contamination. An Oct. 8 study found oil,
heavy metals, PCBs and mercury on the land--a legacy of decades of
drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Aera Energy LLC and wildlife officials are negotiating over what
level of cleanup the oil company and landowner must do, as well as
how much the government will pay Aera to curtail some of its oil
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the level and location, the chemicals will either be
isolated on the site, treated or hauled to landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Fancher and others must determine whether the government has
enough money to fund the $100-million plan. The ports of Los Angeles
and Long Beach have given $79 million to compensate for marine
habitat destroyed by their expanded operations. Officials also hope
to get funding through Proposition 40, a $2.6-billion water and parks
bond California voters approved in March.</TE>
<TE>   Other challenges include preventing runoff from future
developments nearby and minimizing the impact of polluted storm water
that would overflow a substandard flood control channel that will
continue to cross the property.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a hurdle race: You jump one hurdle but there's another
one coming," Fancher said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Fancher said, only 60 miles south in Carlsbad is a success
story. Urbanization and three bridges degraded the 610-acre
Batiquitos Lagoon. A $55-million project reopened it to the ocean in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Recent monitoring has shown that hundreds of invertebrate, fish
and bird species have returned, including nesting endangered Western
snowy plovers.</TE>
<TE>   Lessons learned about revegetation, ocean inlets and sand
replenishment at Batiquitos are being applied to the larger, more
complex -- and more expensive -- Bolsa Chica project.</TE>
<TE>   "The easy ones have been done," Fancher said. "That's an
explanation for why the costs are what they are ... [And] we must
save these because they're all that's left. If we don't save these,
we don't have anything."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A significant number of scientists and biological warfare experts are
expressing skepticism about the FBI's view that a single disgruntled
American scientist prepared the spores and mailed the deadly anthrax
letters that killed five people last year.</LD>
<LD>   These sources say that making a weaponized aerosol of such
sophistication and virulence would require scientific knowledge,
technical competence, access to expensive equipment and safety
know-how that are probably beyond the capabilities of a lone
individual.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, a consensus has emerged in recent months among
experts surveyed by the Washington Post that some of the fundamental
assumptions driving the FBI's investigation might be flawed.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, more than a dozen experts suggested that investigators
might want to reexamine the possibility of state-sponsored terrorism,
or try to determine whether weaponized spores might have been stolen
from an existing, but secret, biodefense program, or perhaps given to
the attacker by an accomplice.</TE>

<HD>Bush Can't Sweep Away Comment About Wife</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush clearly adores his wife. But his efforts to put that
admiration on public display do not always hit the mark. Warming up
an audience in Charlotte, N.C., last week, the president praised
Laura Bush's performance as first lady and offered an explanation for
her absence. "It's been raining," Bush said, "so she needs to sweep
the porch" of their Texas ranch before a visit by the president of
China.</LD>
<LD>   The comment apparently earned Bush no points with his wife. Laura
Bush, standing with the president Friday on that very porch waiting
for President Jiang Zemin, was asked if she appreciated it. She shook
her head and mouthed, "No." The president then blamed the press for
getting him in trouble at home.</LD>

<HD>Chances Fade for Upset in House</HD>
<DH>Many Democrats see their hopes to win a majority of seats
slipping away, barring a dramatic shift in voters' focus before Nov.
5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even though history and economics are on their side, many Democrats
are despairing of their chances of winning control of the House of
Representatives this fall -- unless something dramatic changes
between now and the Nov. 5 elections.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats' hopes of translating voter anxieties about the economy
into political gains large enough to win a House majority have been
stubbornly hard to fulfill, as pocketbook issues have been eclipsed
in the media by the prospect of war with Iraq and the Washington-area
sniper killings.</LD>
<LD>   "Things are very close," said Peter Fenn, a Democratic political
consultant. "If I had to look at it right now, I'd have trouble doing
the math in such a way that the Democrats pick up" the six seats
needed to win back the majority they lost in 1994.</LD>
<TE>   Fenn, like other Democrats, still thinks it possible the party can
pull an upset on election day -- especially if last week's arrests in
the sniper case clear the way for more public attention to the
Democrats' message.</TE>
<TE>   But the problem for Democrats, analysts say, is that no national
tide appears to be pushing voters in their direction. And with little
more than a week until the vote, the party does not seem to have
succeeded in generating one of its own.</TE>
<TE>   While the election results will have major repercussions for the
balance of power in Washington -- and for President Bush's ability to
get his way in Congress -- the individual House races are not shaping
up as a referendum on either the economic issues Democrats emphasize
or the national security concerns the GOP spotlights. Instead, many
races are being shaped by local concerns and dynamics -- from federal
money for dredging the Baltimore shipping channel to a dispute
between an Indian tribe and towns in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough, but doable," Jenny Backus, spokeswoman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said of the fight for
control of the House. "We have the pieces on the board. They are
ready to be in play. But it has never been a swift shot."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans are confident, even bold. "The chances of us losing
the House are remote," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis (R-Va.), chairman of
the National Republican Congressional Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the political climate in the last week of any campaign can
be volatile. And while most political analysts predict Republicans
will keep the House, such prognostication has proved wrong in the
last two midterm elections.</TE>
<TE>   Worried that conventional wisdom has coalesced around the idea
that Democrats cannot win the House, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los
Angeles) has circulated a memo to his colleagues reminding them how
far off preelection forecasts were in 1998, when Democrats defied
expectations and gained seats, and in 1994, when few predicted
Republicans would win control of the House.</TE>
<TE>   Confounding Pundits</TE>
<TE>   "Pundits, it turns out, are actually a contrarian indicator,"
Waxman's memo said. "Based on recent history, the smart bet is that
the 2002 elections will again confound their prediction."</TE>
<TE>   But it is not just pundits who view Democrats' road to a House
majority as a steep climb.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to pick up seats, but I don't think we're going to
pick up enough," said an influential Democratic pollster who asked
not to be named. "I'm less optimistic than I was" in early September,
before debate about going to war with Iraq cast a long shadow over
Democrats' critique of GOP economic policy.</TE>
<TE>   As of now, the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan publication
that scrutinizes every congressional contest, counts 217 House seats
as likely or certain to go Republican, and 202 likely or certain to
go Democrat. That leaves 16 as tossups. And that means Democrats
would have to win every tossup race to eke out the 218 seats needed
to claim the majority.</TE>
<TE>   "It is really tough in the absence of some sort of wave at the end
-- or some kind of incredible luck," said Amy Walter, who analyzes
House races for the Cook Report.</TE>
<TE>   Such comments are surprising, given some key advantages the
Democrats would seem to have in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   For one, it would not take much of a swing in the House to tilt
the balance of power: Republicans outnumber Democrats by a mere
223-208 margin (with one independent who usually votes with Democrats
and three vacancies). That means that Republicans would be ousted
from the majority if they lost a mere six seats.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, history is on the Democrats' side: The party in the
White House traditionally loses seats in Congress in the election
midway through a president's first term.</TE>
<TE>   The economy is sputtering -- a problem that usually resounds to
the disadvantage of the president's party. And recent polls have
found trends that should favor Democrats. A survey for National
Public Radio, for instance, reported that 51% of those surveyed
thought the country is on the wrong track, the kind of pessimism that
usually spells trouble for the party in the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "The underlying trends are Democratic," said Mark Penn, a
Democratic poll taker. "That could create a surprise as long as [key
races] are reasonably close."</TE>
<TE>   But there are a host of factors that have made it hard for
Democrats to capitalize on their advantages. The biggest obstacle is
the election's extremely small battlefield. A remarkably small number
of seats are seriously contested, largely because, as House district
lines were redrawn to reflect population shifts in the 2000 census,
most were crafted to protect incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, most political analysts say that all but about 40
House races are foregone conclusions; only a dozen or two have been
in the tossup category. And much of that tiny battlefield is in
Southern and rural districts that are not part of Democrats' natural
terrain.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Democrats may not get the traditional midterm boost from
being the party out of the White House because Bush's popularity,
which soared after his response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist
attacks, remains high.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the president's party is usually vulnerable because
of weak freshmen lawmakers who had been swept in on the president's
coattails two years earlier. But Bush had virtually no coattails in
2000, so there are fewer than usual vulnerable GOP freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   Even with many voters concerned about the economy, Democrats have
not done a good job of articulating a clear alternative to Bush's
policies, some analysts say. Party leaders, for example, have been
divided over whether to push for a rollback of part of the
$1.35-trillion, 10-year tax cut enacted in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Unless Democrats find a way to build a national head of steam as
the campaign closes, the makeup of the House will be determined in
race-by-race combat. Late developments in the key tossup races have
cut both ways -- some to the advantage of Democrats, others of the
GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Prospects Cool</TE>
<TE>   Some races Democrats touted as hot prospects early this year have
cooled. Democrats had hoped the emergence of corporate responsibility
as a big issue would give a big boost to Rep. Ronnie Shows in
Mississippi in his battle against GOP Rep. Charles W. "Chip"
Pickering -- one of four races that pits incumbents against each
other as a result of redistricting.</TE>
<TE>   Running in a district that is home to WorldCom, the giant
telecommunications company that went bankrupt, Shows attacked
Pickering for being the largest recipient of contributions from the
company and refusing to give the money back. But Pickering has pulled
so far ahead in the polls that Democratic strategists privately
concede that the race seems over.</TE>
<TE>   But Republicans are finding a few of their incumbents more
vulnerable than they anticipated. These include Rep. James A. Leach
of Iowa, a 13-term veteran facing a tough race in a redrawn district
against a Democrat Julie Thomas, a pediatrician.</TE>
<TE>   Another GOP incumbent, Rep. Felix J. Grucci Jr. of New York, may
lose because of a late campaign miscue. Grucci seemed headed toward
reelection until he ran an advertisement recently that criticized his
Democratic opponent, Tim Bishop, for Bishop's handling of rape cases
while he was provost at Southampton College. Critics said the ad was
without foundation. Bishop won the endorsement of the district's
major newspaper, Newsday, and the Cook Political Report now rates the
race a tossup.</TE>
<TE>   In such close contests, the key to victory often depends on which
side does best at getting their supporters to the polls. Republicans
are trying to ramp up their get-out-the-vote efforts to counter the
traditional advantage labor union supporters give to Democrats'
efforts. This year is no different: The AFL-CIO is focusing its
remaining resources on voter mobilization efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Whichever party ends up winning the House, it is unlikely to
control it by a significant margin. Another two years of a narrowly
divided House -- and a Senate that also is likely to be narrowly
split -- will ratify the political reality that was dramatized by the
2000 election: Politically, the United States is divided virtually
50-50.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Jacobson, a political scientist at UC San Diego, said: "It's
an accurate reflection of an underlying lack of consensus."</TE>

<HD>Top House races to watch</HD>
<DH>The closest House races around the country fall into three
categories: Contests between incumbents, pitted against each other
after district lines were redrawn to reflect the 2000 census; races
in which an incumbent faces a strong challenger, often because of
redistricting, and contests for open seats, where no incumbent is
running. Here are the races rated as among the most competitive by
the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan publication that analyzes
congressional elections.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Incumbent vs. incumbent</LD>
<LD>   Connecticut</LD>
<LD>   Rep. Nancy L. Johnson (R) versus Rep. James M. Maloney (D). A
moderate, Johnson has the edge in a campaign in which corporate
accountability has been a local issue: Toolmaker Stanley Works had
threatened to move its headquarters to Bermuda from the district's
core in New Britain.</LD>
<TE>   Illinois</TE>
<TE>   Rep. David D. Phelps (D) versus Rep. John Shimkus (R). This
contest in the southern part of the state is tightening, in part
because Republicans statewide are saddled with the troubles of the
scandal-tainted Gov. George Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Charles W. "Chip" Pickering (R) versus Rep. Ronnie Shows (D).
Pickering is favored to win in a district in the central part of the
state that gives Republicans a distinct advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Pennsylvania</TE>
<TE>   Rep. George W. Gekas (R) versus Rep. Tim Holden (D). Holden is
running a strong race in a district near Harrisburg. Gekas had not
faced a tough contest in years and was slow to respond to Holden's
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Vulnerable incumbents</TE>
<TE>   Florida</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Karen L. Thurman (D) versus state Sen. Ginny Brown-Waite (R).
Thurman was thrown into political jeopardy by redistricting, which
gave her new territory in Central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa</TE>
<TE>   Rep. James A. Leach (R) versus Julie Thomas (D). Leach, a 13-term
incumbent, faces a tough fight in a redrawn district. The district,
in the state's southeastern corner, is more heavily Democratic than
Leach's previous one.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Anne M. Northup (R) versus Jack Conway (R). Northup, a
three-term incumbent, always has had to run hard in this
Louisville-based district, and Conway has mounted a strong effort.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bill Luther (D) versus John Kline (R). This is a rematch of a
2000 contest, which Luther won by fewer than 6,000 votes. The
district is based in Minneapolis-St. Paul suburbs.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Constance A. Morella (R) versus state Sen. Christopher Van
Hollen (D).</TE>
<TE>   Morella has won eight terms in a largely liberal district by
frequently breaking with her party in Congress. But the district, in
suburbs north of Washington, was made even more Democratic, and she
faces the fight of her political life.</TE>
<TE>   Open seats</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (eastern)</TE>
<TE>   State Rep. Mike Rogers (R) versus Joe Turnham (D), a former House
nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (northern Denver suburbs)</TE>
<TE>   Bob Beauprez (R), former state GOP chairman, versus Mike Feeley

<HD>Mondale Is Expected to Run in Place of Wellstone</HD>
<DH>Former vice president will announce his plans Tuesday. GOP
already assailing his record.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook and Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, responding to emotional
pleas from Democrats in Minnesota and around the nation, is expected
to replace the late Sen. Paul Wellstone as the Democratic candidate
in that state's hotly contested Senate race.</LD>
<LD>   Mondale, who turns 75 in January, has said that he will not
announce his plans until after Tuesday's memorial service for
Wellstone, who died Friday in a plane crash. But party officials
Sunday said they believe Mondale is willing to accept the nomination,
which the party is expected to ratify Wednesday. Republicans already
are criticizing his record.</LD>
<LD>   "The vice president, I believe, if asked by the party, would be
willing to seek the election Nov. 5," Mike Erlandson, chairman of the
Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said at a news conference.
"Mr. Mondale is the choice of the Wellstone family. Mr. Mondale is
certainly the sentimental choice of many Democrats across the state."</LD>
<TE>   Democratic officials see Mondale, with his years of political
experience and household-name status, as their best hope for beating
GOP nominee Norm Coleman in the few days left in the campaign.
Victory in Minnesota is crucial to Democrats' broader battle to
preserve their fragile 51-49 Senate majority.</TE>
<TE>   It would be a remarkable twist of political history if Democrats
were rescued from losing control of the Senate by the man who led the
party to a crushing defeat in the 1984 presidential election, when he
lost to Ronald Reagan in a landslide. What's more, Mondale is a
paragon of the kind of liberalism that many Democrats -- other than
Wellstone -- have tried to move the party away from in the years
since he topped their ticket.</TE>
<TE>   A Minnesota Icon</TE>
<TE>   But in Minnesota, old-style liberalism still has great appeal, and
Mondale is an icon to many. Mondale, who now practices law and
teaches in Minnesota, represented the state in the Senate from the
end of 1964, when he was appointed to fill the vacancy left by Hubert
H. Humphrey's election as vice president, to 1976, when he himself
was elected vice president for one term under Jimmy Carter. In 1984,
Mondale became the party's ill-fated presidential nominee, choosing
Geraldine Ferraro -- the first woman on a major-party ticket -- as
his running mate. President Clinton appointed him U.S. ambassador to
Japan in 1993, a position he had until 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "There's such a tremendous reverence for him," Senate Majority
Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said Sunday on CBS News' "Face the
Nation." "He would be the great unifier, and I think there would be
overwhelming support in Minnesota for his candidacy."</TE>
<TE>   Even though Mondale has not officially agreed to enter the race,
Republicans began picking apart his record Sunday -- including a
famous line in his 1984 speech accepting the presidential nomination
when he candidly acknowledged that, as president, he would raise
taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want a big tax-increase person with a long history of
raising taxes, Walter Mondale's perfect," former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich (R-Ga.) said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "People ought to
vote on how [candidates] vote, not the emotions of this week."</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota race long has been considered pivotal to deciding
which party will control the Senate. The GOP targeted Wellstone as
one of the Democrats' most vulnerable incumbents. President Bush
personally recruited Coleman -- a former mayor of St. Paul and a
former Democrat -- to run, and Republicans were increasingly
confident that he could win.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic officials have until late Thursday to name a
replacement for Wellstone, and the party will convene its 875
delegates Wednesday. State officials said they expect only one name
to be put forward -- a clear sign that the party was ready to unite
behind Mondale.</TE>
<TE>   Any support for other candidates apparently was put to rest over
the weekend when Wellstone's son David, who had been touted by some
as a potential candidate, met with Mondale and top members of the
Wellstone campaign and personally threw the family's support behind
the former vice president.</TE>
<TE>   "The family believes that Sen. Wellstone would be honored to have
the vice president consider replacing him in the United States
Senate," Erlandson said on ABC's "This Week."</TE>
<TE>   Even after that meeting, Mondale has remained publicly
noncommittal. And a friend who has talked with him said he has
genuinely stewed over making this move so late in life. But party
officials are clearly counting on him to run -- if only because they
assume that he would have discouraged speculation if he was not
prepared to go along.</TE>
<TE>   One reason that returning to the Senate might be an attractive
option, his friends say, is that Mondale has viewed his years there
as among the happiest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   "To finish at the place that he loved the best would be
wonderful," said Michael Berman, a former top aide to Mondale.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Democrats contend that Mondale's voting record is
similar to Wellstone's on the issues he cared most about, from
boosting services to the mentally ill to supporting organized labor
and small family farms. "A vote for Mondale is a vote for an elder
statesman who has picked up the flag from a fallen hero," said a
senior Democratic strategist.</TE>
<TE>   The emotions surrounding Wellstone's death put Coleman in an
awkward position. He suspended active campaigning, and his Web site
showed only a statement of condolence. But GOP officials took the
gloves off Sunday and began an assault on Mondale, calling him a
relic and a mainstream Washington politician who has little of the
populist streak that made Wellstone so beloved.</TE>
<TE>   "Walter Mondale is the past; Norm Coleman is the future," said
Minnesota Republican Party spokesman Bill Walsh. "Coleman has proven
he is ready to lead, and lead now." Coleman is expected to slowly
resume campaigning today and should be fully engaged by Wednesday,
party officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans appeared eager to convince voters that Mondale and
Wellstone had little in common, painting the liberal former vice
president as a more centrist, even corporate Democrat in his later
years. They noted that he has served on the boards of large
corporations, including Target and Northwest Airlines, and they
pointed out that he had a central role in passing HMO laws that
Wellstone later railed against. "Mr. Mondale is no Paul Wellstone, or
a Paul Wellstone Democrat," Walsh said.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans also planned to subtly make an issue of Mondale's age
by pressing him to promise he would serve a full six-year term if
elected.</TE>
<TE>   'Lame-Duck' Senator</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the confusion, Gov. Jesse Ventura, an independent, is
considering appointing an interim senator to ensure that Minnesota is
fully represented in the "lame-duck" session that Congress plans
beginning the week of Nov. 11. Democratic officials have urged him to
wait until after the election and appoint the winner of the Nov. 5
election. But John Wodele, a Ventura spokesman, said the governor
would act sooner because of concern that the election results would
not be certified in time for the lame-duck session.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, on Sunday, federal investigators poring over the
detritus of the air crash said that the Eveleth, Minn., airport where
the pilot was attempting to land had a slightly faulty radio homing
device. But officials stressed that they had not determined the cause
of the accident and did not know whether the faulty device played any
role in the crash that killed Wellstone, his wife, his daughter, two
staff members and two pilots.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Society Now Forced to Think About the Unthinkable Over
and Over</HD>

<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It barely made the newspapers late last week when the FBI released a
national alert warning that Al Qaeda terrorists may be planning an
attack on passenger trains inside the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   That news didn't capture much attention because the media were
riveted on the arrests of two men linked to the sniper attacks that
had been terrorizing Washington for three weeks. One form of
terrorism squeezed out the other.</LD>
<LD>   That's what it's been like for Americans of late. The cataclysmic
violence of Sept. 11, 2001. The anthrax scare. The shoe bomber.
Weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. A nuclear North Korea. The
sniper. The unthinkable, on a regular basis, made real.</LD>
<TE>   People go on living their lives, because there is nothing else
they can do, but the sense that something changed is difficult to
escape.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning after the sniper suspects were caught, one
Washington-area man told the New York Times: "With these shootings,
the 9/11 terrorist attacks, anthrax -- it seems like anything can
happen, anytime."</TE>
<TE>   That feeling may be especially acute in Washington after three
weeks of killings, chilling equally for being random and systematic.
But Americans everywhere might echo those words.</TE>
<TE>   This open-ended anxiety is uncharted territory for U.S. society.
The U.S. mainland appeared immune from attack even during World Wars
I and II, and all but the very hottest moment (the Cuban missile
crisis) of the Cold War. And while ordinary crime has always
generated fear, the new cascade of domestic and foreign dangers seems
different: larger, more organized, more difficult to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Attack from another nation still seems a very distant threat.
Notwithstanding some suggestions to the contrary from President Bush,
few Americans probably worry that Iraq has the means or motive to
directly attack this country. A North Korea armed with nuclear
weapons and the missile systems to deliver them would be more
worrisome, but the certainty of an overwhelming nuclear counterattack
will likely prove as reliable a deterrent as it did against the
Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The real change in the atmosphere is the danger of stateless
terrorism. The driving force behind Congress' approval of a
resolution authorizing Bush to invade Iraq was the fear that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein might, at some point, give chemical and
biological weapons to terrorists. No one was sure Hussein would ever
ally with Al Qaeda. But after last year's terrorist attacks, few
wanted to take the chance that he wouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   The shadow of Sept. 11, 2001, also loomed over the sniper ordeal.
Throughout, the greatest fear for many in the region -- and probably
across the nation -- was that the attacks would be linked to an
organized terrorist plot.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest of John Allen Muhammad and Lee Boyd Malvo didn't
immediately bear out those fears: So far, at least, nothing has
linked them to known terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   But, characteristically for this new age of uncertainty, neither
did the arrests entirely dispel the anxiety. Questions remained about
Muhammad's possible sympathy for Al Qaeda and last year's terrorist
attacks. Was he, as a counter-terrorism expert wondered, not a
member, or even a supporter of any terrorist group, but a
"cheerleader" who betrays no sign of supporting the cause until he
strikes?</TE>
<TE>   And even if no links emerge between the suspects and organized
terrorism, and money proves more their motivation than any political
grievance, there remains the fear that terrorists might simply follow
the path the two have laid out.</TE>
<TE>   If police are correct, the two men shattered the routines of daily
life and unnerved a vast metropolitan area -- the highest aspirations
for terrorists -- with no more equipment than a single Bushmaster
rifle that sells for as little as $800 and a beat-up 1990 Chevrolet
Caprice that Muhammad bought for $250. That's leverage terrorists
understand.</TE>
<TE>   The sniper attacks represented a kind of language the 9/11
terrorists might have understood too.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Jane Garvey, then the Federal Aviation Administration
chief, said government wasn't prepared for Sept. 11 because no one
had imagined an attack on that scale. For all the revelations that
have emerged in congressional testimony about CIA or FBI missteps,
she was fundamentally right. The terrorists didn't so much slip
around U.S. defenses as leap over them: They launched an attack that
no one had defended against because no one had conceived of it.</TE>
<TE>   Something of the same grim evolution was evident in the sniper
assault. As the endless parade of experts kept reminding, the sniper
slayings didn't precisely fit any of the patterns of serial or spree
killers. It's no wonder the suspects, when caught, didn't match the
profile that any of the experts drew: Like the Sept. 11 plotters, the
snipers created a new form of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   And now, as after Sept. 11 and anthrax and the shootings at
Columbine High School in 1999, the agencies charged with protecting
U.S. security must search for the best responses to this fresh kind
of threat.</TE>
<TE>   Like the aftermath of Columbine, the pursuit of answers now will
be complicated by the polarizing domestic politics of guns. But if
ballistic fingerprinting of the Bushmaster rifle might have helped
authorities track the weapon more quickly to Washington state, where
its manufacturer says it was first sold, gun rights' advocates will
have a heavy burden to show why law enforcement should not receive
that tool.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the case also shows the limits of government action in
preventing these new dangers. Congress banned assault weapons to
reduce the risk of these tragedies; but the Bushmaster rifle, which
didn't fall under that ban, still proved more than adequate to this
grisly task. In the same way, smart law enforcement, tougher defenses
and military action against rogue states may reduce the threat of
more terrorist attacks but won't eliminate it -- as the FBI's
overshadowed warning last week suggests.</TE>
<TE>   And that is the catch in the throat behind the sigh of relief that
the sniper threat has apparently ended. One danger is gone. But
others, as unpredictable as these attacks, still wait. After the last
year-plus, more of the unimaginable now seems almost inevitable.</TE>

<HD>Man Tied to Sniper Case Cooperates</HD>

<DL>FLINT, Mich.</DL>
<LD>The man who co-owned the blue Chevrolet Caprice believed to have been
used in the Washington-area sniper attacks agreed Sunday to be moved
to federal custody in Maryland and is cooperating fully with
authorities, his attorney said.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said Nathanel O. Osbourne, who was arrested Saturday, is
not suspected of carrying out any of the attacks. His lawyer, Kenneth
R. Sasse, said his client has been interviewed extensively but doubts
he has much information.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't think he has any knowledge or involvement in the
shootings," Sasse said after Osbourne's detention hearing. He added
that he expects U.S. marshals to take Osbourne to Maryland this week.</LD>
<TE>   Osbourne, 26, spoke briefly and quietly as U.S. Magistrate Wallace
Capel questioned him about child support payments and other financial
matters.</TE>
<TE>   The affidavit for Osbourne's arrest was sealed. He was arrested
May 30 in a domestic violence case but has no known warrants
outstanding.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities sought the Jamaican citizen, described as a friend of
sniper suspect John Allen Muhammad, as a material witness in the
attacks that left 10 people dead and three critically wounded over
three weeks in Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland prosecutors filed the first murder charges against
Muhammad, 41, and Lee Boyd Malvo, 17. Prosecutors in Virginia said
Saturday that they would also file murder charges.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne, whose last known address was in Camden, N.J., was
believed to have helped Muhammad buy the 1990 Caprice in which
Muhammad and Malvo were arrested Thursday at a rest stop near
Myersville, Md.</TE>
<TE>   The car was purchased for $250 from Sure Shot Auto Sales Inc. in
Trenton, N.J., on Sept. 10, and Muhammad and Osbourne registered it
the next day. Osbourne and Muhammad had listed the same New Jersey
address.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say a hole had been cut in the trunk from which
someone could have fired a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Osbourne entered the United States in 1996 and had been living in
New Jersey, though officials said Sunday that they were unsure of his
visa status.</TE>
<TE>   Why Osbourne was in Michigan, how long he had been here and how
authorities tracked him to the Flint residence where he was arrested
also was unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Charlie Byrd, who said he owns the home where Osbourne
was arrested, said Osbourne was visiting a woman who lives there and
was considering marrying her. He said the couple came to him briefly
Wednesday for counseling.</TE>

<HD>Rare Changing of Guard in S. Carolina</HD>
<DH>Strom Thurmond spent nearly five decades as a senator. Voters' deep
affection for 99-year-old is an underlying current in race to succeed
him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ken Ellingwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>COLUMBIA, S.C.</DL>
<LD>When South Carolinians go to the polls Nov. 5, they will name a new
U.S. senator. In many places, that might seem routine. But around
here, it's an act fairly ringing with historical moment.</LD>
<LD>   The man vacating the position, Strom Thurmond, has held the spot
since 1954 -- a tenure of such stunning duration that only about 1 in
3 South Carolina residents was alive when he took office. The state's
junior senator, Ernest F. Hollings, 80, is no arriviste either. He
gained his seat in 1966. For evidence of the South's tradition of
favoring incumbents, one need look no farther than South Carolina,
which has elected just six U.S. senators since 1930.</LD>
<LD>   With control of the Senate at stake in races nationwide, the seat
is a must-keep for Republicans seeking to regain their hold. But if
the campaign here wears an extra layer of significance, it stems from
the uncustomary turnover -- and from South Carolina's deep affection
for the 99-year-old Thurmond, a conservative icon whose near-legend
status here has set the bar high for his would-be successors.</LD>
<TE>   Both contenders, U.S. Rep. Lindsey O. Graham, like Thurmond a
Republican, and Democrat Alex Sanders, a former judge and retired
college president, have gone out of their way to lay claim to the
towering Thurmond legacy. Voters are taking careful measure.</TE>
<TE>   "Can either one fill Thurmond's shoes? No. I don't think anyone
ever could do it," said Mack Bigby, a salesman at a clothing store
down the street from the state capital complex, where a statue
depicts Thurmond in purposeful stride. "He's been there so long. He
was a politician before politicians started kicking and scratching to
get elected."</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Thurmond has endorsed Graham, a fellow conservative
who made a name for himself statewide and around the country in 1999
as one of the House prosecutors in the Senate impeachment of
President Clinton. Graham, if successful, would become the first
member of that team to win election to a higher office.</TE>
<TE>   Four of his Republican impeachment colleagues have fallen to
defeat in subsequent election bids. One other retired, six are
seeking reelection and another, former Rep. Asa Hutchinson of
Arkansas, was tapped to lead the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Graham's prominence during the impeachment gave him a boost in
South Carolina, which twice voted against Clinton, and it helped
deter other Republicans from vying for the Senate seat. The name
recognition also provided a big head start over Sanders, a former
appellate court judge who headed the College of Charleston. Recent
polls show Graham leading by as many as 17 points, but the Sanders
campaign insists that its own surveys suggest a much closer race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ours to lose," Graham said during an interview last week at
a campaign barbecue attended by about 150 supporters in downtown
Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   Graham, 47, who grew up in the state's conservative northwestern
belt, known as Upcountry, emphasizes his ideological resemblance to
Thurmond. He is fond of pointing out that the two won nearly
identical ratings from the American Conservative Union (Graham has a
grade of 93, Thurmond 91). Graham is playful on the topic of
Thurmond's longevity. "If I am going to do the Strom thing," Graham
told supporters, "my successor will be born two years from now."</TE>
<TE>   In his stump speeches, Graham emphasizes his allegiance to
President Bush -- although he backed John McCain during the 2000
presidential primary -- and he delights in portraying Sanders as a
darling of American liberals, ticking off some of the Democrat's
supporters, including Barbra Streisand, Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). At the
Columbia event, Graham's youthful twang dripped as he characterized
Sanders' backers as "a who's who of the left."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm the conservative voice," he said later.</TE>
<TE>   Graham's campaign commercials, playing to the state's right-wing
tilt, have played up Sanders' opposition to the death penalty and to
an amendment that would outlaw burning of the American flag. Sanders
said he opposes capital punishment on religious grounds and a
flag-burning law as contrary to free-speech guarantees, but the
damage may have been done.</TE>
<TE>   "These issues resonate in South Carolina. The Democrats here are
much more conservative than Democrats elsewhere," said Brad Gomez, an
assistant professor of political science at the University of South
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The 64-year-old Sanders, whose extensive resume also includes
stints as a law school teacher, state representative and state
senator, protests the liberal tag, despite a few donations by
celebrities he has never met. (Streisand sent $1,000.) "I've gotten a
lot less from celebrities than [Graham] is getting from the drug
companies," Sanders said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Like Thurmond, Sanders insists, he is no man's ideological foot
soldier and takes stands contrary to liberal orthodoxy on some
issues, such as gun ownership. And, like Thurmond, he said, Sanders
would join the Senate after a long and varied career in public
service. "If you see Strom as a fiercely independent and a product of
great life experience," Sanders said after a campaign gathering in
Lexington, a GOP stronghold outside Columbia, "then maybe you'd see
me."</TE>
<TE>   Sanders, whose wit and storytelling abilities are evident during a
short conversation, tells campaign audiences that this election year
is particularly important for the state and nation. Not one given to
the 10-second sound bite, Sanders recounted the fireside chats of
Franklin D. Roosevelt and his message of patience and hope. "I want
to show America that we in South Carolina ... are not ignorant
racists, that we are decent people," he said at the Lexington event.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders is pinning his hopes on a strong turnout by African
American voters.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has, for the most part, focused more on sweeping
national issues, such as Social Security and corporate accounting,
than on home-grown problems.</TE>
<TE>   Economic anxieties are running high -- even among many Republicans
-- in a state that, like most of the South, suffers greater poverty
and joblessness than the entire country. Thurmond's seniority and
staunch advocacy for defense projects kept federal dollars flowing to
the state, a benefit whose importance is lost on few people here.</TE>
<TE>   But it is perhaps Thurmond's storied constituent service -- the
phone calls to track a wayward Social Security check, the condolence
letters to ordinary South Carolinians who lose loved ones -- that has
cemented a legacy across party and racial lines that transcends his
onetime segregationist stands. It is that record, residents say,
which presents the most formidable measuring stick for his would-be
successors.</TE>
<TE>   Voters are "looking for somebody who would carry on the same kind
of service," said Henry Addy, a former state police official who
attended the Graham barbecue but voiced high regard for Sanders too.
"We'll keep you a good, long time -- if you do good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Miles away, at the Sanders gathering, Troy McLaughlin, a
57-year-old high school teacher, said she had never supported
Thurmond during a Senate career that began when she was in knee
socks. McLaughlin said she welcomed a fresh face. "This is the 21st
century," she said.</TE>

<TE>Impeachment impact</TE>
<TE>If Rep. Lindsey O. Graham wins his Senate race in South Carolina on
Nov. 5, he would be the first of the 13 House Republicans who
prosecuted President Clinton's impeachment case to achieve higher
elective office. Several of the other House impeachment managers have
lost subsequent races:
Lawmaker                State   Status
Bob Barr                Ga.     Defeated in 2002 House primary.
Ed Bryant               Tenn.   Defeated in 2002 Senate primary.
Stephen E. Buyer        Ind.    Seeking reelection; favored to win.
Charles T. Canady       Fla.    Retired from House in 2000.
Chris Cannon            Utah    Seeking reelection; favored to win.
Steve Chabot            Ohio    Seeking reelection; favored to win.
George W. Gekas         Pa.     Seeking reelection; too close to call.
Asa Hutchinson          Ark.    Named head of DEA in 2001.
Henry J. Hyde           Ill.    Seeking reelection; favored to win.
Bill McCollum           Fla.    Lost 2000 Senate election.
James E. Rogan          Calif.  Lost reelection bid in 2000.
James F.
Sensenbrenner Jr.       Wis.    Seeking reelection; favored to win.</TE>

<LD>   2001-02 record: 52-30, first.</LD>
<LD>   Offense: 96.2 (13). Defense: 92.0 (5).</LD>
<TE>   Gone: Keith Van Horn, Todd MacCulloch.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Dikembe Mutombo, Rodney Rogers, Chris Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: As Bull general manager, Rod Thorn drafted Quintin Dailey
after his rape arrest, Ennis Whatley after his drug involvement and
Ronnie Lester after he blew out his knee, before finding sanctuary as
vice president in charge of fines in the NBA office. It's been a
different story here, where Thorn's moves have revived the haunted
franchise. It has all fallen together perfectly. Mutombo gives them a
big center and a defensive presence. His arrival and Van Horn's
departure means they can get away with a smaller power forward and
Coach Byron Scott can move Kenyon Martin there. That opens a spot for
the explosive young Richard Jefferson.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: With Scott you get attitude and with Jason Kidd you
get instant karma, more than enough to rule the roost over here.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INDIANA PACERS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 42-40, eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 96.8 (9). Defense: 96.5 (18).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: No one of note.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: No. 1 pick Fred Jones, Erick Strickland.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: With the Pacer roster revamped since their 2000 Finals
appearance, the heat's on Isiah Thomas, who has taken his sweet time
in his two-year coaching career, figuring out how to do this. Last
season's deal for Brad Miller and Ron Artest made them one of the
East's bigger teams. They were already one of the deepest as their
kids, Jermaine O'Neal, Al Harrington and Jonathan Bender, began
realizing their promise. Of course, O'Neal still has to go from being
a guy who scores 20 points, taunts opponents and then disappears when
double-teamed, to the real deal. Thomas keeps experimenting -- he
just put in another offense -- but now must settle on a scheme, a
lineup and deliver.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: They'll move up. Time will tell if it's far enough.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW ORLEANS HORNETS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 44-38, fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 93.9 (20). Defense: 92.9 (7).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Lee Nailon, Matt Bullard.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Courtney Alexander.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: They made the East semis as lame ducks in Charlotte. Now
they're the toast of the French Quarter and Jamal Mashburn, who
played 40 games, is back. General Manager Bob Bass kept them going
while his owners, busy alienating the community, let free agents
walk. They have the East's deepest front line with Jamal Magloire,
P.J. Brown, Robert Traylor and, finally, Jerome Moiso, making Elden
Campbell's biorhythms irrelevant. Baron Davis signed an $84-million
extension, and Mashburn re-upped a year ago, giving them something
they haven't had since their early '90s honeymoon with Alonzo
Mourning and Larry Johnson: stability.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: The high-spirited Davis left UCLA after his sophomore
year, played little as a rookie but, two seasons later, was their
acknowledged leader. If he's ready to move up further, so are they.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT PISTONS</TE>
<TE>   20010-2 record: 50-32, second.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 94.3 (18). Defense: 92.2 (6).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Jerry Stackhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Richard Hamilton, Chauncey Billups, Hubert Davis, Mehmet
Okur, No. 1 pick Tayshaun Prince.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Joe Dumars outdid himself, trading Stackhouse, who helped
them go from 32-50 to 50-32, convinced by last season's fade (he took
fewer shots, still made only 39% and didn't come up big in the
playoffs) that he wasn't worth the big money he'd want as a free
agent this summer. On the other hand, their improbable rise was going
to be hard enough to duplicate and Dumars just traded a 6-6,
220-pound No. 1 option for Hamilton, who may be tough but is built
like a toothpick. With cap room next summer and Memphis' No. 1 pick,
Dumars thinks he can get a star to move to Motown, even if it's cold
and has a state sales tax. Good luck.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Rookie Coach Rick Carlise turned their defense around
but if they don't play it as well, they'll go lower than this.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BOSTON CELTICS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 49-33, third.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 96.4 (12). Defense: 94.1 (9, tie).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Rodney Rogers, Kenny Anderson, Vitaly Potapenko, Mark
Blount.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Vin Baker, Shammond Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: After surviving Rick Pitino to make last season's jump,
they really did it to themselves this time, trading Anderson, who was
handy and, more to the point, had one season on his contract, for
Baker, who was useless in Seattle and has four seasons left at $12.4
million per. New England is home for the easily depressed Baker but
since he'll be the No. 3 option behind Paul Pierce and Antoine
Walker, it may not turn out to be where Vin's heart is, assuming he
has one. Baker has already earned himself a reserve role, averaging
4.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 5.0 fouls in exhibitions, sending the
front office into barely-controlled panic. Said personnel director
Tony Papile, "To say he's done is premature. He didn't age in dog
years over the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Dear new owners: Good luck.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TORONTO RAPTORS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 42-40, seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 91.4 (25). Defense: 91.8 (4).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Hakeem Olajuwon, Keon Clark, Chris Childs.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Jelani McCoy, Lamond Murray, Lindsey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Last season was a debacle until Vince (Who, Me?) Carter
got hurt and his supporting cast proved to be better without him,
rising from 30-38 to make the playoffs. Carter now seems ready to
deal with the reality he has always denied, that a player with his
ability, and his $14-million salary, has to step up on the floor,
rather than at graduation ceremonies in North Carolina the day of
Game 7 in Philadelphia. Olajuwon had little to offer and was pushed
into retirement but losing Keon Clark, hurt, leaving Antonio Davis as
the lone quality big man. In the preseason, they started former Bruin
and Laker (briefly in both cases) McCoy at center and he actually had
his moments.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Small or not, if Carter makes the move from highlight
player to star, they'll do OK.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON WIZARDS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 37-45, 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 92.8 (21). Defense: 94.2 (11).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Richard Hamilton, Chris Whitney, Courtney Alexander, Hubert
Davis, Popeye Jones.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Jerry Stackhouse, Charles Oakley, Larry Hughes, George
McCloud, Bryon Russell, No. 1 picks Jared Jeffries and Juan Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: In what just might be (but who ever knows?) Michael
Jordan's last stand, they brought in all sorts of hoary vets, like
Oakley, and turned the preseason into Old Guy Paradise, with Jordan
and Oakley sitting out most of the exhibition season. Then there's
Patrick Ewing, who at 40 has signed on as an assistant coach but is
still aching to play -- and may, unless Brendan Haywood has come a
long way. Kwame Brown, the No. 1 pick, all but written off as a
rookie, made a big move in the exhibition season, averaging 18
points..</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Jordan still has all his drive, if not all his game.
This time Coach Doug Collins doesn't have to start at square one and
Jordan will get more help.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ORLANDO MAGIC</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 44-38, fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 100.5 (4). Defense: 98.9 (27).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Patrick Ewing, Monty Williams, Don Reid, Troy Hudson.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Shawn Kemp, Jacque Vaughn, Olumide Oyedeji.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: When Tim Duncan turned down a chance to play with Grant
Hill, they went to Plan B, Tracy McGrady. Unfortunately for the
Magic, Hill has played 18 games in two seasons and the team has had
to resort to desperation moves for old/fat men like Horace Grant,
Ewing and now Kemp, looking for a big man. Kemp is still over 300
pounds; the Magic just hopes he can plug up the middle against the
other power forwards who play center in the East. Having undergone
yet another operation on his right ankle, Hill is ready to start the
season but he was ready to start the last two, too.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: They may be able to create more cap space next summer
for a big man. What happens in the meantime depends on Hill's ankle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MILWAUKEE BUCKS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 41-41, ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 97.5 (8). Defense: 97.7 (22).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Glenn Robinson, Darvin Ham.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Toni Kukoc, Kevin Ollie, No. 1 pick Marcus Haislip, No.
2 pick Dan Gadzuric.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: It was a rough year for George Karl, who went from the
East finals to nowhere and then failed his country as well, losing an
unprecedented three games at the World Championship. This called for
bold initiatives, like finally giving away his Big Dog, sending
Robinson to Atlanta for whoever's salary matched up (it turned out to
be Kukoc, but the last team he had a major impact on was Treviso
Benneton). This allows Tim Thomas, signed for $11 million per season
two seasons ago but left on the bench, to start. Unfortunately, Karl
still has the Anthony Mason problem, having given this world-class
malcontent $20 million for four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: There's way too much talent to miss the playoffs
again. Then again, everyone liked the U.S. in the World Champioship.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHILADELPHIA 76ERS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 43-39, sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 91.0 (27). Defense: 89.4 (2).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Dikembe Mutombo, Matt Harpring, Raja Bell, Corie Blount.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Keith Van Horn, Todd MacCulloch, Olden Polynice, Monty
Williams, Brian Skinner, Greg Buckner.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Larry Brown's old friend, assistant and boss, Pacer
President Donnie Walsh, once said that if you made every trade Brown
wanted, you'd get rid of all your players and then get them all back.
Give that man an A in abnormal psych. Brown reacquired Derrick
Coleman, who's on his best behavior now that he's on his last, gimpy
legs, and tried to bring back Jerry Stackhouse and Larry Hughes.
Brown's latest coup is trading Mutombo, then deciding he's so short
at center, he had to sign Polynice, who has been out of the game for
a year. The only question in the improbable Brown-Allen Iverson
alliance remains who leaves first.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: It's one miracle per team in its Brown era and the
76ers have had theirs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ATLANTA HAWKS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 33-49, 12th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 94.0 (19). Defense: 98.3 (25).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Jacque Vaughn, Toni Kukoc.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Glenn Robinson, Darvin Ham, No. 1 pick Dan Dickau.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Since acquiring Theo Ratliff, then 27, for Dikembe
Mutombo, then listed as 34 although lots of people thought he was
closer to 43, Ratliff has played three games while Mutombo played
106. Go figure. Ratliff is over his hip injury, giving the Hawks a
good-looking front line with Robinson and Shareef Abdur-Rahim, backed
up by Nazr Mohammed and Alan Henderson. The backcourt looks OK with
Jason Terry, Ira Newble, Dion Glover and Dickau. However, no matter
how good they look on paper recently, they haven't performed on the
floor. Now they're so confident, they have promised to refund $125 to
each season-ticket holder if they don't make the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: You'll notice they didn't say they'd give all the
money back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHICAGO BULLS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 21-61, 15th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 89.5 (28). Defense: 98.0 (23).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Travis Best, Charles Oakley, Kevin Ollie.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: No. 1 pick Jay Williams, Donyell Marshall, Corie Blount.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Williams may as well have arrived from heaven as from
Duke, so perfectly does he fill their needs. Pro scouts were off him
last season but he's a big-time talent who can run the point and
already has three-point range. This team, however, will rise or fall
with last season's rookies, 7-foot, 230-pound Tyson Chandler and
6-11, 285-pound Eddy Curry. Chandler wowed people with his
athleticism last season but still lacks offense. Curry was soft but
played tougher in exhibitions, when Celtic announcer Tom Heinsohn
said, "In two years, he'll be the center on the All-Star team." He
meant the East All-Star team, but it was still nice.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: After 66 wins in four seasons, they're not quite ready
to turn it around but if Chandler and Curry keep coming, look out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI HEAT</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 36-46, 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 87.2 (29). Defense: 88.7 (1).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Alonzo Mourning, Kendall Gill.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: No. 1 pick Caron Butler, Travis Best, Malik Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: So much for Pat Riley's time in Miami. Oh, he's still
there? The loss of Mourning leaves a humbled Riley no choice but to
begin rebuilding all over again after seven seasons there. A
veterans' coach who didn't start James Worthy as a rookie, he's now
expected to start Butler along with Allen, a 6-10 free agent whose
NBA experience consists of 12 games last season. Riley still has
Eddie Jones, who has played well, even if he can't carry them, and
Brian Grant. After starting 5-23 last season, they went on a
startling 24-6 run but faded because they weren't sure what to expect
day to day from Mourning. Now he's gone and they're on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Riley is never more dangerous than when everyone's
writing him off but even in the East, he's overmatched now.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW YORK KNICKS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 30-52, 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 91.6 (24). Defense: 95.6 (14).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Marcus Camby, Mark Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Antonio McDyess, Michael Doleac.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Oops. Having again spurned rebuilding the old-fashioned
way -- with young players -- they watched McDyess blow out a knee in
the third exhibition game and there went his/their season. Then came
President Scott Layden's farce, fining Latrell Sprewell $250,000 for
not disclosing his hand injury, starting a feud that monopolized the
tabloid back pages all preseason and succeeded only in making the
Knicks look more pathetic. The only questions now are when Sprewell
leaves, when their nine-year sellout streak ends, who gets thrown to
the mob and whether David Stern, who wouldn't throw the last lottery
so they could get Yao Ming, will rig this one so they can get LeBron
James.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction:  Sprewell leaves and the streak ends soon. Layden and
Coach Don Chaney are both axed. Stern won't rig the lottery but is
tempted.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CLEVELAND CAVALIERS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 29-53, 14th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 95.3 (16). Defense: 98.6 (26).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Andre Miller, Bryant Stith, Michael Doleac, Brian Skinner.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Darius Miles, No. 1 pick Dajuan Wagner.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: If some teams, like the Knicks, refused to rebuild, there
are the Cavaliers, who are always rebuilding. Not that that's
guaranteed, either. The Cavaliers just traded Miller, their widely
admired steal from the 1999 draft, because he was two seasons away
from unrestricted free agency. With attendance diving and owner
Gordon Gund reportedly looking to sell, the Cavaliers don't do big
contracts any more. Nor did the fact that they had to donate Miller
to the Clippers for whatever the Clippers would give them deter the
Cavaliers, either. This is a naked ploy to go for the bottom and the
most chances in the lottery, hoping to come up with the hotshot prep,
LeBron James, who's from nearby Akron.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Miles, who'll get to take 20 shots a game, happens
while they lose 65 games.</TE>

<LD>LAKERS</LD>
<LD>   2001-02 record: 58-24, third.</LD>
<LD>   Offense: 101.3 (3) Defense: 94.1 (9, tie).</LD>
<TE>   Gone: Lindsey Hunter, Mitch Richmond, Jelani McCoy.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: No. 1 pick Kareem Rush, Tracy Murray.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The only questions these days are Shaquille O'Neal's
health, weight and state of mind. Last season, he was hurt,
overweight and didn't get his head straight until the middle of the
West finals. After that, he devoured all comers. His feet remain a
concern, sidelining him and all but ruling out a fast start, but
happily for the Lakers, he looks trimmer and happier. The challenge
isn't as much actual as spiritual: They have to show they can still
bring it for an entire season. After they routed the Spurs in the
2001 West finals, the Lakers pooh-poohed the importance of home-court
advantage until seeing how much fun it was to play Game 7 in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: They'll struggle without O'Neal but look for an
earlier wakeup call, by about six months.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SACRAMENTO KINGS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 61-21, first.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 104.6 (2) Defense: 97.0 (19).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: No one of note.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Keon Clark.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Not that their ascent has left them dizzy but ... 70
wins? That's what Mike Bibby predicted -- not long before hurting his
right foot and having the surgery that will keep him out until
December. Yes, talking trash has it perils and is best left to the
Lakers, who have more practice. Bibby's amazing rise last spring,
after four merely nice seasons, means they're full-fledged rivals, no
longer limited by Chris Webber's weaknesses. Nevertheless, there's
still a difference, however diminished, between the Kings, who have
depth, and the Lakers, who have superstars. The 6-11 Clark was
another nice pickup by General Manager Geoff Petrie but at 225
pounds, Clark will join the gang helping out on Shaq, rather than
play him one-on-one.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: On the other hand, as the Lakers learned just in time,
the Lakers' B game won't do any more.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SAN ANTONIO SPURS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 58-24, second.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 96.7 (10). Defense: 90.5 (3).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Antonio Daniels, Terry Porter, Charles Smith, Cherokee
Parks.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Emanuel Ginobili, Speedy Claxton, Kevin Willis, Steve
Kerr, Erick Barkley, Mengke Bateer.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: David Robinson will retire after this season, officially,
although some say he did that three years ago. The Admiral had been
getting off to ever slower starts in his tricky new role as Tim
Duncan's helper. Nevertheless, Robinson would come on in the stretch.
If he hadn't hurt his back last spring, these battlers, who scared
the Lakers, would have been even more trouble. But the team is still
in transition, with 20-year-old point guard Tony Parker alongside
this year's hope, Argentine shooting guard Manu (the Man) Ginobili,
who was a star in Italy. By the time their backcourt is ready,
Robinson may be retired in fact, as well as theory.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: They have as much talent as anyone, but much of it
just got there or is on its way out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DALLAS MAVERICKS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 57-25, fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 105.2 (1). Defense: 101.0 (28).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Greg Buckner.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Popeye Jones, Raja Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: People wondered if they were real or just real
entertaining until Sacramento exposed them in a 4-1 second-round
termination. The Mavericks weren't big enough. Even wunderkind Dirk
Nowitzki turned out to have holes in his high-scoring game. It's
unfair to critique his defense since none of them play any. By the
Mavericks' own reckoning, of the Kings' 207 field goals, an
astounding/depressing 115 were on layups or dunks, including two
unchallenged drives to the hoop by the pint-sized Mike Bibby that
tied the pivotal Game 4 in regulation and won it in overtime. On the
positive side, it's fun watching owner Mark Cuban, who rode Coach Don
Nelson's coattails this far, thrash around.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Now they say the answer is ... Shawn Bradley? Unless
they do a mind meld on him, they'd better come up with something
better than that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 49-33, sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 96.6 (11). Defense: 93.7 (8).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Shawn Kemp, Steve Kerr, Erick Barkley.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Arvydas Sabonis, Antonio Daniels, Jeff McInnis, Charles
Smith, No. 1 pick Qyntel Woods.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Sabonis' retirement turned them from a big, deep team to
an ordinary-size one, but he's back. Unfortunately, Sabonis is about
to turn 38 and lost his mobility when his Achilles' tendons went --
in his early 20s -- so let's not pencil them back in at their old
level. Adding to Coach Maurice Cheeks' challenges, General Manager
Bob Whitsitt created another logjam at point, adding McInnis and
Daniels to Damon Stoudamire, to go with their excess bodies at the
big guard and small forward positions.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: They're still a long night's work, assuming Cheeks can
keep them from killing each other.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   UTAH JAZZ</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 44-38, eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 96.0 (14). Defense: 95.1 (13).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Bryon Russell, Donyell Marshall.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Matt Harpring, Mark Jackson, Calbert Cheaney.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Coach Jerry Sloan almost lost his mind coaching eight
free agents, not to mention a balky Karl Malone, who picked a bad
time -- the start of last season -- to review his career options
anew. The Jazz started 6-11, posted its worst record in 15 years,
squeezed into the playoffs at No. 8 and fell, 3-1, to the Kings, who
won twice in the Delta Center, after which management waved bye-bye
to Marshall and Russell. However, having rebuilt continuously around
Malone and John Stockton, they know the drill. Andre Kirilenko and
Jarron Collins helped last season. A better attitude would be handy.
They don't have any years to waste.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Oops, Malone is back negotiating in the papers, musing
he may retire if the Jazz doesn't extend him, etc. Of course, by now,
they all know that drill too.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 50-32, fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 99.3 (5). Defense: 96.0 (16).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Sam Mitchell, Chauncey Billups.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Troy Hudson, Kendall Gill.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: The honeymoon's way over in Minneapolis, which was once
happy to cheer a .500 team with a star who wasn't looking to bail, a
la Stephon Marbury, but turned up its nose when the Timberwolves, who
won 50-47-50 the last three seasons without a starting-caliber
center, failed to get out of the first round again. On the other
hand, last season now looks like the good old days. Terrell Brandon,
who missed 50 games, isn't back. Billups, his backup, left. Anthony
Peeler, upset about his contract, was fined for missing an
exhibition. Management stalled Wally Szczerbiak, a legend in own his
mind, who wanted a maximum extension. Felipe Lopez was lost for the
season.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: The big question: Will Kevin Garnett, upcoming free
agent, stay, and if he does, as he promises to, why?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SEATTLE SUPERSONICS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 45-37, seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 97.7 (6). Defense: 94.7 (12).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Vin Baker, Shammond Williams, Earl Watson, Olumiji Oyedeji.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Kenny Anderson, Vitaly Potapenko, Joseph Forte.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Howard Schultz, who gave you the $3 cup of coffee you
have to learn a foreign language to order, is trying to breathe life
into the SuperSonics as he did with Starbucks but it isn't easy. He
unloaded the untradable Baker (thank you, Celtics) but still has a
problem with his 34-year-old franchise player, Gary Payton, an
upcoming free agent who's unhappy about Schultz's pointed refusal to
offer him an extension. Everyone knows Schultz wants Jason Kidd,
including Kidd's pal ... Payton. Tell-it-like-it-is Coach Nate
McMillan booted them into the playoffs but they're not happy campers.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Payton's always mad anyway, giving him an edge over
the seven Clippers, who are upset about their contract situations.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CLIPPERS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 39-43, ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 95.7 (15). Defense: 96.1 (17).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Darius Miles, Jeff McInnis, Obinna Ekezie.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Andre Miller, Bryant Stith, Cherokee Parks, No. 1 picks
Chris Wilcox and Melvin Ely.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Even with injuries and a slow start, they're good enough
to make the playoffs. Unfortunately, their ancient enemy has arisen
again to spread confusion among them. Yes, Donald T. Sterling.
Failing to realize that this group was truly different -- not to
mention highly profitable -- he didn't re-sign Michael Olowokandi,
his coming young center; Miller, the widely-admired point guard for
whom he traded Miles; and Elton Brand, beloved by all who know him.
Now all their young players wonder about their future here. Between
those who can walk in '03 (Olowokandi), '04 (Brand, Miller, Lamar
Odom, Corey Maggette) and '05 (Quentin Richardson, Keyon Dooling),
there's your nucleus.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Synchronize watches. Looks as if we're counting down
to the usual scenario.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHOENIX SUNS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 36-46, 10th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 95.1 (17). Defense: 95.8 (15).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: No one of note.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: No. 1 picks Amare Stoudemire and Casey Jacobsen, Scott
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Alarmed by the Suns' decline and run-ins with the law,
owner Jerry Colangelo traded Jason Kidd for Stephon Marbury, turning
two franchises around. With the hard-headed Marbury and oft-injured
Penny Hardaway and Tom Gugliotta, the Suns now have $35 million in
annual salary worth of problems. Tunneling out, they have since
traded Rodney Rogers for promising Joe Johnson, re-signed Shawn
Marion and drafted the high-bounding, 6-foot-8 1/2, 235-pound prep
Stoudemire.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: This season depends on chilling out Marbury. The
future depends on finding new homes for the $35 Mill Trio.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HOUSTON ROCKETS</TE>
<TE>   2001-02 record: 28-54, 11th.</TE>
<TE>   Offense: 92.3 (22). Defense: 97.2 (20).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Kevin Willis.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: No. 1 picks Yao Ming and Bostjan Nachbar.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Owner Les Alexander, hyperventilating since they went
into the lottery with the fifth-worst record and came out with the
7-foot-5 Yao, says this could be "one of the great teams in history."
Maybe he means one of the best teams he has owned but this won't even
be that. Yao didn't arrive until last week and within a few minutes
in his first exhibition, committed a lane violation on a free throw,
had a rebound taken out of his hands by Emanuel Ginobili and a shot
blocked by David Robinson. On the other hand, Yao is surely better
than the other tall geeks he has been compared to (Manute Bol?)
Nevertheless, it'll take him two or three seasons -- not months -- to
adjust to the faster, rougher NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Despite the hype when he faces Shaq or Tim Duncan,
this isn't even Chapter One of the Yao Saga, just the Introduction.</TE>

<TE>   Offense: 89.9 (27). Defense: 97.3 (21).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: No one of note.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: President Jerry West, No. 1 pick Drew Gooden, Wesley
Person, Earl Watson.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Be careful what you wish for, you might get it. West, the
Laker icon who went into the front office and helped assembled not
one, but two dynasties, starts over with a team of kids that has
never won more than 23 games. On the other hand, he's Jerry West and
the kids are good. The 7-foot Pao Gasol, a revelation as a rookie,
came back 10 pounds heavier at 220. West thinks he may eventually
weigh 250-plus and play center. West's first draft pick, Gooden,
averaged 18 points in exhibitions, looking like another hot rookie.
However, Lorenzen Wright, a power forward, plays center, a problem in
this conference, and West has to chill out Jason Williams, whose head
has repelled all comers.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: They'll win more than 23. May shock the world and win
30-35.</TE>

<TE>   Offense: 97.7 (7). Defense: 103.1 (29).</TE>
<TE>   Gone: Coaches Dave Cowens and Brian Winters, Larry Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving: Coach Eric Musselman, No. 1 picks Mike Dunleavy and Jiri
Welsch.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. Those words,
inscribed above the gates of Hell in Dante's "Divine Comedy," belong
on the Warrior logo too, after a free fall dating all the way back to
Don Nelson trading Chris Webber ... nine years ago. Shallow-pockets
owner Chris Cohan and overdue-for-termination General Manager Garry
St. Jean make bad choices. Coaches are overmatched. Players don't
always/often compete. Musselman, son of a coach (Bill), was a sharp
young assistant. If Musselman can get these guys to play, he will
have accomplished something no Warrior coach has in years.</TE>
<TE>   Prediction: Of course, they'll help bring up the rear in any
event.</TE>

<TE>   Arriving: Coach Jeff Bzdelik, No. 1 picks Nikoloz Tskitishvili and
Nene Hilario, Marcus Camby, Chris Whitney, Rodney White.</TE>
<TE>   Outlook: People wondered if rookie General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe
was too nice to succeed in the black hole that swallowed so many but
his draft day moves to get the 19-year-old Tskitishvili (pronounced
SKEET-tzish-vee-lee) and the 20-year-old Hilario, showed he had a
plan: Go with kids, save salary cap money, try to sign a big free
agent. If they luck into next spring's first pick -- and prep phenom
LeBron James -- all the better. Nor is Vandeweghe bringing in a point
guard, letting young Kenny Satterfield battle Junior Harrington for
the job.</TE>

have a future.</TE>

<KH>BUFFALO 24, DETROIT 17</KH>
<HD>Bills' Defense Fills the Hole</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ORCHARD PARK, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>With Drew Bledsoe running the offense, it might be easy to overlook
the Buffalo Bills' unheralded defense.</LD>
<LD>   Not Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Linebacker London Fletcher bailed out the Bills, stopping James
Stewart for no gain on fourth and inches at the Buffalo 20 with 1:52
left in the game, securing Buffalo's 24-17 victory over the Detroit
Lions.</LD>
<TE>   Travis Henry's fumble set up the Lions' final push.</TE>
<TE>   Fletcher got penetration on the left side, catching Stewart as he
got to the line of scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   "London Fletcher, going mano-a-mano in the hole with Stewart, that
was big time," linebacker Keith Neman added.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe then sealed the victory on the next possession, hitting
Eric Moulds with a 12-yard pass on third down, allowing Buffalo to
run out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe, who entered the game as the NFL's leading passer this
season, finished 21 for 36 for 302 yards with a touchdown -- a
59-yarder to Peerless Price.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Bills' once-maligned defense that came up biggest.</TE>
<TE>   "They were taking a lot of heat at the start of the season," said
Moulds, who had 123 yards receiving. "I think that they have turned
it around, saying, 'We're not just going to rely on our offense to
carry us.' "</TE>
<TE>   The unit that gave up an average of 35 points in the first five
games has surrendered only 34 points in the last 10 quarters.</TE>
<TE>   The resurgent Bills (5-3) have won three in a row and are in the
thick of the AFC East race, behind idle Miami (5-2).</TE>
<TE>   The Lions (2-5) still can't win on the road. They've lost a
franchise-record 12 in a row away from home, and their last road
victory was against the New York Jets on Dec. 17, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is five weeks where we've been within one drive of winning
the game," rookie quarterback Joey Harrington said.</TE>

<LD>A former Laker beat writer, Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News
had his own view of the battle between L.A. and Sacramento after
Friday's exhibition game skirmish.</LD>
<LD>   "The NBA will experience a regime change in June because the Kings
aren't intimidated by the Lakers anymore," Kawakami wrote.</LD>
<LD>   "It's about knowing you can get your shots when and where you want
them, about figuring out how to keep [Shaquille] O'Neal from smashing
rims and Kobe Bryant from slashing you to bits.</LD>
<TE>   "But the physical stuff doesn't hurt either. They always say: To
take the title away from a champion, you have to put the champion on
the floor."</TE>
<TE>   One question: Who is "they"?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Which are the four Pacific 10 schools with winning
bowl records?</TE>
<TE>   Juicy controversy: Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle:</TE>
<TE>   "Major League Baseball officials provided proof that the balls are
juiced by officially denying it. What are they going to say? 'You
caught us!'</TE>
<TE>   "Of course they juiced the ball. The marquee guy is [Barry] Bonds,
and MLB is fighting desperately for a TV audience, and it needs the
big stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Light tap: San Diego Charger quarterback Drew Brees, after Raider
fans pelted the Chargers with objects after a San Diego overtime win:
"I got a water bottle on the top of my helmet -- it might have been
the hardest hit I took all day."</TE>
<TE>   Cocky quarterback: Tony Siragusa, former Baltimore defensive
tackle, on Brett Favre's cool under fire:</TE>
<TE>   "Let me tell you, when we played him last year, he killed us, the
Ravens.</TE>
<TE>   "He goes up to the line of scrimmage. Quarterbacks usually go and
concentrate on the defensive line. This guy comes up and says. 'Hey,
Goose, it's on two.' "</TE>
<TE>   Nobody to somebody: Nick Canepa of the San Diego Union-Tribune on
the Chargers' fast start: "The Rams, Ravens and Patriots, the past
three Super Bowl winners, were nobodies before they won.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the way of the NFL these days. The Chargers have been
nobodies for six years, so they have impeccable credentials."</TE>
<TE>   Cinch courses: Dwight Perry in the Seattle Times:</TE>
<TE>   "After Alex Rodriguez donated $3.9 million to the University of
Miami and then announced he would start attending classes there, [do
you] think there's a professor there who'll give him a B?"</TE>
<TE>   Bud's boo-boo: Bud Geracie of the San Jose Mercury News checked in
with the bad prediction of the week: "[Saturday] at 9 a.m., it's
midnight for Cinderella Notre Dame."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1922, USC lost to California, 12-0.
It was the Trojans' only loss of the season. They finished with a
10-1 record after defeating Penn State, 14-3, in the Rose Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Arizona State, USC, Washington and Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "In those
orange jerseys, the Cleveland Browns looked like they should be
picking up trash on the side of the road."</TE>

<KH>DENVER 24, NEW ENGLAND 16</KH>
<HD>Patriots Set Up Broncos With a Long, Good Bye</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The Denver Broncos hope their bye week is better than the one the New
England Patriots just endured.</LD>
<LD>   The Broncos won, 24-16, Sunday over the Super Bowl champions, who
went back to basics during their extra practice time. What can they
try next?</LD>
<LD>   "We have lost four games in a row," said a terse Patriot Coach
Bill Belichick, whose postgame remarks lasted only 2 minutes 48
seconds. "It is hard to have confidence."</LD>
<TE>   Denver (6-2) should have plenty after winning its second
consecutive game, both on the road, with a balanced offense and an
aggressive defense.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton Portis ran for 111 yards and two touchdowns, Ed McCaffrey
caught eight passes for 115 yards, and Brian Griese completed 18 of
23 passes for 229 yards and an eight-yard touchdown pass to Shannon
Sharpe.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL's top-ranked run defense held the Patriots to 179 yards
and sacked Tom Brady five times.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a good spot. Not only are we 6-2, but other than Tom
Nalen, we're pretty injury-free," Griese said. "New England, if you
look at it, should have been hungrier than they were."</TE>
<TE>   Nalen, the four-time Pro Bowl center, is out for the season with a
knee injury, but the Broncos moved the ball well with second-year pro
Ben Hamilton replacing him.</TE>
<TE>   "You win by playing with heart, energy and enthusiasm," said
Brady, who was 15 for 29 for 130 yards. "The last four games, it's
the other teams that have shown that."</TE>
<TE>   Denver moved half a game behind idle San Diego in the AFC West and
plays division rival Oakland (4-3) in two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the perfect time for the break so, hopefully, the little
bruises recover and we can come back and continue the streak," Portis
said.</TE>
<TE>   Portis, who had touchdown runs of one and four yards, helped the
Patriots (3-4) extend to five consecutive games their streak of
allowing an opponent to rush for more than 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Griese threw a touchdown pass for the 23rd consecutive game, the
longest current streak in the NFL, but his team-record streak of four
games with at least 300 yards passing ended.</TE>

<HD>Browns' Rally Honors Lerner</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.</DL>
<LD>As Coach Butch Davis left the field, he looked up to the sky. He
sensed his Cleveland Browns did something very special Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Four days after team owner Al Lerner died, the Browns rallied from
an 18-point deficit to beat the New York Jets 24-21.</LD>
<LD>   Quarterback Tim Couch, who threw two touchdown passes and a
two-point conversion in the second half, said the team wanted to play
well for Lerner and his family.</LD>
<TE>   "This was about courage and heart and it exemplified what Mr.
Lerner was all about," said Couch, who finished 33 for 49 for 307
yards.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Dawson's third field goal, from 35 yards, won it after Couch
guided another long second-half drive. But the game turned in the
third quarter, when the Browns scored 15 points to tie at 21-21.</TE>
<TE>   Couch, shrugged off several near sacks in throwing a five-yard
touchdown pass to a diving Mark Campbell, then a four-yarder to
rookie Andre' Davis. And his lob under heavy pressure for the tying
two-point conversion somehow found Dennis Northcutt in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   New York (2-5) dominated the first half but stopped pressing its
advantage in the third period, when it was outgained, 93-2.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland (4-4) dominated the final quarter against the Jets --
who wasted three timeouts in the third quarter -- and staged a drive
of 8:33 to the winning field goal.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Brown blocked John Hall's 44-yard field-goal attempt with
16 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   After holding Cleveland to a three-and-out to start things, the
Jets got Santana Moss' 63-yard punt return with just 39 seconds gone.
The Browns had nobody on the left side of the field as Moss sped down
the sideline for the first punt return for a touchdown of his career,
and the second-quickest touchdown in Jet history.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave them some early openings ... but we never felt we were
out of the game," Davis said.</TE>

<KH>TAMPA BAY 12, CAROLINA 9</KH>
<HD>Confident Kicker Makes Difference</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHARLOTTE, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Jon Gruden glanced down the sideline at his kicker, wondering how
confident Martin Gramatica was feeling. Gramatica gave him a knowing
nod.</LD>
<LD>   Gramatica kicked a 53-yard field goal to tie the score, then a
47-yarder with five seconds remaining to lift the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers to a 12-9 victory over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   "He asked me how I felt and I said, 'Good,' because I felt real
good today," Gramatica said. "Thank God I made it, otherwise he'd
stop asking."</LD>
<TE>   Gramatica converted all four of his field-goal attempts to help
the Buccaneers (6-2) win a defensive struggle. Three of the kicks
came in the fourth quarter, including a 52-yarder.</TE>
<TE>   Asked after the game what his range was, Gramatica laughed. "I
guess it was 53. I was maxed out," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That kick came with 1:55 to play and tied the score, 9-9. It was
set up by a fumbled punt by Carolina's Steve Smith. Before that, the
Panthers (3-5) appeared poised to win the game by forcing Tampa Bay
to punt. Instead, the Buccaneers got the ball on their 42-yard line
and needed only one play to move into Gramatica's range and tie the
score.</TE>
<TE>   "Our margin of error is not great enough where we can afford to
make one mistake," Carolina Coach John Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   After the tying kick, the Panthers failed to get a first down and
had to punt with 1:20 left. Rob Johnson completed two passes to
Keyshawn Johnson, then, after the quarterback took a hard hit, Shaun
King connected with Karl Williams to set up with winner.</TE>
<TE>   Panther rookie Randy Fasani completed five of 18 passes for 46
yards with three interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't play that well, and I expect more of myself," Fasani
said. "Granted, it was a tough team to play against in my first
start."</TE>

<KH>KANSAS CITY 20, OAKLAND 10</KH>
<HD>Chief Defense Plays Against Type to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Kansas City's defense wasn't itself. That's great news for the
Chiefs.</LD>
<LD>   Priest Holmes totaled 184 yards running and receiving, and the
NFL's lowest-rated defense held the league's highest-rated offense to
one touchdown as the Chiefs beat the Oakland Raiders, 20-10, Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The victory was Kansas City's first in six games against Oakland
(4-3), which has lost three straight.</LD>
<TE>   "We shut up our critics, for a while anyway," said defensive
tackle Derrick Ransom, who blocked Sebastian Janikowski's 44-yard
field-goal attempt in the first half. "We're professionals. We have
our pride. All that stuff people were saying, you just have to let it
go in one ear and out the other."</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Mike Maslowski forced Jerry Rice to fumble and
recovered the ball on the Oakland 22 with 4:39 left, setting up Trent
Green's four-yard touchdown pass to Tony Richardson with 1:55 to go.
The win keeps the Chiefs (4-4) in contention for the AFC West title.</TE>
<TE>   "I just came underneath and ripped it," said Maslowski. "We knew
they were going to make short catches. We just couldn't let them get
away from us."</TE>
<TE>   The Raiders, who were without starters at running back and in the
secondary, averaged almost 33 points a game, second only to Kansas
City's 34.1.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brown, who hinted that he was tired of not getting the ball
enough, caught 13 passes for 144 yards.</TE>
<TE>   But their only touchdown against a Kansas City defense giving up
441 yards and 32.9 points a game came on a one-yard pass from Rich
Gannon to Doug Jolley in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Gannon was 35 of 55 for 334 yards and joined Steve
Young and Kurt Warner as the only players in NFL history to pass for
more than 300 yards in six consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can tell you ... is that there were too many mistakes
offensively, Gannon said. "You can't expect to beat a good team on
the road when you make the mistakes we did."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes had 91 yards in 23 carries and caught six passes for 93
yards.</TE>
<TE>   "We studied film all week on him," said Oakland safety Rod
Woodson. "And we kept saying, 'Find Priest Holmes.... If he's your
guy, hug him.' " "But for three and a half quarters, we didn't do
that."</TE>
<TE>   The Chiefs led, 13-7, on Holmes' three-yard touchdown run heading
into the fourth quarter. Less than four minutes into the quarter,
Janikowski kicked a 32-yard field goal to make it 13-10.</TE>
<TE>   Morten Andersen kicked field goals of 46 and 22 yards for the
Chiefs in the first half. The Raiders scored their touchdown after an
unnecessary roughness penalty on linebacker Glenn Cadrez gave them a
first down.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers must trim their roster to 15 players today.</LD>
<LD>   One way to do it is to waive free-agent forwards Mike Batiste and
Tremaine Fowlkes and then put forwards Melvin Ely (sore toe) and
Lamar Odom (sprained ankle) and guard Bryant Stith (knee surgery) on
the injured list. That would leave the Clippers with 12 players on
the active roster to start the season.</LD>
<LD>   If Coach Alvin Gentry sticks to his plan to use an eight- or
nine-man rotation and the Clippers are more free of injury than they
have been during training camp, the last three or four bench players
aren't going to take off their warm-ups too often this season.</LD>
<TE>   The starting five appears to be set, with Elton Brand at power
forward, Michael Olowokandi at center, Corey Maggette at small
forward (until Odom is fit), Quentin Richardson at shooting guard and
Andre Miller at point guard.</TE>
<TE>   The top reserves are expected to be guards Marko Jaric and Eric
Piatkowski, forward Cherokee Parks and center Sean Rooks -- at least
to start the season.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen how often Gentry will play guard Keyon
Dooling, forward Chris Wilcox or center Wang Zhizhi, particularly
after Odom regains his fitness after being sidelined by a badly
sprained right ankle since February.</TE>
<TE>   Because of a string of injuries during camp, Gentry may want to
expand his rotation while several injured players work themselves
into game shape.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Brand and Olowokandi are not locks to start in the
opener Wednesday against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Brand underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his right knee Sept. 26 and Olowokandi has
tendinitis in his left knee and a strained left hip.</TE>
<TE>   Neither played in any of the eight exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers also might wish to trade a player to simplify their
rotation, but Gentry on Sunday termed a trade "very unlikely" because
so many teams in the NBA are "on the verge of the luxury tax and
don't want to go over it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gentry has had to scale back a new game plan for 2002-03 because
injured players have missed so much time.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers will play tighter defense farther up the court to try
to create turnovers and force the opposition into taking hurried
shots as the 24-second shot clock winds down. But Gentry hasn't
introduced other new wrinkles because injuries have left the team so
far behind.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not really playing catch-up, but we've tried to eliminate
some things so we could concentrate on getting good at some other
things," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to introduce some plays yet. We're giving some
guys a little more freedom to create things. We've got some smart
players, in general."</TE>

<KH>WASHINGTON 26, INDIANAPOLIS 21</KH>
<HD>Matthews Returns to Spark Redskins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LANDOVER, Md.</DL>
<LD>Was that really Steve Spurrier coaching the Washington Redskins?</LD>
<LD>   With an attack bearing little resemblance to Spurrier's Fun 'n'
Gun, the Redskins dominated the Indianapolis Colts with a patient
offense that moved the yardsticks and controlled the clock in a 26-21
victory Sunday night.</LD>
<LD>   Shane Matthews, unhappy that he was benched three weeks ago,
justified his gripe by returning to lead a methodical, nearly
error-free attack.</LD>
<TE>   The Redskins (3-4) ended a two-game losing streak. The Colts
(4-3), who have not been impressive this season despite their winning
record, have struggled in consecutive prime-time games after last
Monday's 28-10 loss to Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, despite trailing, 20-0, in the first half and playing poorly
most of the game, the Colts managed to put together a decent drive
and got a big punt return in the second half to make a game of it.</TE>
<TE>   They had a chance to tie the score after rookie Ricky Williams'
20-yard touchdown catch with 6:46 to play, but Fred Smoot broke up a
pass intended for Qadry Ismail on a two-point conversion attempt.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins then essentially ran out the clock with the running
of Kenny Watson, who played the second half after Stephen Davis left
with a sprained right knee. James Tuthill's 22-yard field goal with
18 seconds remaining, his fourth of the game, capped the scoring.</TE>
<TE>   Washington committed nine turnovers and gave up 13 sacks in the
last two games with rookie quarterback Patrick Ramsey, but Matthews
was 17 of 35 for 210 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions
and was sacked only once -- even though two regulars on the offensive
line didn't start because of injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had 80 yards in 16 carries in the first half. Watson
finished with 67 yards in 15 carries. The Redskins ran 37 times and
passed 36, an un-Spurrier-like ratio.</TE>
<TE>   The Redskins scored on their first four possessions, scored a
touchdown in the first quarter for the first time this season and led
at halftime, 23-7, for the first time this season.</TE>

<LD>   What: "Showtime Dreams: The 2002-2003 Laker Girls"</LD>
<LD>   Where: Fox Sports Net 2, tonight, 8.</LD>
<TE>   Fox Sports Net, granted unprecedented access, provides a
behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to become a Laker Girl in
this one-hour special that first aired Sunday at 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Probably not too many people saw it, however, because Game 7 of
the World Series was on big-brother Fox at the same time. But Fox
Sports Net has a number of re-airings, including tonight's.</TE>
<TE>   The first part of the show offers coverage of this year's tryouts
at the Laker offices and practice facility in El Segundo. Nearly 500
young women showed up.</TE>
<TE>   Although the show doesn't offer much substance, there is more to
it than young women dancing. Jerry Buss, who created the Lakers Girls
and started an NBA trend, is among those interviewed.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always a big college basketball fan and I always thought
cheerleaders and dance groups added of lot of excitement and
entertainment value," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Devean George says he'll sneak peaks at the Laker Girls during
games, but Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant claim they don't look.
Bryant says the only time he looked was last season when, during a
routine on roller skates, "one girl landed right on her butt."</TE>
<TE>   In the second part of the show, Lisa Estrada, longtime Laker Girl
director, phones finalists to let them know if they made the squad.
Estrada and the finalist she's calling appear on camera. This works
the first time, when Shannon, with her fingers crossed, is told she
made it. But the producers run this bit into the ground. In all,
eight finalists get an orchestrated call from Estrada. Six are told
they made the squad and two are invited to try out again next year.</TE>
<TE>   The producers might want to try making this special again next
year as well. This one doesn't quite cut it.</TE>

<HD>16,743 and Counting</HD>
<DH>Smith finally surpasses Payton's mark with his best day
(109 yards) of the season. Cowboys lose, however, and two Seahawks
suffer serious injuries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>What began as a run for immortality yet sometimes felt more like a
crawl -- an inch-by-inch odyssey -- ended Sunday when Dallas Cowboy
running back Emmitt Smith passed the late Walter Payton to become the
NFL's all-time leading rusher.</LD>
<LD>   Needing 93 yards to eclipse Payton's mark of 16,726 yards, Smith
came through with a season-best 109, thanks in part to a Seattle
defense ranked last against the run.</LD>
<LD>   The record-breaking ramble came on a play called "15-lead" in the
fourth quarter, when Smith burst through the left side of the line,
spun out of an arm tackle and twisted forward for an 11-yard gain.
The capacity crowd erupted in cheers, hundreds of silver and blue
balloons were released into the Texas sky, and cannon blasts shook
the stadium to its rafters. That giddiness lingered, even after the
Cowboys wound up losing, 17-14, when Seattle's Rian Lindell kicked a
20-yard field goal with 25 seconds to play.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, after the game, it was almost as if the Seahawks had
lost. Seattle players were especially somber because of a
season-ending injury to quarterback Trent Dilfer, who suffered a torn
Achilles' tendon, and a concussion to receiver Darrell Jackson that
led to a seizure in the locker room. Jackson was taken by ambulance
to Baylor Medical Center and was in stable condition Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys celebrated Smith's record with a postgame celebration
that included appearances by Marcus Allen, Daryl Johnston, Michael
Irvin and Pat Summerall, as well as Payton's brother, Eddie, and
mother, Alyne.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so proud of you, Emmitt," Walter's widow, Connie, said in a
videotaped message. "Your hard work and determination, your being
true to the game, are a part of your success. I feel we're truly
blessed having you as a friend and part of our life."</TE>
<TE>   As plumes of smoke rose around a giant inflatable Cowboy helmet,
Smith made a postgame curtain call wearing a white cap with "16,727"
scrawled on the side. He ran along the wall that rings the field,
slapping hands with fans, then made his way to a star-shaped platform
at midfield.</TE>
<TE>   Cowboy owner Jerry Jones presented him with a silver football and
announced: "There's only one NFL rushing champion, and there's only
one Emmitt Smith."</TE>
<TE>   Smith, who broke down in tears this summer when the Payton family
presented him the "Spirit of Sweetness" award, dabbed at his eyes.
Later, he never stopped smiling as he answered reporters' questions
inside a giant tent erected in the parking lot. He was joined on the
dais by his wife, Pat, their three young children and Jones.
Thousands of fans waited outside, hoping for a glimpse of the star
running back.</TE>
<TE>   "Making history of this magnitude is such a special thing," said
Smith, 33, whose last 100-yard game came 10 months ago. "I've learned
how special it is when I saw Cal Ripken go through what he went
through, and I saw Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa go through what they
went through, and then I saw Barry Bonds do what he did."</TE>
<TE>   Smith set the record with Payton's mother and brother watching
from a luxury box. About 200 of Smith's family members and friends
attended the game, and play was stopped for five minutes after the
record-breaking run.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through his 13th season, Smith has 16,743 yards in 193
games; Payton played 190. That said, lots of people rank Smith down
the list when it comes to the best backs in league history. He's seen
by many as a survivor as much as a superstar, an exceptional talent
who was surrounded for much of his career by exceptional teammates --
players such as Troy Aikman, Michael Irvin and an offensive line
loaded with Pro Bowl behemoths.</TE>
<TE>   "From a media standpoint, I'm very confident that I'm one of the
best that ever played the game," he said. "But when you start talking
about the greatest of all time, how can you define the greatest?
Everybody has a unique skill."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how the Cowboys plan to use Smith's unique skill
after this season. There is very little chance the franchise will
keep him under the terms of his current contract. He's due to make a
base salary of $7 million next season, and his salary-cap number is
$9.8 million, so the team has a much cheaper and younger alternative
in 25-year-old Troy Hambrick.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Cowboys and Smith will find a way to squeeze
every possible buck out of the landmark accomplishment. Starting this
week, up to 6 million cans of Pepsi bearing Smith's likeness will hit
the shelves in Texas and the surrounding states. Motorola will use
Smith to sell telephones and high-speed modems.</TE>
<TE>   There will be Wheaties boxes too and $10,000 autographed sterling
silver Cowboy helmets -- only 22 of them, matching his jersey number.
For fans of more modest means, there are 50,000 shirts and 50,000
hats commemorating the feat, as well as 16,727 bobble-head Smith
dolls, equal to the yardage needed to pass Payton.</TE>
<TE>   Jones said a flag marking Smith's accomplishment will fly at Texas
Stadium alongside the team's Super Bowl banners.</TE>
<TE>   "Emmitt did this when the greatest, most physical athletes over
the last 12, 13 years have played this game in the history of
football," Jones said. "They are bigger, faster, can cover more
ground and stop more plays than any time in the history of football."</TE>
<TE>   Smith changed shoes and jerseys every quarter, setting aside the
valuable mementos, and he promised to give a jersey or helmet from
the game to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Smith participated in the coin toss, and Seattle
defensive tackle Chad Eaton told him, "You're not going to get it on
us today." Eaton repeated that during the game.</TE>
<TE>   "He talked more noise than anybody else on the Seahawk team,"
Smith said. "And when it finally happened, he just said,
'Congratulations, man.' "</TE>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>It's a tricky balancing act the Mighty Ducks bring to Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   They blew a 3-1 lead in the third period, losing, 4-3, to Edmonton
on Saturday. It was the third time in four games they have squandered
a lead with less than 10 minutes left. This one, though, was special.</LD>
<LD>   For starters, the collapse was pricier. Their previous
third-period adventures resulted in points, a 2-2 tie with Vancouver
and a 3-2 overtime victory over Colorado. This time, the Ducks came
away with nothing.</LD>
<TE>   What to do. Hang on to the memory so never to allow such a thing
again? Put it behind you and move on?</TE>
<TE>   "It's a combination of the two," team captain Paul Kariya said.
"We have to learn from this and at the same time we have another
game."</TE>
<TE>   Petr Sykora, fresh from a New Jersey team that knows how to play
with a lead, preached patience. But he was also disturbed by the
Ducks' play Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "We stopped playing and we stopped competing," Sykora said. "You
can't do that in this league. If you don't compete in the third
period, it is going to come back on you. We're not going to get many
leads on the road."</TE>

<HD>Almost a Hollow Feeling Around These Legends</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Paterno and Bobby Bowden, two of the greatest coaches of this or
any generation, finished the weekend a bit closer to the end of their
careers.</LD>
<LD>   This is foremost a statement about mortality; these icons can't go
on forever, no matter how much they think they can and no matter how
much they fight back time.</LD>
<LD>   Paterno turns 76 in December, Bowden clocks birthday No. 73 in
less than two weeks and for, the moment, both men are stuck.</LD>
<TE>   Penn State's third loss of the season left Paterno in a holding
pattern at 332 victories, and Florida State's third loss of the
season left Bowden four wins behind at 328.</TE>
<TE>   There were times Bowden and Paterno went years without combining
for six losses. Both giants have eclipsed Bear Bryant's major college
mark of 323 and, at some point, you wonder what's left to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   You see Paterno working, almost like a bantamweight, fighting out
of the corner trying to win back what was lost after the first
consecutive losing seasons in his illustrious career.</TE>
<TE>   You sense Paterno wanting desperately to get Penn State back on
top before he steps away, not wanting to become another Eddie
Robinson at Grambling, and you sense he thought this was the year to
do it, only to have his retooling plan unravel with two overtime
losses and, then, Saturday's oh-so-close, 13-7 loss to No. 6 Ohio
State.</TE>
<TE>   Paterno has for decades been college football's conscience, yet,
this season, out of obvious exasperation, he has lashed out in
peculiar and acceptable (for others) ways.</TE>
<TE>   After an overtime loss to Iowa, he chased referee Dick Honig out
of the stadium and physically touched him to protest a botched call.
Nothing malicious, mind you, and no one, including Honig, took
offense.</TE>
<TE>   But then came an overtime loss to Michigan, after which Paterno
complained about a possible regional bias because some in the
officiating crew resided in Ann Arbor.</TE>
<TE>   Other coaches in other conferences have been held accountable for
making similar comments -- Utah's Ron McBride, this year, to name one
-- yet Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delaney has been conspicuous by his
silence.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, against Ohio State, Paterno had another beef with the
officials. Another tough loss. Another debatable call.</TE>
<TE>   Are these emotions to be expected in a season tinged by three
excruciating defeats, or are they the signs of slippage?</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Bowden appears in even worse shape at Florida
State. He expected this to be a rebound year after last year's
four-loss campaign, the first time since 1987 the Seminoles didn't
finish ranked in the top five.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, after Saturday's 34-24 loss to Notre Dame, Florida State is,
in Bowden's word, "bumfuzzled." The offense has been mistake-prone
and sloppy. Against the Irish, the Seminoles had a tough time getting
plays to the huddle.</TE>
<TE>   "This game throws us back into the question mark category," Bowden
said. "Had we won this ballgame, I think I would have felt like we
were back where we were."</TE>
<TE>   Truth is, Florida State has for a year been downgraded from
dynasty status. It didn't help that two of Bowden's top assistants,
Chuck Amato and Mark Richt, have taken their insights elsewhere.
Interesting, isn't it, that Amato has led North Carolina State to a
9-0 record, and Richt has Georgia at 8-0.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden, the mentor to both men, is 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the matter of Bowden's unfortunate slip of the
tongue Saturday, when he described Notre Dame as "serial killers" at
a time when a nation was exhaling over events in the Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   Bowden quickly issued an apology, but his original comments
already were circulating on the wire services. Bowden already had
taken criticism, unwarranted, for using the term "Let's Roll" as
inspiration for the season.</TE>
<TE>   There remains time to salvage these respective seasons, and the
competition continues. Paterno, who leads all coaches with 20 bowl
wins, is one victory from becoming bowl eligible. Bowden, who ranks
second on the bowl list with 18, can still claim the watered-down
Atlantic Coast Conference title and go to a BCS game.</TE>
<TE>   But the bowls in play here are not the Fiesta, site of this year's
national title game.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, some of these things with Paterno and Bowden are
starting to add up, unfortunately more quickly than two legends are
piling up victories.</TE>
<TE>   Weekend Wrap</TE>
<TE>   The second bowl championship series rankings are going to be
released today, and there's a chance Notre Dame, No. 3 in last week's
BCS, could jump Miami for the No. 2 spot. Or, it could happen next
week. Miami remained at No. 1 in both the writers' and coaches' polls
Sunday, but Notre Dame has used its No. 1 strength of schedule and a
strong showing in the computer component to put Miami on the BCS
bubble.</TE>
<TE>   The BCS may not be able to survive a scenario in which Oklahoma,
Miami and Notre Dame end the season undefeated and the Irish edge out
the Hurricanes for a spot.</TE>
<TE>   What has Miami done to deserve such a fate? The Hurricanes have
won 29 consecutive games and have been ranked No. 1 in the AP poll
for a record 21 weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Miami has not lost a football game since September 2000, yet the
Hurricanes might be taken down by a computer for the second time in
three years?</TE>
<TE>   So when is the big game between Ohio State (9-0) and Iowa (8-1)
for the Big Ten title? Sorry, the game between conference leaders is
not on this year's calendar, meaning Ohio State will go to the Rose
Bowl if both schools go undefeated in conference play based on better
nonconference record. Unless, that is, Ohio State ends up playing for
the national title in the Fiesta Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   In a modern-day twist to "Win one for the Gipper," Arkansas
players dedicated Saturday's 48-28 victory over Mississippi to fellow
player Jermaine Brooks, arrested this week on drug and weapons
charges. Now, if that doesn't put a lump in your throat.</TE>
<TE>   Late-night wins by Arizona State and Washington State set up a
showdown of undefeated Pacific 10 Conference schools Saturday in
Pullman, Wash. Just the way you had it figured, right?</TE>

<LD>New Jersey Net Coach Byron Scott laughed when he heard horror stories
about his new franchise, even if it was based, literally and
symbolically, in a swamp.</LD>
<LD>   Then he went 26-56 in 2000-01 while Stephon Marbury rolled his
eyes at Keith Van Horn and most of the other guys under contract got
hurt. Just in case, Scott had an uncle, who's a lay minister, bless
the Meadowlands, even if it was only over the telephone.</LD>
<LD>   Not that that was all it took but....</LD>
<TE>   That summer the new general manager, Rod Thorn, told people he had
to move Marbury and/or Van Horn to dump payroll. Providentially,
Phoenix decided to help him out, sending him Jason Kidd for Marbury.</TE>
<TE>   Then on draft day, Thorn traded the rights to Eddie Griffin to
Houston for Richard Jefferson and Jason Collins. The Nets went 52-30,
won the East and reached the NBA Finals for the first time since
entering the NBA in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Thorn just hit it big again, getting the 7-foot defensive presence
they needed, Dikembe Mutombo, donated providentially by
Philadelphia's restless Larry Brown, who also was obliging enough to
take Van Horn's confidence problems and $11-million salary off
Thorn's hands.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets should be significantly better than they were a year ago,
making them solid favorites, because last season's Nos. 2-3 teams,
the Detroit Pistons and Boston Celtics, don't look as good.</TE>
<TE>   Moving up should be the Indiana Pacers, who tore themselves down
and built themselves back up in a hurry since their 2000 Finals
appearance and are ready to rock.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the Hornets, young and talented, who were dismayed
at having to play before intimate gatherings in Charlotte. Now
they're in New Orleans, which had to make do with Pete Maravich and
bad teams in the NBA's last visit, but may be in for a treat.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>Michael Vick felt sick on Atlanta's final possession of the game.
That didn't stop him from leading the Falcons to their third
consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   Vick drove the Falcons down the field in the closing minutes,
setting up Jay Feely's 47-yard field goal as time expired Sunday to
give Atlanta a 37-35 victory over the New Orleans Saints.</LD>
<LD>   "I took myself out because I didn't want to vomit on the field,"
said Vick, who took himself out two plays before game's end because
of a swollen left thumb, pain in his left shoulder and nausea. "I'm
banged up just a little bit. I'll be all right."</LD>
<TE>   The game was the first matchup of two heralded quarterbacks who
are cousins. The Falcons' Vick and the Saints' Aaron Brooks both grew
up in Newport News, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fun playing against him," Vick said. "He brings out the
best in me, and I bring out the best in him."</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta (4-3) harried Brooks throughout, but the New Orleans
quarterback guided the Saints (6-2) to a 35-34 lead when Deuce
McAllister ran 16 yards for a score with 2:20 left.</TE>
<TE>   Then Vick took control. He drove the Falcons to the Saints'
29-yard line before he took himself out. Feely, who missed a 45-yard
attempt with 56 seconds left in Atlanta's loss to Chicago, did the
rest.</TE>
<TE>   After the game, Vick had both shoulders iced. His right,
non-throwing shoulder had been injured Oct. 6 against Tampa Bay,
forcing him to sit out the Falcons' next game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing," said Vick, who completed 16 of 24 passes for 195
yards. He rushed for 91 yards and two touchdowns, including a 32-yard
score in the last quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta's Warrick Dunn, who entered the game with 160 yards
rushing this season, gained 142 yards and scored once.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a matter of getting the opportunity to play big,"
said Dunn, whose role was expanded Sunday when emerging rookie T.J.
Duckett did not play because of a sore foot.</TE>
<TE>   Brooks completed only 16 of 35 passes for 192 yards. He threw two
touchdown passes and two interceptions. "On film we saw Brooks was
most successful when dropping back, so he has time to read the
defense," Falcon cornerback Ray Buchanan said. "We played man to man
and rushed guys in his face."</TE>
<TE>   McAllister had 115 yards in 17 carries and scored two touchdowns.</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Don't Let Rivalry Get Any Uglier</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fortunately for the NBA, that little melee between its three-time
defending champions and their foremost challengers was in an
exhibition game, so few saw it ...</LD>
<LD>   Oh, it was on ESPN?</LD>
<LD>   Well, assuming Commissioner David Stern lets Rick Fox out of jail
before the playoffs, it still doesn't mean much, except as a clue to
where the Lakers' heads are these days.</LD>
<TE>   Having proved they're the best, not to mention the mouthiest, the
Lakers now seem interested in showing how bad they are too. Of
course, as they just saw, this can only wind up embarrassing them, as
in this case, or worse.</TE>
<TE>   "Worse" would be the Laker-King rivalry degenerating into
something like the one in the '90s between the New York Knicks and
Miami Heat, when the two gangs, er, teams kept meeting in the
playoffs and the winner often was determined by which had fewer
players suspended for the deciding game.</TE>
<TE>   Who can ever forget the immortal 1997 series, which the underdog
Knicks led, 3-2, before Stern suspended five of them for their part
in a brief wrestling match between Charlie Ward and P.J. Brown?</TE>
<TE>   Because NBA rules stipulated that teams must dress nine players,
the Knicks had to serve their sentence in platoons. Three, including
Nos. 1 and 2 scorers Patrick Ewing and Allan Houston, sat out their
Game 6 loss in Madison Square Garden. Then the other two, Larry
Johnson and John Starks, sat out their Game 7 loss in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   This was followed by the stirring 1998 rematch when Alonzo
Mourning swung on Johnson, resulting in the annual melee, in which
Knick Coach Jeff Van Gundy wound up clinging to Mourning's ankle as
Mourning tugged him around the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Mourning was, of course, suspended for the deciding Game 5 in
Miami, which -- surprise! -- the Knicks won by 17 points.</TE>
<TE>   Now, despite massive publicity given to all that milling about,
fighting is not a problem in the NBA, which is fortunate for the
league, which has enough real ones.</TE>
<TE>   These days players are suspended, not only for landing a punch,
but for throwing one and missing, or coming into the general vicinity
of one. In that '97 Heat-Knick series, Ewing drew his suspension for
wandering a few feet off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Author John Feinstein recently wrote a book about the horrific
punch the Lakers' Kermit Washington threw that caved in the face of
Houston's Rudy Tomjanovich in 1977, suggesting that started the NBA's
campaign to curb fighting.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, fisticuffs continued for years and in those days when
they said "fight," they didn't mean "swung on and missed," like
Shaquille O'Neal's celebrated roundhouse airball against the Bulls'
Brad Miller last season.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '80s, Detroit's Bad Boys bullied all comers, to be
succeeded in the '90s by Pat Riley's "Game of Force" Knicks, before
Stern sensed that the league's interests lay with grace and beauty,
as personified by the rising Michael Jordan, rather than the teams
that were trying to pulverize him.</TE>
<TE>   After the '92 Knick-Chicago Bull series, when Starks threw a
fearsome midair headlock on Scottie Pippen, whom the Knicks were out
to intimidate, Stern began raising the penalties on flagrant fouls,
which until then were just part of the game, known as "hard fouls."</TE>
<TE>   Now the NBA has mill-arounds, and fewer of them, even if they are
telegenic and get lots of play.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, baseball has 25 incidents a year in which players
stream onto the field after beanballs, et al. It's so common, there's
a phrase for it: "Both benches emptied."</TE>
<TE>   However, because the commissioner doesn't sanction it with mass
suspensions, or many suspensions at all, baseball players just dust
themselves off, go back to the dugout and resume play.</TE>
<TE>   Then, of course, there's the NHL, which once looked into ways to
curb fighting when Commissioner Gary Bettman came over from the NBA,
but found it couldn't, or shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this is an excuse for the Lakers to forget what they do
and what they've come for.</TE>
<TE>   Fox is a Jekyll-Hyde personality, amiable, well-spoken and
approachable off the floor where he authors about 50% of the Lakers'
great quotes, but hard-nosed on the floor, which is OK, and prone to
losing it, which is not.</TE>
<TE>   A five-game suspension would cost Fox more than $225,000 in lost
salary. Of course, he'll have $3.5 million left, so he'll be OK.</TE>
<TE>   But to paraphrase a late, great U.S. senator, $225,000 here,
$225,000 there, the next thing you know, you're talking about real
money.</TE>

<HD>Azeri Has the Secret Formula</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Wayne Lukas, who has been on the winning end of the horse-of-the-year
vote three times, can relate to Azeri's bid for the national title
this year. The last time a filly was voted top honors -- Lady's
Secret in 1986 -- Lukas was the trainer.</LD>
<LD>   There are some parallels that Lady's Secret and Azeri share, but a
notable exception is that while Lady's Secret beat males in her title
year, Azeri hasn't even run against them. When results of the vote
are announced at the Eclipse Awards dinner on Jan. 27 in Beverly
Hills, the winner is likely to be Azeri, winner of Saturday's
Breeders' Cup Distaff, or War Emblem, the tarnished Kentucky Derby
winner who was eighth in the Classic, although Bob Baffert, War
Emblem's trainer, is also throwing the name of Vindication into the
mix. Vindication remained undefeated with a win in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile, effectively becoming the favorite for the 2003 Derby.</LD>
<TE>   The way the voting works is that an estimated 250 representatives
from the National Turf Writers' Assn., the Daily Racing Form and
National Thoroughbred Racing Assn. tracks cast ballots. To win, a
candidate must pile up a plurality from at least two of the
organizations. Sometimes, the outcome can be widely split. Besides
Lady's Secret, Lukas also won the title with Charismatic in 1999 and
Criminal Type in 1990, and in Charismatic's year the winner received
only 55 1/2 of the 209 votes.</TE>
<TE>   "Voting this year is not going to be an easy job," Lukas said
Sunday. "I'm glad I don't have a vote. But usually the
horse-of-the-year winner needs to be charismatic. The horse that
comes out on top is the one that caps the [Breeders' Cup)] day."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, Lady's Secret, who was owned by Gene and Joyce Klein,
began running in January at Santa Anita and never got a breather. By
the time she had won the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Santa Anita in
November, there were 10 wins, three seconds and two thirds next to
her name. She never finished worse than third, and most importantly
she left the older-filly-and-mare division in August to beat males in
the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga. Unable to beat them again, Lady's
Secret ran four times in all, but a month after the Whitney a
second-place finish behind Precisionist in the Woodward at Belmont
Park still added to her luster.</TE>
<TE>   Just like last Saturday, the 1986 Breeders' Cup Classic was
expected to solve the horse-of-the-year enigma. Turkoman and
Precisionist were the favorites, but they ran second and third as
Skywalker, at 10-1, won the race.</TE>
<TE>   Lukas said the same thing happened Saturday with horse-of-the-year
contenders Medaglia d'Oro, Evening Attire, War Emblem and Came Home,
who finished second, fourth, eighth and 11th in the Classic.</TE>
<TE>   "It just laid there for all of them," Lukas said. "All any of them
had to do was grab it."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Volponi, longest shot on the board at 43-1, won the
Classic. The 4-year-old colt had finished seventh, fourth and third
in his only three previous Grade I starts.</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, winning for the eighth time in nine starts this year, won
the Distaff by five lengths. Michael Paulson said that he wanted to
run the filly in the Classic, but trainer Laura de Seroux, talked him
out of it. De Seroux said Sunday that Azeri would continue running
next year and would probably face the males.</TE>
<TE>   Charismatic didn't run after June in 1999, because he was injured
running for a Triple Crown sweep in the Belmont. This year, War
Emblem won only one of four starts after winning the Derby and
Preakness, the first two legs of the Triple Crown.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a big disappointment," Baffert said. "He trained well, but
maybe there was something in his mind. [Jockey Victor Espinoza] had
to nudge him along early in the Classic, and that wasn't a good sign.
He still gave us a lot of thrills."</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Rice, host of a post-Breeders' Cup news conference Sunday
morning at Arlington Park, plunged right into the horse-of-the-year
issue when De Seroux stepped to the microphone.</TE>
<TE>   "Am I supposed to start politicking now?" De Seroux said.</TE>
<TE>   "You're in Chicago," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who else is there?" De Seroux said. "But I don't want to be too
pushy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As early as the first turn, jockey Mike Smith sensed that Came
Home wasn't traveling well in the Classic. The colt, winner of the
Santa Anita Derby and Pacific Classic, suffered a knee injury as he
finished 10th, and has been retired to stud.... Take Charge Lady, who
ran sixth as the second choice in the Distaff, was diagnosed with a
stomach infection after the race.... Overall betting of $115 million
on the eight Breeders' Cup races broke the record of $108 million,
set in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Claimed for $12,500 about five months earlier, Special Matter
became a graded stakes winner when scoring a 9-1 surprise in the
$150,000 Carleton F. Burke Handicap Sunday at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by a partnership and trained by Rafael Becerra, the
4-year-old River Special gelding and jockey Tyler Baze sat off the
pedestrian pace (24 2/5, 48 4/5, 1:14 4/5 and 1:41 for the mile) set
by 6-1 shot Alyzig, then took over in the stretch to win by nearly
two lengths. He completed the 1 1/2 miles on the turf in 2:28 2/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fircroft, the 2-1 second choice, won the $84,000 Miss Grillo
Stakes by a length over 3-1 third choice Marc's Rainbow at Aqueduct.</TE>
<TE>   Two races later, One Colony, the longest shot in the field of five
at 19-1, beat 5-1 outsider Celtic Memories by a head in the $82,950
Pilgrim Stakes. Both races were moved from the turf to the dirt.</TE>

<HD>No One Counted on Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martin Henderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was written into the contract that if the Angels reached the World
Series, there would be no high school football game played over the
weekend at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "At the time," Huntington Beach Edison football Coach Dave White
said, "we thought the odds of that happening weren't very good."</LD>
<LD>   But the wild-card Angels beat the New York Yankees, then the
Minnesota Twins, and the scheduled game on Friday between rivals
Edison and Fountain Valley had to be moved to Orange Coast College.
No one could have known that each team would go into the game with a
2-4 record, but why schedule the game at Edison Field in the first
place?</LD>
<TE>   The "Battle for the Bell" features one of the top rivalries in
Southern California. The schools began playing the game at Orange
Coast in 1973, then moved it to Edison Field (then Anaheim Stadium)
from 1976-86 before returning to Orange Coast, where it annually
sells out the 7,500-seat facility.</TE>
<TE>   "After our game last year, Orange Coast [officials] said the game
was getting too big, [said] there were too many security problems,
and told both schools they needed to look elsewhere," said White,
whose team lost to Long Beach Poly in last season's Southern Section
Division I championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Angels beat the Yankees, we started talking about
alternative plans," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange Coast officials agreed to be host of the game again but
with stipulations: The schools were limited to 7,500 tickets, which
were to be sold beforehand on campus only, and the stadium's entry
gates were to be closed at 6:30 p.m. for the 7 p.m. game.</TE>
<TE>   Edison sold 2,800 tickets and Fountain Valley 3,200 before game
day. Fountain Valley Athletic Director Mike Henigan appealed to
common sense -- empty seats inside and fans unable to enter from the
outside could ignite its own security issues -- and Orange Coast
officials used good judgment and allowed ticket sales at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "The last couple of years, fire marshals shut [ticket sales] down
and there was some trouble outside the gate," Henigan said. "The next
couple of years, our game is after the World Series is over, so we
shouldn't have problems getting Edison Field."</TE>
<TE>   More than 8,000 fans watched Fountain Valley beat Edison, 28-16.
It was Barons' third consecutive victory after an 0-4 start, but the
Chargers still lead the series, 20-13-1.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Temecula Chaparral and Temecula Valley have a ways to go to match
the rivalry of Edison-Fountain Valley, but they do play for the
Mayor's Trophy.</TE>
<TE>   This season's edition of the four-year-old rivalry was a close
one. Blaine Smith, who had kicked field goals of 36 and 47 yards for
Temecula Valley, missed a 49-yarder with 28 seconds remaining and
Chaparral won, 14-13, for its first victory of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Chaparral Coach Dennis Amador called it the biggest
victory in his school's six-year history.</TE>
<TE>   Last year Chaparral missed a field goal to tie the game with seven
seconds left and the year before lost in triple overtime.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To change their fortunes after an upset loss to Rialto Eisenhower,
many Redlands players decided to switch jerseys for their game at
Fontana Miller.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of wearing their regular uniform numbers, the Terriers
threw jerseys into a pile and randomly pulled out new ones. One
catch: No one told Miller officials, who operated under the
assumption that the numbers provided for their printed game program
were correct.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept looking for No. 5 [Rocky McBroom] and didn't see him,"
said Miller Coach John Tyree, who had no idea it was McBroom who
scored a 15-yard touchdown run during Redlands' 30-7 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny business, but we have no complaints because we lost,"
said Tyree, who was more than gracious. "As bad as we played, it
wouldn't have mattered if they were playing in pink uniforms."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A prank before the San Fernando-Sylmar game backfired in a big way
when the Tigers were beaten by the Spartans, 42-14. It was the worst
loss in the 41-year history between the schools, and there was plenty
of back story.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the week, walls on the Sylmar campus were spray-painted
with graffiti in San Fernando's school colors, and dog feces was left
on the Senior Rock. A $200 reward has been offered leading to an
arrest of the vandals.</TE>
<TE>   Sylmar's football team, going for its fourth consecutive league
title, took out its anger on the field, scoring 21 points in the
fourth quarter to open a 21-14 lead in front of a capacity crowd at
San Fernando.</TE>
<TE>   Ryen Carew rushed for 190 yards and scored two touchdowns for
Sylmar, which is 5-2 overall, 2-0 in the Valley Mission Conference.
San Fernando is 3-4, 0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Sylmar's previous largest margin of victory in the series was 31-6
in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing about this game is it's more than a game, they're
playing for their neighborhood," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman said.
"They all grew up together. A few years ago, my right guard went
against their left tackle, and they were brothers. It's the Valley
version of Roosevelt-Garfield."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Craven, coach at Garden Grove Pacifica, is one victory from
200 after his team's 45-14 win over Garden Grove Santiago improved
his record to 199-88-8.</TE>
<TE>   Only Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes and a former coach, Dick Hill,
have more victories among Orange County coaches. Barnes tied Hill at
212 with a victory over Anaheim Esperanza on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Craven's chances of winning No. 200 on Friday against Garden Grove
Bolsa Grande are good. The Matadors are 1-51 since winning their
first four games in 1997, and haven't won a game since 1999.</TE>

<LD>COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Defenseman Chris McAlpine, signed as a free agent
last summer, rejoined the Kings on Sunday after a two-game
conditioning assignment with the club's American Hockey League team
at Manchester, N.H.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't mean that McAlpine, sort of the odd man out in
the Kings' fast start, will crack the lineup any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a real tough one because you want to get him in, you want
him to feel part of it," Coach Andy Murray said. "But you're also
dealing with some other guy. You take him out and all of a sudden you
get that guy starting to wonder, 'What's my situation here?' And then
you put that guy back in and maybe he's not as good as he was before.</LD>
<TE>   "Most of our guys have been pretty good. We haven't really had a
reason to say, 'This guy needs to sit and watch for a game.' "</TE>
<TE>   Enforcer Ken Belanger also had not played before Sunday. He
replaced Erik Rasmussen, who had a sore back, and got into a fight
just 2 minutes 36 seconds into the game, drawing 17 minutes of
penalties. He played less than two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Allison, who strained ligaments in his left forearm in
Friday night's 6-2 victory over the New York Rangers, said Sunday
that he feared at first the arm was broken.</TE>
<TE>   It bothered him, but the rugged center stayed in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to be 100% every night," he said. "It doesn't
mean you can't have a good game. You just try to ignore it as best
you can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy sat out for the fifth time in six games because of a
strained left groin.... Steve Heinze has scored four goals in his
last three games at Manchester but has not attracted any trade
offers, King General Manager Dave Taylor said.</TE>

<HD>Kings, Storr Swept Away</HD>
<DH>No. 2 goalie gives up three third-period goals in a rare
start as Blue Jackets win easily, 5-1, behind hat trick by Wright.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>COLUMBUS, Ohio -- After Tyler Wright of the Columbus Blue Jackets
completed a hat trick by scoring his third goal Sunday night,
bringing a rain of caps onto the ice at Nationwide Arena, King
goaltender Jamie Storr helped with the cleanup.</LD>
<LD>   It was less a gesture of good sportsmanship in the final seconds
of a 5-1 loss than a matter of wanting to flee the scene as quickly
as possible.</LD>
<LD>   "It was nagging at me," said Storr after the Blue Jackets torched
him for three third-period goals, the last two by Wright, in front of
17,106. "It's just like when you're down and someone kicks you ...
and then steps on you.</LD>
<TE>   "That's kind of what it felt like."</TE>
<TE>   Storr, making only his second start this season in relief of Felix
Potvin, hadn't known that feeling in quite some time.</TE>
<TE>   He hadn't lost a start since Nov. 29, when he dropped a 3-1
decision against the Edmonton Oilers, and had been unbeaten in his
last nine decisions on the road, posting a 7-0-2 record since losing
at Tampa Bay, 3-0, on Oct. 25, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   But the Blue Jackets, who had squandered a 3-1 third-period lead
in a 5-4 loss to the San Jose Sharks on Friday night, took a 1-0 lead
on a goal by Geoff Sanderson only 1 minute 46 seconds into the game
and never let up.</TE>
<TE>   Sanderson, one of five players remaining from the expansion club
that made its debut two seasons ago, said later that this was perhaps
the Blue Jackets' best game, helping to ease the sting of consecutive
7-1 October losses to the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who played for the fifth time in six games without
injured right wing Ziggy Palffy, were in no position to argue.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew what we faced here with Columbus," Coach Andy Murray
said. "I had the opportunity to watch them practice yesterday --
they'd had a tough loss the night before -- and they came to work.
Their game was a carryover from their practice. Their level of
determination was real high.</TE>
<TE>   "We also had a great practice yesterday, but somewhere between
then and the start of the hockey game, we lost our level of
determination."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Blue Jackets' lead was only 2-1 after Adam Deadmarsh
scored his fourth goal in two games for the Kings with 11:59 to play.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Jackets had coughed up two-goal leads in each of their
previous two games, losing one and tying the other, so the Kings were
far from finished.</TE>
<TE>   Only 77 seconds later, however, Hannes Hyvonen scored on a rebound
to increase their deficit to 3-1. The winger poked the puck into the
net after a shot by Andrew Cassels slipped between Storr's legs and
caromed off the right post. It landed behind Storr, who had lost
track of it, and Hyvonen pounced on it.</TE>
<TE>   With 4:46 to play, Wright scored a short-handed goal, the first
given up by the Kings, when he rifled a shot from the right faceoff
circle that sailed under Storr's right arm. He completed the hat
trick with a power-play goal, scoring on a redirection of a shot by
Rostislav Klesla with 29 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Including a second-period goal scored at even strength, the hat
trick was Wright's second overall and first since March 16, 2001, at
Atlanta, when he also scored a power-play goal, short-handed goal and
even-strength goal.</TE>
<TE>   Storr and the Kings were left to clean up and clear out.</TE>
<TE>   "My job is to stop the puck out there," Storr said. "Tonight, five
goals went in, so there's a lot of stuff that I can work on.</TE>
<TE>   "What my teammates do out there, that's part of their own
preparation. I don't have any say in whether we were ready or we
weren't ready. Each person has to be accountable to himself. It's on
each individual guy."</TE>

<HD>Fox Apologizes, Not to Christie</HD>

<LD>A contrite Rick Fox, two days after his fight against Sacramento's
Doug Christie, returned to the Lakers for Sunday practice after a
one-day absence.</LD>
<LD>   And while the Laker forward was apologetic to his team and its
fans, Fox still carried with him a sense of defiance toward the Kings
in general and Christie in particular.</LD>
<LD>   "It's not anything that I condone," Fox said of his actions in the
melee. "I mean, I'm a father and a husband and I have kids that look
up to me. It's disappointing that for that moment I fell into the
tactics of their attempt to be brave six months later.</LD>
<TE>   "They came to win a championship in a preseason game. They should
have thought about that a few months back, it's a little late to get
brave now. [Christie] made some statements about being scared in Game
7 [of the Western Conference finals] so I'm sure he was embarrassed
of those statements and I'm sure his teammates have questions about
his ability to perform. So he shaves his head, comes out and has
something to prove.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a situation where my emotions got hijacked and I regret
responding the way I did."</TE>
<TE>   It was only 2:07 into the final exhibition for both teams, which
had been trading barbs all summer after the Lakers won the
emotionally charged playoff series, when Fox and Christie had their
first dust-up, which included a lot of face time.</TE>
<TE>   It included a Fox elbow near Christie's face, Christie chucking
the ball at Fox's face, Fox pushing Christie away with an open hand
to the face and Christie hitting Fox in the chin with a left punch.</TE>
<TE>   After both players had been ejected and sent their separate ways,
Fox, with his knowledge of the layout at Staples Center, sprinted
through a back hallway and met Christie in the tunnel leading to the
Kings' locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Fisticuffs ensued, as did the arrival of almost the entire roster
of the Kings ( who had left their bench), Laker center Shaquille
O'Neal (who seemed to be getting a head start on his career as a
law-enforcement officer) and, according to several witnesses,
Christie's wife.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess she thought he needed some help," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   In reality, it was Fox who needed the lifeline supplied by O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like we were in Arco [Arena] for a second there, got
dropped behind enemy lines and he came and got me," Fox said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers expect to hear from the league office today regarding
fines and suspensions, and Laker Coach Phil Jackson, anticipating
being without Fox for Tuesday night's season opener against the San
Antonio Spurs, was glad to have him at Sunday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit of a distraction, but we do know that you have to make
those kinds of adjustments all the way through the season," Jackson
said. "Unfortunately for us, it's on opening night with the ring
ceremony and all those other things that go along with it.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to be here today and we wanted him to be here today. We
wanted to look him in the face and see how he's doing and hold his
hand a little bit during this time."</TE>
<TE>   Fox wasn't sure what a "fair" penalty would be.</TE>
<TE>   "What is fair depends upon what precedent they want to set," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he would wait until getting an official league ruling
before establishing a starting lineup for Tuesday's game, but he
hinted that first-year Laker Tracy Murray could get the start at
small forward with Fox's inevitable suspension and Devean George
hobbled by an ailing lower back.</TE>
<TE>   "Tracy when he gets loose is a player that has a different rhythm
than when he has to sit on the bench," Jackson said. "Steve Smith's
the [San Antonio] starter, more than likely, and he's a different
type of player that Tracy might be able to stand on Steve Smith a
little bit and pay attention to him. The two of them could be
handcuffed together."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers waived free-agent forward Guy Rucker, dropping their
roster to 14 players.</TE>

<LD>Rookie Mario Dominguez won the rain-shortened CART Honda Indy 300
Sunday at Surfers Paradise, Australia, a race which started with a
major crash that sent two drivers to the hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Dominguez, involved in the accident, pitted four times once racing
started. The event was stopped on the 40th lap because of a two-hour
time limit.</LD>
<LD>   Patrick Carpentier was second, followed by Paul Tracy, Kenny Brack
and Tony Kanaan.</LD>
<TE>   Adrian Fernandez and Tora Takagi were carried off on stretchers
after the starting-line accident.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez broke two vertebrae. Takagi had a broken pelvis and
bruised hip. Both were released from the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Fernandez will not race in the CART 500 at California Speedway in
Fontana on Sunday. Takagi's status is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   Series champion Cristiano da Matta was eighth, Andretti ninth, and
Vasser 12th.</TE>
<TE>   "I just feel like the luckiest guy in the world," said Dominguez,
who led one lap at Rockingham, England, last month.</TE>
<TE>   "That accident at the beginning was terrible. I couldn't see a
thing."</TE>
<TE>   Heavy rain and poor visibility forced much of the race to be run
under yellow caution flags, including the final 30 laps. Safety crews
tried, with little success, to brush water off the track.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Busch outran the competition and the weather, earning his
second straight NASCAR Winston Cup victory in the rain-shortened NAPA
500 at Hampton, Ga.</TE>
<TE>   After one long rain delay and threatening skies, the race
scheduled for 325 laps ended under a yellow flag on lap 248 as the
wet weather finally arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Busch, driving a Roush Racing Ford, got his third career victory
-- and third of the season -- with the help of some fast work by his
crew during the last round of green-flag pit stops.</TE>
<TE>   "We got loose and got to sliding a little bit and that's what
pushed us back," Busch said in the makeshift Victory Circle inside
the empty Busch Series garage.</TE>
<TE>   "We kept digging and made an adjustment at the end. I told [crew
chief] Jimmy Fennig, I said, 'Do this, do that and it'll be perfect.'
We drove ourselves right to victory lane."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Nemechek finished second. Tony Stewart finished fourth behind
Dale Jarrett and increased his lead in the points race with three
races left.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Martin finished eighth and moved past rookie Jimmie Johnson
into second place, 146 points behind Stewart, who came into the race
leading Johnson by 82.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon clinched his first top fuel series crown with a
second-round win and went on to his record-tying ninth victory this
year in the NHRA ACDelco Nationals at Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon's dragster raced down the quarter-mile in 4.613 seconds at
320.28 mph, ahead of Tony Schumacher's dragster, which had a run of
4.674 and 314.75.</TE>
<TE>   John Force earned his 105th career funny car victory with a run of
4.820 at 305.22. He beat teammate Tony Pedregon's run of 4.869 and
301.94.</TE>
<TE>   Jeg Coughlin won his second pro stock title en route to his 31st
career win as he finished in 6.969 and 198.55, just ahead of Warren
Johnson's run of 6.929 at 199.23.</TE>
<TE>   Angelle Savoie won her third straight pro stock bike series title
and earned the 28th victory of her career with a run of 7.247 at
183.99.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Hines was second at 7.218 and 190.65.</TE>

<LD>Tom Watson shot a five-under-par 67 Sunday and beat Gil Morgan by two
strokes to win the Senior PGA Tour Championship at Oklahoma City.</LD>
<LD>   Watson, who won this event in 2000, earned $440,000 for his first
victory of the year on the Senior PGA Tour.</LD>
<LD>   The five-time British Open champion was three over after 20 holes,
then played the last 52 in a bogey-free, 17-under par to finish four
rounds at 14-under 274.</LD>
<TE>   Morgan struggled down the stretch in a 69 that left him at 276,
three strokes ahead of Bob Gilder, who closed with a 68. Hale Irwin
had a 71 and was fourth, seven strokes behind Watson, but he became
the first senior golfer to win $3 million in one season.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to beat the rain, the tee times were moved up two
hours and golfers went off the first and 10th tees. But after 30
minutes, rain caused play to be suspended for a little more than two
hours.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Byrd closed with a nine-under 63 to win the Buick
Challenge and become the 17th first-time winner on the PGA Tour this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd made five straight putts on the back nine at Callaway Gardens
in Pine Mountain, Ga., two of them for eagle, and was within range of
the tour's 72-hole scoring record in relation to par.</TE>
<TE>   David Toms put together a strong rally and had an 18-foot birdie
putt on the final hole to force a playoff, but it slid over the left
edge of the cup. Toms shot a 65.</TE>
<TE>   Byrd finished at 27-under 261 and earned $666,000. Toms finished
with his third runner-up finish this year. Phil Mickelson closed with
a 63 to finish third at 265.</TE>
<TE>   Along with getting a two-year exemption on the PGA Tour, Byrd
moved up to No. 41 on the money list. A strong showing at the
Southern Farm Bureau Classic this week might be enough to get into
the top 40 and qualify for the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Se Ri Pak easily won the wind-swept LPGA Nine Bridges Classic at
Jeju Island, South Korea, closing with an even-par 72 to beat Carin
Koch by six strokes. Temperatures were in the 40s, with winds blowing
at more than 15 mph.</TE>
<TE>   The South Korean star finished at three-under-par 213, while Koch
had a 73 to finish at 219. Annika Sorenstam's 76 left her nine shots
back, ending her bid to set a record for tournament wins in a year.</TE>
<TE>   Lorie Kane and Mhairi McKay finished third at five-over par, a
stroke ahead of Sorenstam and Danielle Ammaccapane.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Third-round leader Patrick Moore was declared the winner of the
rain-shortened Buy.com Tour Championship, finishing on top of the
money list and leading 15 players who earned promotions to the PGA
Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Moore birdied three of four holes to complete a six-under-par 66
that left him at 10-under 206 after 54 holes. Half the field failed
to finish the final round before heavy rain left the course in
Prattville, Ala., unplayable.</TE>
<TE>   Moore earned $108,000 for the victory and moved into the top of
the Buy.com money list with $381,965. Steven Alker, Mike Heinen and
Jeff Klauk tied for second at eight-under 208.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Paradorn Srichaphan came back to defeat Marcelo Rios, 6-7 (2),
6-0, 6-3, 6-2, in the final of the Stockholm Open.</TE>
<TE>   It was the second title of the year for the 23-year-old from
Bangkok, Thailand, who won the TD Waterhouse Cup in New York in
August. The win lifted him into the top 20 in the ATP Champions' Race
for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Wimbledon runner-up David Nalbandian defeated Fernando Gonzalez,
6-4, 6-3, 6-2, to win the Swiss Indoors at Basel. Nalbandian, seeded
sixth, never lost his serve and beat the seventh-seeded Gonzalez in
97 minutes. Twin brothers Bob and Mike Bryan beat top-seeded Mark
Knowles and Daniel Nestor, 7-6 (2), 7-5, for the doubles title. It
was their fifth title of the year.... Top-seeded Kim Clijsters
overwhelmed second-seeded Magdalena Maleeva, 6-1, 6-2, to win the
Seat Open in Luxembourg for the second straight year.... Justine
Henin overpowered unseeded Alexandra Stevenson, 6-3, 6-0, in less
than an hour to win the Generali Open at Linz, Austria.</TE>

<TE>   Freshman forward Kyle Close of the UC Irvine men's soccer team has
been upgraded from serious to stable condition at a Santa Ana
hospital. Close was one of seven players injured in Saturday's crash
of a team van going to a game at UC Riverside.</TE>

<KH>WEEK 8 IN THE NFL SAM FARMER</KH>
<HD>Somber Reminder for Seahawks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>Delirious Cowboy fans were screaming for Emmitt Smith. Frightened
Seattle players were screaming for a doctor.</LD>
<LD>   On the Texas Stadium field, Dallas cheerleaders shook pompoms for
their hero. In the visitors' locker room, Darrell Jackson convulsed
so violently it sent his Seahawk teammates into a panic.</LD>
<LD>   The contrast was gut-wrenching. While Smith was being feted for
his accomplishment Sunday -- breaking Walter Payton's all-time NFL
rushing record -- Jackson, a third-year receiver, was suffering the
aftermath of a devastating hit to the head by Cowboy safety Darren
Woodson.</LD>
<TE>   The extent of Jackson's injury was not known when he was finally
removed from the locker room on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to
Baylor Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Gonzalez, a spokesman for the hospital, said Sunday night
that Jackson was in stable condition and is expected to return to
Seattle today.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson never lost consciousness in the locker room, but his
convulsions and odd behavior concerned even seasoned players who have
seen all types of football injuries. Because they were on the field
for Smith's ceremony, Cowboy players and officials had no idea
anything was amiss until after Jackson was taken to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The hit was brutal. Woodson, who earlier in the game had moved
into first place on the Cowboys' career tackles list, drilled Jackson
from the side as the receiver was leaping to catch a pass late in the
game. It appeared to be a helmet-to-helmet blow, although slow-motion
replays seemed to show Woodson was aiming for Jackson's right
shoulder. Either way, Jackson didn't catch the ball and lay in a
crumpled heap for several moments. Finally, with trainers surrounding
him, the receiver climbed to his feet and walked slowly to the
sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Woodson was penalized for unnecessary roughness and might be fined
by the league. Last week, Denver's Kenoy Kennedy served a one-game
suspension after his third such infraction of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Several onlookers said Jackson looked normal enough for the rest
of the game. He didn't play after the collision though he spoke with
teammates and seemed lucid.</TE>
<TE>   But something was very wrong. Seahawk Coach Mike Holmgren was just
finishing his news conference with about a dozen reporters when he
was interrupted by a ruckus across the hall. Players began yelling
for a doctor, a paramedic, anyone. Holmgren's face dropped, and he
pushed his way across the hall and into the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Just inside the door is a trainer's room, where injured players
are checked out or receive treatment before boarding the bus for the
airport. Jackson was sitting, either on a chair or a table, and began
to have a seizure. Although he never stopped breathing, he didn't
respond to the questions asked by Dr. Ed Khalfayan, the team
physician.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not receptive to any information," Khalfayan said.</TE>
<TE>   When the seizure ended, Jackson wasn't himself. Normally upbeat
yet even-keeled, now he was angry and needed to be physically
restrained.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't throwing punches, he was just combative with the
doctors," said linebacker Chad Brown, who witnessed the scene. "But
that's just a reaction to a concussion."</TE>
<TE>   Holmgren said the reaction was similar to that of Gil Haskell,
then Green Bay's receiver coach, when he was bowled over on the
sideline during a playoff game in 1995 and the back of his head
smacked a sheet of plywood on the turf. That was at Texas Stadium
too. Haskell, now Seattle's offensive coordinator, fought the idea of
going to the hospital at the time.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Holmgren said Jackson recognized him and a few others.</TE>
<TE>   "[But] we had a heck of a time getting him to lay still so we
could load him into the ambulance," Holmgren said. "Once we did that,
he was on his way."</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the whole process took more than half an hour, and the
scene outside the locker room was surreal. With sounds of the
on-field celebration echoing through the stadium tunnels, the
Seahawks -- showered and wearing expensive suits -- somberly walked
up a ramp to their bus. They had just finished a 17-14 victory on a
last-second field goal, but no one felt like talking.</TE>
<TE>   An ambulance, with overhead lights flashing, was backed up to
double doors leading into the locker room. Members of stadium
security and the team's media-relations department formed a human
wall to block the sightlines of reporters and held up sheets and
large pieces of cardboard to thwart photographers.</TE>
<TE>   Two of Jackson's fellow receivers, Bobby Engram and Koren
Robinson, climbed into a sedan that would follow the ambulance to the
hospital. Just before paramedics wheeled Jackson out on a stretcher
-- his neck in a brace and his hands bound to the gurney -- Engram
got out of the car and cupped his hand over the lens of a TV
cameraman standing on a stepladder.</TE>
<TE>   "You don't need to take a picture of this," Engram said.</TE>
<TE>   It was somewhat reminiscent of Minnesota offensive lineman Matt
Birk shooing away a photographer who was taking a picture of Korey
Stringer writhing on the ground at Viking training camp in 2001. It
was the last picture taken of Stringer, who died of heatstroke
complications about 13 hours later.</TE>
<TE>   No one could have known the full extent of Jackson's injury,
whether it was life-threatening or not. Holmgren looked shocked,
almost ashen, when discussing the situation with reporters. The coach
had one request: "Say a little prayer for him, please."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawk players were doing that already, and no doubt kept him
in their thoughts as they flew home to Seattle and he remained in a
Texas hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "This is football," Brown said. "This isn't worth dying for."</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 38, PHOENIX 28</KH>
<HD>Flashes of Owens Enough for 49ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>From Associated Press</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Long after the beauty of Terrell Owens' two touchdown catches faded,
the San Francisco 49ers hung on for an ugly victory that kept them
atop the NFC West.</LD>
<LD>   Jeff Garcia passed for 252 yards and threw two of his four
touchdown passes to Owens as the 49ers took a big early lead and held
off the Arizona Cardinals for a 38-28 victory Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Arizona and San Francisco were tied for first place in the
division, but the more experienced 49ers (5-2) scored 24 points --
including a 21-yard touchdown reception by Owens -- before the second
quarter was a minute old. Owens added another touchdown late in the
first half, sprinting through the secondary for a 61-yard score.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm watching in awe in a lot of ways," said Garcia, who completed
18 of 28 passes. "To take a simple slant pass like that and move it
all the way for a touchdown ... T.O. gives us a capacity that very
few teams have."</TE>
<TE>   Owens finished with eight catches for 132 yards. He even signed
another one of his catches with a pen from his sock -- but it was
during pregame warmups, when he caught a practice pass and pulled the
same trick that earned him a warning from the league after he did it
during a victory over Seattle two weeks ago. This time, Owens handed
the ball to a child.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers, missing several injured regulars and struggling on
defense, barely hung on against Arizona's second-half rally. Jake
Plummer twice got the Cardinals (4-3) within 10 points, and they were
driving again when Ronnie Heard made his third interception with 5:26
left for the 49ers.</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Shipp ran for two touchdowns for the Cardinals.</TE>

<HD>Pressure, Losses Are Building in Chicago</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With their once-promising season turning to dust, the Chicago Bears
are beginning to get testy.</LD>
<LD>   Their fifth consecutive loss came Sunday in a 25-7 defeat by the
Minnesota Vikings.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody is yelling at each other to come on and fight and
that's the problem," defensive end Phillip Daniels said. "We have too
many people yelling that want to talk and be leaders right now and I
say just shut up and play. That's my whole thing. Let your actions
speak louder. Until we figure that out, it's going to be the same old
thing."</LD>
<TE>   Said defensive tackle Keith Traylor: "I don't think it's effort.
Being honest, me sitting back and looking at it, I just think we're
outmanned in a lot of areas and you can't win when you can't compete
at that high level."</TE>
<TE>   The schedule suggests the situation might only get worse. The
Bears face Philadelphia and New England in the next two weeks. Games
against St. Louis, Miami and Green Bay also await.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope our people don't lose heart," Daniels said. "If you
go out there and think you're defeated before the game starts, you're
going to be defeated the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler receiver Plaxico Burress has become one of the
Baltimore Ravens' biggest enemies.</TE>
<TE>   Before being ejected after an incident involving Raven cornerback
James Trapp in the second quarter, Burress caught five passes for 55
yards in the Steelers' 31-18 victory Sunday. That included touchdown
receptions of nine yards and 20 yards as he enjoyed a third
consecutive win as a starter against Baltimore and a second
consecutive win in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "I never lost in this stadium and I don't want to lose here. It's
one of those rivalries where I don't like them and they don't like
us," Burress said. "I've loved playing against Baltimore. It gets my
fire going."</TE>
<TE>   And that usually means inciting the Ravens. Told after the game
that Raven cornerback Gary Baxter called him, "just another receiver"
and "not among the elite," Burress asked, "Who is Gary Baxter?"
adding later, "He's terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Trapp "stepped on my face," according to Burress, who later was
ejected for removing his helmet. At different times, Burress could be

<HD>Knee Injury to Sideline Friedel</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United States World Cup goalkeeper Brad Friedel faces surgery and
probably will be sidelined for several weeks because of cartilage
damage in a knee, his English Premier League club, Blackburn Rovers,
said.</LD>
<LD>   Friedel, 31, was praised as "the best goalkeeper in the country,"
by Blackburn Coach Graeme Souness after making several spectacular
saves in the Rovers' 2-1 victory over English champion Arsenal on
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "His cartilage popped out in the warm-up today," Souness told
Reuters. "He managed to sort it out and play on. Not for the first
time, he was excellent.</LD>
<TE>   "We think he's the best goalkeeper in the country. But he's going
to have to have an operation now, whenever we can find the right
time."</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal took 27 shots, 14 of them on target, but Friedel was
beaten only on a shot by Brazilian Edu just before halftime.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Teams Win</TE>
<TE>   Three-time Major League Soccer champion D.C. United ended its year
with a resounding 4-0 victory over CD Aguila of El Salvador, with
former Aguila player Eliseo Quintanilla assisting on three goals.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Moreno scored twice in front of 17,453 at RFK Stadium on
Saturday night. Bobby Convey and Roy Lassiter also had goals for D.C.
United.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Burn beat Olympia of Honduras, 6-5, on penalty kicks,
in New Orleans after the teams had played to a scoreless tie in
regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Zidane Future</TE>
<TE>   Zinedine Zidane, a World Cup winner with France in 1998, a
European Championship winner with France in 2000 and a European Cup
winner with Real Madrid in 2002, might retire before the 2006 World
Cup in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   The midfielder told the French daily Le Parisien that he is
considering quitting when his contract expires in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "Afterwards, at 33-34, I think it will be a good time to put an
end to my career," the former FIFA world player of the year said,
adding that he is unlikely to move to a French club.</TE>
<TE>   "To return to France would be a decision from the heart," he said.
"And I don't want my career to be ruled by my heart but by reason. I
want to finish at the top."</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy to U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Craig Bellamy, whose goal powered Wales to a 2-1 upset
victory over Italy in a 2004 European Championship qualifying match
earlier this month, will fly to Colorado today after re-injuring his
knee.</TE>
<TE>   Bellamy, who plays for Newcastle United in the English Premier
League, will visit knee specialist Richard Steadman, who has operated
on such top players as England's Alan Shearer and Brazil's Ronaldo.</TE>
<TE>   Kenya Wins Title</TE>
<TE>   A goal by John Baraza 10 minutes from the final whistle Saturday
earned Kenya a 1-1 tie with Uganda in Dar es Salaam, and the Kenyans
then won, 3-2, on penalty kicks, to claim the Four Nations Cup.</TE>
<TE>   South Africa finished third, prevailing over Tanzania on penalty
kicks, 4-3, after a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Player Dies</TE>
<TE>   Colombian player Giovany Cordoba died, three days after he was
struck by lightning that killed Deportivo Cali teammate Hermam
Gaviria during practice.</TE>
<TE>   Cordoba, who was 24, had three heart attacks as a result of
Thursday's lightning strike.</TE>

<KH>PITTSBURGH 31, BALTIMORE 18</KH>
<HD>Maddox Keeps Steelers Rolling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Their 0-2 start is now almost forgotten. After another impressive
showing Sunday, the Pittsburgh Steelers stand alone atop the AFC
North.</LD>
<LD>   Tommy Maddox completed his first 11 passes and the Steelers scored
touchdowns on their first four possessions Sunday in a 31-18 victory
over the Baltimore Ravens.</LD>
<LD>   After coming within one win of the Super Bowl last season, the
Steelers opened this season with two losses. But Pittsburgh (4-3) has
since regained its stature as a contender.</LD>
<TE>   "You saw what a championship-caliber team looked like in the first
half," Raven Coach Brian Billick said. "Our guys got schooled."</TE>
<TE>   Maddox threw two touchdown passes to Plaxico Burress, and Amos
Zereoue ran for two scores as Pittsburgh took a 28-3 halftime lead.
It was the Steelers' most productive first half since Sept. 8, 1996,
when they scored 28 against the Ravens.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh, 3-1 since Maddox replaced an ineffective Kordell
Stewart as the starter, has outscored the opposition, 93-35, during
its current three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Maddox isn't about to start celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   "We still know we've got a lot of football left. We can't start to
feel real good about it or relax," he said. "We've got to continue to
get better and better and continue to do the little things right."</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers did very little wrong in the first half, when Maddox
picked apart a Baltimore defense playing a third consecutive week
without Pro Bowl linebacker Ray Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one of those games where I'm seeing the field really
well," Maddox said. "It was a lot of fun."</TE>
<TE>   Maddox left because of a sprained left ankle midway through the
third quarter but returned with 11 minutes remaining and finished 18
for 24 for 172 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore (3-4), which began the day tied with Pittsburgh for the
division lead, also played without quarterback Chris Redman (back
injury).</TE>

<HD>2008 Super Bowl to L.A.?</HD>
<DH>NFL will get a recommendation this week to award a game to
area, which could set other things in motion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles does not have a team, still does not have a new stadium
in the works, but this week the NFL is going to take a giant step
forward with a break in tradition and recommend to the league's 32
owners that they award a Super Bowl to Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal, which has already received the stamp of approval
from the league's influential Super Bowl committee, will not include
a specific date, although it's known the 2008 game is being targeted
by NFL officials.</LD>
<LD>   A formal vote to award the game to Los Angeles would not come
until next year -- after L.A. officials have submitted a bid with
available hotel rooms, party facilities and other NFL needs.</LD>
<TE>   "We're looking at this as a momentum builder in Los Angeles," a
high-ranking NFL official said. "We're talking about playing the game
in the Rose Bowl unless a new stadium is built someplace else."</TE>
<TE>   The NFL owners will hear the recommendation from the Super Bowl
committee at a three-day meeting this week in New York, which also
will include a favorable report placing the 2007 game in New York or
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   The 2003 Super Bowl will be played in San Diego. The next three
games are scheduled to be played in Houston, Jacksonville and
Detroit, and if the 2007 game goes to New York, a warm-weather site
probably will be the NFL's No. 1 priority in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL is making it clear that a new stadium in L.A. is not a
prerequisite to receiving a Super Bowl, but this unusual move
suggests the league might already have a team in mind to fill the
L.A. void and will be using the lure of a Super Bowl to kick-start a
new stadium deal before a team officially announces its intentions to
move here.</TE>
<TE>   The NFL's track record in placing Super Bowls in new stadiums
suggests the league will want a new one here up and running for the
2006 season, which would certainly catch the fancy of the San Diego
Chargers, Indianapolis Colts and New Orleans Saints, who will be in
position to move at that time.</TE>
<TE>   There have been reports the Colts could move here as soon as next
season, and the Chargers after the 2003 season.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl's announced intentions to meet NFL needs, and if
necessary, investigate the possibility of building a new stadium to
replace the existing facility, is one of the primary reasons the NFL
is turning its Super Bowl attention to this area again. The Raiders
and Rams left after the 1994 season, and the last Super Bowl to be
played here was in the Rose Bowl on Jan. 31, 1993.</TE>
<TE>   "The Rose Bowl effort has certainly given us something to think
about," the NFL official said. "We're hearing several optimistic
things in L.A., but this Super Bowl proposal represents a different
approach. We're trying to get past the argument of who needs whom
more. We would just like to be there, and this might start the
process."</TE>

<KH>HOUSTON 21, JACKSONVILLE 19</KH>
<HD>Ex-Jaguars Put Drive in Texans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSONVILLE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The clock ran out, and Jaguar Coach Tom Coughlin thought he had been
through the worst. Then, an irate fan spit on him and called his team
pathetic.</LD>
<LD>   Led by a group of former Jacksonville players, the Houston Texans
defeated Coughlin's downtrodden team, 21-19, Sunday -- a day that
left little doubt that it's better to be a former member of the
Jaguars than a current one.</LD>
<LD>   A trick play on a punt return set up Kris Brown's 45-yard
game-winning field goal with 2:11 remaining to give the expansion
Texans (2-5) the first road victory in franchise history.</LD>
<TE>   "Someone said it was pathetic, and that's where we are right now,"
Coughlin said after his team suffered its third consecutive loss and
dropped to 3-4.</TE>
<TE>   Not so for the Texans, who ended a five-game losing streak and
looked at home doing it.</TE>
<TE>   A sign in the northeast end zone said it all: "All our Ex's play
in Texas," and on this day, the Jaguars probably wished they had some
of them back.</TE>
<TE>   The Jaguars jettisoned Seth Payne, Gary Walker and Tony Boselli to
Houston in the expansion draft so they could get their salary-cap
mess in order in the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Watching from the sideline was Boselli, the All-Pro left tackle
and onetime cornerstone of the Jacksonville franchise who is out for
the season because of an injured shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Walker and Payne, meanwhile, led Houston's domination of the
Jacksonville offensive line. The Texans limited Fred Taylor to 84
yards, and the Jaguars gained only 290 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels great, not only to come back here and win in
Jacksonville, but just to get a win as a team," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   But of all the former Jaguars, maybe former defensive coordinator
Dom Capers deserves the most credit for the milestone victory.</TE>
<TE>   With three minutes remaining, the Houston coach called for punt
returner Jabar Gaffney to throw back across the field to Aaron Glenn.
Glenn took the lateral and ran 42 yards through open field to give
Houston the ball at the Jacksonville 33. Four plays later, Brown's
field goal put the Texans ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Capers said special teams coach Joe Marciano asked him if he
wanted to run it.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Will it work?' " Capers said. "He said, 'Yes.' So I
said, 'Let's run it.' I'm glad he thought of it."</TE>
<TE>   It was the kind of play an expansion team with nothing to lose
might try.</TE>
<TE>   Coughlin remembers: He called the same play on a kickoff return in
1995, Jacksonville's first season, and Jimmy Smith scored a touchdown
against Denver. But that came during a loss.</TE>

<HD>Dillon Is the Fall Guy in Latest Bengal Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI</DL>
<LD>Only three feet from their first victory, the Cincinnati Bengals
tripped all over themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Corey Dillon stumbled over his blocker and was tackled inches from
the goal line with 1:08 to play Sunday, preserving the Tennessee
Titans' 30-24 victory.</LD>
<LD>   Steve McNair threw three second-half touchdown passes, and the
Titans (3-4) needed that final Bengal blunder to hold on against the
NFL's only winless team.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought we'd won," said Dillon, who had 138 yards in 30 carries
and saw a huge hole open on his final run. "What are you going to do?
I got tripped up, and I came up short.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear I would have walked in, just that simple. It was so big,
I could have took my daughter and my wife through there."</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati (0-7) had first and goal at the nine. Two runs by
Dillon and Jon Kitna's scramble put the nose of the ball at the one,
revving up the crowd of 52,822.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals used a play the Titans hadn't seen by having guard
Matt O'Dwyer pull with Dillon, following him to the right. But Kitna
and O'Dwyer tangled their feet, and Dillon took the handoff and
stumbled over O'Dwyer's legs, lunging toward the goal line as he
fell. Dillon was ruled down at the one.</TE>
<TE>   Fans threw cups and plastic beer bottles on the field, and
security escorted the officials off the field after the game.</TE>
<TE>   Kitna was 17 for 23 for 193 yards and two touchdowns, and McNair
was 16 for 27 for 215 yards. Tennessee's Eddie George rushed for 106
yards.</TE>

<KH>UCLA REWIND</KH>
<HD>Defense Survives Pressure Cooker</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All eyes were on the UCLA offense.</LD>
<LD>   All the pressure was on the Bruin defense.</LD>
<LD>   "I mean, Rusty Williams, our emotional leader, put it best,"
defensive tackle Steve Morgan said. "He said everybody in the country
knows this game is going to be won or lost by the defenses."</LD>
<TE>   With UCLA's offense down to its choice of two freshman
quarterbacks and one phenomenal freshman tailback, the defense
figures the season is on its shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   The Stanford game certainly was during the fourth quarter Saturday
at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA's lead was only four points when cornerback Ricky Manning Jr.
intercepted a pass by freshman Kyle Matter in Cardinal territory,
setting up a Bruin field goal.</TE>
<TE>   And the lead was still only seven points when Stanford went for it
on fourth and one from their 29 with a little more than six minutes
left.</TE>
<TE>   "We were pretty much ready for everything," tackle Ryan Boschetti
said. "But the guard in front of me started to crouch a little bit
more. We knew the run was coming right when they did that, stayed
real low in their stance.</TE>
<TE>   "I shot my gap, threw my guard by and then I stood [running back
Kerry Carter] up and grabbed on for dear life as Marcus [Reese] came
and cleaned him up."</TE>
<TE>   Later, with only a little more than a minute left and UCLA leading
by 10, the defense faced a dire situation again as Stanford went for
a first down from fourth and 15 at the Bruin 19.</TE>
<TE>   Matter, under pressure, scrambled, was wrapped up and somehow
flung the ball to Kenneth Tolon for what looked like a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he got it off, because I actually got his leg
and kind of hog-tied him," Boschetti said. "I came up with what I
thought was his sock. It was really the towel he keeps to wipe his
hands off. I thought for sure I had sacked him.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I saw that he threw it and I'm thinking, 'Aw!'</TE>
<TE>   "Then I realize I'm sitting about three yards in front of the line
[of scrimmage.]"</TE>
<TE>   The flag was already on the ground. Matter was over the line of
scrimmage. UCLA ball -- and ballgame. Bruins win, 28-18.</TE>
<TE>   Those were only a few key situations, but UCLA's defense came
through again and again despite a 15-0 hole after two fumbles deep in
UCLA territory led to two Stanford touchdowns in the first five
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   From that point on, Stanford managed only a 42-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins played with tremendous aggressiveness, sacking Matter
six times and dropping Cardinal players for losses 12 times.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Brandon Chillar had two sacks, and Morgan was credited
with 1 1/2 sacks and 3 1/2 tackles for losses.</TE>
<TE>   "We were just playing aggressive, running a lot of stunts, a lot
of blitzes, and trying to confuse them," Reese said.</TE>
<TE>   That's a game plan that works against another team's freshman
quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   What about when the Bruins face Cody Pickett, Carson Palmer and
Jason Gesser?</TE>
<TE>   "You can do that against a veteran quarterback too," Reese said.
"The main thing we've got to do is cover. People don't notice how
good Ricky Manning and Matt Ware were covering."</TE>
<TE>   Last season slipped away, with four losses in a row and the
suspension of tailback DeShaun Foster.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins were dealt a blow this season when quarterback Cory
Paus broke an ankle, but Morgan said there won't be another collapse.</TE>
<TE>   "This team is not like that," he said. "We kind of did that last
year. We set our goals extremely high, and once we lost a couple of
games, I think a lot of people threw in the towel. This year, our
goal was team unity. As long as we stay unified, we're going to
overcome adversity together."</TE>
<TE>   Especially the defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We just know we've got to step it up," Manning said. "From now
on, we've got to give our quarterback second and third chances to get
it going."</TE>

<HD>Moving Up in Poll, but Not in Standings</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC's surprising rout of Oregon ended the Trojans' futility against
the Ducks and kept them in the hunt for their first Rose Bowl berth
since the 1995 season.</LD>
<LD>   It also helped the Trojans move up four spots to No. 11 in the
Associated Press poll Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The win, however, did not affect USC's standing in the Pacific 10
Conference.</LD>
<TE>   USC, 6-2 overall and 4-1 in the Pac-10, still trails eighth-ranked
Washington State (7-1, 4-0) and 16th-ranked Arizona State (7-2, 4-0),
which play Saturday at Pullman, Wash. With an open date this week,
about the only thing the Trojans can do to improve their position is
root for Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   USC suffered its only Pac-10 loss against Washington State on Oct.
5, 30-27 in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   "We wish we could have that game back, but we just have to keep
winning and let everything else fall into place," senior middle
linebacker Mike Pollard said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State and Arizona State each have four Pac-10 games
remaining, USC three.</TE>
<TE>   The schedule appears to favor Washington State, which plays
Arizona State, Oregon and Washington at home before concluding the
season against UCLA at the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State plays at Washington State, then returns home to face
Cal before traveling to USC and Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   After USC plays at Stanford on Nov. 9, the Trojans play host to
Arizona State and then meet UCLA at the Rose Bowl before the
regular-season finale against Notre Dame at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "This sets us up pretty well," senior wide receiver Kareem Kelly
said of the Trojans' first victory over Oregon in five years and
their first win over a ranked Pac-10 team on the road since 1995. "We
know we still have a lot of work."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly, who has a sore right ankle, is one of several banged-up
Trojans who welcome the off week.</TE>
<TE>   All-American safety Troy Polamalu said last week that he does not
expect the pain from a high right ankle sprain to dissipate until the
season ends. After helping the Trojans dominate Oregon in the second
half, he is certain to benefit from a day off today and three more
next weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Offensive tackle Jacob Rogers (knee), defensive end Omar Nazel
(sternum and knee), nose tackle Bernard Riley (knee) and Pollard
(hip) are other prominent contributors expected to benefit from the
break.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a well-needed week off," said Riley, who is playing more
snaps in the wake of Shaun Cody's season-ending knee injury against
Cal.</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll said he is not worried about losing
momentum during an off week. The Trojans will practice Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday with reserves treated to more reps in what
Carroll called a "Halloween Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll is hoping that several young players will establish
themselves during the break, just as freshman lineman Winston Justice
did in the off week after a season-opening victory over Auburn.</TE>
<TE>   Justice earned a starting role and made his debut in a rout of
Colorado. The investment in his development paid dividends again
Saturday when he cleared a lane for tailback Justin Fargas on a
15-yard touchdown run.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll is not looking to replace any starters. But several
players could earn increased playing time, among them freshman tight
end Dominique Byrd, freshman defensive lineman LaJuan Ramsey,
freshman fullback Brandon Hancock and redshirt junior receiver D.
Hale.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great opportunity for those kinds of guys to make a
move," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Matt Grootegoed, who made a team-high eight tackles
against Oregon, said the Trojans will require a deep and healthy
roster for the stretch drive. USC is riding a three-game winning
streak that it hopes will reach eight by season's end.</TE>
<TE>   "If we lost, we would have been in trouble," Grootegoed said.
"This was a big win that is going to give us momentum the rest of the
season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kelly and Oregon wide receiver Keenan Howry broke the Pac-10
record for consecutive games with a reception. Both have caught
passes in 43 consecutive games.... Mike Williams' 13 receptions
established a USC freshman record. His 226 receiving yards rank
second for a freshman and third overall behind R. Jay Soward's
school-record 260 in 1996 against UCLA.... Freshman linebacker Oscar
Lua suffered a sprained ankle and could be sidelined one or two
weeks.</TE>

<KH>MINNESOTA 25, CHICAGO 7</KH>
<HD>Patience Pays Off for Vikings' Culpepper</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Daunte Culpepper showed some patience, and for once, the Minnesota
Vikings forced more turnovers than they committed.</LD>
<LD>   Keeping the ball for more than 41 minutes thanks to a surprisingly
tough defense, the Vikings defeated banged-up Chicago, 25-7, Sunday,
handing the Bears their fifth consecutive loss.</LD>
<LD>   Culpepper completed 22 of 29 passes for 216 yards with one
touchdown and no interceptions. His fumble was the Vikings' only
turnover. The Vikings recovered a fumble, intercepted two passes and
had six sacks.</LD>
<TE>   Culpepper committed 16 turnovers -- including 12 interceptions --
in the first six games, and Coach Mike Tice indicated Culpepper might
not have been secure as the starter until Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our quarterback played with a smile on his face," Tice said. "He
was determined to show that he should have that job. I'm happy for
him."</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper said he wasn't worried about being benched.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel he has confidence in me or I wouldn't be there," Culpepper
said. "I remind myself to be patient, and when I do that, good things
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Moss had nine receptions for 119 yards, Gary Anderson kicked
three field goals and Michael Bennett rushed 29 times for 106 yards
to lead the Vikings (2-5).</TE>
<TE>   After a rather drowsy first half, Culpepper caught the Chicago
secondary sleeping on the fifth play of Minnesota's first
third-quarter possession. He threw a perfectly placed ball to Moss in
the corner of the end zone on first down for a 39-yard touchdown play
and a 20-0 Viking lead.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper excitedly hopped on his way to the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "I was harping on myself all week that if it's not there, don't
force it," Culpepper said. "Randy's been there all year, and when
I've tried to force it to him a few times, bad things have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Chandler was 15 for 25 for 176 yards with an interception
for the Bears (2-5). Anthony Thomas was limited to 18 yards in nine
carries.</TE>

<DH>If Jerry West was looking for a challenge after building a
dynasty in Los Angeles, he came to the right place</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>MEMPHIS, Tenn.  -- Memphis?</LD>
<LD>   East is still East and West is still West, but now Jerry West is
East, if not in the NBA where he's still in his old conference, at
least in real life, running a team based on the eastern side of the
Mississippi River.</LD>
<LD>   Talk about your breaks with the past. The last time he went to
camp with anyone but the Lakers, he was a West Virginia senior,
Dwight Eisenhower was president and the Lakers were still in
Minneapolis, a year from their 1960 move into the state-of-the-art
arena going up in downtown Los Angeles, the Sports Arena.</LD>
<TE>   How can we imagine Lakerdom, suddenly without West, without Chick
Hearn?</TE>
<TE>   West arrived in Los Angeles as a rookie in the fall of 1960. Chick
came on to call the playoffs the next spring (until then the new team
couldn't get its games on radio and didn't have an announcer) and
stayed the rest of his life.</TE>
<TE>   With Elgin Baylor, they were the Laker trinity that provided the
glamour that would become part of team lore. More to the point, it
came in handy to sell the game to Angelenos, who barely knew they had
arrived, or cared.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't like the Dodgers' arrival in 1958, which was
front-page news and required great civic initiatives to procure the
downtown land for the new stadium. Minneapolis barely noticed the
Lakers had left; nor was Los Angeles at a fever pitch. Attendance at
their first game was 4,044.</TE>
<TE>   As Baylor's knees went, West became their beating heart as a
player in the '60s and '70s, then their brain as general manager in
the '80s and '90s. Before his nervous system went, he retired in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   So what's he doing here?</TE>
<TE>   Jerry West of the ... Memphis Grizzlies?</TE>
<TE>   "The weird part," he says, sitting in the stands in the Pyramid
(local arena in Memphis) as the Grizzlies (whoever they are)
practice, "yesterday I talked to [Laker GM] Mitch Kupchak and we
talked about Laker players.</TE>
<TE>   "I wished him well, told him I thought they had the team to beat.
Obviously, you feel that incredible loyalty and sense of what that
franchise has meant in my life. At times, it's sad to think that I'm
not there, but I really believe I did the right thing for me.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line, maybe sometimes you have to do selfish things in
life. This is kind of, from my perspective, a selfish thing because I
left a lot of wonderful friends, a situation with the people and the
coaching staff they have in place.</TE>
<TE>   "That franchise is going to be really successful, particularly for
as long as Shaquille [O'Neal] plays. That was the difficult part of
it. But the other thing was that, it didn't bring me the same good
feeling, even when we were winning. It just didn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   Of course. That was Our Jerry. We came to know his moods and
foibles as if they were part of the landscape, like the weather. In
June, the marine layer hangs over the beach in the morning and burns
off in the afternoon. In June, West considers retiring from whatever
he's doing.</TE>
<TE>   It was ever thus. So two Junes after he finally did retire, he
again grew restless with what he was doing and came back to start all
over, at age 64, from the very bottom.</TE>
<TE>   In Lakerdom, the heavy lifting was over, which made him almost
ornamental, but it's not like that here. The Grizzlies, formerly of
Vancouver, have never won more than 23 games and he's a reason to
hope. Actually, because they've had clueless owners and GMs, he's the
first reason for hope they've had.</TE>
<TE>   "It's exciting for me to come to work, knowing he's the captain of
the ship," second-year forward Shane Battier said. "Everyone from the
PR staff to the medical staff to the players feel energized by his
presence....</TE>
<TE>   "It starts at the top, and getting Mr. West just sends a signal
throughout the organization."</TE>
<TE>   In that case, get ready for lots of signals.</TE>
<TE>   "We would get [to games] early and he would be upset about
something, frustrated about something -- or happy about something,"
Magic Johnson said recently, reminiscing about all his years with
West.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when he was happy, he was mad. I tell you, the organization,
the city, as well as us as former players, are going to miss him....</TE>
<TE>   "And those guys better get ready," Johnson added, laughing,
"because they don't know what's about to come."</TE>
<TE>   Bad Times,</TE>
<TE>   Worse Times</TE>
<TE>   What thrill of victory? With West, winning seemed to bring a
special agony of its own.</TE>
<TE>   Nor was it hard to tell, because he wore his hyper-critical
emotions on his sleeve. It was one reason people cared so deeply for
him -- fans, media, even bitter rivals.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston Celtics' John Havlicek once told him on the floor, "I
love you." Bill Russell flew out for the ceremony marking Jerry's
retirement as a player and announced: "If I could have one wish in
life granted, it would be that you would always be happy."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't that West was never happy. He had a nice family, a lot
of friends, was often out of the Laker offices by noon on his way to
the golf course and was generally considered fun to be around by the
Lakers' little people.</TE>
<TE>   It was just that whenever the Lakers won, and everyone around him
was dancing in the street, he'd be asking himself if this was all
there was.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985 when he was general manager, they won their most
monumental series before or since, coming back from a 148-114 defeat
in Game 1 to overcome the Celtics, who had dumped them in seven NBA
Finals, six of which West had played in.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, The Times' Steve Springer asked if he'd be in the
parade. No way, West said. He wasn't going to ride through town on a
parade float so people could boo him.</TE>
<TE>   However, even his friends were surprised by his transformation in
the late '90s, after he finished perhaps the greatest rebuilding job
in NBA history, tearing apart a team that made the Finals as late as
1991, getting back above 50 wins while keeping its salary cap low
enough to sign O'Neal in 1996, stealing Kobe Bryant in a trade the
same summer, finally recommending Phil Jackson (West says), along
with O'Neal (Shaq says) to get over the top by 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of signing O'Neal in 1996, West got the blues and
told reporters he might not want to keep working long.</TE>
<TE>   Two seasons later, he announced he'd leave, saying he was burned
out, then recanted after the Lakers were swept in the playoffs by the
Utah Jazz (whew, bad news, just in time).</TE>
<TE>   The season after that was the one with Dennis Rodman, when West,
horrified but disinclined to confront owner Jerry Buss, absented
himself from games for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately or not, the best/worst was yet to come: The next
season, the Lakers won a title.</TE>
<TE>   West was a basket case that spring of 2000. He was alarmed that
Jackson was dating the boss' daughter, Jeanie Buss, leading to
speculation among insiders that Jackson was running West off.</TE>
<TE>   However, everything spooked West that spring. Even the Finals, a
humdrum series against Indiana that the Lakers led, 3-1, and won,
4-2, unsettled him to the point he not only stopped going to games,
he didn't even watch them on TV.</TE>
<TE>   Before Game 6, as fans gathered in Staples Center and outside to
watch on the giant TV screen, in taverns and homes, West hopped in
his car and fled.</TE>
<TE>   "I was up past Santa Barbara, as a matter of fact," he says. "I
had a friend of mine at the game. I said, 'Call me when it's over.'</TE>
<TE>   "That made me realize this had become almost a sickness and that I
just couldn't do this anymore. It was the last game. And I thought
how happy the people were. I know how happy the players were, how
happy the fans and the owner. And it was nothing to me.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to say that because I don't think unless you
sort of lived all this stuff and was as close to watching this, that
you could even imagine feeling that way. And even to this day, it was
like, if that series hadn't gotten over that night -- you know, it's
not even really funny.</TE>
<TE>   "At times, you almost feel ill in even thinking about them losing.
That really convinced me that I didn't need to do this anymore. It
was terrible for me. It was terrible for the people around me, my
family, my friends. Everything ceased to become fun."</TE>
<TE>   He confided his distress to his usual confidantes. The usual
rumors circulated. Johnson, who has been through it before, said he'd
believe it when he saw West on the podium making the announcement.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out that Laker publicist John Black had to make the
announcement. West was not only burned out but so charred, he
wouldn't attend his farewell news conference.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't held in a Beverly Hills hotel ballroom with Buss and all
the Laker greats there, but on the court at their El Segundo practice
facility, with only a few reporters attending.</TE>
<TE>   West was one year into a four-year, $14-million contract. With
nothing to do but make an occasional decision, kick back and accept
congratulations for putting together their budding dynasty, the
greatest Laker of them all just faded away.</TE>
<TE>   Guess Who's</TE>
<TE>   Coming to Dinner</TE>
<TE>   Well, it could have worked.</TE>
<TE>   For a season, West told everyone how relaxed he felt but, of
course, he got antsy and began wondering if he had done the right
thing, as the offers started coming. And the more he said no, the
bigger the offers got.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he had no intention of leaving Southern California. Once
last season, a Newsday reporter phoned his house to see if he might
be interested in taking over the New York Knicks but got West's wife,
Karen, instead.</TE>
<TE>   "New York?" said Karen West, pleasantly. "Oh, no."</TE>
<TE>   Several teams, including the Atlanta Hawks, sounded out West. As
usual, some of his millionaire golf/poker friends said they would buy
teams and hire him to run them. West has always had lots of friends
like Steve Wynn, owner of the Las Vegas Mirage hotel and casino,
eager to do deals with him.</TE>
<TE>   Then Grizzlies owner Michael Heisley came up with a stunning offer
-- reportedly $5 million to $7 million a year for five seasons and
perhaps a piece of the team -- and West, who always insists it's not
about the money but does love to be stroked, couldn't say no.</TE>
<TE>   West, impressed, now compares Heisley to Buss, although it hasn't
occurred to anyone else. All Heisley had done before in two seasons
was pull the team out of scenic Vancouver and hire the voluble,
overmatched Dick Versace, a personal friend, at huge numbers to run
the basketball operation.</TE>
<TE>   The Grizzlies under Versace went 45-119 in two seasons, sending
the impatient Heisley back onto the market, where this time he bagged
the elephant.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been Mr. L.A.," Coach Sidney Lowe said. "When I heard about
[the possibility West might come] I thought, 'No, no way he's coming.
I hope he comes but he's not coming.'</TE>
<TE>   "When I finally got the call, Jerry called me and told me he was
coming -- he called me. I mean, just out of nowhere. I didn't even
know he had my telephone number and he told me he was coming."</TE>
<TE>   This was a call Lowe was happy to get, having been hired by
Versace, making him a holdover with a 45-119 record. However, it
isn't West's way to come in and start lopping heads off ...
immediately. So if there's a lot of speculation Jerry would like to
hire his old Laker coach, Mike Dunleavy, Lowe will still get a chance
first.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis is small, friendly and humid, with the nation's No. 43
metropolitan area, which ranks it last in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   It's a crossroads, or in other words, people go through here on
their way somewhere else. The Pyramid sits right by the Mississippi
River, with Arkansas just across the bridge. St. Louis sits 250 miles
upriver. New Orleans is 400 miles downriver.</TE>
<TE>   It was always like that. Country music coming out of Nashville ran
into blues coming up the river from New Orleans and became
rockabilly, which became rock 'n' roll. Elvis Presley first recorded
here at Sun Records, which was also the label of B.B. King, Muddy
Waters, Jerry Lee Lewis and Johnny Cash.</TE>
<TE>   Sun's little studio is still open at 706 Union St., an
unpretentious shrine in comparison to the tourists' favorite,
Graceland. The city may be small, but it's soulful, which makes it a
good fit for West, who's all soul, himself.</TE>
<TE>   The team -- well, let's just say West won't have to worry about
how he feels after winning a title for a while.</TE>
<TE>   There are several good young players -- Battier, Pao Gasol,
Lorenzen Wright, Jason Williams. West's first No. 1 pick, Drew
Gooden, just burned up the exhibition season, averaging 18 points and
11.5 rebounds for the Grizzlies. So, at least they have somewhere to
start and, for a change, someone in charge who knows which direction
to go in.</TE>
<TE>   So here he is, back on the job, feeling funny about it and right
at home, at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   "Just being away from it was kind of a wake-up call for me," he
says. "It said, 'You better really be 100% sure the next time you say
you're not going to do this.'</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's going to be difficult, but I'll be honest with you --
I've been in a situation where I've really seen the best of it. I
want to know what it's like on the other side. To me, when your team
wins all the time, when you start the season and you know you're
going to make the playoffs, that's pretty easy. But I think it really
helps to see the other side of it....</TE>
<TE>   "This is the fun part of it, but I would like to see two players
out here that we had in Los Angeles. I know I could go to bed nights
smiling and feeling good about our chances at the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   He means Shaq and Kobe, but they're from his former life. As
glorious as it was and as long as it lasted, that one's over.</TE>

<LD>Move over, little dogs, this is big dog country.</LD>
<LD>   This is the conference with the Lakers, who are on a three-title
winning streak ... and the Sacramento Kings, who finished ahead of
them in the regular season and almost took them out in the Western
Conference finals ... and are still moaning about Game 6 at Staples
Center when the Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   That's not all the West has to offer, either.</LD>
<TE>   If the Kings aren't far behind the Lakers, the San Antonio Spurs
aren't far behind the Kings, needing only for things to fall into
place quickly since they've turned over half their roster.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Mavericks' 57 wins put them in a tie with the 1994-95
Seattle SuperSonics for the distinction of being the best fourth
seed.</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Timberwolves' 50 wins were only good enough for the
fifth seeding, before they were (again) sent home in the first round,
earning them scorn from their fans who are tired of hearing how tough
the West is.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if you don't have a Shaquille O'Neal-Kobe Bryant
tandem, or at least a Mike Bibby-Chris Webber or a Tim Duncan-David
Robinson, the smart thing to do is ... leave?</TE>
<TE>   Yes, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies have volunteered to move to
the East, if the NBA lets New Orleans go to the West. (The Hornet
owners want to take advantage of rivalries with the Texas teams and
are willing to give up their good thing in the East. Of course, the
Hornet owners have messed up everything else they've touched, to
date.)</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, it'll be dog-eat-dog over here, as usual, and
they've got some large canines.</TE>

<HD>DeMera Lifts Panama; U.S. Shuts Out Mexico</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Grahame L. Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amerelis DeMera is unlikely to have seen her name in the same
sentence as Mia Hamm before, but here it is.</LD>
<LD>   The 17-year-old striker from Universidad Tecnologica in Panama
City stole the show at the Rose Bowl on Sunday, scoring a deserving
hat trick and leading Panama over Trinidad and Tobago, 4-2, in the
first game of the CONCACAF Women's Gold Cup.</LD>
<LD>   And Hamm?</LD>
<TE>   Well, the world's best-known player was as active as ever -- as
shown by the bruises she picked up after time an again being knocked
to the turf -- but was unable to add to her world-record total of 135
goals.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the United States had more than enough firepower to
overcome Mexico, 3-0, in the second game of a doubleheader in front
of a chilled gathering of 5,568.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans held a 7-0 all-time advantage over the Mexicans
before the match and had outscored them, 51-2, but Mexico's program
is rapidly gaining strength under Coach Leonardo Cuellar, a former
World Cup player.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, a three-goal victory was about the margin expected.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's Jennifer Molina made outstanding saves off two shots by
Shannon MacMillan and a header by Angela Hucles in the second half,
and Kristine Lilly hit the right post with a long-range diagonal
shot, otherwise the result might have been more lopsided.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is a satisfying result for Mexico, and on the flip
side it's not a satisfying result for us," Coach April Heinrichs
said. "Because we felt that the game got a little reckless in the
second half and that while we created more [scoring] chances, we
didn't bury them.</TE>
<TE>   "Mexico, every time they come back, they come back with a little
bit more determination, a little bit more grit, a little bit more
organization, and I think probably a little bit more optimism about
what they can create on the offensive side."</TE>
<TE>   It took the U.S. only 4 minutes 33 seconds to take the lead, with
impressive midfielder Aly Wagner powering a shot past Molina from 18
yards off a pass from Lilly.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican defense stiffened after that, and it was not until the
42nd minute that Cindy Parlow was able to double the U.S. advantage.
The final goal, by MacMillan, came in injury time in the 90th minute.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hard surface, especially in the middle after a football
game" said Hamm, who came into frequent contact with the ground. "But
regardless of that -- and we all talked about it -- technically, it's
got to be better."</TE>
<TE>   The rust is still being knocked off the world champions. By the
time they return to the Rose Bowl for the Nov. 9 final -- assuming
they qualify -- they should be in more dominant form.</TE>
<TE>   On defense, however, they already are proving difficult to play
against.</TE>
<TE>   On the rare occasions when Mexico managed to mount attack, central
defenders Joy Fawcett and Brandi Chastain, along with outside backs
Kate Sobrero and Cat Reddick, were up to the challenge and goalkeeper
Briana Scurry had relatively little to do.</TE>
<TE>   Hamm left in the 79th minute and was replaced by 17-year-old
Heather O'Reilly.</TE>
<TE>   But by then, another 17-year-old, DeMera, had long since made the
day her own.</TE>
<TE>   Panama plays Mexico in the second game of Tuesday's doubleheader
at Cal State Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays Trinidad and Tobago, whose coach, Jamaal Shavazz,
has understandably low expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very eager to play the U.S. and see how much we have
progressed since losing, 12-0, [in the 2000 Women's Gold Cup]," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was only 11-0, but who's counting?</TE>

<HD>No 'I' in MVP, Either</HD>
<DH>Angel third baseman Glaus, who always puts the team's
success first, wins individual award for producing Bonds-like power
numbers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Dwyre</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Glaus is the most valuable player of the 2002 World Series, and
that may be about the most definitive and descriptive label anybody
will be able to pin on him.</LD>
<LD>   He is about as colorful as your beige bedroom wall and would not
be hurt when described that way. He is the Angel third baseman who
nearly outslugged perhaps the greatest slugger in the history of the
game, and did so when it counted the most. In the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   For the seven games that it took for the Angels to create one of
the better storybook endings to a true Disney season, Glaus' batting
line read:</LD>
<TE>   * Ten hits, 22 total bases, three doubles, three home runs and
eight runs batted in. His hit .385, and his slugging percentage was
.846.</TE>
<TE>   For the seven games it took for the Giants to truly frustrate
themselves, as well as a nice little city by the bay with great
restaurants, Hall of Fame shoo-in Barry Bonds' batting line read:</TE>
<TE>   * Eight hits, 22 total bases, two doubles, four home runs and six
runs batted in. He hit .471, and his slugging percentage was a robust
1.294. Bonds, of course, was walked 13 times.</TE>
<TE>   Had the Giants won the World Series, Bonds probably would have
been standing up on that giant platform in the middle of the field
after the game, hobnobbing with Commissioner Bud Selig and Fox's
Jeanne Zelasko and taking it all in for himself, as a World Series
MVP is entitled to. But the Angels won, and that made Glaus the man,
in the bright lights with Bud and Jeanne and Michael Eisner and
Jackie Autry.</TE>
<TE>   The key phrase there is: "But the Angels won."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Glaus cared about. That's what he talked about. That's
the only way he could think, cared to think. With microphone after
microphone jammed in his face, with notepads held by inquiring minds
wanting to know, Glaus talked team.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, it was a stream of cliches about all 25 players contributing
and doing this thing one game and one at-bat at a time and everybody
knowing his role and playing it.</TE>
<TE>   And sure, it didn't make for compelling copy or spellbinding
storytelling. But it was honest, what he is, who he is.</TE>
<TE>   Probed for reaction and description of emotion, or depth of
feeling, he finally said that, when he heard he was the MVP, he
didn't think all that much about it.</TE>
<TE>   "And then they told me to go up on the stand, and so I did," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus does have a $100,000 World Series MVP bonus clause in his
contract, but he'll collect more than three times that amount as his
share for the team winning the Series.</TE>
<TE>   He had delivered the game-winning blow in Saturday night's
incredible Game 6 turnabout, but he said he never allowed himself to
think about the next thing, the possible Game 7 win, and what that
might mean.</TE>
<TE>   "We just played hard again, played our hearts out, just like we do
every night, all season," he said. "That's what we are."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, all questions directed to the singular Troy Glaus brought
responses in the plural Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Adam Kennedy was asked about Glaus. Did he have any
stories, any anecdotes?</TE>
<TE>   "I love the guy, but I don't have any stories," Kennedy said
implying that there really might not be any, outside of fastballs and
curves and sliders and a shower before going home.</TE>
<TE>   After his big hit Saturday night, how was Glaus in the clubhouse,
Kennedy was asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Same as he always is," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   And so it was, in the 2002 World Series, that bland won out over
bombastic, that the word "team" still didn't find the letter "i" in
it, and that a tall, muscular third baseman from the Angels who only
thinks collectively won one of the most coveted prizes in sports.</TE>
<TE>   In a time when NFL players take pens out of their socks to sign
footballs on the field after touchdowns, the image of Glaus wanting
to chop up his MVP trophy into 25 pieces has a nice feel to it.</TE>
<TE>   Much like the entire Angel season.</TE>

<TE>   I've been a Dodger fan since I was 10 years old, in 1959, when the
Dodgers won the World Series against the White Sox. I was there at
Dodger Stadium when Fernando pitched his no-hitter. And I'll never
forget Gibson's homer. But then Peter O'Malley sold the team, they
traded Mike Piazza, etc., etc., and I have to admit that my loyalty
has been tested. I guess you can accuse me of jumping on the Angels'
bandwagon, but this is the most exciting postseason I can remember.

<HD>Right to the End, Scioscia Lets Others Have the Credit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mike Scioscia probably doesn't know the story, doesn't care. He
wasn't even 3 years old when the expansion Angels gathered for an
introductory banquet during the early days of their first Palm
Springs training camp in 1961.</LD>
<LD>   New owner Gene Autry, already in a celebratory state, was at the
microphone, explaining how he and general manager Fred Haney had
tried hard to talk Casey Stengel into managing the team but believed
they had hired a man who would be just as successful in Phil Wrigley.</LD>
<LD>   Phil Wrigley? A quizzical buzz swept the room. The Angels had
hired a member of the chewing gum family that then owned the Chicago
Cubs?</LD>
<TE>   Autry apologized. A slip of the tongue. He had meant to say Bill
Rigney.</TE>
<TE>   Now, 42 years since that inauspicious start, Edison Field was
rocking to the beat of the Angels' first World Series title.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia had led the organization to a height many -- well, OK,
I'm hiding among accomplices -- thought it would never reach,
overcoming the futility and frustrations that enveloped almost all 15
of his full-time predecessors, starting with Rigney.</TE>
<TE>   It became official at 8:18 PST Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Lofton flied out for the final out of a 4-1 victory over the
San Francisco Giants in Game 7, the final out of an improbable
season.</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels swarmed from the dugout to engulf Troy Percival on
the mound, Scioscia raised both arms over his head as if in sweet
salute to those who had preceded him.</TE>
<TE>   As if in reply to the talking heads who had wanted his job during
the 6-14 start of April.</TE>
<TE>   As if to say to the Dodgers, who had virtually chased him off the
managerial fast track and out of an organization that had been his
life until 1999 ... well, look at me now.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that was the last thing Scioscia was thinking or would
admit to thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Redemption and vindication?</TE>
<TE>   That has never been part of a season, he would reiterate, that
ultimately spanned 110 victories, 50 of them when the Angels came
from behind, including seven times in the 16 games of the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   In a clubhouse awash in champagne, Scioscia said, "All of us who
have ever dreamed about managing have dreamed about having a
championship-caliber club and seeing how far you can go with it. I'm
just thankful for the opportunity and happy for the players. They
deserve the credit."</TE>
<TE>   When has he said anything different? When has he let his emotions
surface, showing how it is for him? Immovable behind the plate,
Scioscia remained impassive in ultimate triumph.</TE>
<TE>   On the victory platform that was towed to the center of the
diamond for the presentation of the championship trophy, Scioscia
held it aloft and told a crowd of 44,598: "I enjoy this, but this
game is all about playing, and these guys can carry what they
accomplished here for the rest of their life. I've been in the game a
long time and never been around a more passionate group that every
day gave their best."</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to argue, of course, but then passion has to be
channeled, a tone and direction set.</TE>
<TE>   Starting in the spring, Scioscia and his staff sold the Angels on
a situational and team approach at the plate that removed ego and
ultimately produced an offense that led the American League in
batting, struck out less than any of the 29 others and roared through
the postseason with an average of 6.3 runs a game and a .320 batting
average.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, coming off a season in which they had finished 41
games out of the division lead, Scioscia sold the Angels on the
cliche concept of putting the ghosts to rest one game at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Never did he waver from insisting this was a championship-caliber
team.</TE>
<TE>   "This entire collection of players is a reflection of the
manager's personality," said Joe Maddon, the respected bench coach.
"Mike set the tone, created stability, brought a confident calmness.</TE>
<TE>   "He has the experience of having been in a championship situation
before [Scioscia is the 28th person to have played for and managed a
World Series winner], and he brought a direction that allowed
everybody to do their job. I mean, from an offensive standpoint these
guys genuinely fed off each other, reveled in each other's success.
It was a college approach on a major league level, and what's wrong
with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Said assistant general manager Ken Forsch, a pitcher on the 1982
Angel team that came within one win of reaching the World Series
before being derailed by the demons and a man familiar with the
haunting memories of '86 when the Angels were within one strike of
the Series:</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like what happened here this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike changed the whole attitude by getting these guys to buy into
the concept of playing one game at a time.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it's a cliche and sounds contrite and the tendency is to
say, 'yeah right, yeah right,' but instead of thinking something bad
was going to happen, these guys came to the park every day thinking
something good was going to happen, and they used that approach to
get rid of 16 years of baggage."</TE>
<TE>   Can Scioscia and the Angels sustain the transformation? That's for
tomorrow. The phone rang in the manager's office after Game 7. It was
Giant Manager Dusty Baker, his former Dodger mentor when Scioscia was
a rookie, calling to tell him:</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't win it this year, I wanted you to win it. You guys
are awesome. Don't let your guys forget you're champions. Hold your
heads high."</TE>
<TE>   There was another voice from the Dodger past. Roxie Campanella,
the wife of the late Hall of Fame catcher, had attended the game as
Scioscia's guest, and now sat in a meeting room near the clubhouse
saying how much her husband had loved Scioscia, how much he had doted
on him when the young catcher sat at Campanella's feet, soaking up
knowledge in Vero Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike was like a son to both of us," she said. "I'm so proud of
him and happy for him that I can't even convey my thoughts. I know
Roy is looking down and smiling. He loved Mike so much. He belonged
with us."</TE>
<TE>   What she meant is that Scioscia belonged with the Dodgers, but
that page has been turned, of course.</TE>
<TE>   In his third year at the Angels' helm, he has clearly authored the
beginning of a rewarding new chapter.</TE>

<HD>Touched by Angels, All of Southland Is Part of Halo Nation</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The City of Angels, indeed.</LD>
<LD>   We are precisely that today, a city of pastels painted red, a city
of many sports religions united under one halo.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles has a new hometown baseball team today, a new reason
to crack a peanut and spill a beer and shout to the sky.</LD>
<TE>   Their faces are fresh, their pants are dirty, and their chests are
heaving as they sprint through 42 years of shadows into the blinding
light of a World Series championship.</TE>
<TE>   Dodgers, pack your stuff and climb to the top bunk.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are moving in.</TE>
<TE>   It became official Sunday night with four weary wings, 45,000
prayers, and enough heart to make a rug-burned center fielder choke.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem real," said Darin Erstad, fighting back tears as
he spit on Edison Field's now-sacred ground. "It just doesn't seem
real."</TE>
<TE>   It became official with two last lunging swings by struggling
Garret Anderson and Bengie Molina, and nine endless miles by pitchers
rattling on the rims.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shot," said Brendan Donnelly, shaking his head. "My arm is
totally shot."</TE>
<TE>   It became official at 8:19 p.m., when Erstad caught a fly ball
seemingly dropped into his glove by Gene Autry himself, when Troy
Percival let out eight years worth of scream, when Molina fell to his
knees in prayer.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now it is all a dream," said Tim Salmon, for him, for a
team, for a town.</TE>
<TE>   An Angel 4-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants in Game 7?</TE>
<TE>   Of the World Series?</TE>
<TE>   The Southland's first major-league baseball championship in 14
years?</TE>
<TE>   It was a dream with a "Celebration" soundtrack, champagne-stained,
tattered T-shirts, and an on-field player conga line through a
baseball yard nobody wanted to leave.</TE>
<TE>   Long after the final out Sunday, long after heroes had gone
inside, thousands of fans continued to rattle their noise sticks and
shout their thanks. They were rewarded by funky, flinging, perfect
Angel Ben Weber emerging from the clubhouse to spray them with
bubbly.</TE>
<TE>   "I look at all this and I think, 'Oh my God,' " said coach Alfredo
Griffin.</TE>
<TE>   Yep, Los Angeles, the Angels are moving in, demanding our
increased attention, earning that hour-long drive, a team that bucked
trends and defied description.</TE>
<TE>   You know how, after most major team championships, a star is
selected to shout, "I'm going to Disneyland" into the cameras?</TE>
<TE>   Under particular pressure because the players and the park work
for the same boss, officials here selected their stars during Sunday
night's celebration and tried to round them up.</TE>
<TE>   But the stars wouldn't leave their teammates.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't get them apart," said a team official.</TE>
<TE>   So instead of one or two guys in the commercial, there will be
least five.</TE>
<TE>   And joining the legacy of countless sports heroes in shouting the
famous words will be Benji Gil, who had five World Series at-bats,
and Alex Ochoa, who had one.</TE>
<TE>   "We are the definition of the team at the professional level,"
said Erstad, who started the party by catching the final out. "It's
so rare you find a group of guys all on the same page and care so
much for each other."</TE>
<TE>   Rare was the old-timer searching the postgame madness for Manager
Mike Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   She wanted to tell him how proud her husband would have been. She
wanted to thank Scioscia for carrying on the Southland baseball
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Her name was Roxy Campanella.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my," she said. "Even the Dodgers were never like this."</TE>
<TE>   These are, in a sense, the new Dodgers. These are the sort of
players this town fell in love with many years ago, the kind many
thought they would never see again.</TE>
<TE>   They are baseball's best team. Yet, on the roster of the midseason
game featuring the best players, they had only one.</TE>
<TE>   They don't have Babe Ruth, they have a shortstop who is the
approximate size of a Baby Ruth candy bar.</TE>
<TE>   They don't have Lou Gehrig, they have a catcher who runs like an
iron horse.</TE>
<TE>   No Splendid Splinter, but they do have a first baseman who plays
in a band called the Sandfrogs.</TE>
<TE>   No Hammerin' Hank, but a Fish.</TE>
<TE>   No A-Rod, just K-Rod.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly no pressure either, on a team that won only when it was
convinced that a monkey was on its back.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at these guys," mused coach Mickey Hatcher during the
on-field party. "You come here tomorrow, they'll still be standing
around here. They don't know any better."</TE>
<TE>   Given their October obstacles, maybe it's better that they don't
know.</TE>
<TE>   They bullied through the playoffs by beating a Big Foot, a
Cinderella and a tall tale named Barry Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   They won the division series after being mugged at midnight in the
Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   They won the league championship series after being lulled asleep
in the heartland.</TE>
<TE>   They won the world championship by making sure the Giant hearts
never left San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Down to their last eight outs on Saturday here, trailing by five
runs, they crushed the Giants with their spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Down to the last day on Sunday, they silenced them with their
will.</TE>
<TE>   The heroes on Saturday were eventual most valuable player Troy
Glaus and Scott Spiezio and Erstad and Donnelly.</TE>
<TE>   The heroes Sunday were David Eckstein and John Lackey and
Francisco Rodriguez and Erstad and Molina and Anderson and Percival.</TE>
<TE>   That about cover everybody?</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, we forgot Brad Fullmer, who hit .294 in the postseason,
and Adam Kennedy, who hit three home runs in one playoff game to help
them get here.</TE>
<TE>   If there was a goat, it was Giant Manager Dusty Baker, again
showing postseason jitters in Game 7 by starting the league's biggest
loser (Livan Hernandez) and a guy who had not had a hit in a month
(Pedro Feliz), and then inserted hiccup-hitting Tom Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   The star of this show was supposed to be Bonds. But in the end, he
was a four-homer loser, while the Angels were seven-homer champions.</TE>
<TE>   It is a new show indeed, with new stars who are not stars, with a
new style that's an old style, world champions and new kings of the
neighborhood.</TE>

<KH>GAME 7 AT EDISON FIELD / ANGELS 4, SAN FRANCISCO 1</KH>
<HD>Fantasyland!</HD>
<DH>Glaus is MVP as amazing Angels complete first championship
season</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The halo shines tonight, and forever. Gene Autry's Angels are the
champions of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon waved a cowboy hat at the sky. Then he hoisted the
championship trophy aloft and skipped around the warning track, a
victory lap 42 years in the making. After four decades of seasons
that ended in defeat, sometimes painfully and all too often
routinely, the Angels proclaimed the first championship in franchise
history loudly and proudly.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't gloat very often," relief pitcher Troy Percival said.
"Right now, we're the best."</LD>
<TE>   That they are, without a superstar.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels spun the pick-a-hero wheel for Game 7 of the World
Series, and look who came up in the 4-1 victory over the San
Francisco Giants: All-Star Garret Anderson, the other left fielder in
this Series, doubled home three runs, the last game-winning hit in
his fabulous season. John Lackey, a tall Texan who would not be out
of place in one of Autry's old cowboy movies and a kid five days past
his 24th birthday, pitched five terrific innings to become the first
rookie to win Game 7 in 93 years.</TE>
<TE>   The score never changed after the third inning, tension and
anticipation mounting all the while. Salmon, the right fielder
removed from the game in the eighth inning, said he started counting
down in the fourth. Second baseman Adam Kennedy said he started
counting down in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth inning, as Percival took the mound, Salmon scampered
back to the clubhouse. From his locker, he retrieved a white Stetson
cowboy hat, with Gene Autry's signature embossed in gold along the
band. Jackie Autry had loaned the hat, from her late husband, when
Salmon asked for some memento, some symbolic way to involve the
Angels' founding owner in the celebration he so dearly wished he
would live to see.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:19 p.m., Kenny Lofton lofted a fly ball to center field, for
what would be the final out. As Darin Erstad awaited descent, waving
his arms so frantically no one dared encroach upon his airspace,
catcher Bengie Molina rushed the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "My heart," he said, "wanted to come out of my body."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad said he could barely breathe.</TE>
<TE>   "I was like, oh my God," he said. "I wanted that ball so bad. I
said to myself that this would be the hardest catch I ever made in my
life. I said, use two hands, just like my dad taught me."</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels charged the mound, and hugged, and piled atop each
other, Salmon emerged from the dugout with Autry's hat, thrusting it
to the sky and to every corner of the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   And, as Commissioner Bud Selig said upon presenting the
championship trophy, "Somewhere, Gene Autry is smiling right now."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon, the longest-suffering Angel player, lingered on the field,
soaking up all the sights and sounds of victory -- the fireworks, the
ovations, the streamers, the teammates dressed in black World Series
championship T-shirts and gray championship caps.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is dreamlike right now," Salmon said. "It just doesn't
seem real."</TE>
<TE>   Molina said he wouldn't believe what had just happened until he
read about it in the morning papers.</TE>
<TE>   Congratulations, Bengie. The Angels really are champions.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, the veteran closer, got the final three outs. The first
24 came from Lackey, Brendan Donnelly and Francisco Rodriguez, all
rookies, none of whom made the opening day roster. In those eight
innings, the Giants managed five hits.</TE>
<TE>   "There goes the theory," Salmon said, "that you need veterans to
win a World Series."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants had a pretty good one in Barry Bonds. He hit .471 in
the Series, reaching base in 21 of 30 plate appearances and hitting
four home runs.</TE>
<TE>   But the championship rings will not be worn by the team with the
left fielder who snubbed his teammates during the World Series
introductions and who nearly came to blows with his second baseman in
the middle of a game during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   And the Series MVP award was won not by Bonds but by a
representative of the winning team -- Angel third baseman Troy Glaus,
who hit .385 with three home runs and eight runs batted in.</TE>
<TE>   "I watch other teams win, and you sit and watch how many
superstars they've got," Percival said. "To watch this team win the
world championship is something special."</TE>
<TE>   Said Brad Fullmer: "This is the first time I've ever seen a team
go from February to October without one argument, without one fight.
A lot of teams put up with each other, but they don't actually like
each other. This team does."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, the World Series champions, had one player selected to
the All-Star team -- Anderson, as a reserve. That will change next
season, when Angel Manager Mike Scioscia gets to make the selections.
As a perk of victory, he will manage the American League All-Star team.
In that capacity, he will be introduced by the honorary president of the
league -- Jackie Autry.</TE>
<TE>   And so it all came full circle, back to Gene Autry. Red was his
favorite color, the one that reminded him of the days when the circus
would pass through his boyhood town. In red, he saw happiness.</TE>
<TE>   This year, for the first time in their 42 seasons, the Angels wore
red. This year, destiny wore red.</TE>

<HD>'Mygoodness,' Hudler Is in Seventh Heaven</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So this is what it feels like to be Rex Hudler for a day, thousands
and thousands of Angel fans running around all giddy and bubbly, the
Rally Monkey conga line forming behind the Wonder Dog.</LD>
<LD>   Darin Erstad might be an awesome fielder, and Scott Spiezio an RBI
machine in the playoffs, but every day of the year, win or lose, rain
or shine, Hudler, the former Angel player, has been this team's
Energizer Broadcaster, feeding anyone who will listen with hope and
promise no matter what the score.</LD>
<LD>   And so there he was, clapping, jumping up and down and hugging
everyone along the third base line after the Angels' World Series
victory, and no matter how hard I yelled, he wouldn't put me down.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THEY ANNOUNCED Troy Glaus had been selected most valuable player,
Hudler heard it, and hugged me again while screaming in my ear: "Troy
David, Troy David," and I had done my homework and knew Glaus' middle
name was Edward, and so obviously "the Hud Man" had really lost it.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have a baby," he said, and I told him we had just
hugged, but he wasn't listening. "We know we're going to have a boy
in December, and I'm going to name him Troy, after the MVP, and David
after David Eckstein," he yelled, and I turned in his arms so he
could have the chance to blow out the other ear drum.</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't you check with your wife? I said.</TE>
<TE>   "I might have had some trouble naming him 'Kingfish,' after [Tim]
Salmon, but this one's mine to name," he said, while showing me a
World Series ball from Game 7. "When Troy David arrives, I'm going to
give him this."</TE>
<TE>   In the Hud Man's excitement, I hope one of the nurses catches the
ball when he flips it to the baby.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WHEN THE fans come together again in the Edison Field parking lot
Tuesday to honor their heroes, Hudler will serve as master of
ceremonies -- as it should be -- with broadcasting partner Steve
Physioc, although I fear no one will understand what the Hud Man is
saying in his excitement.</TE>
<TE>   "Mygoodness," he said, and that was after thanking Fox honcho
David Hill for not assigning him TV duty right after the win,
"becausei'llbetooexcited."</TE>
<TE>   Translated: If you attend the Rolling Stones concert here later
this week and catch Mick Jagger going crazy jumping up and down,
that's what you get from Hudler when you say, "Hello, Rex."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BEFORE THE noise sticks, and the red T-shirts appeared here to
spur on the Angels, the most excited guy in this empty place was
Hudler -- night after night. He was the rally monkey long before the
two video kids put the critter on the scoreboard, and the only
mystery at this point is why didn't those two kids put a picture of
the Hud Man up there jumping up and down like a monkey.</TE>
<TE>   "Mygosh,mygosh,mygosh," he gushed, both arms above his head like
Rocky making it to the top of the steps, and I believe for a second
there, he was crying.</TE>
<TE>   "You know when all this started?" he said, and I'm sorry for
jabbing him in the stomach and forcing him to take a breath, but I
wanted to understand what he was saying. "The night before the strike
when the fans here threw the baseballs back onto the field, that
changed everything. They got into it. That didn't happen in any other
stadium that night, and those pictures went back to the player reps
in New York and there was no strike.</TE>
<TE>   "Then it really took off, the fans knowing the Angels really had a
chance to play it out all the way, and they haven't stopped screaming
since."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that also includes Hudler, who will tell you he'd like
to be a credible broadcaster, but knows he's a homer. "Hey, they feed
my family, and I love them," the Hud Man said. "Maybe next year I'll
be credible," and then Jackie Autry held up the Cowboy's hat on
stage, and Hudler turned to mush.</TE>
<TE>   "Mygosh,mygosh ... " he blubbered.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't you dare pick me up again," I said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE TROPHY ceremony took place beyond second base on a stage, and
the Hud Man watched it like a proud parent watching his child
graduate from high school.</TE>
<TE>   The night before he brought his 8-year-old daughter with him to
share in his joy, and now he said, "I'm the luckiest man in the world
to be a part of this."</TE>
<TE>   He has two sons, "Will the Thrill," named for Will Clark, and
"Cade," a 5-year-old Down syndrome child, which motivated Hudler and
his wife, Jennifer, to begin the "Team Up For Down Syndrome"
foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Hudler, of course, calls it "Up Syndrome," because there's no down
about Hudler or anyone around him, which probably explains why so
many of the Angels, support personnel and coaches returned the Hudler
hug with such obvious affection.</TE>
<TE>   "Mygosh,mygosh.... " he said, and I pointed to Bengie Molina as
the Hud Man came charging at me with open arms, and said, "I don't
think you've hugged him yet," and managed to get away with ribs
intact.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE'S TALK the Dodgers might go after free agent Jeff Kent. But
that was Dodger Chairman Bob Daly sitting 10 rows or so up from where
Kent kept striking out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE WALL Street Journal reported Barry Bonds is buying an
$8-million home in Beverly Hills. Only a matter of time, I guess,
before Bonds, Bum Garner, Kevin Brown and I are playing as a foursome
at Bel-Air.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CORRECTION: IT was incorrectly reported here a few days ago that
"The SIMERS Show," also known as "Around the Horn," would debut today
on ESPN and then be canceled by Tuesday. ESPN reports the show has
been delayed a week, presumably because it's no good, leaving the
possibility it might be canceled before making it on air.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers' Daly Pulls for Angels to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was little doubt where Dodger Chairman Bob Daly's allegiances
were Sunday night -- the Brooklyn native was seated two rows behind
the Angel dugout for Game 7 in Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   "I grew up hating the Giants and loving Gene Autry, so for me this
was easy," Daly said of the late Angel owner. "The Angels waited 42
years for a World Series, they have a good team, they've played very
well, and it's been a very, very exciting Series. I've enjoyed it."</LD>
<LD>   The Angels have long been considered a poor stepchild to the
Dodgers in the Southern California market, but while this season
could change their image in the eyes of some fans, Daly doesn't
expect the Angels to cut into the Dodgers' fan base or future ticket
sales.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a pretty big city, and there's certainly room for both
teams," Daly said. "There's so much history with the Dodgers, I'm not
worried."</TE>
<TE>   AND YOU ARE? Spotted entering Edison Field on Sunday night was
Tony Tavares, the former Angel president whose turbulent six-year
tenure as the team's top executive ended when he resigned in January.
The guess here is that Tavares was not on Angel closer Troy
Percival's pass list.</TE>
<TE>   --Mike DiGiovanna</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COMEBACK: Former Angel pitcher Jim Abbott, who threw out the
ceremonial first pitch before Game 7, still lives in Orange County, a
region long apathetic to the Angels but suddenly crazy in love with
its team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's heartwarming," Abbott said. "It's awesome to see the
excitement. It's great for all the guys who have to go to dinners and
all the things required of baseball players in the winter. They'll be
able to hear good things, and they deserve it."</TE>
<TE>   Abbott, 35, who retired in 1999, said he would be interested in
rejoining the Angels, perhaps as a part-time pitching instructor. He
is hesitant to spend too much time away from home, with daughters
ages 5 and 2, but eager to return to the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I think baseball is in my future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Maddon, the Angels' bench coach, caught the pitch from Abbott.
Maddon has been with the Angels since 1975 as a minor league player,
minor league manager, scout, major league coach and three-time major
league interim manager.</TE>
<TE>   --BILL SHAIKIN</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HUSTLE: The Hustle Award for memorable Game 6 goes not to any
players, but to the stadium electricians.</TE>
<TE>   Although the workers refused comment, sources say they set up the
entire celebratory postgame television stage in the Giant clubhouse
in the eighth inning, only to quickly tear it down during the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   BEST EVER? While the Angels' rebound from a five-run deficit in
Game 6 was officially the greatest comeback in an elimination game in
World Series history, you have to wonder....</TE>
<TE>   The previous best comeback was from four runs down, a record held
by two teams, including the 1919 Chicago White Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Considering those were the infamous Black Sox, with several
players allegedly trying to lose the game intentionally, their
comeback from a 4-0 deficit to beat the Cincinnati Reds, 5-4, on Oct.
7, 1919, was impressive indeed.</TE>
<TE>   BILL PLASCHKE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HAPPY DAYS: The Angels' postseason success is a case of Kevin
Uhlich, the club's senior vice president of business, having his cake
and eating it too.</TE>
<TE>   Uhlich celebrated his 45th birthday Oct. 5, the day the Angels
wrapped up their division series victory over the New York Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   His twin boys, Chase and Cody, celebrated their 7th birthday
sitting with their parents and watching the Angels play the Giants in
Game 7 of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   And daughter Katie turns 2 on Wednesday, when the candles figure
to merely enhance her dad's glow.</TE>
<TE>   --ROSS NEWHAN</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOUNDS FAMILIAR: As soon as the Angels wrapped up Game 6 on
Saturday night when the Giants' Rich Aurilia struck out on a Percival
fastball, Fox's Joe Buck said over the wild cheers of the Anaheim
faithful, "We'll see you tomorrow night!"</TE>
<TE>   Eleven years earlier, Jack Buck, also partnered with analyst Tim
McCarver, uttered the same words over a raucous Metrodome crowd as
Minnesota Twin star Kirby Puckett's walk-off home run in the bottom
of the 11th sent the 1991 World Series against the Atlanta Braves to
a decisive Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I knew that if I said it, it wouldn't come out as
well, I thought that, if provided the right opportunity, I'd like to
use my father's line from Game 6 of the '91 Series," said Buck, whose
father died in June. "I was right. Dad's call was better, but I'm
glad I said it. It was a perfect way to end the great game we'd just
seen, and a very special personal moment for myself."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- Kenny Lofton hit a ball that
deflected off John Lackey to Adam Kennedy, who threw him out. Jack
Lazorko would have fielded the ball cleanly. Rich Aurilia struck out,
Bengie Molina throwing to first for the out. Jeff Kent flied to
right. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0 -- David Eckstein walked. Darin Erstad
sacrificed. Tim Salmon walked. Garret Anderson flied to center,
Eckstein was doubled off second, Terrible baserunning by Eckstein,
who seemed to think ball would drop. No runs, no hits, one left.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 1, Angels 0 -- Barry Bonds lined to Eckstein, who,
with an infield shift on, was on the second base side of the infield.
Benito Santiago singled just past a diving Eckstein. Between innings,
Livan Hernandez had a few choice words for plate umpire Jerry
Crawford. Too bad for Livan that Eric Gregg is no longer umpiring.
J.T. Snow singled to right center, Santiago took third. Reggie
Sanders flied to left, Santiago scoring. David Bell struck out. One
run, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Giants 1 -- Troy Glaus struck out. Brad Fullmer
flied to left center. The Edison Field crowd is unbelievably loud.
Doesn't Dusty Baker ever worry that he is going to inhale and choke
on his toothpick? Kids, don't try that at home. Scott Spiezio walked.
Bengie Molina doubled to left center, Spiezio scoring. If the ball
had bounced about six inches higher, it would have been a ground-rule
double and Spiezio would have had to stop at third. Kennedy flied to
center. One run, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 1, Giants 1 -- Pedro Feliz grounded to third.
Lofton grounded to first, unassisted. Aurilia flied to left. No runs,
no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Eckstein singled to left, Bonds
kicked it but not far enough for Eckstein to advance. The U.S. soccer
team could learn a thing or two from Bonds. Erstad singled to left.
Bonds fielded it cleanly! Eckstein to second. Salmon was hit on the
right hand by a pitch. That's gonna leave a mark. Bases are loaded.
Dusty Baker finally makes the call to get someone up in the Giant
bullpen. Why did he wait so long? Anderson cleared the bases with a
double down the right-field line. Glaus was walked intentionally.
Chad Zerbe pitching. Fullmer grounded to short, Glaus was forced at
second. Spiezio grounded to third, Anderson was thrown out at home.
Anderson was ducking and seemed to shy away from any contact. Way to
take one for the team. Molina grounded to second. Three runs, three
hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Kent struck out looking. With the
infield shift on again, Bonds hit a grounder to the left side, Glaus,
the only Angel on the left side, dived for the ball, but was unable
to throw out Bonds, who actually hustled up the first-base line.
Santiago singled to center. Snow flied to center. Sanders flied to
right. Salmon caught the ball two steps in front of the warning
track, and Joe Buck described it as a "popup." No runs, two hits, two
left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Woody from "Toy Story" pitching. No,
that's Kirk Rueter. Kennedy struck out swinging. Eckstein flied to
left. Erstad struck out. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Bell flied to short left center,
Erstad made a great diving catch. If Erstad doesn't win a Gold Glove
this season, they should stop handing out the award. Pedro Feliz
struck out swinging. Why is Feliz in the lineup? Didn't Shawon
Dunston homer last night? Lofton walked. Spiezio saved a bad pickoff
throw to first. Aurilia flied to right. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Salmon grounded to short. Anderson
grounded to first. Pierce Brosnan is at the game. Who better to have
at World Series Game 007? Glaus walked. Fullmer grounded to the
pitcher. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Brendan Donnelly pitching. Nice game
by Lackey. He did his job. Kent grounded to third. Bonds popped to
Eckstein, who again was on the second base side of the infield.
Santiago was behind, 0 and 2, but drew a walk. Nice at-bat. Snow
doubled to right, Santiago to third. Tom Goodwin is batting for
Reggie Sanders. Sanders must be thrilled. Because Goodwin has a much
better chance at hitting the three-run homer. What's Baker thinking?
Goodwin struck out. No runs, one hit, two left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Goodwin to right. Spiezio popped to
short right, Goodwin made the catch. Molina doubled off the
right-field wall. Kennedy grounded to second, Molina to third.
Eckstein hit a line drive that Kent dived and caught. Nice play. No
runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Bell flied out to the left-field
fence. Feliz struck out swinging. Lofton flied to the fence in
right-center. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Ahead in the count 3 and 0, Erstad
went back to his home run swing and grounded to second. Salmon took a
called strike three. The kid from "Malcolm in the Middle" is at the
game. What channel is that on? Anderson flied to center. No runs, no
hits.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Alex Ochoa to right. Francisco
Rodriguez pitching. Aurilia struck out on three pitches. Kent struck
out swinging. Seven pitches, two strikeouts. Bonds walked. Santiago
struck out swinging. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Longtime Angel fan John Travolta is
at the game with Michael Eisner. Christopher Lloyd already has the
"Angels in the Outfield" sequel locked up. Tim Worrell pitching.
Glaus struck out. Fullmer hit a grounder down the first-base line and
Snow made an outstanding diving play and flipped to Worrell covering.
There have been some great defensive plays throughout this Series.
Spiezio popped to third. Only one more inning of Joe Buck and Tim
McCarver. Dry your eyes, America. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Angels 4, Giants 1 -- Troy Percival pitching. Snow singled
to right. Goodwin grounded into a 4-6 force. Goodwin took second on
defensive indifference. Bell walked. Tying run at the plate. Tsuyoshi
Shinjo, batting for Feliz, struck out swinging. Lofton flied to
center. No runs, one hit, two left. As Vin Scully would say, in the
year of the improbable, the impossible has happened. The Angels have
won the World Series.</TE>

<LD>Meet Bengie Molina, power hitter.</LD>
<LD>   The Angel catcher hit two doubles Sunday, his first extra-base
hits of the Series. That also earned him the distinction of becoming
the first catcher with two doubles in a World Series game since
Atlanta's Javy Lopez hit two on Oct. 25, 1995, in Game 4 against
Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him, 'You've been getting down on yourself. Today is going
to be your day,' " batting coach Mickey Hatcher said. "He was mad at
himself. He had a great day."</LD>
<TE>   That he did. But for Molina, individual accomplishments meant
nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "If I look around me and see my teammates celebrating with tears
in their eyes, I know we did a great job," he said. "I just wanted to
be part of this."</TE>
<TE>   Much of his family was part of the celebration.</TE>
<TE>   His wife, Biby, recorded the postgame celebrations on the field
with a camcorder, almost too excited to hold it still. His daughters,
Kyshly and Kelssy, joined their parents on the field, running around
with the children of other players.</TE>
<TE>   His brother, backup catcher Jose, lifted Kyshly and Kelssy off the
ground in bearhugs, laughing and smiling non-stop.</TE>
<TE>   However, both brothers would like to have shared the day with
their father, Benjamin Sr. However, he was busy being inducted into
the Puerto Rican amateur baseball hall of fame Sunday in San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   Bengie and Jose had expected to be able to attend the ceremony,
but the Angels' unexpected postseason success put a crimp in those
plans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was strange," Bengie said. "They were all saying, 'We hope
you're not here.' "</TE>
<TE>   --Helene Elliott</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are the 13th franchise to win the World Series
championship in their first try. They're also the sixth expansion
franchise to win, joining the Mets, Royals, Blue Jays, Marlins and
Diamondbacks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio allowed a Major League Baseball
production crew to film him as he drove to Edison Field on Sunday,
for possible use in the World Series home video. The idea was to
capture a player's thoughts during the long drive to the ballpark for
Game 7, but Spiezio already had moved out of his summer home and into
a hotel adjacent to Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "It's only a two-minute drive," Spiezio said. "I did a U-turn and
drove back, so they could get eight minutes."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The World Series MVP ceremony Sunday was smoother than the one 14
years ago, one that left Hatcher waiting to accept an award he did
not win.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Hatcher starred in the Dodgers' World Series victory,
hitting .368 with two home runs and driving in five runs in the five
games. Network television production assistants dragged him away from
the Dodger celebration, telling him he had won the World Series MVP
award and he needed to accept the award on television immediately.</TE>
<TE>   When he got to the podium, the producers informed him they had
made a mistake. They had meant to send for Orel Hershiser, not
Hatcher. .</TE>

<HD>Anderson Finally Lives Up to Billing</HD>
<DH>Called "Mr. Clutch'' by Angel teammates, he was anything
but that until his decisive three-run double.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was hard to tell who put himself in a position to be trampled
worse Thursday night in Pacific Bell Park -- Darren Baker, the
3-year-old San Francisco Giant batboy nearly flattened near home
plate in Game 5 of the World Series, or Garret Anderson, the
30-year-old Angel left fielder being trashed from coast to coast.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson, many media members thought, dogged it on Kenny Lofton's
foul ball down the line in the second inning, coasting in from left
while hustling shortstop David Eckstein lunged for the ball after a
long sprint, missed it and smashed into the short wall beyond the
third-base dugout.</LD>
<LD>   Two pitches later, Lofton singled to start a three-run rally that
could have been prevented had Anderson made the catch, and the Giants
went on to rout the Angels, 16-4.</LD>
<TE>   The other knock on Anderson: Through five Series games, the player
touted as an American League most-valuable-player candidate, the
Angels' cleanup batter, had pretty much made a mess of things at the
plate, coming to bat with 22 runners on base and driving in only
three of them, with no extra-base hits.</TE>
<TE>   But when the Angels needed him most, when the stakes were highest
in the winner-take-all showdown against the Giants in Game 7 of the
World Series on Sunday night, Anderson came through with a hit he and
his teammates will remember for a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, the bases loaded and no out in the third
inning, Anderson laced a three-run double into the right-field corner
against Giant starter Livan Hernandez, and that was the difference in
the Angels' 4-1 Series-clinching victory before 44,598 in Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never been a guy to let criticism bother him, and that's
what I love about him," Angel batting instructor Mickey Hatcher said.
"I knew if the game came down to a situation where we needed a big
run driven in, he would be the guy.</TE>
<TE>   "We know he was struggling, but we also knew he would be the guy
we wanted up there when we needed the big hit. This guy is great
under pressure. He's been coming through for us all year."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who hit .306 with 29 home runs and 123 runs batted in
during the regular season but only .281 with no homers and six RBIs
in the World Series, basked in the afterglow of the victory and the
Angels' first world championship in the 42-year history of the
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   After the postgame awards ceremony, he took the Series trophy from
teammate Tim Salmon and jogged around the field for a victory lap.</TE>
<TE>   Every time Anderson thrust the trophy into the air, the crowd
responded with a cheer so loud it seemed those F-14s were doing
another fly-over.</TE>
<TE>   "I still can't believe the ringing in my ears," Anderson said. "It
meant a lot to get that hit. Everyone is chipping in, and tonight it
was my turn to chip in.... There's no words to describe this
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   If there were, Anderson wasn't about to reveal them. While his
teammates headed to the clubhouse for a raucous celebration, spraying
each other with champagne and beer, doing Tequila shots and lighting
victory cigars, Anderson retreated to a private room off the
clubhouse, celebrating with his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope he can understand the impact he's had on this team,"
Angel closer Troy Percival said. "Garret has been our MVP all year.
If it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be here. Troy [Glaus] and Tim
[Salmon] and Scott [Spiezio] stepped up in the playoffs, but without
Garret Anderson, we're not here."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants seemed to be pitching around Anderson for much of the
Series, but Anderson wouldn't let them. He's never been one to draw
many walks -- he didn't have one in the World Series -- and for six
games, he swung at too many bad pitches.</TE>
<TE>   But Anderson never panicked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's how he lives," Angel bench coach Joe Maddon said. "If you
showed up at his house, he'd be calm, patient, never in a hurry.
That's how he hits, that's how he plays, and because of that, he's
not going to be uptight or nervous. It's an absolute strong point for
him."</TE>
<TE>   So is a knee-high fastball over the plate. After David Eckstein
and Darin Erstad singled to open the third, Tim Salmon was hit by a
pitch to load the bases. Anderson took Hernandez's first pitch for a
strike and the second for a ball.</TE>
<TE>   The next pitch, Anderson pounced on, lining it past first baseman
J.T. Snow and into the corner, turning a 1-1 game into a 4-1 cushion
that starter John Lackey and relievers Brendan Donnelly, Francisco
Rodriguez and Percival made stand up.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew G.A. was gonna come through big time," Spiezio said,
"because he's Mr. Clutch."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Seattle Mariners have received permission from the Dodgers to
interview bench coach Jim Riggleman Wednesday for their managerial
job, which will officially open today when Lou Piniella is named
manager of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</LD>
<LD>   Riggleman, 49, compiled a 486-598 record in seven years as a big
league manager, two with the San Diego Padres (1993-94) and five with
the Chicago Cubs (1995-99). He spent 2000 as the Cleveland Indians'
third base coach and has been on Dodger Manager Jim Tracy's staff for
the last two seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Among the candidates the Mariners plan to interview, beginning
today, are Seattle bench coach John McLaren, Seattle pitching coach
Bryan Price, Seattle coaching consultant Lee Elia, New York Yankee
third base coach Willie Randolph and Baltimore Oriole bench coach Sam
Perlozzo.</LD>
<TE>   Piniella was released from the final year of his contract with the
Mariners to accept a four-year, $13-million offer to manage near his
home in the Tampa area.</TE>

<TE>   Although Game 6 showed an improvement over Game 5 in the ratings
-- the first time that has happened since 1993 -- the "fast" national
of 11.8 with a 21 share for the Angels' dramatic, come-from-behind
6-5 victory was still below what Game 6 did last year.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's 15-2 victory over the New York Yankees in Game 6 last
year got a 13.4/24. The average rating for the first six games of the
this year's World Series is 10.9/19, 24% below the average for the
first six games of last year's World Series (14.3/24).</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Angels' victory in Game 6 delivered Fox its best
Saturday prime-time rating since Game 6 of the 2001 World Series and
allowed the network to win the night in households for the fifth time
during the six games of this Series.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco posted its highest rating for the Series, and for
the fifth time was the highest-rated market in the country, eclipsing
runner-up Los Angeles by 19% (36.5 vs. 30.6).</TE>

<LD>The score was tied, 1-1, in the bottom of the third, the bases were
loaded and Garret Anderson, who had been relatively quiet in the
World Series, was at the plate. Anderson had had only three RBIs in
the Series, but he equaled that with one swing, hitting a
bases-clearing double to give the Angels a 4-1 lead.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   NOT IN BOX SCORE</LD>
<TE>   The veteran presence of rookies John Lackey and Francisco
Rodriguez. Both were in the minors when the season began and both
were on the mound in Game 7. Lackey pitched out of a couple of jams
and gave the Angels five solid innings, and Rodriguez struck out
three batters in the eighth. You'd never guess they were rookies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   There can be only one letdown on a day the Angels win the World
Series: Gene Autry wasn't alive to see it. Many criticized the late
owner's big-spending habits during the 1980s, but all he wanted was
to give his team the best chance to win. The fact he wasn't here is
the only drawback to a great day for Angel fans.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   When Reggie Sanders fielded Garret Anderson's double, a fan leaned
over and hit him in the back with a noise stick. Those aren't solid
enough to cause any harm, but there is no place for something like
that, and it made Angel fans look bad in a Series in which they were
the best fans in the world. The fan was later escorted from the area.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at age 23, he won the Cy
Young Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 earned-run average, 11 shutouts
and 15 complete games. He was a 20-game winner with Minnesota in
1967. His career record was 128-115. Chance, now a boxing promoter,
is guest analyst for The Times for this World Series.</LD>
<LD>   As the game wore on, I started thinking about all the guys I
played with and all the guys who ever wore the Angel uniform. I
thought about Clyde Wright, Jim Fregosi and Buck Rodgers. I thought
about Albie Pearson, Bobby Knoop and Bobby Grich.</LD>
<LD>   I thought about my dear friend Bo Belinsky, who unfortunately
didn't live to see this. You know, in 1962, when we moved into Dodger
Stadium and were trying to compete with the Dodgers, look at all the
ink he got us.</LD>
<TE>   And, of course, I thought about The Cowboy, Gene Autry. It was so
wonderful of the Angels to pay him tribute all through the playoffs
and to have Mrs. Autry on hand for Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   I remember being at The Cowboy's house in 1962. We were in third
place and he told me, "I don't think we're good enough to win it all.
Not yet."</TE>
<TE>   He was always sure, though, that this day would come.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't sure how good this Angel team was until the Oakland A's
won those 20 games in a row and only picked up two games on the
Angels. Then, I knew they were for real.</TE>
<TE>   But when this Series started, you remember, I predicted the Series
would go seven games. I never doubted the Giants would be tough.</TE>
<TE>   And I never relaxed during Game 7. It wasn't until [Darin] Erstad
caught that final ball that I was able to feel relief.</TE>
<TE>   I give all the credit to [Manager Mike] Scioscia. He pushed the
right buttons. He started [John] Lackey with the idea of getting five
good innings out of him and that's what he did. The key for Lackey
was keeping the ball down.</TE>
<TE>   But the key to the game was bringing the kid [Francisco Rodriguez]
in for the eighth inning. You had the heart of the lineup coming up
for the Giants, all dangerous hitters. Especially Barry Bonds. But I
think the kid had them intimidated. He has a great arm, great stuff
and great confidence. Nobody wants to hit against him.</TE>
<TE>   Then Troy Percival came in for the ninth and he might have been
overthrowing a bit, but he was able to bear down and close them out.
How sweet that had to be for him after all the years he has been with
them.</TE>
<TE>   This is such a boost for the Angels. You know, we were always
second to the Dodgers. They were there first and people got used to
their success.</TE>
<TE>   But now, for Orange County, it's the Angels' day. It's like the
circus came to town for the first time.</TE>

<LD>They said they were going, and with this group they might actually do
it. Minutes after Darin Erstad had safely tucked away Kenny Lofton's
fly ball for the final out of the World Series, Scott Spiezio, Troy
Glaus, Alex Ochoa, Adam Kennedy and Benji Gil were corralled by a
team official and coaxed toward a waiting camera crew.</LD>
<LD>   Cameras rolling, together they shouted, "We're going to
Disneyland!"</LD>
<LD>   It has been done after a championship series before, of course,
but this team is better connected than the rest.</LD>
<TE>   The cameras were rolling for only a couple of seconds, but getting
the shot was quite a production. Disney had a camera, mike and three
producer types on hand just to make sure they got the commercial. And
even then they almost missed it.</TE>
<TE>   Because the airwaves were so clogged with cell phone and
walkie-talkie traffic as the game was about to end, the crew got the
run-around -- literally -- trying to get onto the field.</TE>
<TE>   Through corridors under the stadium, they were rushed from behind
the third base dugout, over to the first base side and back behind
home plate as Troy Percival tried to get the final three outs of the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "Michael [Eisner] is really going to be mad if this doesn't get
done," one said. But even dropping the boss' name wasn't helping with
security.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, they made it, just after the final out. Tim Mead, the
Angels' vice president of communications, said the commercial will
air locally.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the commercial's starring role has gone to the World
Series' MVP, but Anaheim Sports officials decided that if the Angels
won they should include more than one player. "That's been the whole
thing about this season," Mead said. "It's been about the team."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, without an Angel victory, the camera crew would have
been there for nothing. Before the game, Mead was asked what the
plans were for the Disney commercial if the Giants won.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not doing it if the Giants win," he said.</TE>

<KH>GIANT NOTES</KH>
<HD>Baker: No Insult Intended</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Jason Reid, Mike Hiserman, Bill Dwyre and Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the Giants leading, 5-0, in the seventh inning of Game 6 on
Saturday, Manager Dusty Baker gave starting pitcher Russ Ortiz the
game ball when the right-hander was removed with one out and runners
on first and second.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels took that as an insult, figuring the Giants thought
they had already clinched the title. Final score: Angels 6, Giants 5.</LD>
<LD>   "How was I showing them up?" Baker said Sunday. "I don't care what
they like, you know what I'm saying?</LD>
<TE>   "I mean, that wasn't intended for them at all. That was intended
as a gesture straight to Russ Ortiz, a gesture of appreciation. That
was a gesture of thank you to Russ. It had nothing to do with the
Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels weren't even in the equation. Nobody should flatter
themselves they were in this situation. You know what I'm saying? If
they took it the wrong way, I'm sorry. But I'm not sorry that I gave
Russ the ball."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maintaining his stance, owner Peter Magowan said he would deal
with Baker's contract status after the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Baker intimated it might be too late.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody wanted me back," he said, "a lot of times you
wouldn't wait until the last minute to tell them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Baker's employment prospects remained uncertain after Sunday, but
pitching coach Dave Righetti cast an emphatic vote in favor of
Sunday's game not being Baker's finale.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy has meant so much to the city, the area, the last 10
years of managing this ballclub," Righetti said. "He's done a
terrific job. He's brought a lot of spirit. The organization has
definitely prospered because of Dusty Baker.</TE>
<TE>   "If that day comes, which I'm truly honest, I don't know, it would
be very sad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Security at any big sporting event is a concern, especially
post-Sept. 11. But nearly all of the 44,598 mostly deliriously happy
fans behaved themselves Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Four spectators were arrested for trespassing when they were
caught running onto the field after the final out, said John Drum,
the Angels' director of ballpark operations.</TE>
<TE>   "All in all, things went very smoothly," Drum said. He credited a
security force he said was in excess of 400 -- counting the Angels'
regular security, plus reinforcements from Major League Baseball and
the Anaheim Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   The only obvious breech took place in the bottom of the third
inning on Garret Anderson's bases-clearing double into the
right-field corner.</TE>
<TE>   As the Giants' Reggie Sanders scrambled against the fence to
corral the ball, a woman appeared to take a swipe at him with a
noise-maker stick. The woman was not arrested, but she was removed
from the field, security said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if she made contact with the player; she might
have," Drum said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether she did or didn't, what she did was a distraction on a
ball in play. It's a zero tolerance policy on that when it affects
play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Last year's full World Series share was $330,000 per winning
player, and that is expected to rise by about $10,000 each this year.
Players' World Series shares come from the ticket revenue generated
in the first four games. TV revenue is treated separately....The
Giants hit a record 14 home runs in the Series, breaking the previous
mark by two.</TE>

<HD>Giants Lament Missed Chance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their nightmare unfolded Sunday night in red-and-white horror while
the stunned San Francisco Giants wondered about what could have been.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants watched the Angels celebrate their first World Series
championship with a 4-1 victory in Game 7 at Edison Field, completing
a journey that they came within six outs of finishing first 24 hours
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants watched an elated red-clad crowd of 44,598 salute the
Angels as a celebration raged on the field and throughout the stands,
denying them an opportunity to host a similar bash for their equally
long-suffering fans.</LD>
<TE>   And the Giants watched as their dreamed slipped away after the
Angels forced them to play a game they had hoped to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd hate to say that we let it get way but ... it's definitely
painful," right fielder Reggie Sanders said. "We had a great
opportunity to try to shut them down the other day and we weren't
able to do that.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the opportunity to try and start all over and we felt good
about that. We liked our chances and we believed we could do it.</TE>
<TE>   "We really felt good but ... that was a big opportunity we
missed."</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, too big to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants squandered leads of 5-0 and 5-3 in the seventh and
eighth innings of Game 6, losing, 6-5, and stirring clubhouse concern
about providing another break for the opportunistic Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "That was probably the biggest game for us," second baseman Jeff
Kent said. "Was it the toughest? I don't know because we played seven
games and every game you lose is tough.</TE>
<TE>   "But to come here, be up that late in the ballgame and lose it ...
it probably is the toughest. Losing means no shine at all to the
season. We know how to come back after tough losses but ... that was
a big opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The veteran Giants are not the type to panic, having been in tough
spots through their National League pennant run. Manager Dusty Baker
aligned the Series rotation so that right-hander Livan Hernandez
would start Game 7, seemingly giving the Giants an edge.</TE>
<TE>   As a 22-year-old rookie with the Florida Marlins in 1997,
Hernandez was selected the most valuable player of the NL
championship series and World Series. He entered this World Series
6-0 with a 2.84 earned-run average in eight postseason appearances,
becoming one of only five pitchers to win his first six postseason
decisions.</TE>
<TE>   But that guy didn't show up.</TE>
<TE>   After working only 3 2/3 innings in the Angels' 10-4 victory in
Game 3, Hernandez gave up four hits and four runs in two innings in
the decisive game. He had two of the Giants' four losses, a 14.29 ERA
and was outdone Sunday by Angel rookie John Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   Left-hander Kirk Rueter, relatively effective in a Game 4 start,
pitched four scoreless innings in relief of Hernandez. Should a more
rested Rueter have started Game 7?</TE>
<TE>   "We have four starters we trust the same," Kent said. "We felt
just as good about Livan as we would have with Kirk or any of our
other guys, but anything can happen in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Owner Peter Magowan walked through the clubhouse thanking players
for their efforts, fighting back tears as he exchanged handshakes and
hugs.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a game that will break your heart," said Magowan, facing
many major off-season decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "To come as close as we did [Saturday] night is something we're
going to have to live with for quite some time.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll live with it for as long as it will take to get back in
this position and win a World Series.... You have to give the Angels
a lot of credit for their comeback to get to this point, but this
hurts. This could hurt for a long time."</TE>
<TE>   And that's the Giants' biggest nightmare.</TE>

<HD>Minimizing Bonds Was Angels' Secret</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball historians are going to look back at Barry Bonds' numbers in
the 2002 World Series and wonder how the San Francisco Giants lost.</LD>
<LD>   Those who witnessed it would tell them that the Giants lost
because the Angels contained Bonds.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps contained isn't the perfect word for what the Angels did
to Bonds. It's like saying the Christians contained the lions. All
Bonds did in seven games was hit .471 (eight for 17), reach base 21
times in 30 plate appearance and set a record for slugging percentage
(1.294) in a World Series of more than four games. He hit four home
runs -- second in history to Reggie Jackson's five and tied with the
likes of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Duke Snider -- and established
himself as Barry Legend.</LD>
<TE>   "He's not human," Angel hitting coach Mickey Hatcher said before
Sunday night's Game 7 at Edison Field. "I can't imagine anybody
better in the game of baseball, and I don't care if you say Ted
Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have an opportunity to really watch [Williams]. But this
guy is scary. I mean, I'm just amazed.... Every time he walks up to
the plate, he scares everybody. He scares us on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Angel Manager Mike Scioscia wouldn't have been wrong if he had
ordered Bonds intentionally walked every time he came to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   If you believe Hatcher, Scioscia was tempted.</TE>
<TE>   Holding up four fingers, Hatcher said, "Mike's fingers are wanting
to do this. He's trying to hold his hand down all the time -- put
this guy on."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Bonds did not beat the Angels, and he especially did not beat
them when it was most important for him to do so, in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't necessarily begin the World Series intending to
surrender to him, but after he crushed a Jarrod Washburn pitch for a
home run in his first at-bat in Game 1, they learned what virtually
everyone in the National League has known for some time. He said last
week that only the Colorado Rockies challenge him, which proves that
high altitude contributes to lightheadedness.</TE>
<TE>   The only other time that Bonds really damaged the Angels was in
the first inning of Game 5 at San Francisco, when he hit a double to
drive in two runs and put the visitors in a hole that they never
escaped.</TE>
<TE>   Although two runners were on base, Scioscia should have held up
four fingers. That would have loaded the bases with one out, defying
baseball's conventional wisdom, but there is nothing about Bonds at
the plate that is conventional.</TE>
<TE>   He is especially dangerous with men on base, a powerful presence
physically and psychologically. The Angels have the rally monkey, but
the Giants have the rally bear in Bonds. So what if his teammates
don't like him in the clubhouse? They love him with a bat in his
hands.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for the Angels, Bonds didn't bat Sunday night with men
on base. So they pitched to him, knowing that he wasn't going to
overcome their three-run lead with another solo home run.</TE>
<TE>   He led off the second inning by lining out to shortstop David
Eckstein, who was playing on the second base side of the infield as
dictated by the Angels' infield shift. He reached base on an infield
single that was knocked down by third baseman Troy Glaus with one out
in the fourth, but was stranded at second. He popped up with one out
in the sixth. He walked on five pitches with two out in the eighth.
All of his at-bats came against rookie pitchers. He went rather
meekly into the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, Bonds' statistics were more imposing than his impact
on the Series.</TE>
<TE>   His four home runs were all solo shots, and his six RBIs weren't
even the most on his team. Jeff Kent had seven.</TE>
<TE>   And when it was all over, Glaus was the MVP with a .385 batting
average (10 for 26), three home runs, eight RBIs and some sharp
fielding plays that shouldn't be overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is intended as a criticism of Bonds. All anyone has
to do if they want to criticize him is write about his fielding. As
even one Giant fan last week yelled from the left-field bleachers, no
doubt an eyewitness to many a Bonds blunder in the outfield, yelled,
"Barry, try the American League."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, to his credit, met the press after the game at his locker,
which he doesn't always do, even after wins. He was wearing blue
jeans, a multi-colored sweater and a scowl. But at least he was
there. He answered a few questions, congratulated the Angels and
threatened to snap only once.</TE>
<TE>   That, in his book, is cordial.</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked him if he felt as if his last, best chance to win a
World Series might have just slipped away and Bonds refused to
answer, calling it a stupid question.</TE>
<TE>   Someone else asked if he was disappointed because he didn't do
more in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds pointed out that he went one for three with a walk.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't sound like such a bad day," he said. "What do you
want from me--three for three with three home runs?''</TE>
<TE>   All in all, he seemed satisfied with his World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "But it didn't matter," he said. "It just shows you it takes a
team to win. You can't be mad when you're doing your best. I'm
disappointed a little bit. But somebody has to win."</TE>
<TE>   In this case, it was the Angels. They would never be so bold as to
claim they beat Bonds, but they won the World Series because they
didn't allow him to beat them.</TE>

<LD>Kenny Lofton lifted the final pitch high into the Anaheim night, and
who'd have ever thought we'd live to hear this moment?</LD>
<LD>   "Driven into right-center field.... "</LD>
<LD>   Joe Buck is a youngster as network sportscasters go, only 33. This
long and winding trail of tears, which haunted a franchise and
tormented a region for more than four decades, preceded him by nine
years. By the time Buck was born, in April of 1969, the Los Angeles
Angels had already become the California Angels, had already moved to
Anaheim, had already suffered through three 90-loss seasons, had
already seen relief ace Minnie Rojas paralyzed in an automobile
accident and numerous other promising careers curtailed by mishap and
injury.</LD>
<TE>   "Erstad says he has it.... "</TE>
<TE>   By the time Buck landed the lead baseball play-by-play job at Fox,
the Angels had blown the American League championship series three
times, in cruel and unusual fashion, and seemed to be giving their
emotionally battered fans all the time they needed -- are 16 years
enough? -- to brace themselves for another tilt at the postseason
windmill.</TE>
<TE>   The voice that took them the final, unbelievable step was vibrant
and his delivery succinct, marking the moment with four words
Southern Californians long ago assumed they would never hear.</TE>
<TE>   "The Angels! World champions!"</TE>
<TE>   Forty-two years in the aching, and there it was.</TE>
<TE>   Now was that so hard?</TE>
<TE>   The Fox-come-latelys tuning into Sunday's Game 7 from the other
time zones will never have a clue.</TE>
<TE>   Long-suffering local fans might have ground their teeth at the
sight of Disney's Michael Eisner, clad in Angels' "World Champions"
cap and Mickey Mouse t-shirt, taking bows for the success of a team
he has spent the last couple of years trying to unload.</TE>
<TE>   (How come Eisner never makes these appearances at Mighty Duck
games? Someone on the trophy presentation platform should have done
Eisner a favor and directed him to the team's home rink. Hey, Mike,
it's right across the street.)</TE>
<TE>   As Buck mentioned during the eighth inning of the Angels' 4-1
World Series-clinching victory over the San Francisco Giants, Eisner
"is in charge of this Angel team that's for sale. The price is going
up by the minute."</TE>
<TE>   This one belongs to Gene Autry, the team's original owner, who
never made it to the promised land. Fox tried to give Autry, who died
in 1998, his due by rolling out a video tribute to the Singing
Cowboy, accompanied by Autry's trademark "Back In The Saddle Again."
There were several old images of Autry with his players; it's amazing
how he was able to smile through so much pain and disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   It was just the right touch at just the right time ... except Fox,
being Fox, couldn't help itself, and cut away abruptly from the Autry
tribute in order to squeeze in a beer commercial.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it was a tough night for Fox. This matchup between the
archrival Giants and Orange County's Angels had been called the
Dodgers' "Nightmare Series," but what about Fox? Not only did Disney
win it all on Fox's dime and time, but did it with a field manager,
Mike Scioscia, who essentially was fired by Fox. Scioscia, a World
Series-winning catcher with the Dodgers, was a manager in the Dodger
farm system before the Fox-owned franchise gave him his walking
papers after the 1999 season.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia kept walking until he reached Anaheim, and three seasons
later, Fox/Dodger management had to listen Sunday night and bear it.</TE>
<TE>   "After 42 years in the shadow of the Los Angeles Dodgers, the
Anaheim Angels step into the spotlight and win the World Series,"
Buck observed as the Edison Field celebration began.</TE>
<TE>   A few moments later, Buck and partner Tim McCarver rubbed the
Dodgers' noses in it a little deeper.</TE>
<TE>   Buck: "What a tremendous piece of work done by Mike Scioscia. We
mentioned the Angels finished the year last year 41 games out of
first behind Seattle. They battled their way through a tough
September, they got through the Yankees, they got through the Twins.
Finally, in Game 7, they get through the San Francisco Giants."</TE>
<TE>   McCarver: "Mike Scioscia [was] with the Dodgers, leaving the
Dodger organization three years ago. Their loss. The Anaheim Angels'
gain."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, amazingly, the Freeway Series dynamics have changed,
with Big Blue brother now assuming the Angels' long-time task of
playing catch-up.</TE>
<TE>   The growing pains were daunting, almost too much to bear. But now,
at last, Angels know. Life begins at 42.</TE>

<LD>John Lackey, who turned 24 last week, has been a big league pitcher
for 125 days.</LD>
<LD>   Brendan Donnelly, 31, who has been released six times in his
professional career -- mostly by minor league teams, once by an
independent minor league team -- was pitching in Puerto Rico a year
ago.</LD>
<LD>   Francisco Rodriguez, 20, was struggling in double A when this
season began.</LD>
<TE>   On Sunday, when the night was chilly and the atmosphere at a boil,
in Game 7 of the first World Series the Anaheim Angels had played,
three rookie pitchers gave the Angels eight innings of one-run,
five-hit ball.</TE>
<TE>   Three rookies, so different physically, mentally, emotionally, so
different in talent and experience, marched onto the mound, one by
one, energized by Lackey, the one who started. The three were
determined to forget fatigue, ignore nerves, put aside doubt and just
throw it.</TE>
<TE>   Think about this.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time in 93 years that a rookie has won Game 7 of
the World Series, and the Angels pitched three consecutive rookies in
the final game.</TE>
<TE>   What the Angels showed us Sunday night was the ultimate team
approach to pitching. "Oh my God," pitching coach Bud Black said,
"three guys, eight innings, one run. What can I say?</TE>
<TE>   "Frankie's story in itself, he was having a rough year in A ball
at one point. A 31-year-old rookie who everybody gave up on except
himself. Lackey, we knew we'd see him eventually but pitching in the
postseason, in Game 7 of the World Series? I don't think we foresaw
that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year during the final game of the World Series, Donnelly said
he and his teammates in a Puerto Rican league hoped to watch the New
York Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks. But their game went 21
innings, 6 1/2 hours, and the World Series had started.</TE>
<TE>   "I come in to pitch the 21st," Donnelly said, standing with a red
streamer at his feet, "and we've been watching the Series on TV
between innings because they were showing the game on the scoreboard.
But when the pitcher would stand on the rubber, they'd take the game
off the big screen.</TE>
<TE>   "So I figure if I step on the rubber in the 21st, they'll take the
game off. But the Diamondbacks had runners on and I wanted to see how
the game turned out. So I kept my foot off the rubber, just kept it
off until Luis Gonzalez singled to win the game. Then I put my foot
on the rubber. Oh, yeah, and I gave up the game-winning hit."</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly said he had never pictured himself in the World Series,
never thought about what it would be like to come into Game 7.
"Honestly," Donnelly said, "I never thought I'd get here. Maybe in
triple-A but never here."</TE>
<TE>   Lackey, the big, strong hurler from Abilene, Tex., went five
innings and threw 86 pitches while starting on three days of rest for
the first time in his brief major league career. Lackey had always
pictured himself in Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   But not like this, not straining to find his fastball, willing
himself to throw one more pitch, then one more after that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fried," Lackey said.</TE>
<TE>   That's Lackey, always honest, always a straight thinker and
talker, a young man certain of his talent but not cocky or
condescending about it.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, after the Angels had made a miraculous comeback from
5-0 down in the seventh to beat the Giants, 6-5, in Game 6, Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia told Lackey he was starting Game 7.</TE>
<TE>   "I said that's what I wanted to hear," Lackey said. "I slept fine.
There's only so much you can think about. I mean, every game I've
pitched the last two months has been full of pressure. If you don't
want a little pressure, you shouldn't be in the big leagues."</TE>
<TE>   Black said there were two keys to the game -- Lackey getting out
of the second and Lackey getting through the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   "John giving us five meant we could do things the way we had
hoped," Black said.</TE>
<TE>   Black asked Donnelly to give him two innings. He wanted to save
Rodriguez, who had thrown 46 pitches Saturday night, to only be
needed in the eighth. So Donnelly gave Black two innings. "I used the
whole park," Donnelly said.</TE>
<TE>   And then came Frankie, the wide-eyed Rodriguez, the child raised
by grandparents in Caracas, Venezuela, the kid who didn't reach the
big leagues until September, the youngster with the "filthy stuff,"
according to playoff opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine what it's like to be Frankie," Donnelly said,
"because I can't imagine having his talent."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez struck out the side in the eighth. "I am so happy,"
Rodriguez kept saying, repeating the only English words he had at his
command at the time."This means everything," Donnelly said. "I don't
know what this means yet," Lackey said. "I am so happy," Rodriguez
said.</TE>
<TE>   Three men, three rookies, three heads and hearts, one big moment.</TE>

<HD>Jackson: Bonds Among Elite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>--Jason Reid</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, a student of baseball history, has come
to this conclusion: Barry Bonds is better than he thought anyone
could be.</LD>
<LD>   "I haven't seen anybody do what Bonds has done for the last two
years," Jackson said before Game 7 Sunday. "This guy, for me, has
been the most dominant offensive force in 35 years of watching big
league baseball. I mean, 198 base on balls and 403 at-bats. It's
unbelievable to be able to maintain your stroke because you get
frustrated.</LD>
<LD>   "If you don't get a chance to swing the golf club, you can't keep
your swing. If you don't get a chance to shoot the basketball, you
can't keep your stroke. This guy doesn't get a chance to play
sometimes, but he doesn't get frustrated. He has tremendous
management of his mental state."</LD>
<TE>   Jackson was a member of five World Series champions with the
Oakland Athletics and New York Yankees, building his reputation in
showstopping October games. Does Bonds, despite all his
accomplishments, need a World Series title to solidify his position
among the game's legends?</TE>
<TE>   "The media has made it that way," Jackson said. "They'll ding
[Charles] Barkley, they'll ding some of the great players. They'll
ding Ernie Banks, but Ernie Banks is probably recognized as the
greatest shortstop, even though he never won a title.</TE>
<TE>   "The media can play into it, as far as whether they like or don't
like a guy. That does affect what his image is, no doubt about it. If
your last name is not Bonds, he's probably not too concerned about
saying hi to you. But love or hate him, you can't ignore him."</TE>
