<LD>Koi may look like giant goldfish, but they are really members of the
carp family. In Japan, they are called nishikigoi and they've been
part of Japanese culture for hundreds of years. Japanese history is
filled with stories and legends about these brightly colored fish.
The Japanese also breed and show koi in competitions, just like some
people show dogs or horses. Most people, however, enjoy koi for the
beauty they bring to outdoor ponds and gardens.</LD>
<LD>   The average koi grows 2 to 3 feet long and lives 25 to 35 years,
though there have been rare cases of them living more than 200 years.
Koi are strong, hardy fish. They can live in ponds covered with 2
feet of ice or in warm water up to 90 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   The Huntington has kept koi in its japanese garden and lily ponds
for many years. If you watch them as they swim about, you will notice
that some are orange, some white, some red, black or a mix of all
these colors. There are many varieties and each one has its own
Japanese name. Next time you come to the Huntington, see if you can
spot some of these different kinds in the ponds:</LD>
<TE>   * Kohaku: white body with red markings.</TE>
<TE>   * Showa sanke: black body with red and white accents.</TE>
<TE>   * Tancho: red patch on the head only.</TE>
<TE>   * Hikari muji: metallic sheen of a single color.</TE>
<TE>   You might also notice that the koi swim close to where you are
standing and are friendly fish. Some people can feed them out of
their hands. But please don't feed them at the Huntington. Though
they will eat such things as bread, oats and lettuce, they are fed a
daily diet of fish food to provide the proper nutrition for a long,
healthy life. To learn more, visit www.huntington.org. For
information, call (626) 405-2141.</TE>

<LD>* I was teased by my big cousin. He said things about me that weren't
true. The last time he teased me, I got really mad and said something
about him that was true. Then everyone laughed and he stopped. He
didn't say anything again.</LD>
<LD>   --Jonathan, 10</LD>
<LD>   Arlington Heights Elementary</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   * My brother always teases me. One day he took my autograph of
Justin Timberlake. He held it out, then pulled it back. I went to
tell my mom, and she took it away from him.</TE>
<TE>   --Sarah, 9</TE>
<TE>   Butterfield Elementary</TE>
<TE>   Lake Elsinore</TE>
<TE>   * There are two kinds of teasing: 1. playful tease; 2. hurtful
tease. I like to tease people playfully.</TE>
<TE>   --Camille</TE>
<TE>   Granada Elementary</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills</TE>
<TE>   * For hair, face, eyes and braces, people get teased. If somebody
has braces, people who are mean may call him or her "brace face."
Once I took my teddy bear to school, and everybody teased me. My mom
told me not to worry and to try to forget about it.</TE>
<TE>   --Melanie, fourth grade</TE>
<TE>   Fremont Elementary</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   * I have been teased because of my English accent. I am from
England. I got so upset that I called my mom to pick me up from
school, but my mom did not bring me home. Instead, she talked to my
teacher, Mrs. Estin. My mom said that there will be no more teasing
any more because my teacher straightened it out.</TE>

<LD>Ooohhhh! It was dark in that closet, and I didn't like being all
cramped in among the sheets and towels--and I was hungry. Was this
the way to treat a persnickety, pampered, precious cat? No way!</LD>
<LD>   I sat on the top shelf sulking, waiting for someone to find me and
let me out. I couldn't even purr. I was too miserable, and it was all
because of that dog. Life was wonderful before he came along. He
upset everything--that dog.</LD>
<LD>   Mew! Mew! I whimpered, but no one heard me.</LD>
<TE>   Meow! I tried a little louder, but no one answered.</TE>
<TE>   I didn't expect Johnny or that dog to miss me, but I thought Jilly
would be looking for me. Or Mrs. Rogers would notice that I wasn't
napping on the sofa. Or Mr. Rogers would wonder why I wasn't curled
up on his lap as he watched television.</TE>
<TE>   And then I heard Mrs. Rogers ask, "Where's Fluffy?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Mr. Rogers said. "I haven't seen her."</TE>
<TE>   "Mew! I'm here," I cried, but Mrs. Rogers didn't hear me.</TE>
<TE>   And then Jilly started calling me. "Fluffy! Where are you?"</TE>
<TE>   "Meow!" I yelled, but she didn't hear me either.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not on the sofa?" Mrs. Rogers asked.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not under the bed," Jilly said. "Where could she be?"</TE>
<TE>   Then I heard Johnny tell that dog, "We can't find Fluffy. Do you
know where she is, Billy?"</TE>
<TE>   And that dog--do you know what he did? He started barking--that
same noisy arf-ing sound he made when he was chasing me. And it got
louder and louder! He was right outside the closet. Then he started
scratching at the closet door. That dog was trying to tell the
Rogerses that I was locked in.</TE>
<TE>   Will they pay attention to him? I wondered.</TE>
<TE>   Friday: Will they understand what Billy is trying to tell them?</TE>

<LD>I awoke the other morning feeling guilty, and I couldn't remember
why.</LD>
<LD>   It isn't unusual for me to greet the day burdened by vague
feelings of culpability, even when I haven't done anything gross or
disgusting the night before. But this time it was more intense.</LD>
<LD>   Some have suggested that the morning guilt syndrome is due to the
fact that men are always thinking about participating in detestable
acts. I read a Boston University study that said male humans had an
erotic fantasy eight times a day, although it varied according to
one's age and level of creativity. Women had half that number.</LD>
<TE>   Jimmy Carter admitted once that he often lusted in his heart, and
has been praying away the guilt ever since. Other presidents lusted
beyond their abilities to contain it in their hearts and spent a part
of their administration acting out their fantasies.</TE>
<TE>   My feelings of guilt on this particular morning had nothing to do
with erotic thoughts. Lust is always there in a corner of my mind
grinning at me like a hooker in a doorway, but it hadn't emerged for
several days.</TE>
<TE>   I sat on the edge of the bed puzzled by the guilt until I
remembered suddenly what had occurred the evening before. I had hung
up on my sister Emily in Oakland, who prays for me, and later I
hooted and hollered at my daughter Cindy, who lives in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Now neither of them will probably ever talk to me again, much less
pray for me, and it's all because of a bloody basketball game.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not the most dedicated sports fan in the world, but the
playoff Sunday between the Lakers and the Kings had me jumping up and
down and screaming like a maniac in joy, agony and finally in triumph
when our tall people beat their tall people.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of behavior is usually foreign to my nature. I am not
the type to bubble with enthusiasm and, in fact, have a tendency to
regard those who do as suffering from an advanced form of dementia.</TE>
<TE>   I have been known to clap politely for a grand-slam homer at a
Dodgers game and have even murmured "Hear! Hear!" when the Raiders
used to win with 90-yard passes in the final seconds of the fourth
quarter. But scream and cry and bounce off the walls? Only when the
Lakers are in some kind of playoff.</TE>
<TE>   I realize, as I believe Yogi Berra or Dick Nixon once said, that
it ain't over till it's over (or maybe Bill Clinton said it to Monica
Lewinsky), but the Lakers make me wild even in the preliminaries.
When they actually win a championship, I go nuts.</TE>
<TE>   I was in a place on the outskirts of Monterey two years ago when
they actually did win the NBA title. My wife, Cinelli, and I were
traveling north and had stopped at a jock bar with one of those
oversized TV screens because we knew the final game was being played.</TE>
<TE>   I got so crazy when the Lakers won that I knocked over a chair
that knocked over a table that knocked over the beer of a large,
scowling hairy person who was at the end of the domino chain, so to
speak. Thank God, the synaptic message of rage was slow to reach his
brain, and Cinelli dragged me out before he had a chance to react.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, Emily telephoned right in the middle of the overtime
segment. I hollered, "Not now, not now!" before she had much of a
chance to speak, but Emily is as persistent as a tick on a dog and
insisted on saying she'd pray for me during the riots. She was
anticipating that any Lakers win would be followed by the usual
post-victory chaos around Staples, and her prayers would be for my
safety should I be there.</TE>
<TE>   I said, "That's crazy, they're playing in Sacramento, and nobody
ever riots in Sacramento!" and quite rudely cut her off in the middle
of a response. If Emily had called at any other time but during a
game that evoked the emotional fervor of a revival meeting, I'd have
waited patiently while she lectured me on the abundance of evil in
L.A. and told me how worn out she'd become praying for me all these
years.</TE>
<TE>   My frenzy was reflected throughout our quiet neighborhood. I got
home just in time for the final quarter of the game, and as I drove
by other houses I could hear the kind of screaming that usually
accompanies intense forms of torture. Burning straws under the
fingernails and electrodes attached to certain sensitive parts of the
body. That sort of thing. But it was just the Lakers and the Kings
driving everyone bananas.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the game I hardly had the strength to telephone my
daughter, a Kings fan, and leave a cruel and shameful message on her
answering machine, consisting of hooting and jeering. Now I have one
less sister and one less daughter.</TE>
<TE>   I feel guilty, but I'm still grateful for the momentary diversion
brought into my life by a lot of tall guys throwing a ball through a
hoop. The lust that is currently in my heart isn't for sex but for a
third Lakers championship in a row. That's what a game like that will
do to you.</TE>

<LD>AMBASSADOR OF THE DEAD</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Askold Melnyczuk</LD>
<TE>   Counterpoint</TE>
<TE>   266 pages, $25</TE>
<TE>   Askold Melnyczuk's second novel, "Ambassador of the Dead," brings
the dark, fabled world of the Ukraine, with its brooding passions, to
the shiny, optimistic streets of America in a triumph of style and
storytelling. His masterful book begins ominously: The narrator, Nick
Blud, a Boston physician, receives a phone call from Adriana Kruk,
the beautiful mother of his childhood friend Alex, whom he hasn't
seen in years. Adriana summons Nick back to his New Jersey hometown,
telling him she has something urgent to relate. As he sits in her
living room awaiting her revelation, he begins to meditate on his
past: "In different ways I had loved all the Kruks--they were my
little Russian novel, so impulsive and uncontainable, you never knew
if they were going to kiss you or bite you ...."</TE>
<TE>   The same could be said of Melnyczuk's writing. He skillfully
re-creates the post-World War II immigrant neighborhood of Nick's
youth, where Ukrainian families alternately struggle to assimilate
and be true to their heritage. Nick's family is all for the New
World, but the Kruks, led by the mysterious and powerful Adriana,
cling to their past. Though Nick and Alex attempt to blend in to the
American landscape, neither can escape the otherworldliness of
Adriana. She is a country all to herself, the compelling heart of
Melnyczuk's story.</TE>
<TE>   Nick's life ends up taking a very different course from Alex's.
Nick goes to college and makes good, while Alex becomes a tormented
rebel who finds himself in one rehabilitation center after another.
The Kruks, all of them, are a mess. Alex's older brother commits
suicide after serving in Vietnam, while his uncle, Adriana's brother,
is a reclusive drunk who has never gotten over the years he spent in
Stalin's gruesome concentration camps. The father, meanwhile,
adjusted to American life by leaving Adriana for a younger woman,
stranding her with two sons and her emotionally crippled brother.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Nick sees that for all the sorrows the Kruks have endured--and
for all of their idiosyncrasies--they possess a gravitas that his own
family, in their rush for suburban respectability, has forfeited.
"The efficiency of my well-oiled life assures me that each time I use
my ATM card I participate in a ritual older than prayer, so
effortlessly have the technological changes of the last decades
integrated themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "And it is not enough." Even before arriving in America, Adriana's
fate had been a hard one, and we learn of it in a most unexpected
way. One of Adriana's earliest suitors was a poet who was forced to
flee Russia. Eventually he established a respectable literary
reputation for himself in England, but he never got over Adriana.
When Nick and Alex are in their teens, the poet tracks down Adriana
and hands her a story he has written about her called "The Ambassador
of the Dead."</TE>
<TE>   We, along with Adriana, read the story. It is a piece de
resistance, a stunning shift in the novel's tone that takes us back
to the mother country, where Adriana's tribulations--she is raped as
a young girl and many of her friends and family members are executed
or starved in death camps--lead her to resist her losses in an
unusual way:</TE>
<TE>   " ... she forgave the world its failings since she herself had
from an early age moved beyond it, establishing a link to the larger
and infinitely more powerful shadow empire of the dead," Melnyczuk's
poet explains. She has become an ambassador to lost souls, a
preserver of memory, a link to fallen lives.</TE>
<TE>   In the final chapter we return to the scene of the first: Nick, a
prosperous doctor and married man who has seemingly mastered the
trick of assimilation, sits and waits for Adriana to give up her
secret. Whatever she tells him, Nick has become sure of one thing:
"Only heroes spend lifetimes refusing to forget or betray their
homes."</TE>
<TE>   Melnyczuk's "Ambassador of the Dead" is an eloquent meditation on
the human need for a rooted historical perspective. His ambassador,
Adriana, invites comparison to one of the tempestuous Karamazovs.
With her, he has brought the great tradition of Russian literature to
American soil in a transplant that is a work of art.</TE>

<HD>Graduation Recognizes Achievement, Not Race</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The purpose of a college graduation ceremony is to celebrate the
culmination of four years of perseverance, study and sacrifice for
each and every student and his or her family. To hold a separate
public ceremony recognizing a certain racial group is racist and
divisive (Sandy Banks' column "Black Grad Night Is About Pride, Not
Separatism," June 2). I am sure there are plenty of white
disadvantaged students who will be the first in their family to
graduate from college this year. Shall they have a separate ceremony?
Who will define disadvantaged?</LD>
<LD>   A graduation ceremony should highlight the achievement of every
student without dwelling on disadvantages--real or perceived.</LD>

<TE>   Suppressing Infants' Crying Is Not the Answer</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Karp is doing great harm to infants by teaching their parents
how to stop their babies from crying ("He Shushes New Parents' Cry
for Help," May 28). Aletha Solter has studied crying in infants and
children for the last two decades. She has concluded that babies need
to cry to release their prenatal and birth trauma stress. By
distracting infants with swaddling, shhh-ing, sucking, swinging and
side positions, we are only increasing their stress and diminishing
their ability to release it.</TE>
<TE>   Babies who are allowed to cry in a loving, supportive way, in
their mother's arms, are able to deal with their emotions for a
lifetime. The neuroscientist William H. Frey has analyzed the
composition of tears and discovered that they contain stress
hormones. Crying is one of the ways our bodies naturally release
these hormones.</TE>
<TE>   Our culture insists that crying is taboo, a sign of weakness, and
we will do anything to distract babies, children and adults from
doing it because we are so uncomfortable with it. Instead we should
support others when they cry and see how it would benefit all of
society.</TE>

<TE>   The Downside of Over-the-Top Proms</TE>
<TE>   As the parent of a high-school senior, I agree that the modern
prom is overblown (Sandy Banks' column "A Night to Remember, if Only
for the Bills," May 26). True, there is a positive side to kids
working and saving for a special event. But it's more than just the
cost of prom that should concern parents. If seniors haven't become
sexually active by then, they may feel enormous pressure to do so
that night. Too, we are encouraging our kids to assume that a party
can't be special if it isn't a gigantic blowout. Proms have become
the teen equivalent of the Super Bowl, and parents and schools could
do a much better job of educating kids about how expecting perfection
on a grand scale can lead to a huge letdown the morning after.</TE>

<TE>   Truth Is Truth, Even for Icons</TE>
<TE>   I've read with interest books by Wanda Coleman and by Maya
Angelou. I also read Coleman's review of the most recent installment
of Angelou's autobiography (" 'Flung' Into Controversy by Negative
Book Review," May 24). Coleman (who has favorably reviewed earlier
work by Angelou) showed that even an icon like Angelou may wander
away from fact. Coleman backed up her points vividly. What's
happening to Coleman now reminds me of the reception of another
truth-teller: Socrates.</TE>

<LD>The abundance of sleek, upscale interior-design showrooms in West
Hollywood demonstrates how trends go in cycles.</LD>
<LD>   "Originally all the to-the-trade design showrooms were on these
streets, but when the Pacific Design Center opened on Melrose in
1975, a lot of the merchants moved there and left this area almost
empty," says Richard Herb, president of Richard Charles LLC, an
interior design firm that originally had an office at the design
center.</LD>
<LD>   Within the last six or seven years, however, there's been a
flowering of new high-end retail stores in the area, such as Armani
Casa, as well as some to-the-trade showrooms. "Designer traffic
slowed down at the PDC, so many [shop owners] decided to return,"
says Herb, who moved to Beverly Boulevard more than three years ago.</LD>
<TE>   In 1996, local business owners, through a city ordinance,
established the area around Robertson and Beverly boulevards and
Melrose Avenue as a Business Improvement District, calling it the
Avenues of Art and Design.</TE>
<TE>   To promote the area to a largely unaware public, these
entrepreneurs began to hold annual neighborhood open houses featuring
design information as well as food and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The next event takes place Saturday, from 4:30 to 9 p.m. The fifth
annual Art &amp; Design Walk will encompass a half-mile-square area, now
home to 100 antique and contemporary furniture and interior-design
stores, more than 30 art galleries, 40 restaurants and a variety of
other art or design-related businesses, including Heritage Books, the
biggest antiquarian bookshop in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors can begin their tour at any showroom in the
Melrose-Beverly-Robertson area, and the boundaries will be marked by
multicolored banners.</TE>
<TE>   Because these tony establishments generally are patronized
primarily by the design trade and affluent retail clients, the
weekend's open houses should prove an unintimidating opportunity for
the uninitiated to chat with showroom owners and learn about the
latest design trends.</TE>
<TE>   "The showroom owners are interested in people who want to learn
more about design, even if they can't afford to buy a thing," says
Avenues spokesman Alex Stettinski.</TE>
<TE>   And an evening's visit can cover a lot of ground. "You have
diverse showrooms, all in walking distance, with many of them family
or privately owned, as is ours," says Jamie Adler, president of
Phyllis Morris furniture.</TE>
<TE>   All the participating showrooms will hand out programs outlining
special events, with addresses and times, and provide locations of
the five hospitality areas offering free coffee, water and hors
d'oeuvres.</TE>
<TE>   Seven gift packages, valued from $5,000 to $7,000, will be
raffled, with tickets selling for $5 each and proceeds benefiting
P.S. Arts, a nonprofit group that provides arts education to schools
in the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   Shuttle buses will also be available for the tour. Studio Poliform
on Beverly offers high-end contemporary Italian furniture and
accessories, as does Diva, at the corner of Beverly and Robertson,
which will project highlights from the 2002 Salone Internazionale del
Mobile on large screens and show the latest line from American
furniture designer Jeffrey Bernett of B&amp;B Italia.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Charles will have New York designer Susan Unger's home
collection done in couture fabrics, and Phyllis Morris, on Beverly,
will show a new retro modern furniture line called Circa.</TE>
<TE>   Unusual events include Japanese tea ceremonies at Sabi on Melrose,
a Buddha blessing at Silk Roads, also on Melrose, and free
restoration advice on furniture built from 1900 to 1950 at Anne Hauck
Art Deco on Robertson.</TE>
<TE>   Walker &amp; Zanger on Melrose will show "Chairing Styles," an
exhibition of 11 chairs and matching gowns designed by the 2002
graduates of the downtown Fashion Institute of Design &amp;
Merchandising.</TE>
<TE>   Special parking arrangements will make metered street parking in
the area free after 4 p.m., and neighborhood restricted parking won't
be enforced.</TE>
<TE>   Parking also is available in the lot at the Pacific Design Center,
8700 Melrose Ave., and in marked lots at 8899 Beverly Blvd. and 8500
Melrose Ave. For more information, call (310) 289-2534 or www.avenues
artdesign.com.</TE>
<TE>   In 1908, Sylvanus Marston (1883-1946) designed America's first
bungalow court, with 11 one-story Arts and Crafts homes set in a
garden bisected by an automobile driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Marston's work in Pasadena will be the focus of bus tours, "From
Modest to Masterpiece: The Sylvanus Marston Tour,"  on Saturday at 9
a.m. and 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "The tour will emphasize the versatility of this man and his firm,
Marston Van Pelt Maybury, who designed 1,000 structures from 1908 to
the late 1930s," says Kathleen Tuttle, author of "Sylvanus Marston,
Pasadena's Quintessential Architect."</TE>
<TE>   Marston's career ranged from bungalows to French chateaux and
Tudor-style mansions. He is credited as the first to use color on
exterior stucco in Spanish residential design with his pink A.L.
Garford house, built in 1916 in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   "He was distinguished by his rapport with clients," says Tuttle.
"He didn't do signature buildings; instead he gleaned from his
clients their unexpressed wishes."</TE>
<TE>   Marston's firm was best known for designs in the Mediterranean
style, and in the 1920s his were considered by many to be the best
Spanish Colonial Revival examples in Southern California, according
to Tuttle. The tours will include a Marston-designed Mediterranean
house's exterior and gardens, not seen in three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Also on the tour is a radical change of style by Marston--the
Grace Nicholson residence in 1924, done in the Imperial Chinese
Courtyard style, and for the past three decades best known as the
home of the Pacific Asia Museum.</TE>
<TE>   The docent-guided bus tours will feature more than 30
Marston-designed buildings, with three open for interior viewing.</TE>
<TE>   Reservations are required at (626) 441-6333 or at
www.pasadenaheritage.org. Cost is $35 for Pasadena Heritage members,
$40 for nonmembers.</TE>

<HD>Young Aussie's 2nd Orb Sail Is His Canvas for Life</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Saturday morning, Jesse Martin's 54-foot sailboat Kijana eased its
way along Australia's desolate Queensland Coast on the first leg of a
two-year journey around the world. "There's absolutely nothing
there," he said via satellite phone, surveying the island. Martin was
still groggy from sleeping on the couch. Navigational charts and
candy bars littered the kitchen table, he said, and the boat smelled
funky from a mackerel dinner the night before. The next town was
still a day's sail, and food supplies were waning. Breakfast was a
dry biscuit with peanut butter. Dinner was to be some combination of
rice, potatoes, lentils and, with luck, mud crabs. "Everything you're
used to is changed," Martin said. "It's really beautiful, but you
have to get used to that way of life. It's a lot slower.... It's an
adjustment. Even for myself."</LD>
<LD>   This is Martin's second trip circling the globe, but the first
with a crew. The Australian entered the record books in 1999,
becoming, at age 18, the youngest person to sail solo, nonstop and
unassisted around the world. The trip earned him considerable fame
and inspired his book "Lionheart: A Journey of the Human Spirit"
(Allen &amp; Unwin, 2000), released last month in the United States.</LD>
<TE>   Things are different this time around. The adventurer, now 20, is
traveling with his brother Beau and three friends. Their "Journey of
Kijana"--the boat is named for the Swahili word for "young
people"--set sail from Melbourne on March 10. And three months into
the journey, two of the crew members are still taking medication for
seasickness. The group plans many stops as they wind through the
Spice Islands of Indonesia to Sri Lanka, India, Kenya and the Congo
and then on to the Amazon River and South America. "In two weeks'
time, we're on walkabout with a group of Aboriginals," Martin said.
Eventually the crew will head through the Caribbean, the Galapagos
Islands, Ecuador, Chile, Easter Island, Tahiti and Samoa, with a
return to Melbourne set for April 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone helps document the trip with cameras, a journal and a
video camera, posting dispatches on www.jesse martin.net, an
educational Web site that is being used by Australian teachers.
During a recent down period in the trip, Martin flew from New Guinea
to New York for interviews with David Letterman, Carson Daly and
Paula Zahn, among others.</TE>
<TE>   The group's itinerary may be complex, but its underlying goal is
simple. Said Martin, "For us to go out and experience things
firsthand--that's one of the biggest aims."</TE>
<TE>   A Trip to the 'Altar'</TE>
<TE>   The photographers' shouts echoed in the concrete canyon formed by
a towering parking structure and the Arclight Hollywood theater
tucked behind Sunset Boulevard as Jodie Foster entered the scene in a
long, black velvet coat. A crowd of autograph seekers, held back by a
metal gate, appeared to move as one being, with hundreds of arms
extending pens, posters and photographs as Foster breezed past.</TE>
<TE>   The actress was arriving for the Tuesday night premiere of her
latest project, "The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys." She produced the
film and stars as a nun alongside Vincent D'Onofrio, who plays a
priest. "Dangerous Lives," Foster said, "was a very raw and true
depiction" of adolescence. "I know in my life it was a very dark
place at 14," she added, bringing to mind her portrayal of a
prostitute in "Taxi Driver" at age 13.</TE>
<TE>   While the film's title is especially provocative in light of the
sex scandal rocking the Catholic Church, director Peter Care quickly
dismissed any comparisons. "It's so irrelevant to this movie," he
said. But, he noted, the scandal has added "a strange tension" to
scenes that feature the teenage boys alone with their priest.
"Everyone's thinking, 'Is this it? Is he going to touch the boy?' "
Care said.</TE>
<TE>   The film, based on a novel by Chris Fuhrman, is a coming-of-age
tale set in 1970s North Carolina. It tracks the mischief-making of
two 14-year-olds played by Emile Hirsch and Kieran Culkin. The
picture's primary sexual tension is between the characters played by
Hirsch and Jena Malone.</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch has been featured in numerous TV roles, but this film
marked his movie debut, and at the premiere he appeared a bit
scrambled. To one reporter's question, the fast-forwarding
17-year-old replied: "I really felt like a teenager after I did this
film." Malone, meanwhile, spoke adroitly of her character's
precocious ability to embrace her sexuality. "That's hard at 14,"
said the 17-year-old actress, "and it's hard at 30."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>My sister had been in town only a day when she asked about those
purple trees. Did I know what they were called? I couldn't help it.
"Ah, yes," I heard myself say. "The jacarandas."</LD>
<LD>   I'm not the only Angeleno who can't answer a simple question about
those trees without seeming to give the matter undo weight. Later
that same day, my sister mentioned the trees again, this time to a
friend who stopped by. Sure enough, there came the wistful reply.
"Ah, yes," my friend said. "The jacarandas."</LD>
<LD>   We can't help it. Live here long enough and you wear the marks of
having to reconcile the city's conflicting demands on the senses.
L.A. doesn't just force us to adapt. It forces us to be numb and
alert, to tune out its aggravations while catching its whimsical
flashes of beauty. I offer one example: the gorgeous, zany eruption
of bright purple trees throughout the city each spring. The
jacarandas are preposterous, predictable as the tides--and they
always come as a complete surprise. If you've lived here long enough,
you know what I mean.</LD>
<TE>   It's one reason L.A.'s beauty is so hard to explain to the
outsiders who loathe it. Even the Angeleno's affection, like romantic
love in the movies, may take the form of strong repulsion at first.
It's often true that it takes two years of hating L.A. before you
realize you may never leave. At first you don't know how to live
here. You drive too much, live in the wrong place. You see its brutal
surface only. My first two years were like that. I was stunned by the
heat and ugliness. Somewhere along the line, though, those purple
trees penetrated my misery. One day I asked a colleague about them.
There it was--the hint of reflection, the gleam of secret
significance. "Ah, yes," he said. "The jacarandas."</TE>
<TE>   Now I get it. People who have lived in Southern California for
years know it reveals itself bit by bit, and no argument can replace
that process of revelation. Newcomers must see for themselves. We
say: "Ah, yes. The jacarandas." We mean: "Ah. So you noticed."</TE>
<TE>   The jacarandas, of course, are hard to miss. After the haze and
cars, they may have been among the first things I noticed. Maybe that
was before I noticed that the moon sometimes hangs like a big brass
orb over the freeway at dusk, or that bland and shabby housing tracts
hid lovely oak-shaded backyards, or that roses here bloom nearly
year-round, or that on some winter mornings, the San Gabriels are so
clear that you can pick out trees on their flanks. Maybe that was
before I came to recognize the call of a mourning dove, or the scent
of jasmine. Maybe it was before I started wondering if I could grow
my own lemons.</TE>
<TE>   That's how it works. You learn how to live here bit by bit. You
stop driving so much. You find a neighborhood you like, and stay in
it. You get used to waking to the sound of mockingbirds, and it never
again seems so hot and smoggy as it did those first two years. You
notice more, and you start to take the long view--to see how the
scorched hills rejuvenate after a fire, or how they turn green hours
after it rains; how the Santa Anas are hot and dry one year, cold and
dry the next.</TE>
<TE>   Then one day a visitor asks you about those purple trees, and you
can't help it. "Ah, yes," you say. "The jacarandas."</TE>

<DH>In San Gabriel, a tribute to the Tongvas shares green space
with trees and picnic tables.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EMILY YOUNG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These days, a stroll through San Gabriel's oldest public green space
isn't just a walk in the park. Sure, Smith Park has trees, grass and
picnic tables--all the things you'd find in any park in Anyplace,
USA. But what's with the thatched roofs on stilts? The dry stream bed
winding past the barbecue grills? The sea creatures "swimming" across
the lawn?</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to a $3-million improvement project, Smith Park has been
transformed into a unique outdoor setting that combines the usual
recreational amenities with a history lesson on the little-known
Tongva Indians. The Tongvas inhabited the region long before the late
18th century arrival of the Spaniards, who established the San
Gabriel Mission and renamed the indigenous population the
Gabrielinos.</LD>
<LD>   "The city emphasized it really wanted this park to be special, to
have an identity that set it apart," says landscape architect Anna
Armstrong. "We felt the Gabrielino theme was most appropriate because
the site of the park was almost the exact location of Sibangna, the
Indian village that preceded the mission."</LD>
<TE>   At the most fundamental level, a city park is a public place
intended to serve as a refuge from the frenetic pace of urban life.
But the past few years have seen the emergence of a new kind of park
that's more than mere oasis.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no hard data, but we're hearing about more parks being
designed and created to establish a strong sense of place," says Jane
Adams, executive director of the California Park &amp; Recreation Society
in Sacramento. "This kind of design allows communities to distinguish
themselves from others, whether the focus is on a park's natural
geographic features, some historical or cultural significance of the
site or the neighborhood itself."</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, Smith Park isn't the only park to pay tribute to
the Gabrielinos, a tribe that, because of sketchy records, remains
relatively obscure even in the vast Los Angeles Basin where about
15,000 of its ancestors are believed to have lived more than two
centuries ago. Descendants, whose numbers have dwindled to about
2,000, have petitioned for federal recognition as an Indian nation
that, if granted, would translate into health, education, housing and
other benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Heritage Park in Santa Fe Springs, in fact, had already
constructed a historically correct tribal village for educational
purposes. Smith Park fulfilled a different demand. First opened in
the late 1920s on three acres along Broadway a block west of Del Mar
Avenue, the old park had been popular for its numerous sports
facilities. In 1994, city leaders decided to expand it to create a
so-called passive park for picnicking and other family-oriented
activities.</TE>
<TE>   To design the open space, the city hired Armstrong and her
partner, Richard Walker. Their firm, Armstrong &amp; Walker Landscape
Architecture in Monrovia, designed the woodland demonstration garden
at the Arboretum of Los Angeles County in Arcadia and the Hawthorne
Boulevard streetscape in Torrance.</TE>
<TE>   Collaborating with city officials--most notably the Park and
Recreation Department's George Kotchnik (now retired) and Bob
Harris--the designers met with residents to brainstorm possible park
themes. The consensus was that Smith Park should pay homage to the
Gabrielinos.</TE>
<TE>   But as Armstrong and Walker began their research, they hit a snag.
"We realized there was information on the local Indians, but the
emphasis was on their life after the mission was founded," Walker
says. "We thought it was important to communicate what their life was
like before the change."</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about early Gabrielino culture, the designers
consulted Mark Acuna, the cultural liaison of the local
Gabrielino-Tongva Tribal Council, who helped plan the replica village
in Santa Fe Springs. "I realized this had to be much more stylized
than Heritage Park," Acuna says of the need for Smith Park to
function primarily as picnic grounds, not a museum exhibit. "My role
was helping to make sure things were as accurate as possible, even if
it was just a plaque."</TE>
<TE>   The city eventually bought a three-acre parking lot west of the
existing park and eliminated the intervening street to form six
contiguous acres. Then the designers went to work, skillfully weaving
Gabrielino references into the landscape.</TE>
<TE>   They dreamed up those unusual-looking thatched structures as
picnic shelters to echo the true shape of the Gabrielinos' domed
huts. Built of prefab gazebo parts, the shelters form a village along
boulders arranged to suggest the arroyos at the foot of the San
Gabriel Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, cast-concrete dolphins, sea lions and a whale allude to
the Gabrielinos' literal and spiritual connections to the ocean. "The
Indians looked on these animals as holy creatures," Armstrong says.
"We wanted to bring them in as something kids could climb on."</TE>
<TE>   At Acuna's urging, a paved circle etched with Gabrielino
pictographs was incorporated as the park's ceremonial center. The
designers laid out the concrete pad--perfect for tribal dances--like
a giant compass, marking the directions to several long-vanished
settlements as well as a few, such as Azusa and Rancho Cucamonga,
that survived.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a garden of native vegetation prized by the
Gabrielinos, who are permitted to harvest what they need--California
grey rush and deer grass, both materials for basketry; coast live oak
and toyon, whose acorns and berries, respectively, are edible; and
black and white sages, favored for medicinal purposes. "There are
markers for the plants, so if you go there, you can read how they
were used," Walker says.</TE>
<TE>   Working from artifacts provided by Acuna and with assistance from
Jefferson Middle School students, local artist Dixie Giering painted
two large tile murals. One depicts a village scene in Sibangna; the
other is a still life of Gabrielino dishes, tools and clothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Smith Park makeover was completed in 2000, earning a
California Park &amp; Recreation Society award for community park
planning. Since then, it has attracted fans such as Ismael de La O, a
former San Gabriel resident who recently celebrated his daughter's
fifth birthday at the park.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has parties at Griffith Park," de La O says. "But with
the theme dedicated to the Gabrielino Indians and all kinds of
beautiful native plants, this place is something different." Adds
Delbert D. Schrader, a longtime city resident who used to bring his
daughter to play on the old park swings: "I didn't realize why they
named Gabrielino High School the way they did a few years ago," he
says. "But after reading all the plaques, now I do."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps even more significant is what the park has meant to the
Gabrielinos themselves. "Heritage Park is more educational, more
authentic, and Smith Park is more recreational. But in both cases,
we're honored to be recognized," says Chief Anthony Red Blood
Morales, chairman of the Gabrielino-Tongva Tribal Council. "It's
important so people won't forget what was here and that we're still
here. It's a symbol that we're not extinct."</TE>

<HD>He Has a Few Questions for You</HD>
<DH>Modern philosopher turns to Socrates to revive nearly lost
art of public discourse</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The subject was war and morality, and the words "Adolf Hitler" and
"Al Qaeda" hung solemnly in the air at the small Westside
coffeehouse. But the soft-spoken man in black cowboy boots sounded
upbeat as he patiently fired off another question to a room packed
with pensive smiles and furrowed brows.</LD>
<LD>   "What is the difference between defending yourself and going to
war?" Christopher Phillips was quietly asking the dozen people
crowded into the small cafe extension of Dutton's Brentwood Books.
The amiable ambience felt far removed from the take-no-prisoners
screaming matches that today often pass for public discourse--so far
removed, in fact, that the scene might've been occurring in another
time and place.</LD>
<LD>   For Phillips, a 42-year-old former political science major, that
time and place would be Athens in 4th century BC, when another man
known for posing tough questions single-handedly swayed the course of
human thought. Socrates, the founding godfather of Western
philosophy, whose probing dialogues gained immortality through the
writings of Plato, is the inspiration behind Phillips' 6-year-old
Socrates Cafe, an enterprise that, despite its name, has little to do
with bohemian poseurs knocking back ice-blended mochas.</LD>
<TE>   "I think that Americans always go to war to preserve our way of
life. The rest is just ideology. We want to protect that we're a rich
country and we're powerful," says Jai Ying, a former Internet company
worker who's between jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, nodding thoughtfully, slowly steps from his bar stool at
the front of the room. "If someone says, 'I'm going to war to prevent
future 9/11s,' is that just?" he asks, nudging the dialogue in a
slightly different direction.</TE>
<TE>   For a few seconds the room falls silent save for the traffic
whooshing by on San Vicente Boulevard. "You have to be convinced it
is right," one man responds finally. "You also have to be convinced
that it is a last resort, that there is no other way."</TE>
<TE>   In its simplest form, Phillips says, Socrates Cafe is a way of
getting people from various walks of life together to discuss such
perennial brain-twisters as: What is justice? What is a good friend?
What's the difference between destiny and fatalism?</TE>
<TE>   To date, Phillips has orchestrated discussions on these and other
Solomonic topics at nursing homes, maximum-security prisons,
churches, homeless shelters, bookstores and coffeehouses across the
country, gently prodding students, urban professionals,
unreconstructed slackers, street people and others to share their
worldviews and scrutinize their most basic assumptions. In the six
years since he strolled into a Montclair, N.J., cafe and started
rapping about this and that, Phillips has taken part in about 2,000
Socratic sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, Phillips starts things off with some brief remarks,
after which he lets the group choose the topic. Often, these spring
directly from the day's headlines. Once, at a Rhode Island bookstore,
a man said he wanted to understand more about why the Oklahoma City
bomber, Timothy McVeigh, had been put to death. "You could see people
getting very tense," Phillips says, until the group finally settled
on the question: Who owns human life?</TE>
<TE>   While Socrates' more-introspective-than-thou attitude didn't
always play well at the Parthenon--the Athenians finally forced him
to drink hemlock to shut him up--Phillips' respectful, incorrigibly
curious demeanor appears to put people at ease, permitting lively,
free-flowing exchanges. "People ask me, sometimes seriously and
sometimes tongue-in-cheek, if I worry about the same demise" as
Socrates, Phillips says over an early dinner Monday before his
Brentwood engagement. "Being the gadfly is not the most popular
profession."</TE>
<TE>   Popular or not, Phillips, a former journalist whose grandfather
was a Greek immigrant, seems determined to push his concept as far as
it will go in today's culture of grindingly oversimplified debate.</TE>
<TE>   Building on word-of-mouth and last year's publication of "Socrates
Cafe: A Fresh Taste of Philosophy" (W.W. Norton), his chatty
memoir/travelogue/do-it-yourself manual, Phillips has been turning up
in prominent newspapers, magazines and on National Public Radio. His
book has even made it onto a few high school and college syllabuses.
His illustrated children's book, "The Philosophers' Club" (Ten Speed
Press, 2001), is also selling well.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Phillips has been taking his act to such places
as South Korea, Japan, Europe, Mexico City and the southern Mexican
states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, where he and his Mexican-born wife,
Cecilia, held a Socrates Cafe with members of the region's
impoverished indigenous communities. "There were soldiers with guns
looking at us like we were crazy," Phillips says.</TE>
<TE>   If challenging received wisdom can be a precarious occupation,
Phillips believes it's as necessary now as it ever was. America, he
thinks, is politically and spiritually adrift, a condition not unlike
that facing Greece in the time of Socrates. Though he's scrupulous in
keeping his views to himself during cafe meetings, he's less guarded
in private.</TE>
<TE>   "I see my beloved democracy just a shell of what it was," he says,
suddenly flashing his gray-green eyes like a wrathful Olympian. "I'm
trying to hold dialogues with people to recapture a democracy that is
on the wane. People don't realize that even the greatest
civilizations have a shelf life. I don't think most people realize
what an advanced state of decadence we're in."</TE>
<TE>   Even while Socrates was upending the status quo and offering new
ways of thinking, Phillips says, much of the rest of the Athenian
populace (minus women and slaves) was indulging in "rampant
sophism"--shallow, pseudo-sophisticated reasoning that bred political
apathy. Today, Phillips believes, a similar ethos has infiltrated the
"knockdown, drag-out kind of debate" that thrives on TV talk shows,
abetting a meltdown in civic participation.</TE>
<TE>   "The [Athenian] powers that be would rather stay corrupt and let
that seal their doom, which it did, rather than let someone usurp
their powers," Phillips intones darkly over the remains of his
Souplantation salad. The moment passes, and Phillips returns to being
an easygoing, mildly self-deprecating bookworm who likes to hold
hands while walking with his wife and still speaks with a trace of
the mellifluous Tidewater accent of his native Newport News, Va.</TE>
<TE>   "You're asking my opinions now, and I'm very strident in my
opinions," he says a few minutes later. His hope, he explains, is
that Socrates Cafe will not only help participants clarify their
thinking and become more open to diverse ideas, but translate their
convictions into action. Hey, wasn't it another ancient rogue
thinker, Karl Marx, who said the point of philosophy wasn't just to
interpret the world but to change it?</TE>
<TE>   Cecilia Phillips, 29, who shares many of her spouse's intellectual
passions, says that her husband has grown "much more tolerant toward
other perspectives" in the six years they've been together. "He's
really trying to learn from others, their perspective," she says. "I
think he has a much deeper social consciousness."</TE>
<TE>   For a man with three master's degrees--in natural sciences,
education and the humanities--Phillips much prefers to take
philosophy out of the ivory tower and into the street. He says the
ontological bug first bit him when his mother gave him a volume of
Plato.</TE>
<TE>   Born and raised in a West Virginia coal-mining camp, Phillips'
mother was an independent thinker and the only member of her family
to break with the Jehovah's Witnesses faith, says her son. "We used
to go to the country store and she just loved to hear people's
stories. And that's why I became a journalist, a feature writer, is
because I love to hear people's stories."</TE>
<TE>   Once he began writing for Reader's Digest and Parade magazines, he
found himself drawn to stories about "unsung heroes, people making a
difference. I realized I wanted to be part of that tradition."</TE>
<TE>   It took a few more crucial life transitions before he made the
leap. When Phillips started Socrates Cafe, his first marriage was
breaking up. One of his best friends recently had committed suicide.
"It just exploded all these self-imposed obstacles," he says. "I
didn't like my life and I didn't like me that much. I asked myself:
What sublime risks am I willing to take?"</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately for Phillips, one of the first people to turn up at a
Socrates Cafe, on a night when no one else came, was Cecilia. The
question she and Phillips decided to address: What is love?</TE>
<TE>   The first years, Phillips says, were a struggle. The couple were
living off Cecilia's teacher's salary, bouncing to different
addresses, driving a 1985 Chevy Nova with three working gears and
falling thousands of dollars into debt.</TE>
<TE>   But with the royalties from his book sales, they've steadily been
able to work themselves out of that hole and are now virtually
debt-free, living cheaply on a combined annual income of less than
$20,000. Phillips also is founder of the nonprofit Society for
Philosophical Inquiry (www.philospher.org), which now has about 200
members.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to have a house, yes, we would like to have kids,
yes," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an eternal optimist," he says. "I really think some eccentric
billionaire is going to see this thing has legs and isn't just a
fad."</TE>
<TE>   Cecilia, who has been keeping track of the time, signals her
husband that it's time to leave the restaurant and head over to
Dutton's. It's one of those perfect summer evenings, cool and serene,
and the small gathering, mixed by age, sex, ethnicity and occupation,
has arrived in a talkative mood.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, many Socrates Cafes have pondered variations on
questions about war, terrorism and how justice is served. This night
is no exception.</TE>
<TE>   Blake Gardner, a young man with a brown bandanna around his head,
who plans to set up his own Socrates Cafe, proposes the group discuss
when is it just to go to war. The others agree, and the conversation
is off and running for the next hour and 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips plays the role of conductor, stepping in when he senses a
line of thought has petered out and frequently asking speakers to
define their terms or flesh out their ideas. Cecilia, furiously
scribbling away on a notepad, keeps track of the dialogue's ebbs and
flows and jumps in once or twice with a comment.</TE>
<TE>   As the evening breaks up, Eric Vollmer, an arts and grant
consultant, says he was "surprised and sort of delighted with the
level of conversation. The skill that [Phillips] has is quite
remarkable."</TE>
<TE>   And what will Phillips take away from the evening? Most likely,
the same thing he always does. "The one great lesson I've learned is
that people can change," he says. "Most people never do. And it
starts with somebody taking the time to talk to 'em."</TE>

<LD>   A divine cast, headed by Ellen Burstyn, Sandra Bullock, Ashley
Judd, Maggie Smith and James Garner, is among the highlights of
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," Callie Khouri's adaptation
of Rebecca Wells' best-selling novel. Khouri, an Oscar-winning
screenwriter for "Thelma &amp; Louise," makes her feature directing debut
with this ensemble comedy-drama about a close-knit group of friends
who intervene to show a young playwright the many joys of her
Southern roots.</LD>
<LD>   "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," rated PG-13 for mature
thematic elements, language and brief sensuality, opens Friday in
general release.</LD>
<TE>   9pm Dance</TE>
<TE>   The annual City of Los Angeles (C.O.L.A.) Performing Arts series
once again takes over the L.A. Theatre Center for two weekends of
provocative work. Performance artist Tim Miller kicks off the series
at 8 p.m. in Theatre 1 with "Us," but the dance action begins an hour
later in Theatre 3, when choreographer Hae Kyung Lee premieres
"Silent Flight II," a collaboration with composer Steve Moshier. A
week later, C.O.L.A. programs a dance doubleheader: Victoria Marks'
"What Happened" (music by Amy Denio) and "July Gone" (music by Joe
City Garcia) in Theatre 1 at 8 p.m., followed by Sophiline Cheam
Shapiro's "The Glass Box" in Theatre 3 at 9. Miller, Lee, Marks and
Shapiro were each given $10,000 grants by the city's Cultural Affairs
Department to honor their achievements and support the creation of
new work.</TE>

"King of the Moon," Tom Dudzick's stand-alone sequel to his popular
comedy, "Over the Tavern." For the Polish-Catholic Pazinski clan of
Buffalo, N.Y., it is 10 years later and, in the shadow of the 1969
Apollo II lunar landing, all the family members--from the son, who's
AWOL from the seminary, to the family matriarch, who's being wooed by
her late husband's best friend--are trying to adjust to a changing
world.</TE>

museums in her lifetime: LACMA, the Met and the Art Institute of
Chicago among others. Next up: Pasadena's Norton Simon Museum.
"Sister Wendy at the Norton Simon Museum of Art," an hourlong film
premiering Friday, will bring the museum's collection alive with
Beckett's storytelling style and wit. The museum's collection offers
a wealth of story opportunities too, with its mix of Old Master,
Impressionist, modern and Asian art masterpieces by artists such as
Raphael, Degas and Picasso.</TE>
<TE>   "Sister Wendy at the Norton Simon Museum," 6-9 p.m. at the Norton
Simon Museum, 411 W. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena. Admission to the

<TE>   9pm Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Returning to its roots as a basic rock band on its new album after
some experimental byways, Los Lobos celebrate the joys of community
and confront their loss with the range and eloquence that's made them
one of L.A.'s musical treasures. Marking this week's release of "Good
Morning Aztlan," Lobos shares a bill with Quetzal, a band widely seen
as their heir apparent.</TE>

ones, Dan Zanes is the artist of choice. The former Del Fuegos lead
singer has traded in his rock band for a kids show, but that doesn't
mean he's left the good beats behind. Already a preschool hit on the
East Coast, he's in town with his "Dan Zanes &amp; The Rocket Ship
Revue," featuring folk songs, his original pieces and sing-along
tunes from his family recordings, "Rocket Ship Beach" and "Family
Dance."</TE>

Ethel Merman, Dan Dailey, Marilyn Monroe, Donald O'Connor, Mitzi
Gaynor and poor, old Johnnie Ray serve Berlin's tunes to great

nine operas, returns courtesy of Long Beach Opera in two performances
this month. Lisa Willson performs the title role, and Katherine

loyalty. Andreas Mitisek conducts the 1903 work; Isabel Milenski is
stage director; and the evocative set design is by Darcy Scanlin.</LD>

survey of the L.A. native's unusual sculpture and drawings from the
1950s to 1981. The exhibition includes about 100 sculptures and 20
works on paper, as well as works never before seen in public, such as
11 of the artist's sketchbooks and works made as gifts for family and
friends.</TE>

<TE>   You may have read of his exploits or seen the recent TV or Imax
dramatization of his survival saga, but nothing can bring you closer
to Sir Ernest Shackleton's ill-fated attempt to be the first to walk
across Antarctica than "Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic
Expedition." More than 150 photographs taken by the expedition's
photographer, Frank Hurley, chronologically document the harrowing 22
months. The ship got trapped in ice, then sank, stranding the 27 crew
members for months in the frozen Antarctic. And if you start to feel
warm, remember this: When the ship sank, Hurley dove into frigid
waters to retrieve his glass-plate negatives, from which these photos
were printed.</TE>

<TE>   One of the most visible and popular companies on the local scene
before suffering debilitating crises of funding and leadership, AMAN
International Music and Dance celebrates its rebirth with a program
titled, appropriately enough, "Remade in America." Expect the company
and guests to depict the passing down of traditions from generation
to generation, and place to place, through suites derived from the
cultures of Appalachia, Hungary, Russia, South Africa, Cuba and
India. The question lingering over the engagement, though, will be
whether AMAN's own 38-year-tradition has been handed down.</TE>

<HD>Spinning the Night Away</HD>
<DH>Take it from touring DJs: L.A. is the best city for
electronic music</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD>Steve Baltin is a Los Angeles-based freelancer covering
the electronic music scene and frequent Calendar contributor.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The party at Spundae was clocking in somewhere between full tilt and
overdrive as roughly 2,000 dancers--hands waving, limbs
gyrating--packed L.A.'s biggest "superclub," which gets underway at
Hollywood's Circus Disco every Saturday night. For the beautiful
people there, the attraction was Chris Fortier, a DJ from Orlando,
Fla., making a rare L.A. appearance. It's a racially diverse crowd,
mostly in their 20s but ranging into the 50s, and those who've made
it inside are grooving under green laser lights, a giant disco ball
and the shadows of the club's go-go dancers.</LD>
<LD>   Fortier's particular sound--one of several that exist under the
electronic music umbrella--weaves together the futuristic,
synthesizer-heavy hooks of the genre known as trance with world-music
beats and warm grooves. Though he doesn't get behind the decks--a
high-tech combination of two turntables and mixing equipment--until
1:30 a.m., the room is still jumping. A new wave of dancers comes
through the door as word of the headliner's arrival makes it to the
patio, where there's everything from food, drink and free fruit to
massages. Last call at the bar may be at 2 a.m., but the party will
be going until 4, and even later for those who hit the after-hours
spots.</LD>
<TE>   But this is about more than one night, one DJ and 2,000 fans. Los
Angeles has emerged as the premier site for electronic dance music
with DJs from around the world making tracks here to play. Fueling
the trend are the local superclubs, which surfaced as an evolutionary
tributary of the rave scene. Put simply, as ravers grew older, they
still wanted the music, but not always in a field with 30,000 other
fans. Promoters here brought the scene indoors, and according to many
of the top DJs there is no other city in the world offering as many
venues showcasing the genre's wide range of sounds and artists--from
electronica's elite to raw unknowns.</TE>
<TE>   "People often imagine New York, London or Ibiza are the clubbing
capitals of the world," says Los Angeles-based trance DJ Christopher
Lawrence, who has played clubs around the world. "Los Angeles blows
the rest of them away, just by the sheer number of people that live
here and go out, along with the energy in this city and the quality
of the events."</TE>
<TE>   Fortier says later he's here now because "L.A. is exciting and I
love playing here. The crowds are receptive and really ready for the
party."</TE>
<TE>   That's a statement the close-knit international dance world would
have once laughed at. A thriving scene required a booming club
culture, something L.A., with its traditional shutdown at 2 in the
morning, simply couldn't provide. But no one's laughing now.</TE>
<TE>   What turned things around? You can start with a boom of home-grown
DJ and performing talent and the lure of Hollywood for the many DJs
and producers who are discovering the big payouts in soundtrack and
score work. There's a club culture that offers dance music seven
nights a week and enthusiastic, free-spending crowds, all of it
monitored and supported by such radio shows as "Metropolis" and
"Chocolate City" on KCRW-FM (89.9).</TE>
<TE>   There are DJ-friendly vinyl record shops including D.M.C., Wax and
Beat Nonstop, locally based national electronic magazines such as
Lotus and Urb, and high-profile events, from the annual Coachella
Festival to the New Year's Eve 2001 parties on Hollywood Boulevard
and at the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. has not held such a prominent spot in the music world since
the '80s hair band days," says William Bensussen, a lawyer and
frequent club-goer. "It's good to establish our city's place in the
'scene.' It's really a great time musically for this city."</TE>
<TE>   It all adds up: In the dance world, L.A. is breaking new ground on
a global scale.</TE>
<TE>   Though the explosion of the club scene is a relatively new
phenomenon, L.A. as a dance music mecca is not. In the late '80s and
early '90s, the city's warehouse movement was burgeoning.
Underground--sometimes illegal--raves drew hundreds, if not
thousands, of mostly teenage and college-age fans. The scene unfolded
downtown and in Orange County warehouses, hotels and office
buildings, where fans could check out up-and-coming DJs spinning the
newest music from overseas and such U.S. electronic hotspots as
Chicago and Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Levy, president of the Los Angeles-based record label
Moonshine Music, was one of the early leaders of that scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Back then, when we were doing Truth at the Park Plaza, we had a
couple of thousand people showing up every Saturday," says Levy,
whose label helped break acts like Lawrence and DJ Dan. "It was the
beginning for the whole country; it was happening in L.A. and New
York and that's it."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas New York, thanks in large part to the legendary nightclub
Twilo, went on to become the club capital of the U.S., L.A.'s weather
and its ability to draw fans from Las Vegas, Arizona, San Francisco
and beyond made the city the festival center.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially legal raves that were more organized and better
promoted, such events as Nocturnal Wonderland, Electric Daisy
Carnival and eventually Coachella, attracted tens of thousands of
fans to Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The lure of playing before 30,000 people was something the top
international DJs, including England's Paul Oakenfold and Germany's
Paul Van Dyk, could not ignore. Only such major European festivals as
Creamfields were able to offer similar numbers.</TE>
<TE>   One person who watched the growing numbers coming to festivals was
Dave Dean, a transplanted electronic music fan and promoter from San
Francisco. He believed that if festivals could draw those numbers,
there was no reason why fans wouldn't support a permanent residence
for top-name DJs.</TE>
<TE>   When Dean opened Giant in January 2000, L.A. had its first
superclub, a venue that could accommodate thousands of dance music
devotees. And the rest of the world began to take notice. British DJ
Sasha, who with John Digweed forms the most successful DJ duo in the
world, Sasha &amp; Digweed, credits Giant with helping the L.A. scene
take shape.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last two or three years, a lot of promoters have started
to move in L.A. and are doing great things. It all started to come
together with Giant opening," Sasha says.</TE>
<TE>   "There has always been a very strong rave and large-event scene in
L.A. It was just a matter of getting it into a club environment,"
says Dean, who was primarily responsible for putting together the
first New Year's Eve event on Hollywood Boulevard two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Though many have been caught off guard by the scene's expansion,
those in the industry say the popularity of Giant (which is now
putting on sporadic events until it moves into a new, permanent venue
in Hollywood before the end of the year) and Spundae was a natural
evolution from the warehouse parties of a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got people who started going out to raves 10 years ago who
are now in their late 20s and 30s, and they don't want to drive two
hours to an event," says Lawrence. "So you've got people that are
just as passionate and educated about the music but want to go to an
environment that they can feel a bit more comfortable in with people
of a similar age."</TE>
<TE>   The appeal of electronic music to listeners in their 20s and 30s
is not limited to alumni of the rave scene. Thanks to mainstream
media such as commercials (the popular Mitsubishi ad that features
the English band Dirty Vegas) and films ("Tomb Raider" and "Blade"
are just two of the several recent films that utilized electronic
acts on their soundtracks), more people are discovering the music
than ever before.</TE>
<TE>   There are downsides--with popularity come poseurs, and many
festivals are starting to become places to be seen, as opposed to the
places to dance and hear music. And there is still the widespread
perception that dance music is synonymous with Ecstasy. While that
designer drug is still a part of the club and rave scene, it's not
nearly as prevalent as some mainstream media outlets would lead one
to believe. There are usually no more people on "X" at a rave or club
than there are fans on pot at rock concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the old law of supply and demand. Ticket prices,
which have been well below those of rock concerts, are starting to
rise. Upcoming Mayan Theatre shows by DJ Shadow on Wednesday ($27.50)
and Oakenfold on June 17 ($32 and $35) are in the standard range, but
when Sasha &amp; Digweed came to the Mayan in November, the cost was a
then unheard-of $53 a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   While there has been nothing as dramatic as the electronic
revolution predicted in the late '90s when the Prodigy was supposed
to become the next Nirvana, the growing popularity is having an
effect throughout the Southland. Dancers no longer need to go to
Hollywood on a Saturday night to get their groove on.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic music can be found on Thursday nights in Santa Monica
at Bossanova, Saturdays in Echo Park at the Echo (for more
down-tempo, or slower, dance music), and Mondays at Las Palmas Supper
Club, site of the Monday Night Social, which just celebrated its
sixth anniversary. Even venerable L.A. institutions such as Yamashiro
restaurant, primarily known for its sushi, have started dance nights.</TE>
<TE>   "It's encouraging to see other clubs open their doors to it," says
Gene La Pietra, the proprietor of Circus.</TE>
<TE>   Electronic music may still be the underground to many, but its
growing acceptance is leaving room for the genre to sprout its own
culture and underground.</TE>
<TE>   There are, for example, clear distinctions between the various
styles under the electronic umbrella. While trance and house,
popularized by the likes of Oakenfold and Derrick Carter,
respectively, are the big draws in the superclubs, the more cerebral
electronic music played by Aphex Twin, Autechre et al is finding a
place as the counterculture scene.</TE>
<TE>   In that sense, electronic music is no different from rock, which
went on to spawn punk, heavy metal, grunge and other offshoots. Dave
Sanford sees that trend only becoming stronger over time. Sanford's
Spectre Entertainment produces some of the alternative nights held at
smaller clubs or unusual venues featuring experimental live acts and
DJs."The thing that's really been growing in L.A. is the more
fringe-oriented element," Sanford says. "As Giant and Spundae become
more the mainstream thing ... to me the alternative thing to do on a
Saturday night is to go to the Echo or go downtown to the Central
City Cafe."</TE>
<TE>   L.A. is also enjoying a surge of home-grown talent to join an
already impressive list that includes DJ Dan, Lawrence, the Crystal
Method, Cirrus, Sandra Collins and more. Lawrence walks away at every
local show he does with dozens of homemade CDs, from people working
in their bedrooms, that he says are on par with anything being done
around the world. And Levy has seen the effect of underground DJs and
producers moving into L.A., spurring "a creative streak from an
electronic music standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   For fans, it's a simpler equation: As Gena Nason, a marketing
manager who frequents the scenes, says, "It really comes down to
who's playing. If it's not someone I'm interested in, I'm not going
to go, unless the place has a comfortable vibe.</TE>
<TE>   "A big part of the experience is being able to be close to the DJ
and actually watching them get into it, to see the records they pick,
watch them spin."</TE>
<TE>   Though Angelenos are always eager to rush out and see imported
acts, the L.A. electronic scene rivals the city's hard-rock movement
of the late '80s or the punk days of X and friends in the late
'70s-early '80s. And even if it's not always recognized locally, the
rest of the world, including superstar DJ Van Dyk, has taken notice.</TE>
<TE>   "In the whole L.A. area there have been a lot of very influential
American DJs like Christopher Lawrence, Taylor, Sandra Collins, and
they played a big part in the whole movement," says Van Dyk, who
makes a rare L.A. club appearance at Giant on June 15.</TE>
<TE>   Before last winter's big New Year's Eve shows DJ Irene was
preparing for her stint on the podium on Hollywood Boulevard, where
she'd be spinning records for thousands of revelers literally dancing
in the street. The colorful performer was asked what it meant to be
sharing a stage in L.A. with such international stars as Oakenfold
and Deep Dish.</TE>
<TE>   "It means recognition," she said. "That these acts are coming to
my hometown on the biggest night of the year means respect,
recognition."</TE>

<LD>No. 1 Moby's "Everything Is Wrong" (1995)</LD>
<LD>   This doesn't include Moby's rave anthem "Go," but its variety
makes it impossible to ignore. From punk to house to the ethereal,
"Everything Is Wrong" is that rare work that weaves an array of
styles into a comprehensive soundscape.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   No. 2 DJ Shadow's "Entroducing" (1996)</TE>
<TE>   Like "Everything Is Wrong," "Entroducing" was so advanced for its
time that its full influence has yet to be realized. But the mix of
hip-hop, turntablism and ambient sounds makes it one of the must
records of the genre.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Portishead's "Dummy" (1994)</TE>
<TE>   The effect of this gorgeous, haunting collection was obvious, as a
wave of female-fronted electronic acts came out of the woodwork after
its surprise success. No other work quite matched the beauty or heart
of "Dummy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Paul Oakenfold,</TE>
<TE>   "Perfecto Presents Another World" (2000)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the consummate mix collection, this two-CD set finds the
English DJ taking listeners on an amazing journey through classic
rock, trance, house and big beats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No.5 Chemical Brothers, "Dig Your Own Hole" (1997)</TE>
<TE>   The Prodigy's "Fat of the Land" was the album that debuted at No.
1, but "Dig Your Own Hole" is the one that over time has set the
standard for break beats and big beats.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 1 Roger Sanchez</LD>
<LD>   Though born in New York, Sanchez found greater appreciation
abroad. His most recent work, "First Contact," achieved hit status in
Europe before being released stateside, but his blistering house sets
and production work make him one of the stalwarts.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   No. 2 Juan Atkins</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit native was instrumental in jump-starting the Detroit
scene that essentially gave birth to techno in the U.S. His work in
techno and house, two of the music's major subgenres, is still
influencing acts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 3 Deep Dish</TE>
<TE>   The Washington, D.C.-based duo is known more for its remixes, but
its live DJ sets are as good as any on the scene. The importance of
its work with 'N Sync, Madonna and Dido can't be underestimated in
terms of bringing mainstream attention to dance music.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 Carl Cox</TE>
<TE>   The legendary British DJ may be the best live technician in the
world. His impressive dexterity and boisterous personality make his
sets seem so easy, but the skill behind them is remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 5 Sasha</TE>
<TE>   Like Cox, this Brit shines in the live setting. In fact, he may be
Cox's closest competitor. And his use of world-flavored beats and
huge, rising synthesizers has been instrumental in making the live DJ
set more accessible to large audiences.</TE>

<LD>Thursday Lo.cal at Yamashiro</LD>
<LD>   One of the great settings in L.A., with a lovely garden and a
fabulous view of the city, the Hollywood landmark is a perfect spot
for this new night, with Tony Watson among the DJs creating the
smooth vibe. It will need to establish an identity over time. 10
p.m.-2 a.m. 21 and older. $5-$10. Yamashiro, 1999 N. Sycamore Ave.,
Hollywood, (323) 850-8662. Tonight only, special event at Boardner's,
1652 N. Cherokee Ave., Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Friday Red at Arena</TE>
<TE>   Now that Spundae at Circus has taken over Saturday night, this
club attempts to revolutionize Friday night. The early returns are
promising. A recent set by Christopher Lawrence had fans lined up
around the block. Of course, if you really want to get in, that's not
always a good thing. 9 p.m.-4 a.m. 21 and older. $10-$20. 6655 Santa
Monica Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 692-3533. www.nexxez.com</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Saturday Spundae at Circus Disco</TE>
<TE>   The biggest and baddest continue to bring in the top names every
weekend. The downside to their success, particularly at Spundae, is
that as the hype grows, some of the purity is being compromised, and
what was once all about the music is threatened with becoming a scene
and meat market. 9 p.m.-4 a.m. 21 and older. $20. 6655 Santa Monica
Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 462-5508. This Saturday: Sandra Collins,
Slacker, Grant Plant and Tim Lawson. www.spundae.com or
www.spundaehollywood.com</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Deep at sixteen-fifty</TE>
<TE>   DJ Marques Wyatt's Sunday night institution features a mix of
experimental DJ sets and major-name talent attracted by Wyatt's
reputation. 5 p.m.-2 a.m. 21 and older. $15. 1650 Schrader Blvd.,
Hollywood, (323) 960-2088. www.deep-la.com</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Monday Monday Night Social</TE>
<TE>   at Las Palmas</TE>
<TE>   Considered the staple of the scene after six years, this more
laid-back club night gets top-name talent without the huge crowds.
Memorial Day featured Q-Burns in a setting so intimate it felt as if
he was in your living room. It makes for a nice chill-out vibe, but
if you want the energy of the dance world, there are better spots. 9
p.m.-2 a.m. 21 and older. $10. 1714 N. Las Palmas Ave., Hollywood,
(323) 464-0171.</TE>

<KH>MY FAVORITE WEEKEND</KH>
<HD>Kim Hill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Adam Bregman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>* The hip-hop soul singer has a new homemade record, "Sugahill,"
available exclusively at Amoeba Records in Hollywood. She also sang
on Black Eyed Peas' "Behind the Front" and "Bridging the Gap."</LD>
<LD>   Vintage Hangout: I like Fais Do-Do because they are down on West
Adams Boulevard, and both the owner and the booker are great and
you've got to love the doorman, who always wears a red carnation and
a black suit. You just can't find that anywhere else. He is
definitely vintage. So I love that room, and they serve great
catfish.</LD>
<LD>   Not Too Down-Home: My favorite place is this little soul-food
Mexican spot. It's a hole-in-the-wall called Sky's on Pico and
Hauser, and you would slap somebody's mama to have one of their
shrimp tacos. If I'm going to leave my house to go eat--because I
love to cook and I think I'm a great cook--I have to feel welcome and
there has to be a level of home style to it without worrying about a
roach running across the table. I don't need it to be that down-home.
They have the best food and great homemade lemonade. That's
definitely a place that I go to at least twice a week.</LD>
<TE>   Supporting the Scene: Although there are a lot of record stores
across the world that carry my 12-inch, Amoeba Records in Hollywood
is the first store that actually carries my CD. I did an in-store for
them and two days before it, they said, "I hear you're selling CDs
for your show. We want them for the store," and I said, "Well, for my
artwork, I go to Copymat on Sunset and I don't put labels on them
because sometimes they can't be read in people's CD players," and
they were like, "We don't care. We want them in the store." So, they
bar-coded my homemade CDs. You have to love that. The people who work
there really care about music, and you know they're not getting paid
a lot of money. They're like, "Hey, this just came in."</TE>
<TE>   Handmade Jewelry: Another one of my favorite spots is this jewelry
store on the corner of Melrose and Martell called Sage. The owner is
a very young entrepreneur. She pretty much got her start when she was
about 22 making jewelry for another designer, and she landed an
account with Barney's, which enabled her to open up her own business.
And I've never seen anything like it. You know you've invested in a
great piece when you buy something there. You've got to walk in with
at least $300, but it's worth it, because it's definitely the kind of
thing you can't wait to pass on to your grandkids.</TE>
<TE>   Old Recipes: I love Aunt Kizzy's Back Porch, the soul food spot in
the Marina. Adolph and Mary Dulan are the owners, and Adolph makes
his way to pretty much everybody's table and tells stories about
black culture and our food and how he's incorporated his
great-grandmother's recipes into a modern cuisine. And you're like,
"OK, nice to meet you" and he's like, " ... then when I was 15...."
Another thing that's great about that restaurant is that Kizzy was a
slave who was very important in the movement, and when you walk in,
you get a piece of literature about why the restaurant was named
after her and what her contribution was to the culture.</TE>

<LD>   The Full Monty--The saga of six unemployed steel mill workers who
decide to strip for cash--and, as it turns out, even more-needed
self-worth--has been moved from its cinematic home, Sheffield,
England. Instead of pints, guys from upstate New York talk about the
football Bills. This is a new national touring production of a show
that is proving itself a durable franchise; after debuting two years
ago at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, the show is still playing
on Broadway and has opened in London, among other international
markets.</LD>
<LD>   Despite jokes you can see coming from Ithaca and an opening 20
minutes that feel awfully sluggish and expository, "The Full Monty"
is nevertheless difficult to resist in the end. The sets are clever
and streamlined, the pacing spry. The talented core cast, under the
direction of Jack O'Brien and choreographer Jerry Mitchell, moves
nicely from disparate strangers to a unified band of reluctant
strippers.</LD>

<HD>Newman's Own: 'Hustler,' 'Verdict'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's hard to believe that when Paul Newman made his film debut in
1954's "The Silver Chalice" he was described as a Marlon Brando
clone. No one now would ever accuse the superstar, sex symbol and
salad dressing king of being a Brando wannabe. Over the past 48
years, he's been nominated for eight Academy Awards, finally winning
for 1986's "The Color of Money." Newman's still going strong at 77;
his newest film, "The Road to Perdition," is set for release next
month.</LD>
<LD>   Newman gave two of his greatest performances in 1961's "The
Hustler" and 1982's "The Verdict"-- both of which are being released
on DVD this week (Fox Video, $20 each). Directed and co-written by
Robert Rossen, "The Hustler" is a searing character study of a cocky
pool hustler, "Fast Eddie" Felson (Newman), who takes on the greatest
pool player, Minnesota Fats (a marvelous Jackie Gleason). George C.
Scott plays a conniving promoter, and Piper Laurie is an alcoholic
who falls in love with Fast Eddie.</LD>
<LD>   Shot primarily in location at a real pool hall in New York City,
the film won Oscars for Eugen Shufftan's brilliant black-and-white
cinematography and Harry Horner and Gene Callahan's set design.</LD>
<TE>   The provocative, intelligent DVD features an informative
documentary, "The Hustler: The Inside Story," picture-in-picture
commentary with a champion trick pool player; a crisp wide-screen
transfer of the film; a photo gallery and the theatrical trailer. The
high point of the DVD is the audio track, which features informative,
thoughtful and heartfelt commentary from Newman, assistant director
Ulu Grosbard, Rossen's daughter, Carol, Time magazine movie critic
Richard Schickel and editor Dede Allen.</TE>
<TE>   Allen says that "The Hustler's" lengthy prologue, which comes
before the title sequence, was a rarity in its day. Fox executives
were worried the prologue would confuse audiences and wanted her to
cut the scene, but she and Rossen held firm.</TE>
<TE>   Carol Rossen discusses her father's experience with being
blacklisted and why he eventually cooperated with the House
Un-American Activities Committee. Newman talks about how he got
involved in the project. He and Elizabeth Taylor were set to star in
"Two for the Seesaw," but she got sick and pulled out. Newman had
approval for her replacement but didn't like any of the actresses on
the list. So he pulled out. Suddenly, he had an open slot in his
schedule when the script of "The Hustler" came his way.</TE>
<TE>   Though Newman lost the best actor Oscar that year, he won for
playing "Fast Eddie" 25 years later in the inferior sequel "The Color
of Money."</TE>
<TE>   Though Newman is listed as a commentator along with director
Sidney Lumet on the audio track of "The Verdict," he doesn't show up
until the 20th of 22 chapters. Why did he even bother? Thankfully,
the veteran Lumet is a mesmerizing guide through this superior drama,
written by David Mamet. The Oscar-nominated Newman plays a washed-up,
alcoholic attorney who gets his shot at redemption. Charlotte
Rampling, a dazzling James Mason and Jack Warden also star. The DVD
includes a vintage featurette and photo gallery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Lynch remains an enigmatic presence on the digital editions
of his feature films. For the special edition DVD of his 1986 classic
"Blue Velvet" (MGM, $25) he, yet again, fails to supply commentary.
And in the one-hour-plus retrospective documentary on the movie,
"Mysteries of Love," he is seen only in interviews conducted when the
film was released.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch, who received an Academy Award nomination for best director,
did supervise the lush new digital anamorphic transfer of the mystery
thriller starring Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Hopper, Laura Dern and
Isabella Rossellini. The original cut of the film was four hours, and
though the two hours of excised footage are missing, a photo montage
on the DVD attempts to piece together several deleted sequences.
There is also an excerpt from a 1986 edition of "Siskel &amp; Ebert," a
photo gallery and a trailer.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary is filled with behind-the-scenes tidbits,
including Hopper's revelations on acting for the first time in years
without being drunk and stoned, and Rossellini's confession that she
felt she brought too much baggage to the film because she was Ingrid
Bergman and Roberto Rossellini's daughter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Ford's lyrical 1949 western "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"
entered the Digital Age this week (Warner, $20). John Wayne, in one
of his best roles as a retiring military man, Joanne Dru, John Agar,
Ben Johnson and the always wonderful Victor McLaglen star in this
sagebrush saga set right after the Battle of Little Bighorn in 1876.
The real star of the film is Winton C. Hoch's breathtaking
Oscar-winning Technicolor cinematography that captures the majesty
and beauty of Arizona's Monument Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The DVD includes a beautiful new transfer of the restored film,
four minutes of home movies featuring Ford and Wayne and the
re-release trailer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vilmos Zsigmond supplied the dark, muted cinematography for Robert
Altman's demanding 1971 western "McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller" (Warner, $20).
Warren Beatty stars as a small-time hustler who arrives in a small
mountain town and becomes an entrepreneur. Julie Christie, then
Beatty's lover, received an Oscar nomination for her gritty turn as
the town's madam, who has a fondness for her opium pipe. The DVD
features a vintage behind-the-scenes documentary, trailer, a nice
wide-screen transfer of the film and perceptive commentary from
Altman, who remains very much the outspoken rebel, and producer David
Foster.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Julie Andrews and her director-writer husband, Blake Edwards, team
up to provide commentary for the digital edition of their delightful
1982 collaboration, "Victor/Victoria." Andrews received an Academy
Award nomination as a struggling singer living in Paris during the
1930s who becomes a star when she impersonates a man impersonating a
woman. The gender-bending comedy with Henry Mancini's lilting score
also stars Robert Preston in his Oscar-nominated turn as a gay
performer who befriends and mentors Andrews; James Garner as an
American gangster attracted to Victor/Victoria; and Lesley Ann Warren
as his dumb moll.</TE>
<TE>   The digital release includes a beautiful new wide-screen edition
of the film, the trailer and Andrews and Edwards' charming insights
into this production, which was shot on two connecting soundstages at
Pinewood Studios in England.</TE>
<TE>   Warners is also releasing three more Edwards comedies ($20 each)
on DVD, but without any commentaries: 1981's "S.O.B.," 1965's "The
Great Race" and 1989's "Skin Deep."</TE>

<TE>   "Starship Troopers," Paul Verhoeven's outrageous 1997 sci-fi
thriller filled to the brim with gore and gratuitous nudity, is now a
two-disc special edition (Columbia TriStar, $28). Casper Van Dien,
Denise Richards, Dina Meyer and Neil Patrick Harris star in this
over-the-top flick based on Robert Heinlein's futuristic sci-fi novel
in which vicious alien bugs are bent on taking over the world.</TE>
<TE>   The first DVD includes a wide-screen version of the film,
commentary with the very dramatic Verhoeven and screenwriter Ed
Neumeier and another track also featuring Verhoeven, Van Dien, Meyer
and Harris. Highlights of the second disc include deleted scenes with
commentary, screen tests, special effects comparisons, featurettes,
scene deconstructions with Verhoeven commentary and a documentary on
the making of the film.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eminem's new "The Eminem Show" sold 1.3 million copies last week,
making him the first solo artist to sell a million copies in a single
week twice.</LD>
<LD>   The Detroit rapper's last album, 2000's "The Marshall Mathers LP,"
sold 1.76 million copies in its first week in stores. The only other
albums by solo artists to top the million mark in a week: Britney
Spears' "Oops! ... I Did It Again," which sold 1.3 million copies in
August 2000, and Garth Brooks' "Double Live," which sold 1.1 million
in December 1998.</LD>
<LD>   'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys are the only other pop acts to
sell more than a million in a week since Nielsen SoundScan began
monitoring U.S. sales a decade ago. Both groups have broken the
barrier twice, with 'N Sync's "No Strings Attached" first-week tally
of 2.4 million in 2000 holding the record for one-week sales.</LD>
<TE>   The 1.3 million for "The Eminem Show" follows the 285,000 copies
that were sold before the official May 28 release date. Numerous
stores began selling it four days early in hopes of combating
widespread downloading and piracy of the album.</TE>
<TE>   "The Eminem Show" was so dominant in the marketplace last week
that it nearly outsold the rest of the week's top 25 sellers
combined. It led the week's sales runner-up, P. Diddy &amp; Bad Boy
Records' "We Invented the Remix," by more than 1.2 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to draw any conclusions about whether downloads helped
or hurt the album's sales," said Geoff Mayfield, director of charts
for Billboard magazine. "Because total album sales have been down
every week so far this year when compared to the same week last year,
downloading appears to hurt sales overall.</TE>
<TE>   "But if there's a blockbuster album, fans seem to want it so bad
that they'll download it and then buy it as well--and the Eminem
album is certainly a blockbuster. It is likely to be No. 1 for
several weeks."</TE>
<TE>   The remaining positions on this week's Top 10 are held by, in
order, Ashanti, Cam'ron, Celine Dion, Marc Anthony, Sheryl Crow,
Kenny Chesney, Vol. 9 in the "Now That's What I Call Music"
compilations and Musiq.</TE>
<TE>   The best-selling single remains 'N Sync's pairing with Nelly on
"Girlfriend."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Neil Tennant has no faith in celebrity. Not as a guiding force for
humanity, or even as an example for the little people to follow. As
the singing half of the Pet Shop Boys, Tennant has enjoyed his own
kind of pop celebrity for nearly two decades, but he wouldn't want
anyone to take that high esteem too seriously.</LD>
<LD>   Celebrity culture, he insists, is not the answer, especially in an
era when certain supermodels can protest the use of fur in one
celebrated ad campaign, and then two years later appear on a catwalk
in mink. "Celebrities are looked up to for their haircuts and their
clothes, which is fine," says Tennant, 47. "I don't think we need to
look up to anyone for issues. People are clever enough to work them
out themselves."</LD>
<LD>   That still hasn't prevented Tennant and partner Chris Lowe, 42,
from drawing on the day's newspapers as much as personal experience
for the Pet Shop Boys' new album, "Release." On the band's first U.S.
tour since 1999, which includes a stop Friday at Universal
Amphitheatre, mixing the romantic with the topical is a natural
reflex for Tennant.</LD>
<TE>   Which means the Pet Shop Boys can celebrate the comeback of love
letters via the Internet on the lovesick "E-Mail," and then examine
how the murders of Stephen Lawrence in the U.K. and Matthew Shepard
in the U.S. drew belated attention to lingering racism and homophobia
on "Birthday Boy."</TE>
<TE>   "It makes us look into ourselves and about how they look at
people," Tennant says of the deaths. "It's like Jesus dying for our
sins."</TE>
<TE>   The band has built a devoted following for its atmospheric dance
music with a core of intelligence and melancholy. With his usual
deadpan delivery, Tennant specializes in sometimes hurt, sometimes
sneering love songs he's described as "bitter and twisted," with
self-explanatory titles such as "You Only Tell Me You Love Me When
You're Drunk."</TE>
<TE>   One new song likely to draw attention is "The Night I Fell in
Love," which follows a young gay man to the concert of a homophobic
rap artist clearly modeled on Eminem. The song, which Tennant says
was inspired by the rapper's pointed, negative lyrics about
homosexuality and his subsequent appearance with Elton John on the
Grammy Awards, ends with the young man in bed with the rapper.</TE>
<TE>   The Pet Shop Boys have yet to hear any reaction from Eminem. "When
we played Detroit, Eminem was out of town--luckily," Tennant says
with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "Eminem says he's not homophobic--he's just playing a character
representing the ugliness in America. And actually I think Eminem is
doing that. He does it really well too, to be honest. I really like
his records."</TE>
<TE>   The new album was recorded at Tennant's house in northeast England
between September 2000 and last November. Rather than return to the
big dance beat of earlier records, keyboardist Lowe reached for a
more organic sound that put the focus on the duo as songwriters. The
sessions did lead to a handful of dance tracks, but they were
relegated to B-sides of singles.</TE>
<TE>   The final recording also owes something to the dynamic presence of
guitarist Johnny Marr, formerly of the Smiths, Electronic and,
briefly, the Pretenders. He has appeared before on Pet Shop Boys
albums, but he plays on eight of the 10 tracks on "Release." (He
won't be on the tour)</TE>
<TE>   "Johnny is a great rock guitarist, but he's also a great pop
guitarist, and he's a very melodic player, which really fits with
what we do," Tennant says. "He's got this wonderful loose, rhythmic
playing."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Pet Shop Boys collaborated with playwright Jonathan
Harvey on a stage musical, "Closer to Heaven," which played in London
for six months. The show, likely to arrive in the U.S. in 2003, tells
the story of an Irish boy who becomes immersed in London's fast-paced
club scene.</TE>
<TE>   In the musical and on the new album, electronics remain a key
element in Pet Shop Boys music. While the duo has subtly updated its
sound over the years, it has never overtly chased after the newest
trends--drum-and-bass isn't in the repertoire. So even its most
recent material fits comfortably beside the band's early recordings,
including the 1985 signature hit "West End Girls."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really hop from genre to genre, like some people do,"
Tennant says. "With every album we've made, we had a strong idea for
it. You should do what you feel, not what the latest trend is. It
looks a bit shameless to do that. Not that there's anything wrong
with being shameless."</TE>

<HD>KMFDM Returns for More Sonic Savagery</HD>

<LD>"KMFDM is back for more/ KMFDM will never stop," shouted Sascha
Konietzko during the German industrial-rock group's opening number
Tuesday at the Palace. Delivered against the sonic onslaught provided
by the five-piece band, the song, "DIY," was like a declaration of
war.</LD>
<LD>   It was an appropriate opener for the band that has at times been
thrust into an us-against-the-world position--most recently when the
two teenage killers at Columbine High School turned out to be KMFDM
fans. In response to the subsequent criticism and attention,
Konietzko "disbanded" the group, which entailed changing its name to
MDFMK (figure it out).</LD>
<LD>   Now back under its original moniker, KMFDM was greeted by an eager
crowded floor when it hit the Palace stage. Following "DIY" with
"Attak/Reload" and "Dirty" (longtime Konietzko collaborator Tim Skold
came out looking like Marilyn Manson to provide vocals for the
latter) from the new album, "Attak," KMFDM displayed a sonic savagery
that puts to shame all the nu-metal bands.</LD>
<TE>   While there was no way the group could maintain the opening
intensity throughout its two-hour set, there were enough highlights,
including the techno-driven "Megalomaniacal" and the new album's
"Sturm and Drang," to leave little doubt that KMFDM is indeed back.</TE>

<DH>Writer-director Finn Taylor explores how house arrest
affects a young woman in 'Cherish.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I like characters to be flawed or have human foibles, because
otherwise where do they have to go?" says writer-director Finn
Taylor, acknowledging that the main character in his new film,
"Cherish," may be on the annoying, geeky side. "In the studio system,
they make the mistake of making the characters so likable in the
beginning that you kind of hate them in a way."</LD>
<LD>   A hefty man with a ready smile, Taylor, 43, doesn't seem like the
kind who would hate anybody. His affability at first worried actress
Robin Tunney. "I thought he seemed really nice, but I was afraid he
might be too nice, a pushover on the set," she says. "But when we
started working, I realized he really did know what he wanted." And
usually got it, though he would ask, nicely.</LD>
<LD>   In "Cherish," Tunney plays Zoe, a twentysomething woman whose
hijacked car hits and kills a policeman. Nobody believes her when she
says someone else was steering--she'd been drinking--and she is
placed under house arrest. Clamped to her ankle is an electronic
bracelet linked to a modem, which screams mayday should she traipse
beyond the perimeter of her apartment.</LD>
<TE>   To check on her and the equipment, a grim deputy (Tim Blake
Nelson) pays occasional, unannounced visits, while random phone calls
arrive throughout the day. All this proves catastrophic for Zoe, who
has been living for the next party, the next date and all the other
noisy distractions of singledom.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite distractions are vintage pop songs about love and
being in love--such as "Cherish" by the Association, "I Melt With
You" by Modern English, "She's Gone" by Hall &amp; Oates--that punctuate
the film.</TE>
<TE>   They also serve as ironic counterpoint to the essential isolation
of the characters.</TE>
<TE>   "I kind of notice this around me and within myself also," says
Taylor, sitting across a restaurant booth during a recent visit to
Los Angeles. A vegetarian, he's nibbling on a salad. "The idea of not
filling every minute with an activity scares a lot of people. We've
got such a saturated society that facing yourself alone in quiet
seems like a terrifying prospect."</TE>
<TE>   In the film he explores how Zoe copes with that terror and, in
some way, becomes strengthened by it.</TE>
<TE>   A Bay Area native, Taylor hadn't meant to get into the film
business. In the 1970s, he went to the University of Montana to study
forestry management, but soon realized there was way too much math
and science involved, which was for him a turnoff. Instead, after
taking a poetry writing class with Richard Hugo, he discovered that
creative writing was a turn-on. And maybe his true calling.</TE>
<TE>   Dropping Out to Gain 'Experience'</TE>
<TE>   So he dropped out of school to gain, as he puts it, a little "life
experience." He worked at different jobs, he traveled. In 1984 he
returned to college--San Francisco State this time--to hone his
writing skills. During the next four years, he also worked as the
literary director for a performance space, a doorman at a tony
restaurant-hotel, and a writer-director of his own plays in small
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   One of the plays was noticed by director Jeff Brown, who optioned
his screenplay for "Pontiac Moon" and hired him to do rewrites. In
1989, Taylor moved to Los Angeles to do those rewrites, as well as
take on other writing projects. Although Brown had originally
intended to direct "Pontiac Moon," Taylor says, "Paramount paid him
off, and they made a terrible film of it.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't the actors I had envisioned and ... " he pauses,
smiling cryptically. "I don't know how much I should say about this."
Then he offers, "Anyway, I was disappointed in that experience."</TE>
<TE>   But he had learned something. Hanging around the set during the
four months of shooting, Taylor absorbed the process of filmmaking,
learning who did what and how. So when it came time to render his
next project, "Dream With the Fishes," into film and Brown was
unavailable, Taylor decided he would direct it himself.</TE>
<TE>   He also raised his own money. "When you set a date and you're
going to shoot that film, whether you have $20,000 or $2 million," he
says, "when you're completely committed to that, people can see it in
your eyes and then they do come and help you." (In the end, he said
production costs tallied about $1 million.)</TE>
<TE>   "Dream With the Fishes", which was received favorably at Sundance
in 1997, was a quirky tale of a man who agrees to help another live
out his fantasies before he dies. Janet Maslin in the New York Times
called it "a sharply etched, nicely offbeat debut feature."</TE>
<TE>   The story was loosely based on a pivotal experience Taylor had in
his 20s with his buddy Michael. "I was more of a shy guy, and this
was a guy who would do things I would never do in a million years,"
he recalls. Then they had a major blow-up and went their separate
ways, with Taylor taking off for a dream sojourn in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "After having been there a few months, I got a call that he was
terminally ill, so I came back to the U.S.," he says. "Basically I
used the money I had saved up for my trip to help him live out his
fantasies in his last couple weeks of life." Some of these didn't
work out as planned, and his friend died, but Taylor was inspired.</TE>
<TE>   That was when he decided to go back to school and write.</TE>
<TE>   Although not as personal, the inspiration for "Cherish" came from
meeting real people who wore bracelets while under house arrest.</TE>
<TE>   "The first person I met on this program lived in Los Angeles, a
friend of a friend," Taylor said. Intrigued by his stories, the
director soon interviewed more subjects and even a number of officer
monitors.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, many attempt to circumvent the system--either by
removing the bracelet or extending its range--and several real-life
anecdotes made their way into Taylor's script. One man got an
extension cord for his modem so he could go outside. Then one day his
friends played a trick. During a basketball game, they pulled down
his pants and ran beyond the device's range, knowing he couldn't
follow them.</TE>
<TE>   Both Tunney and Nelson say they enjoyed working with Taylor. "He
loves actors and he loves his material," Nelson says. Furthermore,
"he looks at film as an art form, not as a money or career-generating
machine."</TE>
<TE>   For his next project, Taylor is trying the studio route
again--"Chaos Theory" is with Universal, with a name actor who cannot
yet be named attached. It's about a pair of insurance company
actuaries who assess the risk involved in crazy stunts, such as the
1982 case of a man who took flight sitting in a lawn chair tied to a
slew of helium balloons. The director may come to Los Angeles to
shoot this one, although he has been happily resettled in the Bay
Area since 1996. While he enjoyed Los Angeles, he felt that the film
business was too pervasive, to the detriment of other aspects of
life.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, Los Angeles is like a giant university where everyone has
the same major," he says. That can prove limiting, even suffocating.
"Whereas in the Bay Area, there's a film industry too, but it's only
a small part of all the other things. And it gives me more room to
breathe and write and dream."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't bother checking your watch--it's probably nearing last call,
but you're not going anywhere. If you're planted at Dirty at the Room
in Hollywood, you're stuck, my friend. Dirty's DJs spin such a
mesmerizing blend of rock 'n' roll, every time you get up to leave,
they pull you back in.</LD>
<LD>   The Tuesday night club is Hollywood's little rock 'n' roll secret,
and it takes advantage of being at the Room, the last of the
back-alley bars in the Cahuenga corridor. No matter how many times
you've driven through Hollywood, you need to actually get out onto
the streets to find the Room.</LD>
<LD>   The Room is a bit like the Northern California town of Bolinas,
where the residents famously remove any signs pointing their way. You
have to rely on word-of-mouth directions. Here's mine: If you're
walking up Cahuenga Boulevard toward Hollywood Boulevard, you make a
right into the parking lot south of Beauty Bar but kittycorner to the
Burgundy Room. It's usually easiest to ask the nearest street hustler
to point you in the right direction.</LD>
<TE>   No matter how much of a tourist destination the Cahuenga corridor
becomes, egged on by hot venues such as the Burgundy Room and Beauty
Bar, the Room still belongs to the locals. The bar, located behind
curtains and up a few stairs, set down roots in this nook of
Hollywood back when the area seemed to draw more car thieves than
hipsters. The Room's owners took a chance and began attracting all
kinds of young adventurers back to Hollywood. Over its 10-year
existence, the Room has managed to maintain a low profile, and it's a
very friendly place to chill out.</TE>
<TE>   Its low-key attitude allows Dirty's promoters, Christina Carey and
Ian Grieve, to treat their clientele like friends at a house party.
They attract a wide-ranging group of customers--from rock 'n' roll
refugees like the Strokes to actor Alan Cumming and loads of H-wood
clubbers. The common denominator for Dirty fans is music.</TE>
<TE>   Carey gets Dirty jump-started by heaping on heavy doses of Led
Zeppelin. She then turns over the turntables to guest DJs culled from
the Hollywood underground. Each use Dirty as his or her own pop
playground.</TE>
<TE>   When Grieve, who also bartends at the Viper Room, takes his DJ
turn, he spins everything from Jon Spencer to Tom Waits and Johnny
Cash. Next up, you might hear actor Sean Sweeney working the eclectic
crowd with some vintage Barry Manilow and Carpenters before Carey
returns to smooth out the night with a gentle track by Oasis. It's an
unpredictable mix, but an intoxicating way to spend an evening.</TE>
<TE>   All I can say is good luck trying to get out of there. Dirty is
like Hotel California: You can check out anytime you like, but you
can never leave. I mean, it's last call but they're playing Jeff
Buckley.</TE>
<TE>   Dirty at the Room, 1626 Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. Tuesdays, 9:30
p.m.-2 a.m. 21 and older. No cover. (323) 467-0191.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Probably the most popular downtown restaurant is a seafood stand
called the Fisherman's Outlet. It's mobbed from just before noon till
about 2 p.m. most days (it closes at 3:30), and for even longer than
that on Fridays and Saturdays. One line snakes out the door and into
a roofed patio; another meanders through the adjoining fish market
and salad counter.</LD>
<LD>   Inside, there's a surging crowd of people from all walks of
life--government workers, downtown locals, people from the nearby toy
and fashion districts--all watching for one of the countermen to
point and call out, "Who's next? You? What's your order?"</LD>
<LD>   Make it snappy, and tell him whether you want it with rice or with
fries and cole slaw. That's right, slaw comes only with fries; if you
want it with rice, it's 46 cents extra.</LD>
<TE>   Then wait your turn to tell another counterman whether you want a
soft drink. That's also the moment to order a sauce, if you're
getting broiled fish. (With fried, you get packets of commercial
tartar or cocktail sauce, or both, seemingly at random.)</TE>
<TE>   Then you slowly work your way down to the cash register and pay a
third counterman. Eventually, your order emerges from the grill and
fry area, where about half a dozen more guys are working furiously. A
lot of the countermen have been doing this for years, and they've
become surprisingly good at remembering whose order is whose.</TE>
<TE>   You can order cocktails or chowders from the third counterman, or
you can order them next door at the seafood counter, an altogether
cooler and quieter place. At the seafood counter, you can also shop
for fresh seafood to cook at home.</TE>
<TE>   When your order comes up, you grab it and go looking for a seat on
the patio. It holds about two dozen concrete tables with concrete
benches, all set very close together. There are also a couple of
wooden tables inside, but hardly anybody ever sits there among the
jostling lines of people placing orders. A counter with a handful of
stools outside the window is also underutilized.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest sellers are the fried seafood plates--there are combos
you can order as No. 1 (fish and shrimp), No. 2 (fish and scallops)
or No. 3 (shrimp and scallops). They come with rice or with crunchy
skinny fries and a little cup of dill-spiked cole slaw. (OK, so you
don't get slaw with the rice. It's good rice, with a chewy texture
like al dente orzo pasta that happens to taste like rice.)</TE>
<TE>   Fried items are pretty good in their crunchy panko-type breading,
even the inexpensive fried fish sandwich (no side dishes with the
sandwich). Often, there's a blackboard special of crab cakes, which
are very crabby, with very little filler. The fried sand dabs are
disappointing, though. They're not filets but whole fish, so you get
a lot of bones and not much meat.</TE>
<TE>   The more expensive broiled seafood dishes also come with fries or
rice and your choice of sauce--garlic butter, thick teriyaki or a
Cajun sauce thick with ground medium-hot peppers. The choices include
a smoky albacore filet, sea bass with a good, fresh flavor and tiger
shrimp, which are two skewers of about five large shrimp each.</TE>
<TE>   Everything seems good here (even trout, so often disappointing in
restaurants), but the best things are clearly the salmon and the
giant shrimp. The salmon is a butterflied filet, juicy and
ultra-fresh; the giant shrimp are half a dozen really big ones, also
butterflied and very fresh, with an attractive charcoal-tinged
flavor. If you don't tell them otherwise, they automatically give you
garlic butter with the giant shrimp. (Go along with it.)</TE>
<TE>   If fried or grilled seafood isn't enough for you, you can get a
bland white clam chowder or a red chowder of small shrimp and bits of
fish in a spicy tomato broth. There's also a lobster bisque, but
they've always been out of it when I've asked.</TE>
<TE>   Seafood cocktails come with a horseradish-heavy cocktail sauce on
the side, although there's a shrimp cocktail in light tomato sauce
with raw onions, which is more like a Mexican coctel.</TE>
<TE>   A few commercial desserts are available, such as a Key lime pie
with that everlasting sort of cream topping and a chocolate cake
that's mostly fudgy filling and frosting. But do you really need to
order dessert? You're taking up a seat there, Mac.</TE>

<HD>For Authentic Florentine Flavors</HD>
<DH>Zibibbo specializes in soulful dishes unfamiliar to
tourists. But if Florence is too far away, a new cookbook dishes on
the Tuscan treasures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FLORENCE, Italy--Tuscany has become such a tourist destination it's
hard to find restaurants anymore that serve anything other than the
familiar roster of dishes the tourists already know. Cibreo in
Florence, which Benedetta Vitali and Fabio Picchi opened in 1979
fresh out of college, is one of the very few exceptions.</LD>
<LD>   Three years ago, Vitali left Cibreo to open her own place, and
it's become my favorite place to eat in Florence. Named for the
Sicilian grape, Zibibbo Trattoria is only about 15 minutes from the
city center by taxi, but well worth the effort for its gloriously
authentic Tuscan food.</LD>
<LD>   Ask to be dropped off at Piazzetta di Careggi. From that little
square, Zibibbo is only a few doors down Via di Terzollina. There's
no sign (or at least not the last time I was there). Just look for a
window displaying some of the best wines in Italy. That's it.</LD>
<TE>   A small bar opens onto an airy dining room that's much more
contemporary chic than rustic, but the food is soulful Tuscan fare
cooked with finesse and passion.</TE>
<TE>   The menu changes frequently, yet everything on it sounds
interesting enough that I could eat here every night. Vitali, who
speaks English well, will take your order and translate any of the
dishes you don't know. Outstanding antipasti include insalata di
gallina, a salad of shredded chicken with a few leaves of bitter
green radicchio, julienned sweet peppers and a gorgeous, yellow,
handmade mayonnaise. There's also an inspired octopus and plump white
fagioli (beans) salad drenched in lemon.</TE>
<TE>   Pastas are first-rate too--everything from tagliatelle in a rustic
duck sauce and spaghettini with quickly sauteed veal kidney to
spaghetti tossed with mussels, clams and tellini (a tiny, sweet
shellfish).</TE>
<TE>   Inziminio di calamari, which is squid and spinach, is a
traditional Florentine dish that's hard to find anymore, and Vitali's
is memorable. Another Florentine favorite is trippa alla Parmigiana,
a gratin of tender tripe and Parmigiano Reggiano. And I crave her
classic arista, pork roast stuffed with herbs. I'd love to stay long
enough one time to eat my way through her entire menu.</TE>
<TE>   But how often do any of us get to Florence? The good news is that
Ten Speed Press (www.tenspeed.com) recently commissioned Vitali to
write a cookbook. It's called "Soffritto: Tradition &amp; Innovation in
Tuscan Cooking" ($32.50), and is illustrated with photographs and the
pastel landscapes that hang on Zibibbo's walls.</TE>
<TE>   The recipes reflect the simplicity and integrity of the best
Tuscan cooking. You'll find her versions of raw artichoke salad and
pappa al pomodoro, Tuscan bread and tomato soup perfumed with basil.
She tops fettunta (essentially Tuscan bruschetta) with cavolo nero
(Tuscan black cabbage) and cardoons.</TE>
<TE>   And yes, she does include her recipe for the inziminio di calamari
I love and arista too, along with musings on technique, ingredients
and serendipity in the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   Should you ever get to Florence, keep this address in your pocket.</TE>
<TE>   Zibibbo Trattoria, Via di Terzollina 3/R, Florence; telephone:
011-39-55-433-383. About $30 a person, not including wine.</TE>

<HD>Wiggling Its Way Into Kids' Hearts</HD>
<DH>Once a warmup act for Barney, the Australian band the
Wiggles is now headliner material</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE HEFFLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Australian invasion continues. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe,
Nicole Kidman and now ... the Wiggles?</LD>
<LD>   The Wiggles have emerged from Down Under as a superstar children's
band. With their videos and CDs selling millions, they've already
made serious inroads into Barney and "Teletubbies" territory. Now,
with the Wiggles on their third solo tour of the U.S.--the first to
reach California--preschoolers here are increasingly doing what their
Aussie counterparts have been doing for a decade: dancing the Ooby
Doo, toot-tooting, chugga-chugging and hoop-dee-doo-ing with this
four-man band.</LD>
<LD>   Once a warmup act for the "Barney" stage show, the Wiggles appear
tonight at the Universal Amphitheatre, Saturday at the Long Beach
Terrace Theater, Sunday at Oxnard's Performing Arts Center and
Tuesday at the Fox Theater in Bakersfield.</LD>
<TE>   The Wiggles in performance, like gushy Barney, can make some
adults wince: toothy grins, unflappable cheer, unflagging energy,
silly jokes, repetitive lyrics and cheery tunes so catchy that they
can lodge for days in grown-up brains.</TE>
<TE>   These four grown men, in black trousers and close-fitting,
long-sleeved "skivvies" (Aussie for T-shirts), cavort onstage, play
guitars, drums and keyboards, sing "Hoop-Dee-Doo" and do "The Wobbly
Dance."</TE>
<TE>   They cut up too, with costumed characters Wags the Dog, Henry
Octopus, Dorothy Dinosaur and Captain Feathersword, a lacy-shirted
pirate with magic buttons on his vest.</TE>
<TE>   The Wiggles--Anthony Field, 39; Murray Cook, 42; Greg Page, 30;
and Jeff Fatt, 48--aren't crafting their shows for adults (although
they do attract a number of adult female groupies; in 1999 Field was
named "bachelor of the year" by a leading Australian magazine).</TE>
<TE>   "The underlying principle is being child-centered," Cook said from
the Sydney studio where the band was taping its new "Lights, Camera,
Action, Wiggles" TV series. "And that's really the principle from
early childhood education, thinking what's important to children,
what's in their world, what they'll understand. It's also not being
condescending to them."</TE>
<TE>   The Wiggles' own backgrounds in child development led to their
signature nonviolent, upbeat and gentle personas, and even the
brightly colored shirts they wear for easy identification: Field is
the Blue Wiggle; Cook, the Red Wiggle; Page, the Yellow Wiggle; and
audience favorite Fatt, the Purple Wiggle. In one regular bit,
created to make children feel "empowered," Fatt's the "sleepy" Wiggle
who must be jarred out of periods of torpor by audience shouts of
"Wake up, Jeff!"</TE>
<TE>   Field and his brother Paul started out with Fatt in a popular
1980s rock band called the Cockroaches. When the band dissolved after
the death of Paul Field's infant daughter from SIDS, Anthony Field
went back to school to earn a degree in early childhood education.
That's where he met Cook and Page, two other musicians pursuing the
same path.</TE>
<TE>   It was Anthony Field who suggested that they "combine what we'd
learned about child development with what we knew about music," Cook
said. Fatt soon joined them.</TE>
<TE>   The group's first years of renown came about through word of mouth
and self-funded enterprises. As their popularity as classroom and
birthday party entertainment grew, so did the demand for more
recordings like their self-titled 1991 album, which they had assumed
would be a one-time venture.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Field, who is now the Wiggles' manager, says it's their
talent as songwriters and musicians that lies at the heart of their
appeal. "It was grass-roots support, not hype. In the early childhood
world, if there's something kids love, there's a parents' network
where you tell your friends. We've been lucky that way."</TE>
<TE>   Today, U.S. sales of Wiggles videos and CDs, distributed by HIT
Entertainment, are at 3 million and climbing. Sales in Australia top
4.5 million. The Disney Channel added Wiggles video clips to its
Playhouse Disney programming block in February, and plans are afoot
to replicate the band for the Asian market through a Disney-Wiggles
partnership. It's a remarkable success story in a field dominated by
character-driven entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the undeniably canny, moneymaking enterprise, however,
the sense of a calling, a la Fred Rogers, is evident too. Despite
burgeoning relationships with media giants, the Wiggles retain tight
creative control to protect their vision and ideas.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys have self-funded most of their projects," Paul Field
explained, "because even to this day, there's some who don't
understand what they're about. I was with Anthony in an airport once,
and a father came up and said, 'Oh, my kids love you guys,' but then
he said, 'Don't you feel a bit silly doing what you do?' Anthony
said, 'When you speak to your child, play with your child, you don't
feel silly doing that, do you? Well, it's the same with us.'"</TE>
<TE>   The Wiggles don't take their success for granted.</TE>
<TE>   "Every new project we have, every tour we have is exciting for
us," Cook said. "One of the most important things about what we do is
playing live. We love keeping in touch with our audience."</TE>
<TE>   Allegra Heckman, 29, a Woodland Hills mom with three children,
ages 1 to 4, plans to be in that audience. She discovered the Wiggles
in a music video at the end of a "Bob the Builder" children's tape.
Now she and the kids are hooked.</TE>
<TE>   "We have all their tapes. They're incredible musicians, every song
has the greatest beat [and] they've really captured the innocence of
childhood," she said. "They're these four sweet, nurturing, gentle
sort of father figures. You don't get that very much in children's
programming."</TE>

<LD>Aspiring actors can flail against the Hollywood system for years
without making a dent, a thankless endeavor that can result in
psychological whiplash.</LD>
<LD>   In "Big Shot," his solo show at the Lillian, playing directly
after the 8 p.m. show "Go True West" on the same stage, Ben Davis
examines the sometimes bizarre lengths actors may be driven to in the
desperate struggle for success. Davis' tale, directed by Scott
Rabinowitz, who also contributes the evocative lighting design, could
be subtitled "A Hollywood Horror Story."</LD>
<LD>   Like any good B-movie thriller, there's a certain "Duh!" factor at
work here. The "Duh!" factor is part of that familiar cinematic
quotient in which characters perversely enter a haunted house's
cellar despite reports of a monster lurking there. Their
all-too-predictable fates rate a resounding "Duh!" from the
exasperated audience.</LD>
<TE>   Figuratively speaking, Davis ventures into the fatal cellar when
he falls under the influence of Jonah, a wealthy Hollywood "big shot"
who casts Davis in his new play and vows to make him a huge
star--sweet words to the struggling actor, who has recently been
reduced to acting for free in a loincloth and glitter. To Davis'
dismay, Jonah (not his real name) soon proves a monster of the most
eviscerating sort, alternately heaping praise and abuse on his
terrified underlings.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, Jonah genuinely believes that he is God Almighty,
possessing the power of life and death over all.</TE>
<TE>   But does that creepy revelation send Davis fleeing for the exit?
Not quite yet.</TE>
<TE>   Although Davis' manic delivery results in a few line flubs early
on, his is a cautionary yarn well spun, a scary but comical journey
into the dark heart of Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, Davis' decision to finally break free of Jonah's mad
influence might engender that familiar "Duh!"</TE>
<TE>   However, Davis' show makes a serious point about how destructive
sheer yearning, devoid of ameliorating common sense, can be.</TE>
<TE>   "Big Shot," the Lillian Theater, 1076 N. Lillian Way, Hollywood.
Fridays and Saturdays, 9 p.m. Ends June 29. $12. (323) 221-6656.
Running time: 1 hour, 15 minutes.</TE>

<LD>Men in suits and bowler hats, green apples, puffy white clouds in
blue skies, a floating boulder, black umbrellas: The imagery of
Belgian Surrealist painter Rene Magritte dominates Barry Kornhauser's
play "This Is Not a Pipe Dream."</LD>
<LD>   Kornhauser's exploration of theater, art and reality is a
play-within-a-play, fed by Magritte's observations and signature
images, including his seminal pipe painting, "Ceci n'est pas une
pipe," and his self-portrait obscured by an apple. This unusual
fantasy romp is one of youth theater's most difficult to pull off
well, and Bread and Jam Children's Theatre of Los Angeles' production
at the Secret Rose Theatre struggled with it opening weekend.</LD>
<LD>   At its heart, "This Is Not a Pipe Dream" is a sensitive story
about Magritte's childhood experiences with a rigid, disapproving
father, the drowning death of his supportive mother and his own drive
to express himself without words. Fittingly, little is quite what it
seems.</LD>
<TE>   The sometimes thoughtful, sometimes wacky play deliberately keeps
the audience guessing about the nature of reality, but it also
progresses in fits and starts. It is frequently interrupted by
explosive bouts of silent-movie-style comic anarchy, with actors in
black suits and bowler hats turning into slapstick clowns who club
each other with (foam) pipes or administer an ego-deflating kick in
the pants. The same actors also play actors, breaking character to
grumble about the script. Throughout, an interlocutor serves as
narrator, ringmaster and audience informant.</TE>
<TE>   This absurdist approach requires sure footing and absolute clarity
not to lose audience members along the way. Bread and Jam director
Tekla Ackelson-Wright and her cast of professionals, led by Jason
Jack Beeber as Magritte, Stacey Jack as Interlocutor and Mike Firek
as Magritte's father and a bowler-hatted Anonymous Man only partially
succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of rehearsal might be to blame, judging from bobbles in
timing and dialogue at the show's first matinee. Technical glitches,
however, were nearly fatal. Magritte quotes were muffled by
scratchiness in the recording. Lighting mishaps not only left a good
bit of the action in shadow, but negated much-needed visual interest
by rendering projections of Magritte's work nearly invisible.</TE>
<TE>   Bread and Jam is capable of better. Despite these problems, the
company has clearly made a considerable effort to bring this rarely
seen play to young audiences--an effort that includes Les Salva's
Magritte-inspired set design and Valerie Wright's period and humorous
costumes. Whether it can pull it all together at this late date is a
question mark. Here's hoping.</TE>

<HD>MSNBC's Heavy Hitter Re-Ups</HD>
<DH>TV* Chris Matthews, host of the network's top-rated show,
is signed to a new seven-year contract and given a key time slot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>MSNBC, continuing to revamp its lineup in an effort to pull out of a
distant third place among the cable news channels, announced
Wednesday that it has signed talk host Chris Matthews to a new
seven-year contract, given him a key slot in its lineup and installed
him as anchor of its prime-time presidential election coverage.</LD>
<LD>   Matthews' "Hardball" is MSNBC's top-rated show, even though it
also airs on sister channel CNBC. When schedule changes take effect
July 15, CNBC will drop the program and it will air exclusively on
MSNBC, which will move it to 6 p.m. Pacific time, putting it in the
middle of East Coast prime time and against CNN's top-rated show,
"Larry King Live," as well as "Hannity &amp; Colmes" on Fox News Channel.
The latter show's co-host, Alan Colmes, extended his contract for
several years on Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Viewers will flip around among all the shows, predicted Matthews.
"It's like a neighborhood of restaurants. They may head out to eat at
one, but then look in the window and decide to eat at another," he
said.</LD>
<TE>   The unusually long deal will keep Matthews, who also writes a
nationally syndicated column, hosting "Hardball" through 2009. In
addition, Matthews is already slated to anchor a weekly syndicated
show produced by NBC News and distributed by NBC Enterprises
beginning in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Although Matthews had recently explored opportunities at other
networks, he said MSNBC "is the perfect job for me. It lets me
express attitude. I basically try to be fair, but I do express
feelings."</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC has been seeking to reshape its prime-time image as a place
where all opinions can be heard, adding liberal Phil Donahue, who
will make his debut in July, airing in the hour preceding Matthews;
and conservative Alan Keyes, whose show has been on for several
months. "I'm equally distant between the two of them. They're the
goal posts of politics," Matthews said.</TE>
<TE>   MSNBC recently re-branded itself "America's NewsChannel" and has
begun dropping the MSNBC logo from its screen at times. The network,
which is also ceding "The News With Brian Williams" to CNBC, said it
hasn't yet decided what will air when.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Ashleigh Banfield's show probably will move to 7 p.m.
Pacific time to make room for "Hardball," with a time slot for Keyes
undecided.</TE>

<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a breeze off the water, a fresh new revival of "South Pacific"
has swept into the area--spiced with mystery and enchantment, yet
chased along by a gathering storm.</LD>
<LD>   A tale of paradise found, lost and found again during World War
II's Pacific battles, the 1949 Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical can be
devilishly tricky to get right. Yet this touring production, now at
the Orange County Performing Arts Center and traveling soon to San
Diego and Los Angeles, maintains a delicate balance between sunny
entertainment and sobering enlightenment.</LD>
<LD>   The production's greatest strength is its voices. Headliner Robert
Goulet plays Emile de Becque, the French-born plantation owner who
enchants Arkansas-raised nurse Nellie Forbush during her posting on a
Pacific island. It's a part to which the actor's still impossibly
rich bass-baritone is well suited (although he has an annoying
tendency to scoop up into some pitches).</LD>
<TE>   But the unalloyed delights here are the other leads: Amanda
Watkins, a sparkling mezzo-soprano, as Nellie; Lewis Cleale, a
ringing lyric baritone, as the heroic Lt. Cable; and Gretha Boston, a
resonant mezzo and 1995 Tony winner (featured actress, for "Show
Boat"), as entrepreneur Bloody Mary.</TE>
<TE>   Better still is the male chorus depicting U.S. Naval personnel.
These guys are itching for action--military and otherwise--as they
cool their heels, awaiting the call to battle in the incongruously
beautiful islands that set designer Derek McLane has rendered with
photo-realistic stands of palm trees and picture-perfect stretches of
beach.</TE>
<TE>   Testosterone wafts off the stage as these strapping, deep-voiced
men roar through "Bloody Mary," their comic tribute to the central
woman in their lives, and "There Is Nothin' Like a Dame," a raucous
ode to womanhood in general. Also beautifully handled is "Happy
Talk," in which the Tonkinese Bloody Mary tries to persuade Lt. Cable
to propose marriage to her daughter, Liat. While Boston, as Bloody
Mary, uses her voice to paint a sunny picture of their possible life
together, Kisha Howard, as Liat, renders the same image with
lotus-like sign language and supple undulations of her torso.</TE>
<TE>   Cleale's Cable is enraptured, yet years of ingrained thought tell
him he can't marry outside his race. Suddenly ashamed, Cleale is
strangled with bitterness as he bites through the show's
groundbreaking song about prejudice, "You've Got to Be Carefully
Taught."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Faris, whose credits consist principally of flashy Las Vegas
shows, is credited as the main director, but the insightful Broadway
veteran Jerry Zaks is listed as production consultant. Whoever is
responsible, the fact remains that this production--with its emphasis
on the music--stands as a wonderfully fitting tribute to Rodgers as
the world celebrates the centenary of his birth.</TE>
<TE>   "South Pacific," Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town
Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Today-Friday, 8 p.m.; Saturday, 2 and 8
p.m.; Sunday, 2 and 7:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $27.50-$62.50. (213)

Provence Boulangerie, 191 Park Ave., Long Beach, (562) 433-8281.</LD>
<TE>   La Frite: Swiss and ham go between slices of French bread,
buttered on the outside so they will crisp. Then the whole thing is
put on the grill until it's melted on the inside and light golden
brown outside. Accompanying your sandwich is a glorious pile of crisp
skinny frites. (Croque-monsieur, $10.) La Frite, 15013 Ventura Blvd.,

<LD>   Hunt and Robbins</LD>
<LD>   to Star in 'The Guys'</LD>
<TE>   Helen Hunt ("As Good As It Gets") and Tim Robbins ("The Shawshank
Redemption") will perform Anne Nelson's new play, "The Guys," July
10-28 at the Actors' Gang Theater in Hollywood, where Robbins is the
founding artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   The one-act play, a tale about the aftermath of the Sept. 11
attacks, is still playing off-Broadway in New York, with Bill Irwin
and Amy Irving in the leads. Like that production, this one will have
rotating celebrity casts after the departure of the original duo.</TE>
<TE>   The story focuses on a New York City fire captain who lost eight
men in the collapse of the World Trade Center and the editor who
helps him write the eulogies he must deliver. Nelson, a journalism
professor, based it on her own experience and turned it into a play
at the suggestion of Jim Simpson, director of the project on the East
and West coasts.</TE>
<TE>   Simpson will also be at the helm of a big-screen version of the
film, starring his wife, Sigourney Weaver, and Anthony LaPaglia.</TE>

<TE>   Study: TVs in Bedrooms Put Pounds on Kids</TE>
<TE>   Television viewing has been linked to obesity among school-age
children, teens and adults. Now comes word that putting a TV in the
bedrooms of preschoolers also increases their risk of being
overweight.</TE>
<TE>   In a study published in this month's issue of Pediatrics, the
journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, a team of New York
researchers tracked the viewing habits of more than 2,700 preschool
children involved in government nutrition programs. It found that the
inactivity associated with TV viewing plus the tendency to eat
high-fat snacks in front of the screen is a dangerous mix.</TE>
<TE>   Average TV and video viewing habits increased from 11 hours a week
at age 1 to 18 hours a week at age 4, the study found--and
preschoolers with TVs in their bedrooms watched an additional 4.6
hours a week.</TE>

<TE>   Warwick Off the Hook on Marijuana Charges</TE>
<TE>   The state of Florida dropped a misdemeanor charge of marijuana
possession against Dionne Warwick on Wednesday after the Grammy
Award-winning singer completed a pretrial program aimed at giving
first-time offenders a second chance, a court official said.</TE>
<TE>   Warwick, 61, had been charged with marijuana possession on May 12
at Miami International Airport when baggage screeners found 11
marijuana cigarettes in her lipstick case.</TE>
<TE>   Actor Thomas Awarded Millions in Back Pay</TE>
<TE>   Philip Michael Thomas, co-star of the 1980s TV police drama "Miami
Vice," was awarded $2.3 million by the American Arbitration Assn.
over the use of his likeness by Traffix, a direct marketer, the
company said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The award ended an 8-year-old battle over the rights to use his
name and likeness in TV "infomercials." Traffix said it was reviewing
the decision and its options.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" has surpassed "The Fast

rental title of all time. The movie took in about $19.1 million after
five days, according to Video Store Magazine.... CBS has ordered six
episodes of the Nathan Lane comedy "Life of the Party," in which
he'll play an actor-turned-congressman.</TE>

<LD>* New this Week: Michael Cuesta's "L.I.E.," one of last year's
strongest--and riskiest--movies, is a coming-of-age film that is a
boldly imaginative yet subtle exploration of male sexuality in all
its contradictions, complexities and fluidity and, beyond that, the
interplay of love and sex. By the time it is through, "L.I.E." has
embraced tragedy, folly, perversity and outrageous dark humor and
takes an unflinching look at the darker aspects of life in American
suburbia. Brian Cox gives a robust yet reflective portrayal as a
tragic figure whom no parent would want in the neighborhood. Billy
Kay, Bruce Altman, James Costa and Marcia DeBonis co-star.</LD>

<HD>A Societal Study in 'Two Small Bodies'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Multiple messages pervade "Two Small Bodies," now at the Company of
Angels. Neal Bell's two-character study of societal hypocrisy
regarding maternal sexuality raises more questions than it answers,
not always deliberately.</LD>
<LD>   Inspired by the 1966 Alice Crimmins child-murder case, Bell
eschews naturalism, introducing his suspected Medea, cocktail hostess
Eileen (Caerthan Banks), in full gyration to the blare of Kenny
Klimak's sound design. With the arrival of pre-biased detective Brann
(Keith A. Brush), a neo-noir riff evolves, drawing this pair closer
while unraveling their motives.</LD>
<LD>   Under Eric Mofford's stark, Expressionistic direction, the play is
most effective as psychosexual exercise, both actors displaying
notable commitment. Banks' purposely lower-case delivery masks primal
outrage, landing lines like "Men want to make love to absolute
beauty. Women just want to make love" with conviction. Brush
maneuvers his soft-focus Gary Sinise quality and sibilant vocal
timbre to comparable effect, juggling clipped snideness and perverse
fascination with assurance.</LD>
<TE>   However, while the execution and authorial intent are determined,
the architecture and thematic statement are indeterminate. The
various sociological elements abut rather than blend with the
interrogative and satirical points, with the title metaphor unsubtly
extended and the resolution less enigmatic than convenient.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, Brann says, "You want false hope, go to church. This is
reality." Well, no, though such implosive subtext and character
detailing could gain credence in the independent film arena.</TE>
<TE>   "Two Small Bodies," Company of Angels, 2106 Hyperion Ave., Silver
Lake. Thursdays-Fridays, 8 p.m. Ends June 28. $15. (323) 883-1717.
Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes.</TE>

<HD>A Discreet Addition to the Venice Scene</HD>
<DH>Drake's, in the old St. Mark's Club, won't hang a sign or
list a number. But don't call it exclusive.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Venice Confidential: Will Karges, the restaurateur responsible for
swinging spots like Jones, Rix, Circle Bar, Voda, Blueberry and El
Dorado, will open his hippest place yet Friday just steps from the
Venice boardwalk. Drake's doesn't have a listed phone number, and
don't expect to see a sign out front or even the address. (Clue: The
door is the one just to the left of the entrance of the St. Mark's
Hotel.) "I'm not trying to be exclusive," Karges insists. "I just
want the clientele to be those who appreciate the place."</LD>
<LD>   He has renovated the old St. Mark's club, built by Abbot Kinney
around 1910, preserving the grandeur while updating it with clever
touches. (Look up and you'll find a gondola fresh from the Venice
canals.) The regional American menu will be cooked by Christian
Shaffer, whose background includes Pinot Bistro and Cicada. It's a
lively, energetic homage to Venice, Karges says. "All the good
spirits are here hanging out."</LD>
<LD>   * Drake's, 23 Windward Ave, Venice.</LD>
<TE>   Time to Go: Ludovic Lefebvre has decided to leave L'Orangerie.
Having worked there for six years (he was 24 when he began), the
charismatic young chef is now looking for a location in Santa Monica.
"I want the restaurant to be much more casual and the dishes simpler
than at L'Orangerie," he says, "but the quality to be as fine."
Lefebvre has promised L'Orangerie owner Gerard Ferry he'll stay until
a replacement is found. Comments Ferry, "We traveled the road
together, and now he needs to go his way. It's his time to make a
change."</TE>
<TE>   Ginza Sushi-Ko Goes East: Yes, it's true--Masa Takayama, the owner
and sushi master of Ginza Sushi-Ko, has decided to leave Beverly
Hills for New York City. His tiny sushi restaurant, celebrated as
much for its exquisite food as for its unparalleled high prices
(dinners begin at $350 a head), has consistently been one of Zagat's
top-rated Los Angeles restaurants, and it's the only restaurant that
Times restaurant critic S. Irene Virbila has ever awarded four stars.
It turns out Takayama has been looking for a New York location for
four years. He's found one where he'll be in very good company:
Thomas Keller of the French Laundry and Jean-Georges Vongerichten of
Jean-Georges will also be opening restaurants in the new AOL Time
Warner building at 58th and Central Park West when it opens next
year. "I'm very excited to move," Takayama says. "I need the pressure
and excitement of New York." He says he essentially plans to
re-create his restaurant there, but with even higher prices (starting
at a staggering $400 to $500 a head), and two seatings a night
instead of one. "In New York City, people eat late," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Goodells Come North: Tim and Liza Goodell, the couple behind
Orange County's Troquet and Aubergine, plan to open a restaurant in
the new Viceroy Hotel in Santa Monica by the end of the month. "It's
much less formal in concept than my other restaurants," Tim Goodell
says. "I wanted the menu to be more flexible. That's the way people
like to eat, especially in L.A." The menu will be American comfort
food with a wide variety of side dishes.</TE>
<TE>   A Quiet Opening: Steve Arroyo, whose Spanish tapas place Cobras
and Matadors has been packed since it opened a year ago, has quietly
opened a neighborhood steak house in the heart of Hollywood between
Hillhurst and Vermont. To keep prices low while still serving prime
Black Angus beef, Hillmont's diners order at the counter, then grab
seats on leather benches at one of the eight communal tables. The
menu also includes grilled seafood and poultry. Despite the cement
floors and brick walls, Arroyo has managed to create a warm
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   * Hillmont, 4655 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, (323) 669-3922.</TE>
<TE>   Small Bites: You may not find legendary Campbell's soup cans at
the Andy Warhol show, but you'll find your very own at Mirabelle's
for lunch. During the run of the Warhol exhibition, Mirabelle will be
serving warm tomato soup in the can, a tiny bowl of chili, sauerkraut
and a juicy hot dog on a "very special" bun all for $9.50....Sure, it
costs $28, but L'Orangerie serves the highest-end burger in town: a
Kobe beef patty stacked high with Brie, onions and black truffle
compote along with a rich mayonnaise sauce, all on a buttery toasted
brioche....</TE>
<TE>   You've probably never heard of Jeannie Hoverson, but she's famous
at the Tam O'Shanter. She's been waiting tables there since JFK was
president and Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were vying for the most
home runs. That makes it 41 years this month. Happy anniversary.</TE>

<LD>There could scarcely be a more appropriate selection to kick off
LACMA's Double Exposure: Photography Plus Film Equals Cinema, a
series that considers the relationship between film and photography.
Swiss documentarian Christian Frei's acclaimed "War Photographer"
(Friday at 7:30 p.m.) is a remarkable portrait of a remarkable man,
James Nachtwey, who has been hailed as the world's greatest war
photographer.</LD>
<LD>   A slim, silver-haired man of 52 with the looks and presence of a
movie star, Nachtwey has been determined to serve the victims of
battle and poverty the world over. A man of quiet dignity and
compassion, he does not exploit his subjects but rather expresses
their plight through his pictures, which are astonishing documents of
terrible events and deeds.</LD>
<LD>   Frei's documentary begins with a quote from World War II
photographer Robert Capa: "If your pictures aren't good enough, you
aren't close enough." When the situation calls for it, Nachtwey could
scarcely get closer, nor in turn could Frei in following him into
Kosovo after widespread massacres, into the thick of the action in
Ramallah and then into the shantytowns of Jakarta, Indonesia, and a
sulfur mine in East Java. Inspired by the vivid images from Vietnam,
the Massachusetts-born Dartmouth graduate tells us that he soon knew
he wanted to be a war photographer.</LD>
<TE>   Providing insights into Nachtwey are such colleagues and friends
as CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Stern magazine foreign editor
Hans-Hermann Klare and Geo Saison editor in chief Christiane
Breustedt, his onetime lover, who says she wishes they could have had
a closer relationship but respects the demands of his work.
Screenwriter Denis O'Neill, Nachtwey's best friend since college,
adds that because of Nachtwey's dedication, he has never been able to
sustain a long-term relationship or start a family. Even so,
Nachtwey, while driven in the pursuit of his profession, comes across
as a man content with his priorities. (323) 857-6010.</TE>

<TE>   Steven Hanft's droll "Southlander," tonight at 7:30 p.m. at the
Egyptian in the American Cinematheque's Alternative Cinema showcase,
offers an amusing, funky, near-surreal journey though L.A.'s music
underground. Chance (Rory Cochrane) searches for the rare '69
Mullowtron synthesizer stolen from his seedy station wagon. He had
just acquired the instrument, whose distinctive "space" sound landed
him a gig as a keyboardist with a band about to go on tour. His
quest, aided dubiously by his flaky pal (Ross Harris), a rock-star
wannabe, reveals the overlapping and unnoticed worlds of Los Angeles,
the only place this odyssey could unfold with any credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Hanft has a laid-back manner and a visual panache that are just
right for this quirky adventure, which has a terrific music track.
The film acquaints us with, among others, a sinister, passe rock
superstar (a sly Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs) and an intense, millionaire
New Age musician (Gregg Henry, spot on) dedicated to destroying
electronic instruments. Cochrane admirably conveys Chance's cool
manner in an increasingly frustrating predicament. There are cameos
from Beth Orton, Beck and, in a funny salvage-yard vignette, Hank
Williams III. (323) 466-FILM.</TE>

<TE>   "The Temptress" (1926), which screens Friday through Sunday at the
Silent Movie, has been aptly described as Hollywood hokum, but it's
nonetheless a splendid example of Greta Garbo turning dross into
gold. Garbo's mentor, the great Mauritz Stiller, adapted a Vicente
Blasco-Ibanez novel to the screen. He was to direct, but Irving
Thalberg yanked the project away from him for a rewrite and gave it
to Fred Niblo, fresh off "Ben-Hur."</TE>
<TE>   Blasco-Ibanez's novels "The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse" and
"Blood and Sand" became two of the most enduring movies of Rudolph
Valentino, the second under Niblo's direction. But "The Temptress" is
so lurid and dated it's hard to imagine what Stiller could have done
with the material that Niblo didn't. Indeed, Niblo's straightforward
storytelling skills, his sense of the pictorial and his energy lend
the film a vitality.</TE>
<TE>   Garbo's Elena captivates Antonio Moreno's Robledo at a masked ball
in Paris, where they pledge their mutual and undying love. The
dashing engineer then discovers she is the wife of his good friend
the Marquis de Torre Bianca (Armand Kaliz). If that's not enough of a
jolt, the next evening Robledo joins the Torre Biancas at a grand
banquet thrown by a banker (Marc MacDermott), who offers a toast to
Elena, declaring that she is a woman "who asks for nothing but takes
all a man has to give and more," then he swallows a glass of
champagne into which he has slipped a fatal dose of poison.</TE>
<TE>   The ensuing scandal surrounding the banker's dramatic suicide
drives the Marquise from the country, and, accompanied by Elena, he
turns up at Robledo's ranch, apparently having no other friend to
turn to. Elena's presence is guaranteed to wreak havoc on more men,
including Lionel Barrymore, although Robledo, the one she truly
loves, is determined to get on with building a dam in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   Garbo's Elena is different from other silent-era vamps in that she
is passive, and while she lives an empty existence, she says in her
defense that men want her not for herself but for her body, and not
for her happiness but their own. Hardly any other actress could seem
so ravishing yet radiate such spiritual longing--and while wearing an
immense wardrobe of elegant gowns. This sumptuous production has an
astonishing, unexpected coda in which Garbo is no less than sublime.

<TE>   The Goethe Institute's annual Blockbuster series of recent German
hits continues Tuesday at 7 p.m. at its headquarters, 5750 Wilshire
Blvd., Suite 100, with Ralf Huettner's giddy romantic comedy
"Moonlight Tariff." Gruschenka Stevens stars as a vivacious artist
who has just met a doctor (Tim Bergmann) and experienced a night of
incomparable love with him. But that was Wednesday and now Saturday
looms without Stevens' Cora having received a call from the doctor.
Cora is out of her mind with anxiety, but her best friend, Jo (Jasmin
Tabatabai), insists that a woman must never call a man after they
have had sex--he should make the next move. As her desperation grows,
Cora starts to do the one thing Jo doesn't want her to do, which is
to think for herself. (323) 525-3388.</TE>

<TE>   The 76-minute "Taylor Mead's Ass" (1964) and the 66-minute "Eating
Too Fast" (1966) continue the Warhol on Screen series, which is part
of MOCA's Andy Warhol Retrospective. Scheduled for Friday at 7 p.m.
at the Pacific Design Center's SilverScreen Theater, both are tests
of the viewer's patience. In the first, a static camera is pointed at
the naked buttocks of scrawny Factory regular Mead, who does wriggle
around like a burlesque star but not, alas, to the same erotic
effect. The second features art critic and writer Gregory Battcock,
an authority on the underground cinema movement of the '60s, seated
before a camera and seeming utterly oblivious to the sex act
ostensibly being performed upon him out of camera range. Only a phone
call sparks his enthusiasm. It's a sly, wry comment on impersonal
sex, but only Warhol would turn it into an hour-plus long film. MOCA
is nonetheless to be commended for presenting so comprehensive a
survey of Warhol's films. (213) 621-1745.</TE>

<DH>The Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet introduces itself with a
grab bag of pieces that emphasize company strengths as well as
weaknesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you consider the Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet as primarily a
contemporary creative instrument, it's easy to understand the
strengths and weaknesses of its local debut Tuesday at the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   Officially the dance component of the Stanislavsky and
Nemirovich-Danchenko Moscow Music Theatre, the company is known for
works that extend, deepen and personalize the academic classical
tradition. So if its current seven-performance engagement emphasizes
hand-me-down repertory, this is very much a company sideline, not its
specialty.</LD>
<LD>   The opening mixed bill or gala dutifully assembled some of the
leading names in Russian choreography: Marius Petipa, of course, but
also Mikhail Fokine, Leonid Lavrovsky and Victor Gsovsky. (Other
Russian icons will be danced later in the engagement.) But the
company looked like a world-class ensemble only in private property:
artistic director Dmitry Bryantsev's neo-Romantic 1995 Chopin suite
"The Spirit Ball."</LD>
<TE>   In a gauzy, ghostly ballroom designed by Vladimir Arefiev, five
couples caught in a meaningless social whirl relived relationships
through a series of fantasy duets--each one rich in feeling,
technical challenges and choreographic invention.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone looked effortless in the unusual lifts and floor
maneuvers (supported turns with the woman rolling delicately across
the stage, for instance), but everyone danced as if given a gift, an
opportunity and a token of respect--all true. In addition, Valery
Basiladze conducted with impressive sensitivity and Alexander Andreev
capably attended to the solo piano passages.</TE>
<TE>   New ballets that can capture a refined sensibility are rare
enough, and those that can generate a unanimity of impulse from its
cast are rarer still. Coming at the beginning of a three-hour Moscow
Stanislavsky marathon, "The Spirit Ball" inspired expectations that
the rest of the evening left unfulfilled.</TE>
<TE>   Georgy Smilevsky and Natalia Krapivina, for instance, danced
Bryantsev's extended, mercurial first duet with a luminous rapport
that they failed to generate later on in the simpler, showier
choreography of Gsovsky's familiar "Grand Pas Classique" (untitled in
the unreliable program booklet). Indeed, Smilevsky remained off form
technically until the coda and, for all her facility with fouettes,
Krapivina lacked the majestic phrasing that this showpiece demands.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Bryantsev had provided an artful context for Oxana
Kuzmenko's eerie intensity in the contorted second duet from "The
Spirit Ball," but this technically accomplished but dangerously
emaciated principal couldn't make passages from Act 2 of "Giselle"
(credited to Petipa) yield anything but isolated effects--a high
extension here, fleet and light footwork there. Stansilav Boukharaev
made a promising, small-scale Albrecht.</TE>
<TE>   The technically uneven Victor Dik had partnered Kuzmenko soberly
in "The Spirit Ball," but grew callow and unaccountably smirky in the
evening's biggest disappointment: Nina Belikova's restaging of
Fokine's "Chopiniana" (a.k.a. "Les Sylphides").</TE>
<TE>   Like most Russian companies, the Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet danced
it in academic style, without the airy suppleness that marks
"Chopiniana" as a 20th century vision of Romanticism. But even within
these limits, Dik's fatuousness, the rocky technique of Katarina
Borchenko (the Prelude solo), the well-drilled but constricted corps
dancing and the rather thin orchestral sound under conductor Georgy
Zhemchuzhin undermined the company's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Only Tatiana Chernobrovkina (the Pas de Deux) marshaled enough
floating lyricism and personal radiance to free the choreography,
just as the spirited, elegant Natalia Ledovskaya and three uncredited
women seemed the only reasonable justification for reviving
Lavrovsky's kitsch-laden "Walpurgis Night" even as a suite of
excerpts.</TE>
<TE>   Skinny Viacheslav Buchkovsky and burly Roman Malenko skillfully
dominated the "Walpurgis Night" corps of horny satyrs, but lustfully
pawing Ledovskaya, hurling her through the air, or raising her in the
infamous Soviet crotch lift count as cheap thrills in any language.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Moscow audiences still get diverted by watching
underdressed, muscle-pumping guys make themselves ridiculous on a
desperate prowl for booty. But those of us who live in Hollywood can
see all that out on the street.</TE>

<LD>More awards, less show: At the Oscars, that's a common plea heard
when, at the three-hour mark, as everyone awaits the major winners,
we must first endure a 20-minute interpretive dance homage to the
oeuvre of Krzysztof Kieslowski.</LD>
<LD>   At the MTV Movie Awards, it's easy to wish for the opposite. After
all, how many people are white-knuckling over who will be named best
villain or best on-screen team? (And if you cared, you would've seen
the results in the media earlier this week.) What matters is the
showmanship.</LD>
<LD>   The first 12 minutes of the 10th annual celebration-cum-spoof,
taped Saturday at the Shrine Auditorium, relentlessly hyped by MTV
and airing tonight at 9, brilliantly display such style. Hosts Jack
Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar hit the perfect comedic tone in a
"Spider-Man" parody and in an opening musical number that would have
done Busby Berkeley perversely proud.</LD>
<TE>   Then they had to ruin it by handing out the awards, voted on by
MTV viewers. The honors and acceptance speeches are largely
irrelevant; what's more important, judging from the hooting and
hollering, is the chance to ogle the stars vying for the golden
popcorn buckets.</TE>
<TE>   Although two more movie parodies, energetic performances by the
White Stripes and Eminem as well as the dubious singing debut of Ozzy
Osbourne's daughter Kelly buoy the "Moulin Rouge"-themed show, they
can't save it from sinking into the morass of self-congratulation
that these two hours intend to ridicule.</TE>

<DH>Where to watch the Lakers' title run? It's a slam-dunk--try
a sports bar.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yes, yes, the Lakers are in the NBA Finals again, which means there
is only a short time left this summer in which you have the excuse to
hang out in bars and act like a lunatic for the express purpose of
watching television.</LD>
<LD>   Why in a bar? Well, for one thing, finding friends willing to let
six people invade their house to drink beer and scream at the top of
their lungs can be a bit of a pain, unless said host has a fondness
for scrubbing salsa out of the carpet or unplugging toilets. Besides,
watching the game in public when the final outcome of the series is
pretty much a foregone conclusion (the Lakers will win in five games,
or at worst six) allows you to take in other sights while drowning
out the banter of commentators Bill Walton and Steve "Snapper" Jones,
which as any avid basketball fan will tell you, is a major bonus.</LD>
<LD>   As for the window closing on this behavior, if you think about it,
there really isn't another bar-worthy sporting event until the
college football season kicks off around Labor Day, unless you can
get truly motivated regarding the Dodgers or Angels in June and July.
Now, no offense, but with a 162-game season, if you feel compelled to
watch baseball outside the house before October you either have a
drinking problem or a strong desire to avoid going home.</LD>
<TE>   So back to the NBA Finals, and more to the point, where to watch
them. Having grown up in the San Fernando Valley and moved back there
a couple of years ago, I can tell you that if the valley does secede,
those remaining in Los Angeles won't be losing any great sports bars
in the process. Thus far, in fact, I have failed to find any really
worthwhile location north of Mulholland to watch a game, unless you
count Stanley's on Ventura Boulevard, where there are a couple of
small TVs and the focus is on scoring of a different variety.</TE>
<TE>   Chalk it up as a personal bias, too, that I find it depressing to
drink near airports, which vetoes Champions, an otherwise perfectly
respectable, by-the-numbers sports bar not far from LAX. Or maybe
it's just that I have a hard time taking any establishment where the
wait staff wears referees' jerseys seriously.</TE>
<TE>   By force of habit, then, I find myself drawn back to the Westside
for such events, or on rarer occasions to Pasadena, where there are
several beer-worthy locales, including Gordon Biersch and Crown City
Brewery.</TE>
<TE>   The first rule for any sports bar, of course, is that you ought to
be able to see a TV screen virtually anywhere you look, without
having to crane your neck excessively to see around the oblate guy
who hasn't moved from his corner seat since 1967. After all, if I
wanted to exercise, I'd be out playing the game, not planted in a
chair watching it.</TE>
<TE>   Rule No. 2 generally involves offering a wide assortment of beers
(sure, you can drink a purple martini to cheer on the Lakers if you
want, but come on) and food that it is greasy enough to soak up said
beer without providing you cause for regret partway through the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Another key factor, for some, would involve the age of the patrons
(younger is generally deemed an advantage) and the ratio of men to
women. Fortunately, we're talking about Los Angeles, so even people
who really are committed to watch the game can't stop themselves from
preening and posing to catch the eye of those scouting for talent. In
short, any bar worth the salt on its margarita, with the Lakers
playing in the NBA Finals, ought to have more than its share of
beautiful people to ogle, whether that's your game or just a
spectator sport.</TE>
<TE>   A final personal rule would be to try avoiding any venue where TV
station crews are likely to congregate, which invites all kinds of
posturing and shouting and idiotic behavior--and that's just by the
TV reporters. Much as I love Hooters, for example, for its
hard-working and intelligent staff, I can do without the shots of the
local TV bunny surrounded by people screaming "Laaa-kerssssss!
Wooooo!" behind her before she throws it back to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   By process of elimination, then (and in at least one instance,
court order), I find myself drawn back repeatedly to two venues:
Maloney's on Campus in Westwood, a good old-fashioned college bar
with plenty of TVs, large beers and perfectly fine greasy cuisine;
and the San Francisco Saloon in West Los Angeles, a neighborhood bar
that has undergone more than its share of personality changes over
the years but which offers a warm, inviting atmosphere to catch the
game. In fact, I once watched a football game at the Saloon dressed
in a tuxedo, with a soon-to-be-married friend and several of his
groomsmen. For the record, the three shots and beer chaser made the
wedding itself much more enjoyable.</TE>
<TE>   Look at it this way: Watching the game in a bar provides you some
of the excitement of being there (for what it's worth, those rich
folks in the luxury boxes wind up watching most of the action on TV
too), without having to hassle parking, paying $8 for a puny beer or
worry about your date running off with Jack Nicholson.</TE>
<TE>   Or you can watch the game at home. If you invite friends over,
though, be advised to have the carpet cleaner and plunger handy.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Downtown</LD>
<LD>   Staples Center--Good luck getting tickets for a home game. But if
you're interested in seeing an away game, Staples broadcasts them for
spectators on a big-screen TV. (Tickets, available now for all away
games, cost $10 for adults, $5 for children between 2 and 14.) If
that doesn't work out, try Fox Sports Sky Box, a restaurant built to
resemble an TV studio, with satellite feeds covering every sporting
event on the air, real-time score tickers and no less than 54 screens
(the largest one 16 feet wide). It's game-watching at its most
decadent, but be forewarned: It's also a pillar of home-team
allegiance. Unless you plan to burn it, leave your Nets gear at home.
Staples Center, 1111 S. Figueroa St., downtown L.A., (213) 742-7340
or Ticketmaster, (213) 480-3232. Fox Sports Sky Box, (213) 742-7345.</LD>
<LD>   Westside</LD>
<TE>   Maloney's on Campus--This Westwood joint gets its fair share of
Bruin business , but it's proven just as popular with nonstudents.
Maybe the 23 TV sets, four of them big-screen, have something to do
with it. Maybe it's beer company promos. Or maybe watching the Lakers
is just one of those activities that transcends age barriers. 1000
Gayley Ave., Westwood, (310) 208-1942.</TE>
<TE>   Hooters--If you're looking for viable Laker Girl substitutes, you
can't do much better than this gleefully lowbrow joint. The menu
features contests galore: jersey raffles, halftime trivia and, of
course, a wing-eating contest. And as these are Hooters Wings, bring
a competitive appetite. Also, bring a wallet, and be sure you use it
throughout the evening if you don't want to get kicked out--there's
plenty more where you came from. 321 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa
Monica. (310) 458-7555; Also, 96 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626)
395-7700; 130 Pine Ave., Long Beach, (562) 983-1010; 2406 Newport
Blvd., Newport Beach, (949) 723-5800.</TE>
<TE>   San Fernando Valley</TE>
<TE>   Champs--Basketball wasn't invented to lower anyone's blood
pressure (if relaxation's your thing, take a mud bath), but Champs'
refreshingly down-to-earth feel comes as close to soothing as the
sport gets. That said, expect a turnout of at least 150 to 200 rabid
fans at this popular bar. Also expect a discount price on a
particular brand of beer, selected at random. On the off chance that
you get bored watching the 12 TVs, two of which are big-screen, take
a break at one of the free pool tables. 4103 W. Burbank Blvd.,
Burbank, (818) 840-9493.</TE>
<TE>   Universal CityWalk--Parked in the middle of CityWalk's Cinema
Plaza, adjacent to the Hard Rock Cafe, is the 18-by-22-foot
Astrovision screen. And parked in front of that on any Lakers playoff
night are about 1,000 screaming fans, many of whom line up hours in
advance to stake out their seats. The good news: It's noisy. The
other good news: It's freer than a free throw. Universal CityWalk,
Hollywood Freeway at Lankershim Boulevard, (818) 622-9539.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Doodles--Beer promotions from Budweiser and Miller; raffles
on gift certificates, prizes, shirts and hats; ESPN Radio on game
nights; a special menu featuring old-fashioned American cuisine at
bargain prices--hopefully, you'll still find time to watch the game.
It would be hard not to; this two-story, 600-person-capacity bar has
40 TVs, eight of them big screens. 21870 Victory Blvd., Woodland
Hills, (818) 833-3030. 1410 3rd St. (Third Street Promenade) Santa
Monica, (310) 394-4632.</TE>
<TE>   San Gabriel Valley</TE>
<TE>   Moose McGillycuddys--One of Pasadena nightlife's most reliable
establishments has a relatively low-key evening in store--that is, if
five big-screen TVs, 27 smaller ones and a restaurant filled to
capacity fit your definition of low-key. No free drinks or other
giveaways here, but with a dance floor, live music and DJs spinning
tunes from the '70s, '80s and '90s, it's still a sizable bargain. 119
E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 304-9955.</TE>
<TE>   National Sports Grill &amp; Bar--Eight large-projection screens
(approximately 10 feet each) plus one 21-foot screen (that's roughly
three Shaqs) equals a sure-fire recipe for record turnout: On game
nights, San Gabriel Valley's prime viewing spot serves as many as 900
patrons, with 200 more trying to fight their way in. Management is
smart enough to keep the crowd happy by auctioning off valuable Laker
memorabilia, from autographed photos to leather team jackets. 1360 W.
Garvey Ave., West Covina, (626) 856-1000.</TE>
<TE>   Q's Billiards--The folks at Q's were shrewd enough to procure
authentic Laker jerseys to raffle off during recent games. (They're
washed, of course. Take that as a good thing or a bad thing.) Expect
the trend to continue, with even a pair of shorts or jackets thrown
in if you're lucky. Four big-screen TVs, 30 smaller TVs, three floors
and a capacity of 900 people--you do the math. But don't forget the
$5 cover charge. 99 E. Colorado Blvd., Pasadena, (626) 405-9777.</TE>
<TE>   South Bay</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach Brewing Co.--More of a family establishment than a
sports bar, and the ratio of Laker fans to strollers who just
happened to walk in from the boardwalk is pretty close to even.
Still, Redondo Beach Brewing Co. sees game-night turnouts well in
excess of its nearly 200-person capacity, and with two TV-packed
stories and a 41/2-foot flat screen, no-nonsense basketball fans
should go home happy regardless of the game's outcome. 1814 S.
Catalina Ave., Redondo Beach, (310) 316-8477.</TE>
<TE>   Southeast</TE>
<TE>   All American Sports Bar &amp; Grill--The nerve-racking spectacle that
was Game 7 played to 120 patrons, but All American's 12 TVs, two of
them big-screen, draw about 50 to 60 on average--ideal for those of
you who appreciate a good crowd but appreciate your eardrums even
more. And with giveaways that include Dodgers and Angels tickets, as
well as basketballs and jerseys, it's a haven for the all-around
sports aficionado. Actually, with a $10 discount on all orders
exceeding $20, it's a haven for people who like to save money. 165 S.
Harbor Blvd., La Habra, (562) 691-9311.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County</TE>
<TE>   Champps Americana--Shaq and Kobe look nearly as big at Champps
Americana as they would in person, courtesy of the restaurant's
8-by-10-foot jumbo TV. There are also 41 other screens for those who
want a different angle. During commercial breaks, the excitement
keeps going with a DJ sound booth and dancing. 51 Fortune Drive,
Irvine. (949) 453-9333.</TE>
<TE>   Champions--If cheering for the home team makes you thirsty, head
on down to Champions in Irvine. This sports bar and grill, in the
Marriott Hotel, offers draft beer for $3 during the games, with an
additional dollar if you want to keep the NBA glass it comes in.
Appetizers are also half-priced after the first buzzer. 18000 Von
Karman Ave., Irvine, (949) 724-3616.</TE>
<TE>   ESPN Zone--This sports complex at Downtown Disney has more than
165 TVs total, but we recommend just one: the 16-footer located in
the special screening room. You'll need tickets to get in--but
they're free, and available today for Friday's game. Pick them up in
the merchandise store; there's a limit of two tickets per guest. If
you're itching for giveaways, ESPN Radio will be on hand Friday to
dole out Angels tickets and assorted ESPN goodies. $25 minimum per
person. 1545 Disneyland Drive, Anaheim, (714) 300-3776.</TE>
<TE>   Sports Rock Cafe--Eight-thousand square feet. One hundred
satellite TVs (two big screens, 40 27-inchers and 46 19-inchers).
It's one of the newest sports bars to hit Orange County, but
something tells us the adjustment phase is over. As its name implies,
Sports Rock Cafe caters to a more eclectic crowd; even hard-core
Laker fans should stay behind after Friday's game for the live band.
If that doesn't entice you, the extended Happy Hour ('til 11 p.m.)
should. 545 Westminster Mall Road, Westminster, (714) 379-9607.</TE>

<KH>VENTURA COUNTY CULTURE</KH>
<HD>Celebrating the Vital Spirit of Ventura's Late Art City</HD>
<DH>The Studio Channel Islands Art Center in Camarillo will
offer a tribute to the former gallery and enclave.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEF WOODARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Art City: Even the name seems like something out of a dream, some
ironic utopian vision of a community in which art and the muse rule.
It could trigger flashbacks to the '60s counterculture or the
wide-eyed idealism of Bauhaus.</LD>
<LD>   But Art City was a reality, if a humble and funky entity, for many
years in Ventura. A vital gallery and studio enclave on the fringe
between Ventura and the Ventura River, Art City ended in January, due
to a shift in property usage. Its role in the fabric of local culture
has been missed already.</LD>
<LD>   If only briefly, Art City rises again at the Studio Channel
Islands Art Center in Camarillo, another space existing proudly on
the fringes of the commercial area. "A Tribute to Art City" brings
artwork normally found in the rustically inviting Art City gallery,
but here seen in the tidy, carpeted confines of SCIAC's main gallery.
It's almost disorienting, without creaking floorboards and rafters
overhead.</LD>
<TE>   You know you've arrived by the odd sentry near the front door of
the Art Center.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to Eric Richards' life-size bronze replica of a vintage
motorcycle policeman, part of a memorial to the St. Francis dam
disaster in the late '20s, which wreaked destruction in Santa Paula
and cast a dark shadow over Mulholland's name. But that's another
story.</TE>
<TE>   Art City founder and general gatekeeper Paul Lindhard is seen in a
fond, aptly scraggly portrait by Paul Benavidez, capturing the
restless creative energy of the subject in a flourish of Philip
Pearlstein-like observation. Then, on the gallery floor, is a recent
sculpture by Lindhard, a mutant geological and anatomical piece
winkingly titled "Widemouth."</TE>
<TE>   A different sort of melded imagery is seen in Alexandra Morosco's
"Nursing the Raven," in which a nude, oozing out of stone, coddles a
raven. Dan Lyman's insect sculptures, fashioned from rusty auto
parts, crawl about the windows, and Benavidez's own concertedly
messy, trash-bedecked assemblage piece, "The Place That Is Jenin,"
asserts its timely message.</TE>
<TE>   In two-dimensional art, M.B. Hanrahan's large, slightly woozy
"Still Life" uses cartoonish imagery to put forth an essay on death
and Disney. Peter Eble's mixed-media "Rorschach Series" is
psycho-decorative, and Marilyn Noad's "Leaving Tinseltown" is a dark,
stormy and roughhewn landscape, leaving us to speculate on the
artist's flight from SoCal superficiality. Alberta Fins' "Wounded by
the 'Rite' " is one of her typically sweet-and-sour works, stirring
up creative energy, visceral techniques and a sense of questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Art continues in the back of Georgia O'Keeffe Gallery, with an
especially effective gathering of four painters whose work is mostly
abstract and mostly neo-expressionistic.</TE>
<TE>   Joining Fins, Eble and Noad is Richard Schaeffer, who has an
ability to create landscapes with a secret life as abstraction.</TE>
<TE>   * "A Tribute to Art City," Studio Channel Islands Art Center at
CSU Channel Islands, Camarillo. Ends July 6. Thursdays to Saturdays,
noon to 3 p.m. (805) 383-1368.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Artful Busing: Sculptor Dennis Oppenheim was commissioned to adorn
the Ventura bus transfer center, and the official unveiling will be
at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday. For the occasion, local new music man Jeff
Kaiser and Los Angeles-based avant-reedist Vinnie Golia will present
a new commissioned musical work.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday night, hear Oppenheim speak at the Laurel Theater, in
conversation with Donna Granata, as part of her "Focus on the
Masters" series.</TE>
<TE>   * Opening of bus transfer center, north end of the Pacific View
Mall, Mills and Telegraph roads, Ventura, Wednesday, 4:30 to 6:30
p.m. Musical program begins at 5:30 p.m. (805) 658-4768. Dennis
Oppenheim, in conversation with Donna Granata, 7 p.m. Tuesday, Laurel
Theater, 1006 E. Main St., Ventura (805) 658-4768.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dance Notes Local and Upward: Tonight's presentation of "The World
of Dance" at the Pacific High School Performing Arts Center has its
own built-in allure for regional dance aficionados. But there's a
particular cause for local pride in that it also represents the
farewell performance for gifted Venturan Jennifer Whalen. All of 17,
Whalen was recently contracted as a member of the American Ballet
Theatre Studio Company, a junior arm of the celebrated American
Ballet Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Whalen was a student of Linda Strangio-Hedberg, whose Poinsettia
School of Ballet is one of several dance groups on the program.</TE>
<TE>   * "The World of Dance," Pacifica High School Performing Arts
Center, 600 E. Gonzales Road, Oxnard, 7 p.m. today. Advance: $8
general, $6 children 12 and younger, $5 senior citizens and students.
At the door, $10. (805) 985-3639.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Library Sounds: The classical music season has generally come
easing to a halt in Ventura County. Many are left to head south or
north--to Santa Barbara's always intriguing Music Academy of the West
season--for live musical sustenance.</TE>
<TE>   But all is not lost. A monthly chamber music series has begun at
the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, every second Saturday from 2
to 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   This Saturday, the Moorpark Chamber Ensemble, drawn from players
in the Moorpark Symphony Orchestra, will perform in the courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   * Moorpark Chamber Ensemble, Ronald Reagan Presidential Library,
40 Presidential Drive, Simi Valley, Saturday, 2 p.m. Free. (800)

<LD>Snead obituary--Golfer Sam Snead missed a three-foot putt on the
final hole of a playoff in the 1947 U.S. Open against Lew Worsham.
The distance was incorrect in Snead's obituary May 24. Also, Snead
three-putted from the edge of the 17th green in the 1949 U.S. Open to
lose to Cary Middlecoff. He did not miss a three-foot putt on the
hole, as reported incorrectly in Snead's obituary.</LD>

<HD>Glaus' Homer Lifts Angels, 7-5</HD>
<DH>Baseball: His two-run blast to center in 10th inning gives
Anaheim a come-from-behind victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS FOSTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those sizzling days of May are well behind the Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes the hard part: the rest of the season.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels won Wednesday when Troy Glaus launched a two-run homer
in the bottom of the 10th inning for a 7-5 victory over the Texas
Rangers in front of 15,301 at Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   The Rangers' Ismael Valdes outpitched Jarrod Washburn. But it was
Washburn who was beaming in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Gonzalez and Alex Rodriguez hit long--make that very
long--home runs. The Angels hit three in the last two innings, by
Glaus, Tim Salmon and Brad Fullmer.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers took a 5-4 lead into the bottom of the 10th. The
Angels took home the victory. It wasn't pretty, but ...</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter how you get it, whether it's little ball or
someone blasts a home run, the important thing is to get the win,"
Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kennedy doubled off closer Hideki Irabu to lead off the 10th.
David Eckstein bunted for a base hit. Darin Erstad's weak grounder
plated Kennedy with the tying run. Glaus then hammered a 2-and-1
pitch to center for the Angels' fourth walk-off home run this season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy when you are leading the whole game and every one is
playing great," Washburn said. "But to be the great team that we want
to be and that we think we are, these are the games you have to win.
Someone gets the big hit or makes the key play. This was a step
forward for us tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Irabu was the one who had the footprints on his back. The Rangers
were headed for a 4-2 victory when he took the mound in the ninth. He
got one out, then watched back-to-back pitches leave the ball park.
Fullmer homered to right and Salmon to left.</TE>
<TE>   "That what is great about this team," Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have guys who can change the game with one swing."</TE>
<TE>   For Salmon, this was another sign of resurgence.</TE>
<TE>   His double and homer Wednesday extended his hitting streak to
eight games. Salmon is 15 for 30 during the streak and has raised his
average from .229 on May 28 to .270.</TE>
<TE>   "My track record says that I've always been this way," Salmon
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have started slow every season. But last season brought
everything into question. Hopefully, at the end of the season, we'll
be saying it was just another typical year for me."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have vaulted into the American League West race--two
games behind Seattle--by feasting on lesser teams.</TE>
<TE>   They went 19-7 in May while playing only two teams with winning
records.</TE>
<TE>   The Rangers fall into that "lesser" category, as they are 10 games
under .500 and 13 1/2 games out of first place in the West. Their
main objective right now is avoiding their second last-place finish
since signing shortstop Rodriguez to a hefty contract before the 2001
season.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn was 5-0 in his last eight starts and his earned-run
average has plummeted like the Dow Jones average in a bear market. He
churned out another solid performance Wednesday, yet the things that
had served him well went into hibernation at times.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez tagged him in the second, burying the first pitch into
the left-field seats for his 400th home run. He ranks 34th on the
all-time list.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez sent Washburn's first pitch in the fourth well beyond
the center-field fence for his league-high 20th home run to tie the
score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm going to give up home runs, I'd rather they be solo ones,"
Washburn said. "It's quick, it's painless and it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Washburn gave up four runs, three earned, in 6 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels did little against Valdes, a pitcher they cast off
after last season. He signed a one-year, $2.5-million contract with
the Rangers, his fourth team in the last four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   With a 3-5 record, Valdes' cost-per-victory may be a bit
extravagant thus far, but he has been money against the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   He went seven innings, giving up two runs and five hits, retiring
15 of the last 16 batters. In three games against the Angels this
season, Valdes has given up five runs in 22 1/3 innings.</TE>

<LD>   "I know I'm a rookie, but I have been playing baseball for a
while," said Driskill, 30, who made his major league debut in April.
"I wasn't going to let this faze me. This is the mecca of baseball."</LD>
<TE>   Driskill had never been to New York before this week and compared
pitching at Yankee Stadium to playing in the Tokyo Dome. Most of the
Yankees had never heard of him.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The bespectacled Driskill isn't overpowering, but he was effective
against the Yankees, who lead the majors with 339 runs and 97 homers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even 6 feet tall and I pitch with glasses on," he said.
"I don't think I'm the most intimidating guy. When they watched the
video, they saw I throw strikes and I'm sure they put their hitting
shoes on."</TE>
<TE>   New York got a runner to second base in only one of the first
seven innings and Driskill had a 4-1 lead with two out and nobody on
in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   But Bernie Williams singled and Jorge Posada homered, ending an
0-for-13 streak. That ended Driskill's night after 121 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Driskill, in his third career start, gave up three runs and seven
hits in 7 2/3 innings. He walked two and struck out six.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 11, Detroit 0--Derek Lowe (9-2) became the AL's first
nine-game winner, giving up two hits in six innings at Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Nomar Garciaparra, Johnny Damon and Carlos Baerga each drove in
three runs for the Red Sox, who improved to 24-6 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 6, Minnesota 4--Ellis Burks and Jim Thome backed C.C.
Sabathia with consecutive first-inning home runs at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Thome hit his 300th career homer, a night after the Indians' 23-2
loss to the Twins tied the largest losing margin in team history.</TE>
<TE>   Sabathia (5-4) won for the second time in three starts, pitching 7
1/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 8, Toronto 6--Wilson Alvarez won for the first time in
nearly three years, and the Devil Rays ended a five-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Delgado hit his 14th homer for the host Blue Jays, who had
won five in a row and lost for the first time in three games under
new Manager Carlos Tosca.</TE>
<TE>   Alvarez (1-1), who sat out the last two seasons recovering from
shoulder surgery, gave up two runs and six hits in six innings for
his first victory since defeating Cleveland on Aug. 29, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 6, Kansas City 1--Gary Glover pitched three-hit ball for
seven innings at Chicago, and Kenny Lofton hit a bases-loaded triple.</TE>
<TE>   Glover (2-1) gave up one run, walked one and struck out five. He
had not pitched past the fifth inning in any of his previous five
starts.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 5, Oakland 0--Jamie Moyer (5-2) gave up four hits and
struck out three in eight innings, and Ruben Sierra had three hits to
lead the Mariners at Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki extended his hitting streak to 14 games with a
single in the seventh inning, and Dan Wilson had two hits and drove
in a run for the AL West-leading Mariners.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after making pitcher Joe Saunders their No. 1 pick, the Angels
signed him.</LD>
<LD>   Saunders, who pitched at Virginia Tech, had agreed to a pre-draft
deal that will pay him a $1.825-million signing bonus, according to
baseball sources.</LD>
<LD>   "The financial part of it was not a big deal for me or my agent,"
Saunders said.</LD>
<TE>   The financial part was probably a contributing factor in the
Angels selecting him 12th overall.</TE>
<TE>   Casey Kotchman, the Angels' top pick in 2001, was the 13th player
taken overall and signed for $2.075 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to have this done," Saunders said. "I had heard all the
bad stories about the difficulties between agents and teams. None of
that happened here."</TE>
<TE>   Saunders, 20, was 9-2 with a 2.86 earned-run average as a junior
at Virginia Tech.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have assigned Saunders to their Class-A team in Provo,
Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have drafted a pitcher first in five of the last six
drafts.</TE>
<TE>   They drafted 28 more players, including 17 pitchers, Wednesday. Of
the 50 players they drafted, 27 were pitchers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Police were needed to separate players brawling during Tuesday
night's game between Salt Lake City, the Angels' triple-A affiliate,
and Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The game was delayed 40 minutes after Salt Lake City's Brendan
Donnelly hit Iowa's Julio Zuleta with a pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly, who played for the Angels earlier this season, was one
of 11 players and coaches ejected.</TE>
<TE>   The brawl escalated and incidents included Angel pitching prospect
Edwin Nina being chased across the infield before being tackled by a
group of Iowa players.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Coast League officials are investigating the fight and
suspensions probably will follow.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Jeff DaVanon, who has been playing for Salt Lake City,
returned to Anaheim on Wednesday to undergo an MRI exam on his back.</TE>

<HD>Astros Field Is Now Minute Maid Park</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Punctuated by fireworks and a locomotive steaming across its outfield
track carrying oranges, Houston Astro owner Drayton McLane on
Wednesday renamed the Astros' stadium Minute Maid Park.</LD>
<LD>   The Minute Maid Co. is based in Houston and since 1960 has been a
subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Co.</LD>
<LD>   "They are a very stable company and this was a big part of our
decision," McLane said. "They have the values and commitment to the
public but they also have great financial security."</LD>
<TE>   McLane said the deal was for 28 years for a price exceeding $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros' stadium opened in 2000 as Enron Field, but McLane
bought out the 30-year, $100-million naming rights deal in February
and quickly removed hundreds of signs bearing the failed energy
trading giant's name.</TE>
<TE>   Since buying out Enron, the stadium had been called Astros Field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The New York Yankees addressed their production problem in right
field from within the organization, calling up Juan Rivera from
triple-A Columbus and giving him the starting job that had been
shared by Shane Spencer and John Vander Wal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's early in the season. We'll see what happens," Manager Joe
Torre said. "Because Juan was doing so well, we decided we'd see what
we have here first before we see what our other options are outside
the organization."</TE>
<TE>   Yankee right fielders were batting .282 with only three homers and
12 runs batted in before Wednesday's game against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not here to sit on the bench. He's here to play," General
Manager Brian Cashman said. "We're not looking for him to be a
savior. We don't need a savior. We're leading the majors in runs
scored."</TE>
<TE>   Rivera was batting .328 with six homers and 33 runs batted in at
Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitching coach Mark Connor and bench coach Cookie Rojas left the
Toronto Blue Jays, two days after Buck Martinez was fired as manager
and replaced by Carlos Tosca.... Texas put outfielder Carl Everett on

<HD>Cordero's Ride in '76 Might Be the Blueprint</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ELMONT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>For a primer on how to ride a front-running horse in the Belmont
Stakes, your research can start and end with Angel Cordero. The
retired Hall of Famer's record in the Belmont--21 mounts, only one
win--must have bankrupted scores of horseplayers, but in 1976 he
nursed Bold Forbes, a notorious speedster, to victory. That might
have been the cleverest ride in the 133 runnings of the race.</LD>
<LD>   Bold Forbes, brilliantly trained by another expert horseman, Laz
Barrera, had carried his speed to victory in the 1 1/4-mile Kentucky
Derby, before he was overhauled and finished third in the Preakness.
For the Triple Crown windup--at 1 1/2 miles the longest test in the
series--Barrera's colt was thought to be vulnerable. He was bound to
run out of steam, the wise guys were saying, by the end of his tour
of Belmont Park's tiring circumference.</LD>
<LD>   Bold Forbes and Cordero sent the skeptics muttering into the
night. Six lengths ahead with half a mile left, the colt barely
lasted at the wire. McKenzie Bridge and Great Contractor ran 2-3.
Respectively, they were only a neck and a neck short, but the payoff
in the Belmont is not the margin but the muster. Cordero never worked
harder to bag a big one.</LD>
<TE>   Bold Forbes' name comes up because on Saturday War Emblem, another
on-the-engine type, will try to win the 134th Belmont and become the
12th horse--the first since Affirmed in 1978--to blitz the Triple
Crown. War Emblem waltzed home in the Kentucky Derby off an
uncontested lead, and then was a grittier, slightly off-the-pace
winner in the Preakness three weeks ago. He'll be the speed in the
race Saturday, in a Belmont that is largely
what-you-see-is-what-you-get. There's no intrigue, nor any deep
strategy to speak of. War Emblem will either live or die by the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Even the post positions appear to be of no import. War Emblem won
from the 5-hole in the Derby and triumphed after breaking from No. 8
in the Preakness, and on Wednesday, in a 12-horse field, he drew the
10, which seemed to please trainer Bob Baffert.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to be on the outside," Baffert said. "This is a fast
horse, and he can leave from there and dictate the race. [A clean
break] will be very important. I'm not worried. All I've got to do is
put the saddle on him."</TE>
<TE>   Of the other speed in the race, Proud Citizen, second in the Derby
and third in the Preakness, drew the No. 9 post, and Wiseman's Ferry,
on the Triple Crown trail for the first time, came up with No. 3. The
suspicion is that Wiseman's Ferry, who has been a gate-to-wire winner
of his last two races, will be battling War Emblem early.</TE>
<TE>   "Those two horses should hook up," Baffert said. "I just hope they
don't go too fast. I hope my horse disposes of the horses that take
him on early, and then has enough left for the stretch."</TE>
<TE>   War Emblem, who was 20-1 in the Derby and the 5-2 favorite in the
Preakness, is listed as the even-money favorite on the morning line.
After that there's a quantum jump to Proud Citizen at 5-1 and Sunday
Break at 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   "Fitness means more in this race because of the distance," said
Cordero, now a jockey agent whose rider, John Velazquez, doesn't have
a mount Saturday. "Most American horses are just not bred to run this
far. In the Belmont, horses get late [tire] quicker than they do in
shorter races. The key is to get your horse to relax, so he can
conserve his energy for the finish."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if War Emblem will end the Triple Crown drought, Cordero
said:</TE>
<TE>   "I think he will. He's a stronger horse than Bold Forbes was. I
see only two horses in there that might possibly beat him. Wayne's
horse [trainer Wayne Lukas' Proud Citizen] and Neil's horse [trainer
Neil Drysdale's Sunday Break]. Sunday Break's a fresh horse, the kind
that sometimes wins the Belmont."</TE>
<TE>   Every other trainer in the Belmont is counting on Baffert's colt
caving in after running too fast early. The typically slow first
fractions for this race look like typographical errors. War Emblem
and his jockey, Victor Espinoza, sat off a 46-second opening
half-mile in the Preakness, a split that was faster than even the
inimitable Secretariat's in the 1973 Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   "If War Emblem runs that fast Saturday, he'll get beat," said
Bobby Frankel, who trains Medaglia d'Oro. Frankel's colt, after a
fourth-place finish with excuses in the Derby, had no alibis after
his eighth-place finish in the Preakness, but here he is, four-legged
testimony to why the Triple Crown is so tough. The woodwork can be
full with pretenders, and sometimes they get in the way, or even win
the race.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mile and a half, but it's still a speed race," Frankel
said. "There have been exceptions, but usually the horse on the lead
at the quarter pole wins it. Somebody's got to pressure War Emblem
early. If he gets an easy early lead, he'll be tough to catch."</TE>

<HD>A Grand Moment for Bonds</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Giant outfielder passes Robinson and takes over
fourth on career list with 587th home run, a drive that goes 482
feet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>Everybody was awestruck with Barry Bonds' grand slam off Qualcomm
Stadium's big scoreboard, except the slugger himself.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds' home run, estimated at 482 feet, moved him ahead of Frank
Robinson and into sole possession of fourth place on the career home
run list with 587 and led the San Francisco Giants to a 12-2 victory
over the staggering San Diego Padres on Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The high-arching homer in the third inning hit the bottom left
side of the scoreboard 29 rows beyond the right-field wall.</LD>
<TE>   Manager Dusty Baker called it both "monumental" and "a monster."
Hitting coach Gene Clines compared it with some of the eye-popping
shots he saw teammate Willie Stargell hit with the Pittsburgh
Pirates.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' reaction?</TE>
<TE>   "It just has to go over the fence. That's all that matters," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   It went over the fence, all right. With the exception of Clines,
nobody in the Giants' clubhouse could recall seeing a longer homer.</TE>
<TE>   "He killed that ball," Clines said, who scoffed at the estimate of
482 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like it was 501," Giant outfielder Reggie Sanders said.
"That was an incredible shot."</TE>
<TE>   In the 15 seasons that homers have been measured here, only Mark
McGwire has hit one farther, a 490-foot line drive into the second
deck in left-center on July 20, 1998. That homer was announced then
as 458 feet but has been revised. The seat that McGwire's homer hit
is painted white with a red circle in the middle.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' homer was just as impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds, whose next stop is Yankee Stadium and its short right-field
porch on Friday night, hit the first pitch from rookie Dennis
Tankersley. He took a few steps while watching it sail away, then
began his home run trot.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was unimpressed with the distance, although he said he was
told he once hit one farther off Robb Nen, the Giants' closer who
once pitched for Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "I marvel at wins," Bonds said. "Mark McGwire is the only one who
ever put me in awe, as far as he hit the ball. He hit balls a lot
farther than I do. [Willie] McCovey did it too, when I was a little
kid."</TE>
<TE>   Longtime observers recall McCovey hitting a long home run in San
Diego in the early 1970s, but no distance was available.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' 11th grand slam gave the Giants a 4-1 lead. It was his 20th
homer of the season, tying him with Chicago's Sammy Sosa for the
major league lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big day, especially to do it on a grand slam, that's
pretty awesome, especially that monumental of a home run," Baker
said.</TE>
<TE>   Tankersley (1-2) allowed a double to Giant pitcher Ryan Jensen
with two out in the third, walked Tom Goodwin and hit Rich Aurilia to
bring up Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I watched it longer than Barry did," Jensen said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if I've seen a longer home run in all the games I've
seen," said Padre Manager Bruce Bochy, whose team has lost seven in a
row. "What's unfortunate is how he even got up there--two outs,
nobody on with the pitcher up."</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was tied with Robinson since hitting No. 586 Sunday against
Colorado. Next on the homer list is Bonds' godfather, Willie Mays,
who is third with 660.</TE>

<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Lennox Lewis' promoter, Gary Shaw, has resigned the week of Lewis'
blockbuster match against Mike Tyson, but the resignation will not be
effective until after Saturday's fight.</LD>
<LD>   Shaw's differences are not with Lewis, but with Kathy Duva, head
of the Main Events boxing organization, which represents Lewis'
interests in this country.</LD>
<LD>   Shaw's departure means the promoter, 57, will not be representing
another Main Events fighter, Fernando Vargas, when he faces Oscar De
La Hoya on Sept. 14.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel terrible about that," said Shaw, who has been with Main
Events for 2 1/2 years. "I feel an obligation to Fernando."</TE>
<TE>   Reports circulated Wednesday about Shaw's future. According to
one, Shaw was going into business with Shelly Finkel, Tyson's
manager, but Shaw denied that.</TE>

<LD>Jon Heyman of Newsday was disappointed with the "head-in-the-sand"
reactions of some New York baseball stars to Ken Caminiti's claim
that steroids are prevalent in major league clubhouses:</LD>
<LD>   "[Yankee slugger] Jason Giambi takes the cake. He acted as if he
had barely heard of steroids. He must think we live on Mars.</LD>
<LD>   "Giambi actually said that the key to being a great player is
'flexibility and agility.' This from a guy who's about as big as a
house and about as flexible as one.</LD>
<TE>   "I always wondered what his overstuffed body is stuffed with. Now
I know: baloney."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the last rookie coach to win an NBA title?</TE>
<TE>   Buffaloed Wings: Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press says the
Red Wings got more than they bargained for in a 3-2 loss to the
Carolina Hurricanes in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday in
Detroit:</TE>
<TE>   "On a night when the buildup exceeded the punch, when the crowd
seemed eerily quiet and drained of enthusiasm, when the ice seemed
sloppy and players fell for no reason, Carolina, the team nobody
picked, pulled alongside the Red Wings, the team everybody picked,
and finally, as if mocking them through the driver's side window,
said, 'Aw, you ain't so tough.'</TE>
<TE>   "And pushed the pedal to the floor, [leaving] the Wings coughing
on their dust."</TE>
<TE>   Out of this world: The two Americans and one Russian aboard the
international space station were promptly informed of their
countries' World Cup victories Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "During the radio communications sessions, flight controllers told
the crew of all the latest developments," said Viktor Blagov, deputy
director of Russian Mission Control. "And since the crew is made up
of real soccer fans, the news was received more than happily."</TE>
<TE>   Where's the beef? Wythe Willey, president of the National
Cattlemen's Beef Assn., recently accused the NCAA of bowing to
pressure from an animal rights group for its decision to switch from
using leather basketballs to those made from synthetic materials.</TE>
<TE>   "Leather has been used by humans since time began," Willey said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, but players and coaches said they preferred the
synthetic basketballs, which are already being used by most NCAA
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Magic moment: Magic Johnson, elected to basketball Hall of Fame on
Wednesday for his remarkable playing career, is also remembered for
one of the funniest quotes in sports history.</TE>
<TE>   Describing how well he and Laker teammate James Worthy worked
together, Johnson said, "It's almost like we have ESPN."</TE>
<TE>   Start flipping: From Caught on the Fly in the Sporting News:
"Finally, the workin' title for sports on NBC, post-NBA: Must-flee
TV."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Pat Riley with the Lakers in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The judge in a high-profile murder case in San Diego
warned jurors to avoid news stories about the trial, which is being
covered extensively. If jurors need to watch television, watch the
Padres' games, said Superior Court Judge William Mudd:</TE>
<TE>   "You may not be seeing good baseball, but at least you won't see
anything about this case."</TE>

<TE>   Mike Tyson's aberrant behavior is curiously compelling to ordinary

his right hook to his police blotter.</TE>
<TE>   Teddy Atlas talks about the time when Tyson was 16 and made
improper sexual advances toward his wife's 11-year-old sister. Atlas
says he put a loaded gun to Tyson's head and threatened to pull the
trigger.</TE>
<TE>   From journalist Jack Newfield: "He liked to hurt women during sex.
His wires were crossed in his mind between violence and eroticism."</TE>
<TE>   From journalist Edwin Pope: "This may sound harsh, but he is as

<LD>Portugal's prime minister urged the country not to lose faith in the
national soccer team after Wednesday's stunning 3-2 defeat to the
United States in the World Cup.</LD>
<LD>   "It's at these moments that great teams show what fiber they're
made of," Prime Minister Jose Durao Barroso said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. win over Portugal, fifth in FIFA's world rankings, hit
hard in this soccer-mad nation.</LD>
<TE>   "It should have been an easy win," said Armando Lopes, 39, a
stereo equipment store owner. "We took it for granted we would easily
go through to the next round. Now it looks like we might be out after
three games."</TE>
<TE>   Said Lopes' customer, Paulo Teixeira, a 35-year-old garage
mechanic: "I'm so sad. And I still don't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Others were more direct about what they thought would happen.</TE>
<TE>   Said photographer Manuel Gomes da Costa: "I thought we would smash
the Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Business leaders had appealed to workers not to take time off to
watch the match, which kicked off at midmorning local time. But the
appeal had little effect based on the light traffic on Lisbon's
normally busy roads.</TE>
<TE>   National sports daily A Bola said on its Web site that Portugal
entered the World Cup with its "pe esquerdo"--its "left foot"--a
Portuguese idiom for when something goes wrong.</TE>

<LD>Meanwhile, across America, U.S. soccer fans got up early--or stayed
up late--and watched their World Cup team face European powerhouse
Portugal.</LD>
<LD>   Two hours after the early-morning start, they had to wipe their
eyes not because they were tired, but to make sure they believed what
they saw.</LD>
<LD>   In Kansas City, Mo., dawn was breaking as more than 400
fans--fueled by 22 1/2 gallons of coffee and 20 dozen
doughnuts--celebrated the Americans' victory at a party held by the
Kansas City Wizards of Major League Soccer.</LD>
<TE>   The crowd was even larger than diehard soccer fans like Nathan
Hunold expected.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought there were going to be about 30 people," the title
company worker said. "I think this shows how far the game has
progressed in the U.S. It has a long way to go, but it's come a long
way since it started."</TE>
<TE>   Near Rochester, N.Y., more than 200 fans gathered at Soccer Sam's
Pizza &amp; Pasta Cafe in Webster to watch and cheer the U.S. team.</TE>
<TE>   "This is unbelievable," said Kevin White, 25, of Walworth. "We
were just praying for a tie going into this match."</TE>

<LD>In some circles, though, the U.S. victory was greeted with an
indifferent shrug across a nation where soccer is a sporting pauper.</LD>
<LD>   Most avid sports fans are caught up in the NBA and NHL finals, and
the World Cup in South Korea and Japan is generating interest only
among hard-core soccer watchers.</LD>
<LD>   "Americans are pretty oblivious to it for the most part," said
Paul Carbone, 32, a sales representative in Boston.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm a sports fan, but baseball, not soccer. I don't even know
anybody really following it. It's not talked about as far as sports
goes," Rob Grum, a clerk at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, said
in a typical reaction from Americans to their national team's World
Cup odyssey.</TE>
<TE>   From the dearth of interest on sports talk radio, to the glum
silence on commuter trains and subways and an insipid response from
the White House, the great majority of Americans were nonplussed by
the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Not even in the soccer hot-bed of Miami could the national team
grab the locals' imagination.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't see the match, I'm Brazilian. The U.S. won? That's a
miracle," said 24-year-old Francisco DeOliveira in a city caught up
by World Cup fever among its huge Latino and Brazilian immigrant
community.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, where no president misses a chance to be
associated with America's sports stars and President Bush hosts
T-ball games on the lawns, the momentous result was met with a limp
response.</TE>
<TE>   There was no official expression of congratulations several hours
after their greatest soccer victory since the historic 1950 World Cup
1-0 defeat of England, and Bush neither watched the game nor phoned
the team, according to a White House spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "I can assure you he has noted their victory and has already
remarked on it," said Ari Fleischer.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers paid all the premiums on their $5-million insurance
policy known as Omar Daal, but there has been a lapse in coverage
this past week.</LD>
<LD>   Daal, whose repeated requests to be traded were ignored because
the Dodgers needed the reluctant reliever in case a starting pitcher
got hurt, replaced the injured Kevin Brown in the rotation last week
but has been roughed up in two starts.</LD>
<LD>   The left-hander gave up six runs Wednesday on a fourth-inning
grand slam to Benny Agbayani and a two-run homer to Todd Helton in
the fifth, putting the Dodgers in a hole they couldn't climb out of.
An eighth-inning rally fell short, and the Dodgers lost to the
Colorado Rockies, 8-6, before 31,793 in Coors Field.</LD>
<TE>   Daal, who went 4-0 with an earned-run average of 0.88 in his first
17 appearances, 15 as a reliever, also gave up six runs and 10 hits
in a 6-3 loss to Arizona on Friday and is now 4-2 with a 2.72 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not disappointed--I'm trying to do my best," said Daal, who
is making $5 million this season. "I struggled with the command of my
fastball today--I had trouble throwing it [on the outside
corner]--and my slider wasn't the same. I don't know if it's because
of the altitude here, but my slider was flat. I just have to forget
about it and try to throw better pitches next time."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the home run, his 15th, Helton singled and scored
on Agbayani's grand slam and doubled in a run in the seventh, giving
him a National League-leading 55 runs batted in. Larry Walker added
two hits and scored three runs.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't notice Omar throwing the ball any differently. They just
hit a couple of balls out of the park," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy
said. "Larry Walker and Todd Helton are difficult to deal with,
whether you're Omar Daal, Kevin Brown or Kazuhisa Ishii. They set up
both of those [run-scoring] innings."</TE>
<TE>   Walker and Helton singled to open the fourth, and after Terry
Shumpert's walk, Agbayani, who was activated off the disabled list
Wednesday, ripped a full-count cut-fastball over the wall in center
for a 4-2 lead. Walker walked in front of Helton's homer in the
fifth, as Colorado took a 6-2 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Each team scored a run in the seventh, and the Dodgers, who
amassed 15 runs in the eighth and ninth innings of wins over the
Rockies on Monday and Tuesday night, scored three in the eighth to
trim the lead to 7-6 before a curious decision by Tracy backfired.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Karros and Adrian Beltre, who was eight for 15 with two
homers and six RBIs in the series, singled to open the eighth, and
Marquis Grissom was hit by a pitch. Mark Grudzielanek's two-run
single and Chad Kreuter's sacrifice fly made it 7-6.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Paul Lo Duca singled, putting runners on first and
second with one out, but Tracy opted for pinch-hitter Dave Hansen
over leadoff batter Dave Roberts, a .321 hitter who had three singles
in four at-bats Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The reason: Hansen had two hits, including a home run, in six
at-bats against Rocky closer Jose Jimenez, and two of his outs were
wicked line drives off the right-hander last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Hansen has a good history against Jimenez," Tracy said. "We were
at a point in time where we needed a ball driven, and he was the
right guy to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Not Wednesday. Hansen struck out, and Alex Cora, who doubled twice
in four previous at-bats, grounded into an inning-ending fielder's
choice.</TE>
<TE>   Jimenez retired the side in order in the ninth for his 16th save,
preserving the win for rookie right-hander Jason Jennings, who gave
up three runs and 10 hits in 6 2/3 innings to extend his winning
streak to six and improve his record to 7-2.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I was surprised," Roberts said about being pulled for
Hansen. "Everyone wants to be the guy at bat in those situations--if
you don't, there's something wrong with you--but I'm just a player,
and it's not my decision. Trace thought Hansen would be better in
that situation, and I have to support that."</TE>

<HD>Brown Still Stuck in Hospital Bed</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Pitcher Kevin Brown, suffering from a herniated disk in his lower
back, remained hospitalized and confined to bed rest for a third
consecutive day Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Though General Manager Dan Evans said Brown was feeling better,
his condition hasn't improved to a point where doctors can perform
the kinds of extensive tests required to determine a course of
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   Once those tests are completed--possibly in the next few
days--doctors can decide whether to start Brown on a physical therapy
and medication program designed to strengthen the lower back and
reduce or shrink the bulging disk or to perform surgery.</LD>
<TE>   A rehab program probably would sideline Brown for up to a month,
but that's assuming he recovers from the inflammation in the back of
his surgically repaired right elbow, an injury that sent him to the
disabled list May 27.</TE>
<TE>   If surgery, in which a portion of the protruding disk that is
putting pressure on the nerve is either cut out or removed with a
laser, is required, Brown probably would be sidelined for at least
six weeks and possibly the remainder of the season.</TE>

<TE>   The Dodgers shouldn't have any problems signing first-round pick
James Loney, a high school first baseman from Missouri City, Texas.
Loney has a scholarship offer from Baylor but said doesn't plan to
attend college.</TE>
<TE>   Loney hopes to sign after this weekend's state tournament, though
he may wait another week so he can play in the Texas state all-star
game next weekend. The 19th pick overall in the 2001 draft received a
$1.3-million bonus, and that's where Joe Urbon, Loney's advisor,
expects the Dodgers to slot Loney.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to ask for anything crazy--we just want to be
treated fairly," Urbon said. "Everyone is pretty clear on what he
should get."</TE>
<TE>   After drafting Bryan Tracy, the son of Manager Jim Tracy, in the
21st round Tuesday, the Dodgers made another all-in-the-family pick
Wednesday, selecting community college third baseman Jon Riggleman,
the son of Dodger bench coach Jim Riggleman, in the 37th round.</TE>

<TE>   Center fielder Dave Roberts jammed his right knee with a hard
slide into second base in the first inning, suffering a minor bruise,
but the injury is not expected to sideline him.... Shortstop Cesar
Izturis sat out the game because of a sore left hip, but Izturis is
expected to play Friday in Baltimore.... Left fielder Brian Jordan,
who has been slowed by a sore left knee for several weeks, also was
given the day off.</TE>

<HD>CHRB to Vote Today on Proposed Fairplex Move</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A series of arguments invoking themes ranging from warm-hearted
sentimentality to cold, hard cash will be addressed today when the
California Horse Racing Board debates whether the Los Angeles County
Fair meet should move from Fairplex Park in Pomona to Santa Anita
Park in Arcadia.</LD>
<LD>   The seven-member board will vote to either accept, reject or delay
the proposed move of the 17-day fair meet (Sept. 13-29) during its
meeting at Bay Meadows Race Track in San Mateo.</LD>
<LD>   Fairplex President/Chief Executive James Henwood announced May 23
he had agreed to end 63 years of horse racing at Pomona's tight,
five-eighths-mile dirt track. Henwood signed a five-year lease
agreement with Santa Anita President Jack Liebau and predicted the
deal would result in increased revenue because of greater on-track
attendance, wider distribution to satellite wagerers and larger
purses because of the addition of 10 turf races and the move to a
one-mile track.</LD>
<TE>   But Craig Fravel, executive vice president of Del Mar Thoroughbred
Club, said: "We were just informed and now the board's meeting. The
issues are larger than what this time frame allows."</TE>
<TE>   That argument has gained significant momentum in the last week.
Fravel and Hollywood Park President Rick Baedeker will oppose the
move to Santa Anita, as will Oak Tree Racing Assn. Vice President
Sherwood Chillingworth. The Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita immediately
follows the fair meet. Chillingworth said moving the dates to Santa
Anita will ruin Oak Tree's identity and could eventually cost the
series major races, such as Breeders' Cup prep events. Del Mar's meet
immediately precedes the fair.</TE>
<TE>   Two board members have told The Times they expect to oppose the
move and the Thoroughbred Owners of California and the California
Thoroughbred Trainers agree that the move should be delayed at least
one year and racing should return to Fairplex this year.</TE>
<TE>   If the board rejects the proposed move, racing will resume Sept.
13 at Fairplex Park. Liebau said he and Henwood will continue to
explore the move if defeated today.</TE>
<TE>   The meet has established itself as an opportunity for second-tier
owners, trainers and jockeys to make handsome sums of money--the
largest purse last year was $100,000--while the sport's elite figures
usually are on vacation.</TE>

<DH>French Open: Amid postponements, Agassi, absence for
childbirth and an anti-ATP rant bring controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>Andre Agassi could not get away from Roland Garros fast enough
Wednesday evening, away from the cold, the rain and the wind ... and,
more important, away from Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero.</LD>
<LD>   The long day of waiting--a 6 1/2-hour rain delay--ended with a
rush. Play resumed for 13 minutes, enough for Agassi to lose two of
the three games played, meaning Ferrero led their quarterfinal, 6-3,
1-0. Agassi gestured to the chair umpire, who summoned tournament
referee Stefan Fransson. Agassi had his say, then Fransson went over
to speak to Ferrero, and the match was called for the day, at 7:04
p.m. Paris time.</LD>
<LD>   It appeared to spectators and television viewers that Agassi had
called the shots. Whether that was accurate or not, the perception
was shared by Ferrero and his supporters. Later, when asked if he had
the chance to speak on the court, Ferrero said: "I didn't say
anything."</LD>
<TE>   A member of his entourage was more pointed, saying: "Andre
canceled the match."</TE>
<TE>   Fransson maintained the players had proper input, before the match
resumed, and on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I could tell, they both agreed," he said, adding later
that he couldn't do much about the perception of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Fransson and French Open officials held a news
conference, Agassi and his wife, Steffi Graf, had left the grounds.
Ferrero, Alex Corretja and Albert Costa stood in the back at the news
conference and Corretja felt aggrieved, saying, "It's always the same
with us."</TE>
<TE>   Corretja spoke with Fransson in the hallway of the players'
lounge, and Ferrero and his agent had a closed-door meeting with the
referee and did not seem placated afterward. Other matches were still
going on despite light rain on other courts, and the decision to stop
on the main court, Philippe Chatrier, triggered a chain of events.</TE>
<TE>   Corretja had hoped to finish his quarterfinal match against Andrei
Pavel of Romania, which started Tuesday, having been stopped because
of darkness with Corretja leading, 7-6 (5), 7-5, 4-5. But in what was
a strange twist on a strange day, Pavel was not even in the country.
His wife is expecting and he left Paris to be with her for the birth
of their son in Germany, knowing the weather forecast for Wednesday
was dubious.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Durate, Corretja's coach, was on the long list of unhappy
people with the sudden cancellation, especially after the weather
improved. "For me, the decision is no good," he said, noting that
Corretja and Pavel had played much later in the evening Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Weather permitting today, Corretja and Pavel will finish--if Pavel
returns to Paris--followed by Agassi and Ferrero and another men's
quarterfinal, Marat Safin against Sebastien Grosjean. The women's
semifinals will follow, and all of this is scheduled to take place on
Philippe Chatrier. Although it appears to be a risky move to attempt
to squeeze it all in, officials refused to consider the idea of
moving the Safin match to the secondary show court.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we think there is a good chance we will finish the matches
on center court tomorrow, to give everybody the chance to be there,"
Fransson said.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the women feel as though they were treated unfairly by
being relegated to Suzanne Lenglen for the quarterfinals. The Women's
Tennis Assn. is expected to meet with Roland Garros officials on this
issue, and a source said that a letter from the top players voicing
their displeasure probably will follow in the next few days.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the men's tour was dealing with its own controversy.
French player Nicolas Escude alleged in an interview with Le Parisien
that the ATP is withholding reports on doping.</TE>
<TE>   "What I don't understand is that in any company that presents a
negative balance sheet, the CEO is axed," Escude told the newspaper.
"And when I hear today that Mark Miles is untouchable, I wonder. They
tell me there are files that can't be opened. What can they be, if
not files on doping?</TE>
<TE>   The ATP issued a statement rejecting the "unfounded allegations,"
and Miles said: "Some of what I read attributed to players, if
accurate, I find uninformed, irresponsible and offensive."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview Wednesday night, Miles said he planned to speak
with Escude and the other French players mentioned in the newspaper.
On the issue of the "files," Miles said: "We [the ATP] don't have the
files, the review panel have the files."</TE>
<TE>   He explained why the tour shifted to a European-based company for
administration of the anti-doping program earlier this year</TE>
<TE>   "We did it because they do a lot more in international sport and
offer us two things, more testing for the same dollars," he said,
adding the ATP is spending more on tests. "This firm has more blood
testing expertise than anyone around."</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, the ATP had 542 in-competition tests and 50
out-of-competition, at nine ATP tournaments, officials said. The tour
has increased its testing by 20% in-competition and 100%
out-of-competition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an excellent program honestly administered, and yet we're
always looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve and to prevent
cheating," Miles said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pete Sampras is changing his grass-court preparation for
Wimbledon, opting to take a wild-card spot at Halle, Germany, much to
the dismay of organizers at Queen's Club in London. It will be the
second time in 14 years he has missed the tune-up event in London.
The tournament news release was rather harsh.</TE>
<TE>   "He's had a desperate start to the year including those losses in
the first round in Paris and of course that Davis Cup defeat, on
grass against Alex Corretja," Queen's tournament director Ian Wight
said. "Whatever personal demons Pete is fighting at the moment, I
suspect that, more than anything else, he feels he needs a couple of
wins under his belt. I guess he feels that's more likely at Halle
than at the Stella Artois."</TE>

<HD>The Other Keane Saves Ireland</HD>
<DH>Soccer: With Roy dismissed from the team, Robbie scores in
the 92nd minute to salvage a 1-1 tie with Germany.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ireland's 2002 World Cup, so far a contrasting tale of two Keanes,
pressed further into the surreal Wednesday when Robbie Keane, the one
who didn't go home, scored an improbable goal, in the 92nd minute, to
salvage a 1-1 tie with Germany in Ibaraki, Japan.</LD>
<LD>   Keane's goal, coming seconds before the final whistle, struck the
hand of German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn and the inside of the right
post before grazing the top of the net and sending an incredulous
Irish bench into convulsions of joy.</LD>
<LD>   "We deserved something out of the game," said a drained Mick
McCarthy, the Irish coach. "We battered them, and gave Germany a good
doing, actually."</LD>
<TE>   Ireland, forced to play this World Cup without captain Roy Keane,
who was dismissed from the team after clashing with McCarthy, has
rallied from second-half deficits against Cameroon and Germany to
record successive 1-1 ties, remaining undefeated and in contention
for a berth in the second round.</TE>
<TE>   Germany (1-0-1) scored in the 19th minute when Michael Ballack
lobbed in a long cross from the left flank and Miroslav Klose, having
beaten defender Ian Harte, headed past Irish keeper Shay Given. The
goal was the fourth of the World Cup for Klose, who had a hat trick
in Germany's opening 8-0 triumph over Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Ireland spent the rest of the match futilely trying to equalize,
turned back repeatedly by Kahn. McCarthy gambled with his lineup,
pulling a defender in favor of a third forward, towering 35-year-old
Niall Quinn, a veteran of Ireland's 1990 quarterfinal run. As the
game entered stoppage time, Quinn performed his specialty, winning a
high aerial ball at the top of the German penalty area and flicking
to Keane.</TE>
<TE>   Keane chested the ball down and between the last two German
defenders. One of them, Carsten Ramelow, came up empty on a desperate
lunge for the ball and suddenly Keane was through, one on one with
Kahn.</TE>
<TE>   Keane struck the ball hard and high, glancing it off Kahn and the
right post before hitting the inside top webbing.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to take a chance at the end," McCarthy said, "but what's
the point in going out without a fight? That was never going to
happen."</TE>
<TE>   Ireland midfielder Gary Kelly said the last-ditch comeback was
"typical of the fighting Irish. We were fighting 11 Germans and the
referee tonight, but we knuckled in and we just kept going.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never over until the final whistle. And now, we are over the
moon."</TE>

<HD>Tolan, 16, Gets to Find Himself at U.S. Open</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Soon after he chipped in from 50 feet to win a three-way playoff and
qualify for the U.S. Open Championship, 16-year-old Derek Tolan got
so many calls it nearly fried his cell phone.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm pretty lost right now," said Tolan, a junior-to-be at
ThunderRidge High in Highlands Ranch, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   It's understandable. Tolan's shot shocked PGA Tour veteran Mike
Reid and Mike Zaremba, and propelled the teen into the U.S. Open
field at Bethpage Black in Farmingdale, N.Y., next week. Tolan
already has lined up two practice rounds.</LD>
<TE>   "But not with Tiger," he said. "I already asked. He's booked."</TE>
<TE>   In the 36-hole qualifying Monday at Columbine (Colo.) Country
Club, Tolan was three shots ahead in the race for the second spot but
bogeyed three of the last five holes and was forced into the playoff.</TE>
<TE>   John Tolan, a club pro and his son's only teacher, was in agony as
he watched the bogeys.</TE>
<TE>   "I know what it's like for that to happen and you try so hard not
to think about making bogeys, but that's all you can think about,"
the elder Tolan said. "But Derek has mental focus years beyond a
16-year-old."</TE>
<TE>   Tolan isn't the youngest to play the U.S. Open. In 1941, Tyrell
Garth was 14. He may, however, be one of the luckiest.</TE>
<TE>   On the first playoff hole, Tolan was short of the green, his ball
on the front fringe, a solid 50 feet from the hole. His next shot was
a chip.</TE>
<TE>   "It kept going, I saw it going, I didn't know what it was going to
do," John Tolan said. "Then it went in. I was so nervous on the back
nine, I just couldn't believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Neither could Derek, but with all the hoopla, he has gotten used
to the idea of making the Open.</TE>
<TE>   "My goal is mostly just to see what it's like and get a feel for
it," he said. "I want to see how tough the Open is, how tough the
course is, how tough the players are."</TE>
<TE>   He won't be the only Tolan on hand to find out. His father and
mother, Darlene, will be at Bethpage and so will sisters Heather, 20,
and Chantel, 11.</TE>
<TE>   John Tolan says Derek, who is 5 feet 11 and slender, hits the ball
pretty far.</TE>
<TE>   "And he has a real good short game," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously.</TE>
<TE>   Open Up</TE>
<TE>   There are hints now that the U.S. Golf Assn. will not announce its
choice for the site for the 2008 U.S. Open on Wednesday at Bethpage
Black as expected. The site was to have been revealed in the
organization's annual news conference at the U.S. Open, with Riviera
Country Club and Torrey Pines Golf Course figuring prominently as the
front-runners.</TE>
<TE>   It seems that the deal is much more complicated than you would
think, with Pebble Beach being rumored as the choice for 2009 and the
USGA apparently trying to tie that one down first. Speculation is
that the club that doesn't get the 2008 bid will be awarded the U.S.
Open in 2010 or possibly 2011--at which time Tiger Woods will be 35
and playing his 15th full year as a pro.</TE>
<TE>   The Open sites already announced are Olympia Fields in 2003,
Shinnecock Hills in 2004, Pinehurst No. 2 in 2005, Winged Foot in
2006 and Oakmont in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   This Just In</TE>
<TE>   In a survey of nearly 800 of its members, the Golf Course
Superintendents Assn. of America asked what the most interesting
course for a major is this year--38% each for Bethpage Black and
Augusta National, 14% for Muirfield in Scotland (British Open), and
8% for Hazeltine in Chaska, Minn. (PGA Championship).</TE>
<TE>   This Just Out</TE>
<TE>   News item: Part of BusinessWeek's May 20 article called "The PGA
Tour: Where's the Green?" includes an item about the "proposed" Major
Champions Tour, "an eight-event mini-tour in 2003 [that] would
feature 20 top pros and compete head-to-head with the PGA Tour."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Since the Major Champions Tour, at least in that format,
went belly-up about a month ago, it reflects poorly on the
credibility of the rest of the story, fairly or not.</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Update</TE>
<TE>   News item: The pairings program for last week's Kemper Open
included a "Tiger Who" story, accompanied by a picture of Woods with
a red circle and a slash ... a satirical shot at his skipping the
tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: This virtually guarantees "Tiger Who" won't play next
year, either.</TE>
<TE>   Shoe News</TE>
<TE>   Those red slip-on golf shoes that Annika Sorenstam wore and caused
such a stir when she won the Nabisco Championship, well, they simply
won't go away. Nike Golf will ship 150 pairs of the Verdana Slip-ons
to the U.S. Women's Open next month and sell them for $85 (available
in sizes 6 through 11).</TE>
<TE>   There's no word whether Sorenstam will be wearing them again
because she doesn't have a shoe deal with Nike.</TE>
<TE>   Playing a Round</TE>
<TE>   Yes, we know Bethpage Black is a public course, but do you know
how many rounds were played there last year? Try 50,000.</TE>
<TE>   And while we're on the subject of Bethpage Black, the USGA is
probably going to do very well financially at the Open. It has sold
all 42,500 of the daily tickets, 78 corporate hospitality tents--50%
more than ever before--including 18 at $175,000 apiece along the 18th
fairway.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Garden</TE>
<TE>   He just jumped 21 places in the Official World Ranking to No. 48,
so the hottest golfer in the world right now must be, yes, Justin
Rose.</TE>
<TE>   And who have thought that sentence would ever be written?</TE>
<TE>   The 21-year-old Brit won the Victor Chandler British Masters last
week at Woburn, England, and has four victories in five months.</TE>
<TE>   That's probably going to make Rose a huge factor for Europe in the
Ryder Cup. What? Rose wasn't chosen for the team? OK, then. Besides
Sergio Garcia and maybe Colin Montgomerie, no one has played better
than Jose Maria Olazabal has, so he'll pick up the slack. He's not on
the team either? Oh.</TE>
<TE>   Masonry</TE>
<TE>   This is what the Senior PGA Tour is all about ... well, this and
corporate tents: James Mason, a 5-foot-11, 240-pound, 51-year-old
club pro from Dillard, Ga., a Monday qualifier, beat the top senior
players and won the NFL Golf Classic at Clifton, N.J., on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Mason, who earned $195,000, cleared about $15,000 last year after
expenses when he managed to be a Monday qualifier five times in 14
tries. Now he's exempt on the tour for 2003, which Mason said is good
news.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got some credit card companies on my tail," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Balancing Act</TE>
<TE>   Wilson Golf, which says it's the first to develop a perfectly
balanced golf ball, has come up with a test that might actually do
two things--either prove it, or show a misbehaving ball where it
might be headed if it doesn't go straight.</TE>
<TE>   Fill up a container with warm water and add enough Epsom salts so
the ball floats when you put it in. Add a few drops of dishwashing
liquid to reduce friction. Spin the ball. The light side of the ball
will be up, the heavy side down. Mark the light side with a permanent
marker. Spin it again. If you see that dot again, you've got an
unbalanced ball.</TE>
<TE>   On the bright side, you've also got a clean ball.</TE>
<TE>   Business News</TE>
<TE>   According to Golf Datatech, golf ball sales reached $46.7 million
in April.</TE>
<TE>   So Start Designing</TE>
<TE>   Proof that it's good to be a successful golf course architect: Tom
Fazio listed his 9,500-square-foot house at Champions Hills golf
community in Hendersonville, N.C., at $3.6 million.</TE>

<TE>   The 103rd Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur will hold eight

Tarzana.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Since Reine de Romance arrived in the U.S. more than 1 1/2 years ago,
it has become quite clear that the Irish-bred filly does her best
work from off the pace.</LD>
<LD>   Trained by Jenine Sahadi for Team Valor, the daughter of Vettori
won three times in four races on grass during the spring and summer
of 2001, including the San Clemente Handicap at Del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   In each of her good races, Reine de Romance rallied from behind,
so, in her first race as a 4-year-old, it was surprising to see her
on the lead May 9 at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   The 2-1 favorite that day, she retreated to fourth behind the
streaking Snowflake, who has won four in a row for trainer Ron
McAnally since coming to this country, but she could make amends in
today's second, a $58,000 optional claimer at one mile on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Desormeaux will ride Reine de Romance for the first time and
expect him to back off whatever pace develops. The splits should be
legitimate with Stormy Society, who will be handled by leading jockey
Patrick Valenzuela, in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The race, which features only five runners, is not part of a pick
six that has a carryover of $102,185.72.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Truly A Judge, claimed for $20,000 on Oct. 8,
will try to beat graded stakes winner Futural, who has seen better
days, $1.15-million yearling Hadrian's Wall and two others in today's
seventh at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Bruce Headley. The trainer began the week six for 17 at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Leo O'Brien. The veteran trainer, who is based in New
York, is two for 45 in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: Exacta boxes in the first keying Catch The
Queen with Splendid Jaclyn, Biker's Sis and Steamy Dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/83. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $5.80/$469. Total money bet: $534.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than two weeks after he was the beaten favorite for a third
consecutive time, Sign Of Lanty will be a very short price to get
back in the winner's circle tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Arguably the best 870-yard specialist, the 8-year-old gelding drew
the outside post in a small field of five in the fifth, a $12,900
allowance.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by Jackie or Rod Macpherson Jr. and trained by John Cooper,
Sign Of Lanty will be ridden by Eddie Garcia while trying to halt a
losing streak that began at Sunland Park and continued May 25 at Los
Alamitos.</LD>
<TE>   If the California-bred wins, it would give him 25 victories in 58
lifetime starts and push his career earnings over $430,000.</TE>
<TE>   From the inside out, his opponents will be: Rare Mink, who hasn't
won since July 19, Dashin With Johnny, who hasn't run since finishing
third behind Sign Of Lanty on Feb. 2, Timothy Pilot and Coolmore, who
has won two in a row for trainer Laura Lukas since being stretched
out to 870 yards. A gelded son of Carson City, Coolmore will be
ridden by Alex Bautista.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Sheza Mighty Bobby. 2. Isolation. 3. Reed And Right.
4. Bolt Ta Fame. 5. Sign Of Lanty. 6. Apollian. 7. Reeking Havoc. 8.
Gary Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Sheza Mighty Bobby and Lanes Fortune in the first; the
Isolation-Control Freak entry, Chicks Jet Set Baby and Banduino Miss
in the second; Reed And Right, Kid Unit, the Lotsalack-Daves Best Man
entry and Yuuba Jr in the third, and single Bolt Ta Fame in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Dashin Mystery Man gets a new rider in Ramon
Sanchez and drops in class in the sixth. Double Timen tries lesser in
his first start of the year for trainer Adan Farias in the eighth.</TE>

<LD>He will have no fear of bad news.</LD>

<LD>   --In English and Spanish,</LD>
<TE>   on a bulletin board</TE>
<TE>   at trainer Elliott Walden's</TE>
<TE>   barn at Churchill Downs</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LOUISVILLE, Ky.--In 1998, Elliott Walden, born-again Christian and
trainer of Victory Gallop, was the bad news for Real Quiet in the
Belmont Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Second in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, Victory Gallop trailed
by 7 1/2 lengths early before catching Real Quiet at the wire before
80,162 at Belmont Park. Shattered was another last-race bid for the
Triple Crown, and lost was a $5-million bonus for Real Quiet's owner,
Mike Pegram.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s, there was an epidemic of horses winning the
Derby and the Preakness, the opening legs of the Triple Crown, and
then failing to punch home the ultimate victory in the Belmont. The
names of the near-misses and the horses who foiled them are
inseparable: Silver Charm and Touch Gold in 1997; Real Quiet and
Victory Gallop in '98; and Charismatic and Lemon Drop Kid in '99.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven horses have swept the series but 15 have won the first two
jewels and lost in the Belmont and, worse for racing, three of those
15 missed at a time when the sport thirsts for a megastar. The last
Triple Crown champion was Affirmed, in 1978, and with the death of
Seattle Slew last month, there isn't even a Triple Crown titlist
living, for the first time since Sir Barton first swept the races in
1919.</TE>
<TE>   All of this history is again required reading, now that War
Emblem, racing's flavor of the month for May, can become the 12th
Triple Crown champion Saturday with a victory in the Belmont. The
speedy, ill-tempered colt is trained by Bob Baffert, who is as much a
part of the Triple Crown as roses at the Kentucky Derby, faux
black-eyed susans at the Preakness and white carnations at the
Belmont. Baffert has won eight Triple Crown races since 1997, but he
was on the bitter receiving end when Touch Gold and Victory Gallop
engineered their upsets.</TE>
<TE>   "I might not have won those Belmonts," Baffert said Tuesday at
Churchill Downs, where War Emblem had been training after the
Preakness, "but you can't say that my horses didn't show up for those
races.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of great horses before mine have gotten this far and not
won the Belmont. Spectacular Bid, Alysheba, Sunday Silence, horses
like that. You take a look at the 11 horses that have done it, and
you see 11 real tough son of a guns."</TE>
<TE>   Two of the last three Triple Crown near-misses--Silver Charm and
Charismatic--were owned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, the most polite
couple in Newport Beach. The Lewises had been in racing for six years
when they paid $85,000 for Silver Charm, at the urging of Baffert.
They later spent $200,000, also a modest price, to acquire
Charismatic, who was trained by Wayne Lukas. Bob Lewis took the role
of the perfect host to a new level when he chartered jetliners to
ferry 100 or so of his best friends from coast to coast for the 1997
and 1999 Belmonts.</TE>
<TE>   The Lewises eventually did win a Belmont, with a horse they had
given little chance, when Commendable pulled off an 18-1 upset in
2000. Alas, Commendable had been a bust in the Derby and had not run
in the Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   The Lewises didn't have a Triple Crown horse this year, but they
attended the Derby and will be part of what might be a record crowd
Saturday in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "Will we be rooting for War Emblem?" Bob Lewis said during a
recent interview at his trophy-filled home. "Darn right."</TE>
<TE>   He has won six Triple Crown races--two Derbies, three Preaknesses
and one Belmont--and on the trip home from Kentucky after this year's
Derby he uncrumpled a list of 38 2-year-olds that he and his wife
own. The Lewis futures are not in soybeans, they're in horses. They
got big-time Triple Crown fever long ago and, with the money that two
beer distributorships have brought, are not likely to seek a cure.</TE>
<TE>   A Very Good Year</TE>
<TE>   Silver Charm was only one of a rock-solid crop of 3-year-olds in
1997. The cream was concentrated in California, where Free House and
Silver Charm began butting heads early in the year, and where the
late-developing Touch Gold was also based. Joining the mix later
would be Captain Bodgit, a hard-knocking, Maryland-based colt who won
the Florida Derby and the Wood Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   Free House had beaten Silver Charm twice in three races at Santa
Anita, including a narrow victory by a head in the Santa Anita Derby,
before the road show began. At the Derby, Silver Charm, favored
Captain Bodgit and Free House ran 1-2-3, Silver Charm winning by a
head. Beverly Lewis was so taken by the victory that she grew
weak-kneed in the winner's circle.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, at Pimlico, Touch Gold joined the Triple Crown
wars. He had won the Lexington Stakes at Keeneland two weeks before
the Derby but owner Frank Stronach, agreeing with his trainer, David
Hofmans, had skipped the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the Preakness, Touch Gold nose-dived, with Chris
McCarron miraculously able to avoid falling. The four-horse finish,
though, was one of the best. Silver Charm beat Free House by a head,
Captain Bodgit was only a head farther back and Touch Gold, who'd
reinjured his hoof at the start, was beaten by about 1 1/2 lengths,
getting squeezed along the rail through the stretch run.</TE>
<TE>   Captain Bodgit was injured and missed the Belmont three weeks
after that as only seven horses showed up in New York. One of them,
Wild Rush, Touch Gold's stablemate, would provide the early pace.</TE>
<TE>   It was touch and go whether Touch Gold would even run. His left
front hoof required 24-hour attention.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know what to expect," Hofmans said. "It got very hairy
leading up to the race."</TE>
<TE>   Several days before the race, though, Touch Gold turned in a solid
seven-furlong workout and Hofmans felt better.</TE>
<TE>   With half a mile left in the race, Wild Rush was still on the
lead, but the three major players were ready to pounce. Gary Stevens
had Silver Charm in second place, then they moved to the lead midway
through the far turn. Silver Charm shook off Free House in the upper
stretch, but Touch Gold and McCarron were still to be heard from.</TE>
<TE>   What Bob Lewis liked about Silver Charm was that he would look a
rival in the eye and dig in, but this day, Baffert still thinks,
Silver Charm didn't see Touch Gold coming. Free House was between
them, temporarily blocking Silver Charm's view of Touch Gold, who was
as far outside as he could be. The difference on the line was
three-quarters of a length.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis said he has never discussed that race with McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   "Chris is one of the best in the game, and I have the utmost
respect for him," Lewis said. "He was just doing his job, trying to
win."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the hotel near Belmont Park, it had rained on Lewis'
post-race party.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to cut through the gloom, Lewis walked in and said to his
guests, "Don't forget how lucky we are just to be here, and don't
treat this like somebody died."</TE>
<TE>   Hofmans never considered throwing the Belmont trophy back.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it would have been a big deal to the industry to finally
have another Triple Crown winner," he said. "But that's what makes
the Triple Crown so tough--you've got to beat all the horses in all
the races.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we had a legitimate shot going into the Belmont, and I
had no doubt about the mile and a half. I saw the disappointment [in
the Lewises] and you don't like to see that, but my horse deserved
it.</TE>
<TE>   "He proved himself again by winning the Haskell too," Hofmans
added, referring to the $1-million Haskell Handicap that August at
Monmouth Park in Oceanport, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Rash to Judgment</TE>
<TE>   Entering the 1998 Belmont, Victory Gallop and Walden, his trainer,
were a mess. Victory Gallop, after finishing half a length behind
Real Quiet in the Derby and beaten by 2 1/4 lengths in another
second-place finish in the Preakness, had lost a lot of weight and
had an ugly rash on his backside. Walden was on crutches, having
injured himself in a pickup basketball game in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were three hard weeks," Walden said.</TE>
<TE>   Real Quiet, though, was not entering the Belmont under a full head
of steam. It had been hot and humid for the Preakness, which took a
lot out of him, and he'd also had a fever in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Handicappers looked at the 11-horse field and concluded that this
Belmont was a two-horse race. At the eighth pole, that was the case,
and Real Quiet, under Kent Desormeaux, was four lengths ahead of
Victory Gallop and Stevens. The crowd of 80,162 sensed that racing's
hunt for the elusive Triple was finally over. But then Real Quiet
seemed to lose focus, and Stevens sent Victory Gallop into overdrive.
Victory Gallop put his nose in front at the wire, the closest Belmont
finish in 36 years.</TE>
<TE>   "The next jump, my horse was back in front," Baffert said. "The
only jump Victory Gallop was in front the whole race was the one at
the wire."</TE>
<TE>   After the race, Baffert took the high road, not criticizing the
ride by Desormeaux, who was accused in some quarters of having moved
too soon. But the other day, during a training break at Churchill,
Baffert said:</TE>
<TE>   "Kent was in it for the money. He hired a [business] agent and was
thinking about a lot of other things. He lost his focus. The thing
about the Triple Crown is, you can't think about the money. I've told
this to Victor [Espinoza, who rides War Emblem]. Just ride your
horse. Kent didn't move early, but he didn't ride the horse with any
confidence. When you've got the best horse in the race, you've got to
ride him that way."</TE>
<TE>   Interviewed recently by the Daily Racing Form, Desormeaux said:</TE>
<TE>   "It was a devastating loss. I wish he'd beat me by five [lengths],
not the width of a fingernail.... I was laughing at the quarter pole.
I thought it was going to be the easiest race I'd ever won, and it
was for the Triple Crown.... I might do some things differently....
Maybe it's something that will help me in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Desormeaux rode Real Quiet only once more, finishing second again.
Stevens and Jerry Bailey rode the horse the rest of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Stevens had ridden Victory Gallop for the first time in the
Preakness.</TE>
<TE>   "We launched a sneak attack on Real Quiet," Stevens said. "That
was the same thing that McCarron and Touch Gold did to beat me and
Silver Charm the year before."</TE>
<TE>   At 29-1, He Was No Lemon</TE>
<TE>   Like Real Quiet, who had been bought at auction for $17,000,
Charismatic was also considered a blue-collar horse, especially after
Lukas twice had run him in claiming races for $62,500. Luckily for
the Lewises, no rival trainers bought him.</TE>
<TE>   When Charismatic won the Derby, at 31-1, he was the first winner
to have run in a claiming race since Dust Commander 29 years earlier.
Charismatic was also the first claiming refugee to win the Preakness
since Deputed Testamony 16 years before.</TE>
<TE>   In the Belmont, he could have become the first ex-claimer to win
in 34 years. The crowd was 85,818, a Belmont Park record.
Charismatic's biggest rivals were perceived to be the Walden-trained
Menifee, second in the Derby and the Preakness, and the filly
Silverbulletday. Horses like Lemon Drop Kid, ninth in the Derby and
absent from the Preakness, and Vision And Verse were considered rank
longshots.</TE>
<TE>   "The two weeks between the Derby and the Preakness just fly by,"
Bob Lewis said. "But the three weeks between the Preakness and the
Belmont are just overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Lemon Drop Kid's disappointing Derby, his trainer, Scotty
Schulhofer, was bullish about his Belmont chances.</TE>
<TE>   "The distance was going to be right down his alley," said
Schulhofer, who had won the Belmont with Colonial Affair six years
earlier. Schulhofer had to change jockeys for the Derby, hiring Jose
Santos after John Velazquez jumped ship to ride Three Ring, the filly
who finished last at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Santos got off Lemon Drop Kid after the Derby and said:</TE>
<TE>   "I was hung out there [wide] the whole way. We ran a mile and
three-eighths in a mile-and-a-quarter race. This horse should win the
Belmont. He can beat these."</TE>
<TE>   The Belmont was Charismatic's last race. In a 12-horse field, he
led with a quarter of a mile left, but finished third, behind Lemon
Drop Kid at 29-1 and Vision And Verse at 54-1. Charismatic broke his
left foreleg and was deftly pulled up just past the wire by jockey
Chris Antley, who protected the horse until the vets arrived.</TE>
<TE>   From the crowded box-seat section, the Lewises couldn't see the
finish.</TE>
<TE>   "A horse is hurt," their daughter Nancy said.</TE>
<TE>   "Who?" Beverly Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Ours," her daughter said.</TE>
<TE>   The Lewises lauded Antley for his post-race composure, but Lukas
was critical of the ride. Charismatic usually made his run from the
middle of the pack, but in the Belmont, Antley had him close to
Silverbulletday's pace.</TE>
<TE>   "Charismatic's style should have been perfect for the Belmont,"
Lukas said. "But Antley took him out of that style. He didn't ride
him to his form, and that compromised his chances."</TE>
<TE>   Antley was found dead at his Pasadena home in December 2000. A
coroner's report said that the death was caused by an accidental drug
overdose.</TE>
<TE>   Schulhofer, who retired from training in January and lives in
Hollywood, Fla., thought about the two Belmonts he'd won. In 1993,
favored Prairie Bayou broke down on the backstretch and was
euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   "So both times, the favorite broke down," said Schulhofer, a Hall
of Fame trainer. "But I don't think they would have beaten my horses,
anyway. Colonial Affair was a real good horse, and Lemon Drop Kid was
the best horse I ever trained."</TE>

<HD>Stringer Family's Claims Upheld by District Judge</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A district judge Wednesday upheld the claims brought against the
Minnesota Vikings by the family of Korey Stringer, who died of
heatstroke complications last summer after the second day of training
camp.</LD>
<LD>   The Vikings in February asked Hennepin County District Judge Gary
Larson to dismiss the 10-count lawsuit, which accuses team officials
and doctors of negligence, malpractice, intentional injury and
infliction of emotional distress. Although Larson dismissed three of
the counts--including the accusation the Vikings intended to cause
Stringer's injury--he ruled the family's allegations, if proved true,
would be enough to hold the Vikings liable for gross negligence.</LD>
<LD>   "The Vikings claimed that they gave Korey 'exemplary treatment,' "
Stanley Chesley, lead attorney for the Stringer family, said in a
written statement. "Now, the judge has said that if the complaint
proves out, the Vikings were guilty of gross negligence. That's not
exemplary treatment.</LD>
<TE>   "For the first time, a court has ruled that a National Football
League team and its employees can be held liable for gross negligence
in its treatment of a player. That's a landmark ruling that should be
a sign to the NFL and every team that the old ways of dealing with
the heat is not enough and changes must be made before another
training camp begins."</TE>
<TE>   Stringer, 27, a Pro Bowl tackle, died in the early hours of Aug. 1
after collapsing after the morning practice session the day before.
His wife, Kelci, filed the $100-million lawsuit that is scheduled to
begin in June 2003.</TE>

<HD>For Francis, Success Never Grows Old</HD>
<DH>Stanley Cup finals: Center, 39, who scored winning goal in
Game 1, sets the tone for the upstart Hurricanes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Because Ron Francis is regarded as the best player in Carolina
franchise history, it was fitting for "Ronnie Franchise" to score the
game-winning goal in the Hurricanes' first Stanley Cup game.</LD>
<LD>   Francis, who at 39 is one of the oldest players in the NHL, scored
a goal 58 seconds into overtime Tuesday to give Carolina a 1-0 lead
in games over Detroit in the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals.</LD>
<LD>   Carolina Coach Paul Maurice, four years younger than Francis, has
nothing but respect for the Hurricanes' captain.</LD>
<TE>   "He brought an instant expectation level," Maurice said Wednesday
about Francis, who started his NHL career with the Hartford Whalers
and rejoined the franchise as a free agent on July 13, 1998, after
the team had moved to Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a certain preparation professionalism, if that's a proper
statement. He prepares very hard when he is supposed to, takes very
good care of himself and he has a calm about him.</TE>
<TE>   "As things get either more difficult or more intense he seems to
relax more and more. I think he just enjoys it. The big games for him
are the most exciting."</TE>
<TE>   Francis has played 21 seasons in the league and owns two Stanley
Cup rings, thanks to championships he won playing for Pittsburgh in
the early 1990s. He has been the glue for the Hurricanes' playoff run
this year and helped the team have the right frame of mind for
Tuesday's game, despite being overwhelming underdogs to the Red
Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talk about Ron, the first thing that I always mention is
class, and I think you don't realize how important that is to have,"
Carolina veteran forward Rod Brind'Amour said. "The way he carries
himself and what he has done just brings respect within our locker
room. Just watch him and it just feeds off. Everyone just kind of
patterns themselves with the way they behave on and off the ice after
him."</TE>
<TE>   Francis, who signed a five-year, $22-million deal with Carolina
four years ago, has said that he doesn't plan to make a decision
about his playing future until after the finals. The Hurricanes
expect Francis to play at least one more season.</TE>
<TE>   But even if he does decide to retire this summer, Francis has no
regrets about signing with Carolina in 1998, when the team was
rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   "I have said this numerous times: I hate when guys sign a big
contract and say money had nothing to do with it," said Francis,
traded from Hartford to Pittsburgh in 1991. "Certainly that was a
factor. But I sat down, I looked at a lot of things, I looked at the
city of Raleigh, read a lot about what it was like to live there and
what a great place it was to live and raise a family. That was
important for me.</TE>
<TE>   "When I put all the pros and cons down on paper, for me, I thought
it was a good move, and outside of the first 40 games when things
were really struggling for me, I have been really pleased with that
decision."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although teams that have won Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals went
on to win the championship in 50 of 63 seasons (79.4%) since the NHL
went to a best-of-seven format in 1939, the Red Wings are not about
to roll over.</TE>
<TE>   "We just can't think too far ahead now," said Detroit Coach Scotty
Bowman, whose team rallied to defeat Vancouver, 4-2, in the first
round after losing the first two games of the series at home.
"Obviously, the second game is always a crucial game in a series....
There will be pressure on every game as it goes along, but we just
have to concentrate trying to even up this series."</TE>
<TE>   In Game 1, the Red Wings jumped out to a 1-0 lead and led, 2-1,
late in the second period. But they still lost. Bowman is hoping for
a sharper performance tonight.</TE>
<TE>   "I think basically without putting the finger on a bunch of stuff,
it's strange we had a real poor passing game," Bowman said. "Our
passes really hurt us, especially in the first half of the game. We
caused a lot of turnovers, and it didn't result in a lot of damage,
but it certainly stopped the offense."</TE>

<HD>Blanco Lifts Braves With a Clutch Homer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Blanco doesn't get many hits. Even so, he's becoming the guy
the Atlanta Braves want at the plate in clutch situations.</LD>
<LD>   The backup catcher hit a two-out, two-run homer in the bottom of
the eighth inning for his third game-winning hit this season, leading
the streaking Braves to a 6-4 victory over the New York Mets on
Wednesday night.</LD>
<LD>   "When you look up and see his average on the board, it's not
indicative of how good a hitter he is," Chipper Jones said. "He
turned around a pretty good fastball that was down in the strike
zone."</LD>
<TE>   Blanco came up in the eighth batting .183. But he has a way of
coming up with big hits--his other homer was a 10th-inning drive that
won a game at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 5, Houston 4--Luis Gonzalez drove in Erubiel Durazo with a
single in the 13th inning to give the Diamondbacks a victory over the
Astros at Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Randy Johnson struck out 11 in eight innings but left
with his second no-decision in his last three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who threw a season-high 137 pitches, gave up three runs
and six hits and did not walk a batter.</TE>
<TE>   He reached double-digit strikeouts for the fifth time this season
and 176th of his career, second only to Nolan Ryan's 215.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 2, Philadelphia 1--Luis Castillo went four for five with a
home run at Philadelphia to extend his hitting streak to a
Marlin-record 23 games, and A.J. Burnett (6-5) pitched a six-hitter
for his fourth career complete game.</TE>
<TE>   "When he gets confidence the way he has it, he can go for two or
three months," teammate Kevin Millar said of Castillo. "All of a
sudden, he's Godzilla."</TE>
<TE>   Millar doubled in the first inning to extend his hitting streak to
a career-best 17 games.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo ended a 1-1 tie in the fifth inning with his second homer
this year. He singled in the first, seventh and ninth innings.</TE>
<TE>   Burnett walked one and struck out six in his second complete game
this season and the fourth of his career. He had been 0-3 in five
starts since May 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those nights, it was a blast," Burnett said. "I was
just letting go and every pitch I heard the pop. I had a good
fastball, so we figured we would go with it."</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 3, Pittsburgh 1--Javier Vazquez pitched a three-hitter
and struck out 10 for the Expos at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez (4-2) retired 20 of the first 21 batters, giving up only a
two-out single by Josh Fogg (6-4) in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I go out there, that's what I try to do," Vazquez
said. "Today I felt good. I threw strikes. I was around the zone a
lot today, and that's about it."</TE>
<TE>   Vazquez lost the shutout bid in the seventh on Brian Giles' single
and Craig Wilson's double.</TE>
<TE>   "He mixed all his pitches up, worked both sides of the plate, and
kept the ball down," Pittsburgh catcher Jason Kendall said. "If you
do that, you'll be successful."</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Milwaukee 1--Two struggling hitters found their strokes
just in time to help the Cubs avert a three-game sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Moises Alou doubled home the tying run with two out in the ninth
inning at Milwaukee, and Bill Mueller hit a two-run double in the
10th.</TE>
<TE>   Alou had been batting .184 and Mueller .189.</TE>
<TE>   "I was more aggressive today, and things worked out for me," Alou
said.</TE>
<TE>   Right fielder Jeffrey Hammonds robbed Sammy Sosa of his 21st home
run and hit a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis at Cincinnati--The game was postponed because of rain
and will be made up as part of a doubleheader Aug. 27.</TE>

<HD>San Diego Officials Send Strong Letter to the Anschutz
Group</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In their strongest indication yet they intend to keep the Chargers,
San Diego officials fired a legal salvo Wednesday at the group
looking to build an NFL stadium in downtown Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Leslie J. Girard, a San Diego assistant city attorney, faxed a
two-page letter to Anschutz Entertainment Group President Tim
Leiweke, along with pertinent excerpts from the team's Qualcomm
Stadium lease.</LD>
<LD>   "The City trusts that AEG will conduct its business affairs in Los
Angeles without interfering with the contractual rights and
obligations of the City and the Chargers under the agreement," Girard
wrote in the letter, which was endorsed by the San Diego City Council
and distributed to reporters by San Diego Mayor Dick Murphy.</LD>
<TE>   The letter reiterates the Chargers can only pursue their
renegotiation rights if a defined "triggering event" exists on Dec.
1, and the team has 60 days after that to notify the city such an
event has occurred. After that, the Chargers and the city must
negotiate in good faith for 90 days, then--if those negotiations
fail--the Chargers have 180 days to present the city with a letter of
intent to use another stadium. The city then has 90 days to match
that offer.</TE>
<TE>   The letter appears to imply that the city might file a lawsuit if
the Anschutz group, by openly dealing with the Chargers, causes San
Diego fans to lose interest in the team, thus increasing the amount
the city has to pay for unsold tickets. The city has paid nearly $25
million for unsold tickets in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke could not be reached for comment about the letter.</TE>

<DL>FUKUI, Japan</DL>
<LD>So where were you when the United States defeated Portugal in the
World Cup?</LD>
<LD>   Most of Los Angeles was no doubt asleep, replenishing energy
reserves for the Lakers' NBA Finals opener. The Los Angeles chapter
of the American Soccer Underground, as fervent and as dedicated as
any secret society, was caffeinated and captivated, reveling well
past 4 in the morning in the country's biggest soccer victory in more
than 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   I was standing in a small soccer stadium on the west coast of
Japan, along with a couple dozen other journalists conducting
interviews at the Mexican team's late-afternoon training session.
Under normal circumstances, Mexico and the United States are the most
intense of soccer rivals, pounding one another regularly in Gold Cup
competitions and regional World Cup qualification. But over here,
thousands of miles from home, they are brothers united with two
common goals: first-round survival and repairing the global
reputation of North American soccer.</LD>
<TE>   A Mexican colleague was making fast recovery runs from the stands
to the press box, which was equipped with the live feed from the
U.S.-Portugal match, and back to the stands to report the game's
unfathomable progress.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ONE-NOTHING, United States!" came the first breathless
announcement. Some of us looked up and started laughing. Yeah, right.
That's a good one. Had to be an own goal by Portugal, right?</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, he hustled back again.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it is TWO-NOTHING, United States!"</TE>
<TE>   This time, it really was an own goal.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, we were packing up our notepads and our tape recorders in
hope of seeing some of this for ourselves when our incredible instant
messenger came sprinting up again.</TE>
<TE>   "Now ... THREE-NOTHING!"</TE>
<TE>   That couldn't be right. We looked at one another with arched
eyebrows.</TE>
<TE>   Nah. The U.S. hadn't scored three goals in a World Cup match since
... well, how long have they been playing World Cups? Seventy-two
years?</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, when the United States hosted the World Cup, the home
team scored three goals, total, in four matches.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, when the United States finished 32nd out of 32 teams in
France, the tally was one American goal in three humiliating defeats.</TE>
<TE>   And now you're telling us the Americans are 3-0 up on Portugal?
The Portugal of Figo and Pauleta, the Portugal favored by many to
reach the World Cup semifinals, the Portugal that had been expected
to shred the hapless U.S. defense into damp lumps of red, white and
blue confetti?</TE>
<TE>   If this is right, one photographer somberly declared, "this is
history."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's the strange sea creatures here that pass for dinner,
maybe it's all that green tea, but something is happening in this
World Cup that isn't supposed to happen in World Cups.</TE>
<TE>   Senegal defeats France in the tournament opener?</TE>
<TE>   Mexico clamps down on Croatia, the bronze medalist of 1998?</TE>
<TE>   South Korea, winless in 14 previous World Cup matches, runs
circles around and through a bunch of lumbering Polish defenders who
look as if they never fought off the jet lag?</TE>
<TE>   Japan and Belgium, without offering any advance indication that
such a thing was feasible, combine for four highlight-reel goals in a
span of 13 minutes?</TE>
<TE>   Ireland, playing without its deposed captain, Roy Keane, rallies
to tie Cameroon, then rallies again, in the 92nd minute, to tie
Germany--a development so unlikely and unexpected, Irish Coach Mick
McCarthy is left bug-eyed and slack-jawed, looking as if he had just
seen a Martian spacecraft swoop in to laser-melt the goal posts?</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy's face is the official emblem of the first week of 2002
World Cup, now complete.</TE>
<TE>   We are seeing things we can't believe, and we can't wait for the
next opportunity to see more.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, some of the usual names have been among the most impressive
here. Argentina defeated Nigeria, 1-0, on a header by Gabriel
Batistuta, as overworked a script as there is. Brazil held off a
furious challenge by Turkey, thanks to a sensational goal by--guess
who's back?--Ronaldo. Italy overmatched Ecuador, as was predicted,
although in something of an upset, the defensively obsessive Italians
actually forged upfield often enough to score twice in the first
half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   But the early hours of the tournament have belonged to the
underdogs, the tiny fish in the big pond--"minnows," as the Brits
call them.</TE>
<TE>   It was a good first week for Asia and Africa and the much-maligned
North and Central American region known as CONCACAF, whose
representatives here--Costa Rica, Mexico and United States--are a
collective 3-0. Tournament co-hosts Japan and South Korea, previously
a combined 0-17-4 at the World Cup, are undefeated, having totaled
four goals, a win and a tie. And the Africans have been a joy to
watch, playing attacking, vibrant soccer whether they win implausibly
(Senegal), lose narrowly (Nigeria) or draw (Cameroon).</TE>
<TE>   The gap between soccer's haves and have-nots is shrinking in a
hurry, as U.S. Coach Bruce Arena tried to inform us last week. We
didn't listen then, but we are certainly watching now.</TE>
<TE>   The minnows have been a delight. The ones on the soccer field,
that is. As opposed to whatever that is they're serving at the
concession stands, covered in rice and wrapped in seaweed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Without Pedigree</TE>
<TE>   How surprising is the 3-0 start by CONCACAF's three
representatives--Costa Rica, Mexico and the United States--at the
World Cup? Consider:</TE>
<TE>   * Only once since CONCACAF was organized in 1961 have its teams
combined for three victories over an entire Cup. That was in 1986,
with all three victories by Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   * Costa Rica, in 1990, was the first CONCACAF team to qualify for
the second round without the benefit of being host. Only six times
has a team from the region advanced beyond the first round, three
when that nation was the host.</TE>
<TE>   * The region went from 1970 to 1986 without a victory in the World
Cup.</TE>
<TE>   * The three victories this year bring the total by CONCACAF teams
to 15 in 12 World Cups, nine by Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Winning Ugly Isn't an Option for the Displeased Russians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here is how Russia stands after the first round of games in Group H:</LD>
<LD>   Undefeated, unscored upon, alone in first place ... and none too
happy about it.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, Russia defeated an outmanned Tunisia team in Kobe,
Japan, on Wednesday, but struggled mightily in an unconvincing 2-0
victory. Tunisia, the weakest link in what is widely regarded as the
weakest group in the tournament, held Russia scoreless for nearly an
hour, yielded only one goal through the run of play and created
enough quality scoring chances to leave the winning coach in a bad
mood.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a good game for the fans," Russia Coach Oleg Romantsev
said, "but there will be reprimands for my players after the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm dissatisfied with the way we played in our penalty area and
in their penalty area. We cannot allow our opponents to create so
many chances, and we created chances ourselves but did not finish
them off."</TE>
<TE>   After 58 minutes of frustration, Yegor Titov finally gave Russia
the lead, courtesy of a distribution mistake by Tunisia goalkeeper
Ali Boumnijel. A poor throw by Boumnijel was intercepted by Dmitry
Sychev, who worked the ball to Titov for his successful strike from
the edge of the box.</TE>
<TE>   Six minutes later, Tunisia's Rahdi Jaidi was whistled for a foul
on Sychev in his own penalty area. Valery Karpin converted the
penalty kick and suddenly, Russia had a rather undeserved 2-0
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia forward Ziad Jaziri was far from impressed by Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Their physical presence is quite strong, but with our technical
qualities we could pass through them," Jaziri said. "Their defense
was very slow. It wasn't hard to dribble past them."</TE>
<TE>   Russia leads Group H with three points, two ahead of Belgium and
Japan, which played to a 2-2 draw on Tuesday. But clearly the
Russians have work to do before their next match against Japan in
Yokohama on Sunday--although Karpin, for one, didn't want to hear
about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to think about the next match," he said, exhausted
from the humidity and the unexpected pressure applied by Tunisia. "I
just need a break."</TE>

<HD>Action on Scoring Gets Deep Freeze</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: ISU Congress is bogged down in other
matters and makes no headway to improve judging.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KYOTO, Japan</DL>
<LD>Despite members' exhortations to explore reforms that would repair
figure skating's damaged credibility, the International Skating Union
Congress became bogged down in tedious matters Thursday morning
(Japanese time) and did not get to the most vital topic on its
agenda.</LD>
<LD>   While votes were taken on matters such as whether referees must
possess "a good knowledge of English" or "a very good knowledge of
English," discussion was delayed on potentially momentous changes to
the sport's scoring and judging systems proposed Wednesday by the
U.S., Australia, Canada and the ISU Council.</LD>
<LD>   The Congress is scheduled to end Friday (Japanese time) after
holding elections.</LD>
<TE>   "We'll probably reach some sort of resolution, but whether we'll
be able to implement it for next season, I don't know," said Don
McKnight, president of Ice Skating Australia. "The ISU proposal
certainly can't be implemented immediately. We need another week--or
another few days."</TE>
<TE>   The figure skating delegates were expected to meet into the
evening hours Thursday to examine the reform packages and attempt to
bring about the meaningful change sought by ISU President Ottavio
Cinquanta.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to pull all these pieces together," said Phyllis
Howard, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. "Still, we feel
something needs to be done."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. proposal, which centers on ranking skaters by a median
score and creating five geographical zones from which judges would be
selected, appeared to have solid support. It could be implemented
more quickly than the ISU project, which will require years of
testing and study.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. always carries weight simply because it's the U.S.,"
McKnight said. "But I think everyone will be given fair
consideration. I'm hopeful we'll get a satisfactory compromise, which
is what it's all about. We need to make it better. It doesn't matter
whose proposal it is.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I have a lot of support. People keep telling me how good
it is, but I don't know if they're telling everyone else the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   A proposal that would have given singles skaters a bye in the
qualifying rounds at the world championships if they or their country
placed in the top 20 at the previous world competition failed to get
a two-thirds majority and was rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Delegates approved the awarding of a 6.0 to performances that are
"outstanding" as opposed to "faultless," although the point would be
moot if the ISU cumulative points system is adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Meeting separately, speedskating delegates voted to use video
replay in short-track competitions to settle protests when cameras
are available, such as in televised competitions. The referee will
evaluate the replay immediately after a protest is lodged verbally or
in writing, and must reach a conclusion before the start of the next
event.</TE>

<LD>UCLA senior Audie Attar, a linebacker expected to contend for a
starting position, was dismissed from the team Wednesday after being
involved in a fight.</LD>
<LD>   University police are investigating the incident, which occurred
off campus, and no arrests have been made.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel this decision is in the best interests of the program,"
Coach Bob Toledo said. "It's unfortunate I have to take this action,
but this is not the first time Audie has violated team policy."</LD>
<TE>   Attar, a key special teams member the last three seasons, believes
the dismissal is not merited.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't agree with the decision," he said. "I feel it was
premature and I would hope Coach Toledo would consider an appeal."</TE>

<TE>   Page met with Brewer officials Wednesday to discuss a contract,
and Nixon will meet with Dodger officials Saturday. They must weigh a
baseball signing bonus and immediate opportunity to launch a
professional career against a UCLA education and big-time college
football.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, the Dodger left fielder, juggled both sports early in his
career, playing defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons. He made an
impression on Nixon during a workout at Dodger Stadium last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "He kind of said, 'Go with your heart,' " Nixon said. "He gave
reasons why he's playing baseball over football.</TE>
<TE>   "I think unless something goes wrong Saturday, it's going to be
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Nixon informed scouts before the draft how much money it would
take for him to forgo football and sign, a figure estimated at close
to $1 million. Page stands to receive perhaps half that amount.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't necessarily mean I am not going to school [and playing
football]," Page said. "They will talk about that, and I will see
what they say. I want to play both, unless they say something that
makes me want to play just one."</TE>
<TE>   Toledo is not conceding anything. He is hoping Nixon and Page
follow the lead of Bruin defensive backs Ricky Manning and Matt Ware,
who play pro baseball during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   However, those players were much lower draft picks. The Dodgers
and Brewers might be reluctant to pay a large signing bonus to
players willing to commit only a few months a year to baseball.</TE>

<HD>Portugal Coach Sounds Like Loser</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUWON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Portugal Coach Antonio Oliveira said he didn't want to make any
excuses, but excuses are certainly what he was offering after his
side's unexpected defeat.</LD>
<LD>   "We were aware of the problems that the U.S. team would present,"
he said. "They played very strongly as we expected. We had a lot of
problems during the match to try to impose our game [on them].
Probably we missed some luck along the way, but that is not an
excuse.</LD>
<LD>   "They had a lot of time to prepare for this World Cup, which we
didn't. The Portuguese players were involved with European leagues
until a very short time ago. We only had two weeks of preparation.
This is not an excuse; this is a fact."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While Portuguese media bemoaned the loss by a team that had
reached the semifinals of the European Championship in 2000 and was
expected to go far in the World Cup, Oliveira tried to preach calm.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing is lost," he said in an interview with Portuguese state
television RTP. "It is merely more distant."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portugal star Luis Figo put the blame squarely on his own team.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to recognize that we made some mistakes that we normally
don't make," he said. "We lost because of these mistakes. Give credit
to the United States team, but these mistakes cannot happen in a Cup
competition like this."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All 14 U.S. players who took part in the match deserved credit for
the victory, none more so than DaMarcus Beasley, who tormented
Portugal on offense with his speed on the left flank and also got
back time and again to help on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a lot of great attacking players and it was hard," he
said. "They're a lot to handle, but I thought our defense played well
and we did fine.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing this at such a young age, it feels great. I feel that I'm a
part of something big. We've finally got over the hump. We're closing
that gap between the U.S. and Europe."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Landon Donovan, who along with Beasley (they're both 20) led the
U.S. team that finished fourth in the FIFA Under-17 World
Championship in New Zealand in 1999, showed a wisdom beyond his years
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember that it's just the first game," he said.
"Everyone's excited, but we don't want to take it for more than it
is."</TE>
<TE>   Donovan bristled at the idea that the Americans had come into the
game not believing they could win.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw the Senegal game," he said, referring to the 1-0 win over
world champion France. "Why can't we beat a Portugal? We've played a
lot of games this year and played a lot of good teams pretty
tough.... Once we get on the field, they're just like you and me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A groin injury suffered in the match probably will keep U.S.
winger Earnie Stewart out of the next game, against South Korea on
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, forward Clint Mathis said it was a hamstring problem,
not a left knee injury as U.S. team officials had said, that kept him
from playing. Mathis said he has recovered completely and is
available to play against South Korea.</TE>

<HD>Arena Plays Shock Market</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Coach's new lineup pays off with three first-half
goals in stunning upset. Second round a real possibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUWON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>Apparently, there isn't much to this World Cup business. Just throw a
bunch of guys together--almost any 11 will do--take on a pedigreed
European power and walk off the field with a victory.</LD>
<LD>   That--implausibly, improbably, impressively--was exactly what the
United States did here Wednesday night, gunning down Portugal with a
three-goal barrage in the first half and then hanging on to win, 3-2,
in front of a disbelieving crowd of 37,306.</LD>
<LD>   The unexpected result drew immediate comparisons to two other
American World Cup upsets: the 1-0 victory over England in Brazil in
1950 and the 2-1 victory over Colombia at the Rose Bowl in 1994.</LD>
<TE>   This one might have been bigger than either, however, not only
because of the quality of the opposition but because it was achieved
with a makeshift team whose 11 starters had never played together.</TE>
<TE>   On top of that, six of the U.S. players were making their World
Cup debut.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this victory will grab the attention of a lot of people
in the United States," U.S. Coach Bruce Arena said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. Maybe not. What will grab the attention is the postgame
comment made by Portugal Coach Antonio Oliveira.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried everything possible to get a draw," he said. This from a
man whose team was overwhelmingly favored to win Group D and included
the likes of FIFA world player of the year Luis Figo of Real Madrid
and lesser stars such as Rui Costa of AC Milan, Sergio Conceicao of
Inter Milan and Fernando Couto of Lazio.</TE>
<TE>   A draw was the last thing on the minds of the Portuguese when the
national anthems were being played, but 36 minutes into the game they
found themselves trailing by three goals.</TE>
<TE>   That too deserves to be put in perspective. The last time an
American team scored three goals in a World Cup match was when Bert
Patenaude bagged a hat trick against Paraguay in 1930.</TE>
<TE>   There were no hat tricks Wednesday, but the match will go into the
record books as the first in World Cup history to feature two own
goals, although that's jumping ahead in the story.</TE>
<TE>   Injuries to Claudio Reyna and Clint Mathis forced Arena to juggle
his lineup, and he went for broke. For example:</TE>
<TE>   * David Regis was tossed out as the left back and replaced by
Frankie Hejduk, who had never played the position for the national
team.</TE>
<TE>   * Pablo Mastroeni, a free spirit from Arizona who became a U.S.
citizen only last year, was assigned the defensive midfield role even
though he had played only 10 national team games.</TE>
<TE>   * Two 20-year-olds, Landon Donovan and DaMarcus Beasley, were
given starting assignments.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, it seemed as if the U.S. was headed for a drubbing.
Instead, it might be heading to the second round if it can produce
similarly inspired performances against South Korea on Monday and
Poland on June 14.</TE>
<TE>   It took the U.S. only four minutes to take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   A corner kick by Earnie Stewart on the left reached Brian McBride,
whose sharp header was only parried by Portuguese goalkeeper Vitor
Baia. The ball rebounded to John O'Brien, who lashed a left-foot shot
into the back of the net, bringing a gasp from the crowd and a roar
from the U.S. bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important that we came out and attacked them from the
get-go and maybe put them on their heels a bit," McBride said.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. continued to attack and doubled its lead in unexpected
fashion in the 29th minute when Donovan hit a hopeful cross from the
right only to see the ball deflect off the back of defender Jorge
Costa and elude Baia's desperate lunge as it flew into the net.</TE>
<TE>   "It was weird," Donovan said. "I hit it and when it first
deflected I thought, 'oh, damn,' but I looked up and it [the ball]
just had eyes for the goal. I'm obviously not going to take credit
for it, but they all count."</TE>
<TE>   The third U.S. goal, seven minutes later, was a thing of beauty.
Defender Tony Sanneh overlapped down the right wing and crossed the
ball to the far post. McBride launched himself in a headfirst dive
and headed it powerfully into the net, with Baia having no chance to
make a save.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody was ecstatic," Cobi Jones said. "Everybody was excited.
It's an unbelievable feeling to be up 3-0 on Portugal in the first
half. No one could have guessed that a month ago."</TE>
<TE>   Stung for a third time, Portugal finally responded.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was pretty obvious that we awoke a pretty big beast,"
McBride said. "They're a very good team and they attack regardless of
what the score is. We knew we couldn't have any mental lapses, and
when we did they hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   Three minutes after McBride's goal, Portugal cut the deficit when
O'Brien, helping out on defense, cleared the ball only as far as
Beto, who slammed it past goalkeeper Brad Friedel to make the score
3-1.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal enjoyed the better of the second half, but its finishing
was uncharacteristically woeful. It was left to American defender
Jeff Agoos to help out in the 71st minute when he accidentally
volleyed the ball into his own net.</TE>
<TE>   That brought a roar of "Por-tu-gal, Por-tu-gal" from the
Portuguese fans, but their enthusiasm gradually waned as the U.S.
defense stiffened.</TE>
<TE>   In the end it was the American fans who were in fine voice, their
"ole, ole, ole, ole" chant ringing around the stadium at the final
whistle.</TE>

Rare Event
The United States' 3-2 victory over Portugal on Wednesday is being
described as one of the biggest in history. It was only the fifth for
the Americans in World Cup play (5-12-1 all-time). Here are the U.S.
World Cup victories and the team's eventual result in the tournament:
1930 URUGUAY
* Victories: The U.S. picked up two victories in this tournament,
defeating Belgium and Paraguay in consecutive games, each by 3-0
* Overall: Any momentum the U.S. had built was destroyed when the
team lost to Argentina, 6-1, in the semifinals
1950 BRAZIL
* Victory: In what has long been considered by many the greatest
upset in World Cup history, the U.S. defeated England, 1-0, on a goal
by Joe Gaetjens
* Overall: Because of a 3-1 loss to Spain and a 5-2 loss to
Chile--results sandwiched around the England stunner--the U.S. did
not advance beyond its third game
1994 UNITED STATES
* Victory: Much the way Portugal was hyped in the 2002 World Cup,
Colombia was lauded before this tournament, but a 2-1 U.S. victory
over the Colombians at the Rose Bowl helped vault the Americans past
the first round
* Overall: A Fourth of July matchup wasn't enough to inspire a
victory in the round of 16 as the U.S. lost to eventual champion
Brazil, 1-0, at Stanford</TE>

<HD>Andersen Jury Hears Forceful Arguments</HD>
<DH>Courts: Deliberations begin today. Prosecution and defense
make final push in Enron-related trial of accounting firm facing
obstruction charge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The government and the defense in the Arthur Andersen
obstruction-of-justice trial made their final arguments to the jury
on Wednesday, battling to the bitter end about the firm's intent when
it shredded documents related to Enron Corp. last year.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ordered the jury to start
deliberations in the case, in which Andersen is accused of destroying
records with the aim of impeding an investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   Asst. U.S. Atty. Samuel Buell began the summations Wednesday,
telling jurors that Andersen shredded the files because it knew that
the SEC would demand "the kitchen sink" in its quest for documents
related to Enron's finances. Andersen should have known that because
it had previously received subpoenas for its audits of such troubled
clients as Waste Management Inc. and Sunbeam Corp., Buell said.</LD>
<TE>   All the Enron documents mattered, Buell told the panel, because
the SEC, "is entitled to all the facts. Arthur Andersen doesn't get
to make that decision for them."</TE>
<TE>   But Andersen lead attorney Rusty Hardin made an impassioned plea
to the jury to spare the firm of 28,000 U.S. employees, saying the
Justice Department had made a "rush to judgment" in indicting the
89-year-old accounting giant.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said that no one at the firm intended to conceal
information from the SEC and that prosecutors "corruptly persuaded"
David B. Duncan, formerly the Andersen partner in charge of auditing
Enron, to plead guilty to obstruction of justice even though he never
violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   Both the prosecution and the defense had scored important tactical
victories during the course of the trial, making the closing
arguments potentially pivotal in the outcome of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Each side was granted four hours to persuade the jury, whose
decision will have an enormous effect on the outcome of the Enron
cases that are expected to follow.</TE>
<TE>   To convict the firm, the jury must find an Andersen employee
"corruptly persuaded" another to destroy evidence with the intent of
concealing it from regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Buell said Andersen had failed to explain why an in-house attorney
sent e-mails last October that reminded partners to comply with the
firm's document policy, which calls for preserving audit papers
needed to back up accounting judgments and the disposal of drafts or
other papers deemed unnecessary. The policy, he told jurors, was
never widely known in the firm and the Enron audit team had never
been told of the policy before last fall, just as Enron's public
meltdown began.</TE>
<TE>   "It had never been done before. This policy was about the lowest
priority in the firm ... all of a sudden it rockets to the top of
everybody's to-do list ....What's the rush?" Buell asked. "What
answer does the defense have to that question?"</TE>
<TE>   Buell said Andersen's senior executives feared potentially tougher
SEC enforcement under new chairman Harvey L. Pitt and invoked the
policy to provide a cover for destroying as much material as possible
before receiving a subpoena. "Why did it happen when it happened?
They were girding for the Enron wars."</TE>
<TE>   During the trial Andersen contended that the shredded documents
were "extraneous," but Buell said that did not amount to a proper
defense under the law.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue isn't whether they did a perfect job" of destroying all
incriminating papers, he said. "They did it because their strategy
was ... the less, the better. Who knows what kind of hideous
documents might be buried in those worker bee files?"</TE>
<TE>   But Hardin, in an often manic four-hour summation, said Andersen
drifted into a "perfect storm" of circumstances that made the
document destruction appear "suspicious."</TE>
<TE>   But he insisted the firm's conduct did not amount to a crime. No
one persuaded anyone else to shred documents with the intent of
keeping them from the SEC.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin argued that it is not illegal for a firm to follow its
normal business policies while an SEC inquiry is underway.</TE>
<TE>   He also discussed the conduct of the four key players fingered by
the government as "corrupt persuaders" under the law--Duncan, Nancy
Temple, Thomas Bauer and Michael Odom. Hardin said none of them
possessed criminal intent or acted to persuade others to impede the
SEC, based on their notes and e-mails.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Hardin said Temple, a junior lawyer at the firm,
has been "wronged" by the prosecution. "We have 38-year-old junior
lawyer who has not been charged with a crime and has been blasphemed
by these people for three weeks when they decided they didn't like
what David Duncan said," His voice rising, Harden said, "Nancy Temple
has been legally and morally wronged in this trial, and I will not
apologize for my tone of voice or my anger. We don't do this in this
country."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin also aimed to dismantle the allegation that Enron team
members in Andersen's Portland, Ore., and London offices also
received instructions to destroy Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin noted that prosecutors didn't call executives from those
offices to appear at the trial. When Andersen did call them, they
testified that they didn't interpret the policy as a signal to shred
incriminating papers. "This isn't a conspiracy," Hardin said. "They
literally drifted into this."</TE>

<HD>Teen Settles Latest Fraud Claims by SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mission Viejo teenager, in his second securities-fraud case, turned
over $93,731 to settle charges he manipulated stocks with false chat
board messages, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Cole Bartiromo, a 17-year-old high school student, surrendered
$91,000 in gains plus interest made by driving up stock prices of 15
publicly traded firms in a "pump and dump scheme," the SEC said.</LD>
<LD>   Bartiromo previously turned over more than $1 million he raised
from some 1,000 investors with promises of guaranteed returns in
sports betting touted on an Internet bulletin board named "Invest
Better 2001," the SEC said.</LD>
<TE>   "Cole just wants to get this thing over with and get on with his
life," said his attorney, David Bayless of Morrison &amp; Foerster in San
Francisco. Bayless said Bartiromo agreed to settle the pump-and-dump
charges, without admitting or denying guilt, before the case was
filed in federal court April 29.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC alleged Bartiromo posted more than 6,000 false messages on
Internet chat boards last year to drive up share prices and sell his
holdings at a profit. The stocks included F2 Broadcast Network Inc.
and Call Solutions Inc., both most recently trading for less than 1
cent a share.</TE>

<HD>USC to Shutter High-Tech Incubator</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling it a "six-year experiment" that had run its course, USC
officials have decided to shut the school's technology business
incubator, known as EC2, on June 30.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which was funded by the university, helped more than
two dozen technology firms such as Womenswire.com and GameWorld
Technologies get their start by giving them a variety of services,
including work space in the Adams Boulevard center and access to
cutting-edge technology. Some of the start-ups maintained their
offices elsewhere but still had access to the center's services.</LD>
<LD>   Officials cited several reasons for shuttering the incubator, from
falling investment yields that reduced available funding to the
dot-com collapse that made the exercise seem less relevant.</LD>
<TE>   The name EC2 was short for Egg Co. 2, with "egg" referring to the
center's role in hatching businesses. Opened in the fall of 1995, it
was one of the first high-tech business incubators in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   EC2 doubled as an incubator and a media research facility,
focusing on digital technologies. The $1.5-million annual cost to run
the nonprofit operation came from the USC Annenberg Center for
Communication.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the center's aim, officials said, was to study the effect
of communication technology developments on society and to examine
the role of a business incubator in academia.</TE>
<TE>   Given advances in both areas, and the school's desire to focus on
developing arenas such as multimedia literacy and technology uses in
interactive storytelling, the decision was made last year to pull the
plug at the end of this school year.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a decision that we wanted to focus in some different
areas," said Todd Richmond, managing director of the Annenberg
Center. "It came to a point where, when we looked around at what we
want to be doing, we decided it was time to wind the project down.
We're in a different environment than we were five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Jon P. Goodman, executive director of EC2, said that when the
center launched, "the Internet was nothing anybody really thought
about. Today, the question is not whether you're going to get on the
World Wide Web but how."</TE>
<TE>   With the center closing, Goodman and two partners plan to launch a
venture capital fund focusing on information technology companies.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 15 center employees are being transferred to other
jobs at the school, and the remaining start-up tenants are being
nudged out of the nest earlier than they had planned.</TE>
<TE>   "I have enjoyed being there and I would have stayed," said Ronald
J. Pion, chairman and chief executive of Medical Telecommunications
Associates, which is developing applications to improve Internet
communications for health-care workers and patients. "It was a
wonderful networking opportunity. It allowed us to utilize technology
that, as a young company, we would not have been able to afford."</TE>
<TE>   The center also was home to the Los Angeles Regional Technology
Alliance, which conducts research on technology markets in
California. It too is finding a new home.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the nation, schools, such as Georgia Institute of
Technology and New York's Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have
given life, respectively, to MindSpring Enterprises, an Internet
service provider that has merged with EarthLink, and MapInfo, a
$100-million firm that produces desktop mapping software.</TE>
<TE>   But EC2 was not the birthplace of scads of well-known tech
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years the center raised about $4 million in fees from
seminars and rents charged start-up companies on its campus, located
on university land north of USC. But officials said EC2 was never
self-sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Both Goodman and Richmond said profitability--either for the
center or its offspring--was never the goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal was not to build for-profit businesses for the
university," said Goodman. "EC2 was designed to have the incubator
serve as one more focal point through which we can better understand
the environment and the technology."</TE>
<TE>   Closing EC2 runs counter to the trend seen nationwide in which
business incubators associated with or funded by universities are
growing, both in number and girth, said Dinah Adkins, president and
CEO of Ohio-based National Assn. of Business Incubators.</TE>
<TE>   "University-based incubators are increasing, not closing," said
Adkins, noting that in 1980, there were only three nationwide. Today,
according to the association, there are more than 174.</TE>
<TE>   Adkins said that although the number of for-profit incubators,
such as Pasadena's Idealab, have dropped from about 350 at peak to
fewer than 100 today, the growth in school-based incubators can be
seen nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "University incubators are doing well, nonprofit [incubators] are
doing well," Adkins said. "All parts of the industry are doing well
except for the ones that got caught up in with the dot-coms."</TE>
<TE>   The growth is seen everywhere except California, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "California has always felt that it was an incubator and so they
didn't need separate incubators," Adkins said. "Given the number of
universities in California, there is very slim support for business
incubators."</TE>
<TE>   Richmond, of the Annenberg Center, described many of the nation's
school-based incubators as "production rather than research"
oriented, in which the focus is on converting the school's
intellectual property into cash.</TE>
<TE>   "And that was really, in my mind, not what EC2 was about,"
Richmond said. "We were not trying to commercialize companies ...
that would go out and make a ton of money. The focus of our incubator
was on basic research, and on learning what is the role of it in an
academic setting."</TE>
<TE>   And that research will continue, he said, just not in the form of
an incubator.</TE>

<HD>Jackson Takes Glove Off Against Sony</HD>
<DH>Music: The star brings in Sharpton and Cochran to launch an
initiative to fight unfair contracts in the record industry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAGGIE FARLEY and CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michael Jackson on Wednesday became the latest pop star to jump on
the artist rights bandwagon, accusing his record company, Sony Music,
of questionable accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson turned up the pressure by recruiting activist the Rev. Al
Sharpton and lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. to launch an initiative to
"emancipate" him and other recording artists from unfair contracts.</LD>
<LD>   "Economic servitude, no matter how comfortable the slave, is still
slavery," Sharpton said.</LD>
<TE>   Cochran, who helped Jackson resolve a child molestation lawsuit
for an estimated $20-million settlement, said, "This is a problem the
record companies should be ashamed of. Artists have made billions for
them."</TE>
<TE>   The flamboyant pair playfully called themselves "the Al and
Johnnie" show, as they stood in front of press microphones at the W
Court Hotel. But their sudden involvement in a growing artists'
rights movement that began in California 18 months ago could bring
additional trouble for the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Sony executives declined to comment on the conflict with Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   At a time of dipping sales, Internet incursions and assorted
lawsuits, the record companies face a new pair of formidable
opponents representing East Coast musicians and black artists. The
movement has wended its way from the West Coast to Sharpton's home
turf, where he has seized on it as a matter of musicians' civil
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Sony is improperly requiring him to pay substantial
sums of money that the company contends the singer owes for cash
advances and promotion and production costs associated with his
recent CD, "Invincible." Jackson said he does not owe Sony any money
and has called into question the way the label has accounted for his
royalty payments.</TE>
<TE>   "Record companies have to start treating their artists with
respect, honor and financial justice," Jackson said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Industry sources said Jackson blames Sony for the poor performance
of "Invincible" and has made overtures to leave the company. Sony has
not objected to Jackson departing, company sources said, because
under the terms of his contract, he owes the label only a
greatest-hits compilation and a box set--neither of which requires
new material.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Jackson is free to shop for a new deal but is not off
the hook for the advances he received until the sales of his albums
recoup the outstanding amount.</TE>
<TE>   There has been much industry speculation that Jackson is strapped
for cash and Sony has urged him to pay off his debt by forsaking his
share of Sony/ATV, a music publishing joint venture that owns the
rights to many Jackson songs and most of the Beatles catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson procured a cash infusion several years ago from Sony by
merging his publishing unit with Sony's publishing arm to form
Sony/ATV.</TE>
<TE>   Sony denied Wednesday that the company was attempting to take over
Jackson's half of the joint venture. Company executives said Sony has
had no discussions with Jackson regarding his publishing assets.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Sharpton said he and Cochran had spoken with Jackson
and Thomas D. Mottola, chairman of Sony Music Enterprises, but denied
that their involvement in the artist movement was to help leverage
Jackson out of his contract.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about any one artist, but the whole industry," Cochran
said.</TE>
<TE>   Long-standing industry practices reduce artists to the equivalent
of indentured servants, Sharpton said, bound by extended contracts
and compelled to repay promotion and production costs fronted by the
companies before receiving any royalties.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpton said he will call for a summit of artists to pressure the
Big Five record companies to reevaluate accounting practices,
particularly the calculation of royalties for music sold in record
clubs and other countries.</TE>
<TE>   He said that Mottola was willing to talk, and that they soon would
be in discussions with the other four major labels, EMI Group, BMG,
Vivendi Universal and AOL Time Warner Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "We come with a unique ability to do what we do," said Sharpton,
alluding to the public opinion he and Cochran can galvanize.</TE>
<TE>   Although artists have long complained about unfair treatment from
record companies, the attempt to gain more equitable agreements has
gained momentum in the last year and a half.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, rock star Courtney Love will go to trial to try to
break what she calls her "unconscionable" contract with Vivendi
Universal, the world's largest music corporation. Later this month,
California lawmakers will vote on a bill that could open the door on
free agency for music acts.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Artists Coalition, a recently formed trade group
representing more than 100 top acts, has been lobbying Congress for
other reforms, including better health-care benefits and accounting
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson isn't the first star to complain about Sony's accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Rock star Meat Loaf sued the corporation after conducting an audit
of his record sales. He settled the case with Sony for an estimated
$10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the Dixie Chicks filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit
against the Japanese conglomerate, accusing it of "systematic
thievery" and "corrupt" accounting. But the country pop trio recently
worked out a settlement to resolve their dispute and are expected to
drop their lawsuit.</TE>

<HD>Lockheed, Loral in Satellite Talks</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Combination of manufacturing operations is under
discussion to cut costs, compete with Boeing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER PAE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Battered by a slowdown in the telecom industry, two of the nation's
largest commercial satellite makers are talking to each other about
the possibility of combining their manufacturing operations.</LD>
<LD>   Lockheed Martin Corp. and Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd., the
second- and third-largest satellite makers in the U.S., have been
mulling a joint venture for several months but have not come to an
agreement on personnel and financial issues, company sources said
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The report follows comments in March by Loral Chairman Bernard L.
Schwartz, who hinted at an analysts' conference that a combination of
the two operations was a possibility as a way to compete against
Boeing Co., the nation's largest commercial satellite maker.</LD>
<TE>   The two companies have significant satellite-making operations in
the San Jose area and combining them would help the companies cut
overhead and personnel costs.</TE>
<TE>   The move is in response to a significant drop in orders for
commercial satellites with the slump in the telecommunications
industry, and most analysts do not see much of an improvement any
time soon.</TE>
<TE>   The number of commercial satellites launched worldwide declined by
more than half to about 30 in 2000 from 65 in 1999 and is expected to
remain that way for a few more years, according to Teal Group, an
aerospace research firm in Fairfax, Va.</TE>
<TE>   The slump has been so severe that even industry leader Boeing is
looking to slash 25% of its work force in El Segundo.</TE>
<TE>   In April, Boeing said it was eliminating 800 jobs on top of the
1,050 it had announced two months earlier and warned that an
additional 500 positions could be cut by year end.</TE>
<TE>   A Lockheed spokesman declined to comment about the report. Loral
officials couldn't be reached Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Calif. Munis Drawing Buyers Despite Worries</HD>
<DH>Investing: Tax-free bonds are attractive in a shaky stock
market, but experts warn of state budget deficit, risks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORA VRANA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California is facing a huge budget deficit, but concerns about the
state's fiscal health don't appear to be having much effect on its
municipal bonds.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, California muni bond mutual funds have performed slightly
better in recent months than the average muni bond fund nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   Reduced stock market expectations and meager returns on short-term
accounts such as money market funds may be attracting more California
investors to tax-free muni bonds, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   "People are looking for something else," said Don Cassidy, senior
research analyst at fund data tracker Lipper Inc. in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Declining yields on many types of bonds since March have boosted
the market value of older, higher-yielding issues.</TE>
<TE>   The annualized yield on a Moody's Investors Service index of
20-year muni bonds from issuers nationwide stood at 5.28% last week,
down from 5.46% in late March.</TE>
<TE>   Interest paid on bonds issued by California, its agencies and
municipalities generally is free of state and federal income tax for
residents. That has long made munis highly appealing to many
income-oriented California investors, especially those in higher tax
brackets.</TE>
<TE>   For a married couple in the 36.5% combined federal and state
marginal tax bracket (that bracket begins at taxable income of about
$112,000), a California muni yield of 5% is equivalent to a fully
taxable yield of 7.9%, according to the California Municipal Bond
Advisor newsletter in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   Even though bond yields have come down, "the municipal market is
still attractive compared to taxable investments," said Mary Miller,
assistant director of fixed-income investments at mutual fund firm T.
Rowe Price in Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   A 10-year U.S. Treasury note, for example, now yields about 5%,
which is less than the yield on many 10-year muni issues. Treasury
interest is subject to federal income tax, though not state tax.</TE>
<TE>   Investors in the average California muni bond mutual fund have
earned a "total return" (interest plus net change in principal value)
of about 2.5% since March 31, according to Lipper, compared with 2.3%
for muni funds nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 12 months, the average total return on California muni
funds has been 5.7%, compared with 5.5% for the nationwide muni
average. The true returns are higher, depending on an investor's tax
bracket.</TE>
<TE>   The average stock mutual fund, by contrast, has fallen 11.6% in
the last year, according to Lipper.</TE>
<TE>   Many higher-income California investors prefer to buy individual
muni bonds rather than mutual funds. That entails the risk that the
bond issuer could face financial trouble and be unable to make
interest payments. But California muni issues have historically been
a fairly safe investment.</TE>
<TE>   Although the dollar value of California bonds that defaulted rose
to $161 million in 2001 from $113 million the year before, much of
that stemmed from 10 troubled bond issues, totaling $118 million,
sold by now-defunct San Francisco underwriter Pacific Genesis Group,
according to the California Municipal Bond Advisor, which tracks such
data.</TE>
<TE>   Most bonds that get into trouble are issues of small
municipalities. Financial advisors typically warn investors to stick
with bonds of the state itself or of large municipalities or
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Even though most bond issuers make good on their interest
payments, bond investors can lose money, at least on paper, in other
ways: The market value of their bonds can decline if investors become
more fearful about certain issuers--even if default is highly
unlikely--or if market interest rates rise, depressing the value of
older, lower-yielding bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts warn that credit-quality concerns are on the horizon
for California muni bonds. The state's projected budget shortfall of
$23.6 billion could mean a ratings downgrade for California general
obligation bonds this year. It also could mean a deterioration of the
credit quality of state agencies, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, "there is concern about downgrades, but prices
[of California issues] remain strong," said Dan Solender, who manages
nearly $4.5 billion of California bonds in two funds for Vanguard
Group in Malvern, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   A rising supply of new muni issues also could depress the value of
older bonds and drive up yields, if investors' interest wanes.</TE>
<TE>   New California muni issuance has totaled $14.8 billion this year,
compared with $11.7 billion in the same period last year, according
to data tracker Thomson Financial.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, some large muni issues are looming, including $4.5
billion of bonds related to the state's liability settlement with the
tobacco industry and the $11-billion power bond issue to cover
shortfalls incurred during last year's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Dave MacEwen, head of fixed-income investments at American Century
Funds in Mountain View, Calif., said investors considering a move
into munis might want to save some cash to buy the power bonds, which
are expected to offer attractive tax-free yields.</TE>
<TE>   But MacEwen warned that investors who are frustrated with low
returns on bank certificates of deposit and other short-term accounts
shouldn't rush into muni bonds or bond funds without understanding
the risks.</TE>
<TE>   He cautions that investors who worry about losing money in bonds
if market interest rates rise should stick with funds that own bonds
maturing in the next few years, so-called intermediate-term funds.
Yields are somewhat lower on those funds than on longer-term funds,
but the principal value of intermediate-term bonds would suffer less
than longer-term bond values if market rates indeed rise.</TE>
<TE>   Investors who are nervous about credit quality also can focus
solely on insured muni issues or on funds that buy only insured
bonds.</TE>

<HD>Panera's Rising Hopes</HD>
<DH>Restaurants: The gourmet sandwich chain from the Midwest
should expect voracious competition as it expands to the Southland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Panera Bread Co., a Midwest-based gourmet sandwich chain whose
consistent and profitable growth has made it a Wall Street darling,
faces new challenges in its bid to expand into the highly competitive
Southern California market.</LD>
<LD>   Panera said last week it plans to open up to 100 cafe-bakeries in
the Southland over the next few years. It intends to open its first
California store in Los Angeles County in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   Moving into the Southland won't be easy, analysts say. Panera must
grapple with several potential roadblocks, including more intense
competition and wider consumer dining choices, as well as high rent,
utility and labor costs, said Janet Lowder, president of Restaurant
Management Services in Rancho Palos Verdes.</LD>
<TE>   The 390-store chain, based near St. Louis, must contend with the
growing presence of other sandwich makers such as Subway and
Quizno's. It also must deal with cutthroat competition from a host of
expanding "fast-casual" restaurants such as Panda Express, Baja Fresh
and Wahoo's Fish Taco, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot easier for a chain to do business in a place like
Omaha, Neb., than it is here," Lowder said. "To succeed here, you
have to really know what you're doing."</TE>
<TE>   Panera executives and analysts contend that the chain's mix of a
coffeehouse-like ambience--fireplaces, plush leather couches and soft
jazz--and fancy sandwiches served on 30 types of freshly baked bread
will help it flourish.</TE>
<TE>   "Consumers want quick, tasty and healthy products at a good price
and that's what Panera delivers," said Scott Van Winkle, an analyst
with Adams, Harkness &amp; Hill.</TE>
<TE>   Both diners and Wall Street have developed a taste for Panera,
which has posted 25 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth.
In 2001, profit jumped 92% to $13.1 million, and revenue increased
51% to more than $529 million.</TE>
<TE>   Panera shares, which traded at less than $6 four years ago, closed
Wednesday at $64.15, up $1.55, on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting its turbocharged growth, Panera has more than doubled
its outlets in the last 2 1/2 years. The typical unit now rings up
sales of about $1.8 million, higher than any other fast-food or
fast-casual restaurant, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   To ensure quality, professional bakers--paid at least $13 an
hour--bake bread in $50,000 stone-deck ovens that turn out crispier
loaves, Panera Chief Executive Ron Shaich said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't cut any corners," he said. "We strive for authenticity,
and our customers can feel the difference."</TE>
<TE>   Panera, which has bakery-cafes in 30 states, should fare well in
Southern California because it offers tastier food than its sandwich
competitors, said Dennis Joe, an analyst with Sidoti &amp; Co. in New
York. The chain also could appeal to the legions of people burned out
on hamburgers.</TE>
<TE>   "For a little more, you can get a much better-quality meal that's
better for you than you would at McDonald's," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The average check at Panera is $6.30, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   Panera stands to profit from consumers' growing demand for
sandwiches. While domestic pizza sales last year increased 2.5% and
burger sales rose 2.7%, sandwich sales jumped 12%, to $14.6 billion,
said Dennis Lombardi, executive vice president of Technomic Inc., a
restaurant research and consulting firm in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Subway's advertising blitz, along with improved offerings by such
chains as Arby's, have helped fuel the sandwich surge, said
Christopher Muller, professor of restaurant management at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando.</TE>
<TE>   Panera began life in 1987 as closely held St. Louis Bread Co. Au
Bon Pain acquired the 19-unit company in 1993 and later added new
stores. St. Louis Bread performed so well, especially in suburban
markets, that Au Bon Pain was sold in 1999 to investors for $73
million. The company was renamed Panera.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Adler, president of Mariposa Bread, a franchise group that
recently signed an agreement to develop 14 Panera outlets in Los
Angeles County, said he expected the restaurants to catch on with
locals, just as they have elsewhere in the country. To take advantage
of the Southland's weather, outlets would have more outdoor seating
than the typical Panera, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his confidence, Adler conceded that Panera's success here
is by no means assured.</TE>
<TE>   "There are more restaurant choices in L.A. than in most other
places," he said. "We have to prove to the people of this area that
we're offering a good product, which I know we are."</TE>

<HD>Court Reinstates Tobacco Verdict</HD>
<DH>Litigation: Oregon appeals panel restores $80.3-million
award against Philip Morris in cancer death case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The tobacco industry's West Coast blues continued Wednesday when an
appeals court upheld a verdict against Philip Morris Cos. and
restored an $80.3-million damage award that the trial judge had
trimmed.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision by the Oregon Court of Appeals continued a string
of West Coast setbacks for cigarette makers, which have lost five
straight cases in Oregon and California, including the verdict upheld
Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Most striking about Wednesday's ruling was not the rejection of
Philip Morris' appeal, but a finding that the trial judge had erred
in paring the verdict to $32 million. "An award that might be a
serious punishment for one defendant could be only a minor
inconvenience for another," the appeals court said.</LD>
<TE>   The ruling came in a suit filed by survivors of Jesse D. Williams,
a Portland school custodian and longtime Marlboro smoker who died of
lung cancer in 1997 at the age of 67.</TE>
<TE>   In what was then a record-breaking verdict, a Portland jury
ordered Philip Morris to pay his survivors about $800,000 in
compensatory damages and $79.5 million, or 97 times the amount, in
punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Trial Judge Anna J. Brown later trimmed the award to $32 million,
noting that the U.S. Supreme Court has declared that punitive damages
should bear a reasonable relationship to the size of a compensatory
award.</TE>
<TE>   But the appeals panel rejected Brown's reasoning, saying, "We see
nothing in a ratio of 97 to 1 that raises our judicial eyebrows,
given the egregious nature of the defendant's conduct as implicitly
determined by the jury."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris said it will take its case to the Oregon Supreme
Court and remains hopeful the verdict will "be reversed or the case
sent back for a new trial."</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Herzog, a tobacco analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, called
the decision "disappointing ... and perplexing," but said Philip
Morris has solid grounds for appeal.</TE>
<TE>   But Richard Daynard, head of the Tobacco Products Liability
Project at Northeastern University, which promotes litigation against
the industry, said the ruling "gives the lie to the assumption on
Wall Street that these punitive damage verdicts are going to get
themselves reversed."</TE>
<TE>   Said Daynard, "the evidence against this industry is just so
damning, and the harm they've done so massive, that it's really hard
... to figure out what would constitute excessive damages."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, tobacco companies have tried 26 lawsuits by individual
smokers and have won 18, according to a count by Philip Morris. The
majority--and the largest--of its losses have come in Oregon and
California.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the Williams verdict, a Portland, Ore., jury in March
ordered Philip Morris to pay about $150 million to the family of
Michelle Schwartz, a longtime smoker who died of lung cancer at the
age of 53. The judge in that case reduced the award to $100 million.</TE>
<TE>   Like both Oregon cases, California verdicts of $26.5 million,
$21.7 million and $105.5 million are all on appeal. Philip Morris was
the defendant in five cases, though R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. also
was named in one.</TE>
<TE>   In the Williams case, jurors found Philip Morris guilty of
defrauding smokers over a period of decades by misrepresenting
evidence concerning the hazards and addictiveness of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   In its appeals, Philip Morris has argued that there was no
evidence that plaintiffs acted on the basis of its statements, which
it said is a prerequisite for a finding of fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris shares fell 36 cents to $57.36 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Surf Wear Riding New Wave of Popularity</HD>
<DH>Retail: Industry gets lift from retro trend, products with
brighter colors and some upcoming movies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLIE EARNEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After wading through a rough year of slower sales, the surf wear
industry is coming back, analysts say, as surfers are returning to
the waves and surf wear makers benefit from a hot retro trend,
products with brighter colors and upcoming surfing movies.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest strong indicator that surf wear is up, bellwether
brand Quiksilver Inc.--the world's largest surf wear maker--announced
Wednesday that it beat analysts' earnings expectations in its fiscal
second quarter ended April 30. Though quarterly profit was off about
4%, fall bookings jumped 18% compared with last year. Confident that
it is heading into a strong second half of the year, the Huntington
Beach-based company raised earnings expectations for this year and
next.</LD>
<LD>   After a hot streak that had stretched over a number of years, the
industry slumped in 2001 as the retail climate weakened and
deteriorated further after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   Any comeback will be welcome news for an industry that is
synonymous with Southern California and that also has become a
fashion trendsetter for youth nationwide, not just surfing
enthusiasts.</TE>
<TE>   Though 2002 may not yield record sales for the industry, insiders
said the upswing appears to be benefiting several key players. Costa
Mesa-based apparel makers Volcom and Hurley International, which was
purchased in February by Nike Inc., are moving strongly into the
second half of the year. Also gaining strength are some older surf
wear brands that are riding the retro trend, such as Irvine-based
Ocean Pacific Apparel Corp. It expects sales to jump 40% this year
over last.</TE>
<TE>   "In our launch of OP Classic, we literally resurrected patterns
and color combinations from the '70s," Chief Executive Dick Baker
said Wednesday. "The striped knit shirts, exact '70s color
combinations, that's what's ... selling in the surf shops."</TE>
<TE>   Twice as many surf shops said sales and margins were up in May
compared with the year before in a just-concluded nationwide survey
of 29 retailers who sell products to surfers and skaters, said Mitch
Kummetz, an analyst with Wedbush Morgan Securities.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good," said Kummetz, who conducted the survey. "I'm
pretty encouraged about how the summer is starting off."</TE>
<TE>   In other indicators that change is underway, analyst Dorothy
Lakner of CIBC World Markets picked up coverage of Quiksilver on
Wednesday and issued a "strong buy" rating. A day earlier, analyst
Jennifer Black of Wells Fargo boosted her rating to "buy" from
"market perform" on Anaheim-based Pacific Sunwear of California Inc.,
a retailer that sells many of the hot brands made by Southern
California companies.</TE>
<TE>   In a further positive indicator, ad sales for Surfer magazine's
oversized August issue, the largest issue of the year, are up 10%,
said Rick Irons Jr., associate publisher of the San Clemente-based
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Industry insiders give several reasons for the turnaround. In
addition to tighter business practices that reduced inventory,
lessening the necessity for markdowns that hurt profits, the industry
is expecting a boost from some surf films, especially "Blue Crush," a
film about female surfers.</TE>
<TE>   Even the colors of the products are brighter, reflecting a more
optimistic attitude throughout the industry, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Although some smaller companies were wiped out last year, the
strong companies are getting stronger, insiders say.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver, for example, raised its earnings expectations for the
year to between $1.38 and $1.40 a share, up from $1.32. The company,
which boasts a wide range of brands--including the Roxy juniors line
and Hawk Clothing for skateboarders--also said it has decided to
boost ad spending by $1.5 million for the second half of the year to
promote the Quiksilver brand in national magazines.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver reported Wednesday that second-quarter earnings totaled
almost $13.5 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with nearly $14
million, or 58 cents a share, in the comparable period last year.
Sales increased 10.6% to almost $186 million, compared with $168.2
million in the second quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver's stock gained $1.50 Wednesday, closing at $24.50 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is up 42% this year. Pacific
Sunwear's stock closed at $19.55, up 75 cents, in Nasdaq trading.
It's down 4% in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the good news for larger, established companies, business
in this industry can still swing enough to make small-business owners
seasick. At the Frog House in Newport Beach, sales are tied directly
to the surf and weather, owner Thomas "T.K." Brimer said.</TE>
<TE>   In January and February, with summer-like weather, sales were very
strong, he said. But as the surf flattened in March and April,
revenue dropped off by as much as 20%, compared with the year before.
Last month, as the waves swelled once more, business kicked back into
gear, Brimer said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced consumers have the money at hand and want to
spend," he said. "I think we're going to be having a fine, strong
summer. It all looks that way."</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worldwide sales of semiconductors, after their worst-ever slump in
2001, are on the rebound this year and will rise a modest 3.1% to
$143 billion, a trade group said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   After rising modestly this year, the Semiconductor Industry Assn.,
in its midyear forecast for the industry, predicts global sales of
semiconductors will rise 23.2% to $177 billion in 2003 and 20.9% to
$213 billion in 2004. Muted growth of 0.9%, to $215 billion, is
expected to follow in 2005, it added.</LD>
<LD>   "So far this year, we have seen a significant decline in excess
inventory and manufacturing capacity, and the industry has resumed
modest sequential growth, indicating that we are in the initial
stages of a recovery," said Dwight Decker, chairman and chief
executive of chip maker Conexant Systems Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Increasing sales of cellular handsets, personal computers and of
digital consumer electronics devices during the next 10 quarters will
lead the rebound, Decker said.</TE>
<TE>   The chip industry suffered last year as economies slowed,
companies cut back on information technology spending and chip
companies overbuilt inventories based on overly optimistic
assumptions of growth, particularly in the telecommunications
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Rapid growth in the Asia Pacific region will help to fuel growth
in the notoriously boom-and-bust industry, which suffered its
worst-ever year in 2001, when global chip sales plunged some 34%,
twice the previous-worst percentage decline in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   During the next four years, the Asia Pacific market will become
the world's largest in terms of chip sales, followed by the Americas,
the SIA said. That region has already been the top revenue generator
for Intel Corp.</TE>

<HD>Service Sector Grows at Fastest Pace Since 2000</HD>
<DH>Economy: Index's May increase reinforces expectations for
recovery from recession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The service sector in May grew at its fastest pace since August 2000,
reinforcing expectations for a moderate recovery from recession, a
survey found Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Institute for Supply Management, an industry trade group, said
its monthly non-manufacturing index of activity in everything from
entertainment to financial services rose last month to 60.1 from 55.3
in April, reaching the highest level since the economic downturn
began in late 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts had forecast a rise to 55.9. A reading above 50 signals
growth, while one below 50 suggests contraction.</LD>
<TE>   Earlier this week ISM's closely watched manufacturing index showed
the sector growing in May at its fastest pace since February 2000,
adding to recent evidence of a broadening U.S. recovery.</TE>
<TE>   Economists and Fed officials are looking for signs of stronger
business investment and consumer spending later in the year to ensure
that the economy's rebound does not falter.</TE>
<TE>   ISM's new-orders index rose to 56.8 in May from 56.4 in April,
while the order backlog index posted its first growth in 17
months--signaling rising demand for future services activity that
could push the index higher next month.</TE>
<TE>   Although the employment index rose in May to 49.5 from 48.9 in
April, it still indicated a 15th straight month of job losses. But
the index moved closer to the 50 threshold that would signal job
growth.</TE>
<TE>   The prices-paid index fell in the month to 55.5 from 59.5,
indicating that prices are rising at a slower pace and soothing some
worries about building price pressures.</TE>
<TE>   ISM compiles its non-manufacturing index by surveying more than
370 purchasing executives in more than 62 service industries once a
month.</TE>

<HD>Investor Agrees to Face Charges in N.Y.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amr I. "Anthony" Elgindy, the Encinitas speculator accused of using
FBI secrets to manipulate stock prices, has agreed to be taken to New
York, where he and four others face charges of racketeering, fraud,
extortion and obstruction of justice.</LD>
<LD>   Elgindy, 34, waived his right to an extradition hearing during an
appearance Tuesday in federal court. He was being held without bail
Wednesday in San Diego and it was unclear when marshals would take
him to New York, said Bill Muller, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney
in Brooklyn.</LD>
<LD>   An extradition hearing for defendant Troy M. Peters is scheduled
for today in San Diego. Three other alleged accomplices have
surrendered in New York or promised to appear there: Derrick W.
Cleveland, accused of helping Elgindy and Peters spread negative
information on firms; former FBI agent Jeffrey A. Royer, who
allegedly gleaned secrets from confidential FBI databases and was
paid more than $30,000 by Cleveland; and FBI agent Lynn Wingate, who
also is accused of misusing bureau databases.</LD>
<TE>   Elgindy, a short seller who profited when stocks declined, charged
investors up to $600 a month for access to the online chat room where
he first posted tips on the companies he considered overvalued.</TE>
<TE>   A Justice Department unit looking for financial connections to
Sept. 11 began the investigation of the Egyptian-born Elgindy, and a
prosecutor at a bail hearing suggested he may have had advance
knowledge of the attacks. But none of the formal charges are related
to terrorism, and in an interview Elgindy vehemently denied any link
to the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<HD>FBI Probes Financing of Films Made by Samaha</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CORIE BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Film producer and nightclub owner Elie Samaha is under criminal
investigation by the FBI for possible fraud, representatives for
Samaha acknowledged Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI probe into the financing of films made by Samaha's
Franchise Pictures--including "Battlefield Earth," starring John
Travolta, and "3000 Miles to Graceland," starring Kevin
Costner--stems from a civil case brought against Samaha by former
partner Intertainment Licensing, according to lawyers for both sides.</LD>
<LD>   In that case, Intertainment alleges that Samaha defrauded the
German television company out of $75 million through a scheme using
multiple sets of books for each movie. "If that's not a crime, it
should be," said Intertainment attorney Scott Edelman.</LD>
<TE>   Said Samaha's attorney, Brian Sun: "We are aware of the FBI
inquiry and intend to fully cooperate. We are firmly of the view that
this is a not a criminal case. This is a civil business dispute."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office declined to comment on
the probe. There have been no criminal indictments in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Samaha's relationship with Intertainment dates back to his first
major studio film, "The Whole Nine Yards," starring Bruce Willis,
released in 1999. Intertainment Chairman Ruediger "Barry" Baeres then
signed a deal to finance 47% of Samaha's next 60 films.</TE>
<TE>   That deal fell apart a year later amid accusations from both sides
of fraudulent representations.</TE>
<TE>   Samaha built his reputation in Hollywood first as the owner of
Celebrity Cleaners and then with his nightclub on Sunset Strip, the
Roxbury. He now owns the Sunset Room.</TE>
<TE>   Parlaying the Hollywood friendships he formed through his clubs,
Samaha was able in 1999 to lock up a distribution deal with Warner
Bros. Pictures. Warner Bros. pays nothing toward the production costs
of Samaha's films but distributes them in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Samaha has become a major contributor to Warner Bros., producing
nine movies for the studio in the last three years with an additional
six set for release this year and next. The slate of films is
renowned for being consistently poor performers in theaters.</TE>
<TE>   A Warner Bros. spokeswoman declined to comment on the revelations
of an FBI probe.</TE>
<TE>   In May, a federal district court refused to dismiss two RICO,
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, claims brought
against Samaha and another Franchise executive. The Intertainment
case is set for trial November 2002.</TE>

<HD>Stock Gains Spark Selling of Gold Futures</HD>
<DH>Markets: Price falls 2%, biggest one-day decline in a year.
Metal's recent rally might resume, but gains may be limited by a
decline in demand in India, its biggest user.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold futures had their biggest drop in a year as a rally in U.S.
stocks reduced the metal's allure as an alternative investment.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose for the first time in three
days after an industry report showed the U.S. service economy grew
more than expected in May.</LD>
<LD>   The gain for stocks prompted selling of gold futures by
speculators whose earlier buying contributed to an 18% rise for gold
this year to a 4 1/2-year closing high Tuesday, traders said.</LD>
<TE>   "With the stronger stock market, gold was primed to move lower,"
said George Dlugosh, vice president of precious metals trading at RBC
Capital Markets in Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Gold for August delivery fell $6.60, or 2%, to $321.20 an ounce on
the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the biggest
one-day decline since June 11, 2001. Prices still are up 21% from
this time last year.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of gold mining companies also fell. The Philadelphia gold
and silver index of 10 mining companies dropped 2.9% to 83.09, but
still is up 53% for the year.</TE>
<TE>   Denver-based Newmont Mining Corp., the world's biggest gold
producer, fell 36 cents to $31.20. The shares reached a four-year
intra-day high of $32.75 on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The recent rally in gold prices was triggered partly by investors
seeking an alternative to stocks.</TE>
<TE>   All three of the major U.S. stock indexes are in the red so far
this year following two years of losses.</TE>
<TE>   Prices also were pulled higher by buying of the metal as a hedge
against a possible disruption in financial markets if military
tensions between nuclear powers India and Pakistan erupt into war.</TE>
<TE>   Although the gold rally may resume in coming days, gains will be
limited by a decline in demand for gold bars and jewelry,
particularly in India, the biggest user of the metal, because of high
prices, traders said.</TE>
<TE>   "One day does not change the trend," said Jim Pogoda, a gold
trader at Mitsubishi International Corp. in New York. "All of the
bullish arguments for a higher gold price remain intact.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think prices will go much over $330 an ounce because of
poor demand in India in the first quarter, and we're hearing the
second quarter may be even worse," Pogoda said. Indian gold buyers
"are very price-sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Indian gold demand in the first quarter totaled 149.8 metric tons,
down 40% from a year earlier, the London-based World Gold Council
said last month in a report.</TE>
<TE>   Hedge funds and other speculators had bought 75,210 gold futures
as of May 28, close to a nine-year high of 76,757 on May 7, a report
Friday from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.
Wednesday's decline for gold accelerated as some speculators decided
it was time to sell contracts and reduce their "long" position,
traders said.</TE>

<HD>Late Rally Gives Wall Street a Lift</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Indexes receive a boost from positive news in the
tech and services sectors. But analysts caution that concerns remain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wall Street staged a late rally Wednesday after mildly encouraging
news from software maker Oracle launched a last-minute surge in
technology stocks. The Dow Jones industrials gained more than 100
points.</LD>
<LD>   The market seesawed much of the day, with the tech sector
advancing solidly only on news reports that Oracle did not plan to
issue an earnings warning for its fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said the response reflected Wall Street's hunger to rally
on any scrap of positive news and did not signal any improvement in
market conditions.</LD>
<TE>   "The market has been very oversold, and people have been very
pessimistic, and we were due for a rally," said Stephen Massocca,
president of Pacific Growth Equities. "People had been betting Oracle
would warn [of lower earnings]. When it didn't, it became an excuse
for people to buy."</TE>
<TE>   The Dow industrials closed up 108.96 points, or 1.1%, at 9,796.8,
regaining nearly half of the 237 points it lost Monday and Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Broader stock measures also rose. The Nasdaq composite index
climbed 17.14 points, or 1.1%, to 1,595.26, and the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 index gained 9.21 points, or 0.9%, to 1,049.9.</TE>
<TE>   Advancers led decliners by 5 to 4 on the New York Stock Exchange,
and losers edged winners on Nasdaq. Trading was moderate.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first session all three major indexes closed higher
since May 23 and comes during a difficult period for the markets.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Dow fell to levels last seen in early February,
while the Nasdaq recorded its lowest close since Oct. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday started quietly. Wal-Mart Stores reported
stronger-than-expected May sales and Avon reaffirmed its forecast,
but the news failed to spark a broad rally.</TE>
<TE>   Although blue chips trended higher for much of the session,
technology didn't catch up until the Oracle announcement.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart rose 96 cents to $54.96, and Avon surged $2.69 to $54.64.
Oracle gained 84 cents, or 10.7%, to $8.66.</TE>
<TE>   Although many analysts expect that May retail sales, many of which
are due out today, will be disappointing overall, the buying spread
to other retailers. Gap rose 63 cents to $15.18 after Prudential
Securities upgraded the stock.</TE>
<TE>   Investor optimism was helped by a report from the Institute of
Supply Management, a private industry group, that showed the U.S.
services sector grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in May,
racking up a fourth straight month of gains after last year's
recession.</TE>
<TE>   The report helped the dollar reach a one-week high against the
yen. It also pushed bond yields higher, with the yield on the 10-year
Treasury note rising to 5.05% from 5.03% on Tuesday. Gold prices
plunged $6.60 to $321.20 an ounce in New York trading as investors
shifted money into stocks.</TE>
<TE>   But analysts cautioned that concerns over corporate profits,
accounting scandals and global political tensions--including another
suicide bombing in Israel--will continue to bedevil the market.</TE>
<TE>   "The buying you're seeing today is more of a rebound than a change
in the big picture," said Robert Streed, portfolio manager of
Northern Select Equity Fund. "The terrorism, accounting and other
problems that have troubled the market for weeks now are still
there."</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Technology stocks got a boost from Oracle. Microsoft rose $1.68
to $51.66, and Intel added 68 cents to $28.18, despite spending much
of the session at a loss. Intel is scheduled to release a mid-quarter
update today. The stock is considered an indicator of where the
broader tech sector is headed, and Oracle's announcement might have
allayed investors' fears that Intel's news would be bad.</TE>
<TE>   * Nortel Networks fell for a second day, losing 20 cents, or 11%,
to $1.60. The telecom gear maker plans to sell as much as $800
million in shares and equity units to raise cash as demand for its
products slumps.</TE>
<TE>   * Tyco International was the most active stock on the Big Board,
up 53 cents at $17.30, as investors rushed in to scoop up the
beaten-down stock. Tyco, already troubled by accounting-related
concerns, was rocked this week by the resignation of its chief
executive, who was charged Tuesday with tax evasion.</TE>
<TE>   * Dow member Philip Morris dropped 36 cents to $57.36 after the
Oregon Court of Appeals reinstated a $79.5-million punitive damage
award against the tobacco maker in a lawsuit that alleged the company
knew of the harm of smoking and concealed the facts.</TE>

<HD>Claims Seagal Started FBI Probe Called 'Absurd'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Lawyers for former business partner accused of
extortion say actor sought retaliation for $60-million lawsuit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANITA M. BUSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The attorney for action movie star Steven Seagal, whose former
producing partner was indicted this week on extortion charges, on
Wednesday denounced as "absurd" allegations that Seagal had initiated
the investigation into Julius "Jules" R. Nasso as payback for filing
a lawsuit against him.</LD>
<LD>   Nasso, Seagal's friend and business partner for 15 years before
their relationship disintegrated, was indicted Tuesday along with 16
others with alleged ties to the Gambino crime family.</LD>
<LD>   Nasso, producer of such Seagal films as "Under Siege 2" and "On
Deadly Ground," was charged with conspiracy to commit extortion and
attempted extortion of a figure in the motion picture industry.
Although not officially named in the indictment, Nasso's attorneys
have said that the victim of the alleged extortion attempt was
"definitely Seagal." Nasso's attorneys alleged that Seagal had a
motive for approaching the FBI with a bogus story because he wanted
to retaliate against Nasso.</LD>
<TE>   In March, Nasso filed a $60-million lawsuit against Seagal for
backing out of a promise to perform in four films.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Seagal attorney Martin Pollner said he could not
confirm that Seagal was the victim alluded to in the indictment, but
he complained that Nasso's attorneys were trying to smear Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   "The statements attributed in the press to representatives of
Julius Nasso that Mr. Seagal approached the FBI, that Mr. Seagal took
steps to 'retaliate' against Mr. Nasso for commencing a lawsuit and
that Mr. Seagal has 'made up' allegations against Mr. Nasso are
completely false," Pollner said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pollner, the three-year criminal investigation "is
based on electronically intercepted conversations, including one in
which Mr. Nasso was allegedly instructed to demand payments." He said
"the attempts of Mr. Nasso's representatives to blame Mr. Seagal for
Mr. Nasso's legal troubles are absurd."</TE>
<TE>   Firing back, Nasso attorney Robert Hantman said Loeb &amp; Loeb, the
law firm representing Seagal, should not be commenting on the case
because it represents not only Seagal but Nasso and their former
production company.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it presumptuous that Mr. Seagal's law firm ... would make
those kind of statements without Mr. Nasso's permission and without
hearing the tapes," Hantman said.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged extortion attempt was caught on FBI wiretaps. The
wiretaps recorded a conversation between Nasso and Gambino associate
Anthony "Sonny" Ciccone in which Ciccone allegedly chastised Nasso
for trying to share some of the extorted money with others without
"prior approval."</TE>
<TE>   In another conversation, Ciccone instructed Nasso to demand
$150,000 per film, according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Friends said Seagal, who was in Los Angeles on Wednesday, has been
besieged by interview requests. Seagal would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Nasso, who was arrested Tuesday morning and arraigned later that
day in a Brooklyn courtroom, was released on bail.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Slows Development of Rocket</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boeing Co. and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. slowed development of
a new rocket engine that would have been among the first of its type
in 40 years after a slump in the commercial space market.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing shifted engineers who had been working on the so-called
MB-XX engine at its Canoga Park-based Rocketdyne unit to other
projects, including one funded by NASA, Boeing spokesman Dan Beck
said.</LD>
<LD>   The decision reflects a declining market for commercial rocket
launches, which fell to 19 last year from a peak of 41 in 1998.
Satellite-phone projects such as Iridium collapsed and recessions in
many markets dried up capital. The MB-XX would have competed with
United Technologies Corp.'s RL-10 engine, which was developed in the
late 1950s.</LD>
<TE>   Boeing now doesn't expect to put the engine into service by 2004
and will only move forward once "various market opportunities open
up," Beck said. The U.S. Air Force has expressed concern about the
lack of U.S. rivals to the RL-10, suggesting there's demand for a new
engine, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Rocketdyne unit is working on other projects.
A $34-million NASA grant funds research on a reusable rocket engine
that would generate more than 1 million pounds of thrust, the most
since the Saturn V vehicle used for the Apollo lunar landings.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Foreign investors shied away from the U.S. in 2001, as direct foreign
investment fell by 60.4% from 2000, the Commerce Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign direct investment to buy or establish U.S. businesses
dropped to $132.94 billion from the record $335.63 billion in 2000,
Commerce said. It was the biggest annual drop in direct investment
since 1991, when it declined 61.3% from 1990 levels.</LD>
<LD>   "The decrease reflected weakness in the U.S. and world economies
and a sharp drop in overall merger and acquisition activity
worldwide," Commerce said.</LD>
<TE>   For the U.S. dollar, which has been depreciating significantly in
recent months, the report was more bad news. The U.S. has funded its
international trade deficit with money from foreign investors.</TE>

<LD>Albertson's Inc. had a fiscal first-quarter loss after the

stores and gas stations and added promotions to compete with rivals
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The loss in the period ended May 2 was $81 million, or 20 cents a

restructuring and other costs, will be $2.31 a share. The previous

chain Kroger Co.</LD>

<HD>Fairchild Dornier Says Bombardier in Talks</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fairchild Dornier said Bombardier Inc., the No. 1 builder of regional
planes, is holding "intensive talks" to take over production of the
insolvent aircraft maker's planned 728 jet.</LD>
<LD>   Another potential partner is still interested in the 728, said
Peter Kellner, a Fairchild Dornier spokesman, although Fairchild
Dornier would "prefer to cooperate with Bombardier." Kellner wouldn't
name the other potential partner. Boeing Co., the world's biggest
plane maker, has been named in news reports as a possible buyer.</LD>
<LD>   Fairchild filed for protection from creditors April 2 after
running out of cash and racking up debt of $670 million. The plane
maker, owned by New York investment firm Clayton Dubilier &amp; Rice Inc.
and German insurer Allianz, has been seeking a partner to help fund
the 70-seat 728's development.</LD>

<LD>* Avon Products Inc. said second-quarter sales will increase by about
4% because of higher revenue in the U.S. and Europe. Its shares rose
5.2%. Second-quarter earnings will increase to about 63 cents a
share, the average forecast of analysts surveyed by Thomson
Financial/First Call, from 57 cents, the company said.</LD>
<LD>   * Smithfield Foods Inc., the world's biggest pork producer, said
fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell 53% as a glut of meat and weaker
demand eroded hog prices. Net income in the three months ended April
28 fell to $24.9 million, or 22 cents a share. Sales rose 30% to
$1.96 billion.</LD>
<LD>   * Priceline.com Inc. agreed to buy the trademarks and Web
addresses for financier Carl Icahn's Lowestfare.com Inc. Terms of the
transaction weren't disclosed. Priceline.com will make its travel
sales available through the Lowestfare.com Web site, the company
said. Lowestfare.com stopped selling airline tickets in recent months
as its business slowed after the September terrorist attacks.</LD>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Adelphia Communications Corp.'s debt ratings were cut by Moody's
Investors Service, which said the No. 6 U.S. cable TV operator faces
imminent bankruptcy and that the company's common stockholders
probably will be wiped out.</LD>
<LD>   Investors with Adelphia, which has about $19.3 billion of rated
debt, will probably suffer "greater than previously anticipated"
losses, Moody's said.</LD>
<LD>   "Until very recently, we believed some transaction might have
provided some stay of relief for the company," said Russell Solomon,
the Moody's senior vice president who wrote the report. "We no longer
consider that the case."</LD>
<TE>   Moody's cut Coudersport, Pa.-based Adelphia's junk-rated senior
unsecured debt one notch to Caa2, its fourth-lowest grade, from Caa1,
and its convertible subordinated notes two notches to Ca, its
second-lowest grade, from Caa2. Its rating outlook is negative.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Adelphia closed in over-the-counter trading near 81
cents, down about 4 cents.</TE>

<LD>Vivendi Universal chief Jean-Marie Messier won a bonus worth 250% of

even though the Paris-based media group posted the biggest net loss
in French corporate history.</LD>
<LD>   Messier received total compensation of $4.8 million, including his
annual salary and a bonus of 250% of his base pay, because the
company's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization rose more than 30% in 2001, the company said in a
Securities and Exchange Commission filing.</LD>

<HD>Ex-Allied Irish Trader Rusnak Indicted in Scam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former currency trader John Rusnak was named in a seven-count
indictment for his alleged role in a trading scam that landed Allied
Irish Banks in one of the biggest scandals in recent banking history,
prosecutors said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Rusnak was charged after four months of investigation into $691.2
million in losses, which Rusnak allegedly racked up by executing
unauthorized trades while employed by AIB's U.S. subsidiary, Allfirst
Financial Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Each count of the indictment, which charges Rusnak with defrauding
the bank and with entering false entries into bank records, but not
with receiving any of the funds that make up the loss, carries a
maximum penalty of 30 years in prison, $1 million in fines and up to
five years of supervised release after imprisonment.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment charges Rusnak with defrauding Allfirst and its
predecessor, First National Bank of Maryland, out of $850,000, his
salary and bonuses from 1997 through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Rusnak surrendered to the FBI on Wednesday morning at his initial
appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Beth Gesner and was released
on his own recognizance.</TE>
<TE>   His arraignment has not yet been scheduled.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal, one of the largest to engulf a European bank since
Britain's Barings Bank collapsed in 1995, stunned the financial
community in February as AIB executives blamed Rusnak for fraud and
deception dating back five years.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, he earned annual bonuses of $200,000 and moved
his family into an opulent 19th century home in one of Baltimore's
exclusive neighborhoods.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Standard Pacific Corp., an Irvine-based home builder with operations
in the Western and Southwestern U.S., plans to buy closely held
Westfield Homes USA Inc. to expand in the Southeast.</LD>
<LD>   Standard Pacific has a letter of intent to pay about $59 million
in cash and stock and assume about $50 million in debt to buy
Westfield's Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina operations,
said Andrew Parnes, Standard Pacific's chief financial officer. The
purchase won't include Westfield's Illinois business.</LD>
<LD>   Standard Pacific has been expanding this year into Florida, where
the population will grow to 21 million from 16 million by 2025,
making it the third-most populous state, according to the U.S. Census
Bureau.</LD>
<TE>   The company's purchases include the Florida unit of Newmark Homes
Corp. for about $95 million and closely held Colony Homes of Orlando
for about $29 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Florida is a high-growth market," said Gopal Ahluwalia, director
of research for the National Assn. of Home Builders in Washington.
"It draws a lot of people who buy second homes with the intention of
moving there full time when they retire."</TE>
<TE>   Standard Pacific plans to buy additional U.S. building businesses,
Parnes said. The company also builds in California, Arizona, Texas
and Colorado, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Standard Pacific shares rose $1.76, or 5.8%, to $32.07 on the New
York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<LD>IBM Corp.'s second-quarter earnings targets may be at risk because of
dismal tech spending, analysts said after the company announced a
restructuring charge of up to $2.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   If IBM doesn't come up with major gains to offset that $2-billion
to $2.5-billion charge--the majority of which the company will take
in the second quarter--it may post a net loss, Big Blue's first since
its massive restructuring in the early 1990s.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AT&amp;T Corp., the No. 1 U.S. long-distance telephone and cable
television company, is in talks to replace or renegotiate its
$8-billion bank facility after a credit-rating downgrade by Moody's
Investors Service.</LD>
<LD>   Moody's cut AT&amp;T's credit ratings to two notches above junk, to
Baa2, affecting about $25 billion of debt.</LD>
<LD>   AT&amp;T will seek to "replace or renegotiate all or a portion of its
$8-billion" bank facility that expires in December.</LD>
<TE>   That credit agreement stipulates that AT&amp;T cannot complete its
sale of AT&amp;T Broadband to Comcast Corp. unless its long-term debt is
rated at least Baa1.</TE>

<HD>Car, Tire Makers Boost Opposition to New Standards</HD>
<DH>Safety: Companies say strict federal guidelines would be
too costly and could lead to a decrease in fuel economy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Auto and tire makers stepped up their opposition to strict new
federal standards for tire safety on Wednesday, saying the rules
would force changes in about 45% of all tires sold and cost tire
makers at least $1.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The outcry came in response to proposals by the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration for tire testing, spurred by the
Firestone tire crisis and a new federal law.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said that although about one-third of the 287 million
tires sold in the United States every year might have to be
redesigned, the new rules could save 27 lives and prevent 667
injuries a year from crashes caused by blowouts or other tire
failures.</LD>
<TE>   It also estimated the standards would cost the tire industry $282
million annually, or about $7.2 million for each life saved.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rubber Manufacturers Assn., the lobbying group
representing 120 companies including all major domestic tire makers,
said NHTSA's estimates are "grossly inaccurate."</TE>
<TE>   It said complying with the rules would cost $1.5 billion in the
first year and about $400 million a year after that.</TE>
<TE>   The association also estimated that up to 42% of passenger car
tires and up to 54% of truck tires would fail the tests.</TE>
<TE>   And it said only about one in every 1 million tires are cited as
the cause of an accident, and most of those are failures from
punctures or road hazards.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obvious there is no relationship between the failure rates
to NHTSA's proposed new test standard and to the actual real-world
tire safety performance," the association said in a filing.</TE>
<TE>   In its response to the proposals, General Motors Corp. said in a
separate statement on Wednesday that the agency's cost estimates
don't account for the changes auto makers would have to make to
accommodate the rules.</TE>
<TE>   GM, the world's largest auto maker, estimated about 22% of its
cars and 6% of its trucks would not meet the new standards.</TE>
<TE>   To meet the standards, GM said it would have to test the new
tires, change calibrations for anti-lock brakes and other complex
electronic systems and in some cases might have to redesign vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   It also said the new tires would lead to a "dramatic" decrease in
fuel economy, because their rolling resistance would increase.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no safety justification for the tire selection
amendments ... and no objective evidence that they will yield any
safety benefit," GM said.</TE>
<TE>   GM and the tire makers said that regardless of what rules NHTSA
finally proposes, they should be delayed for several years to give
companies time to meet the tests.</TE>
<TE>   GM also suggested that NHTSA consider more modest proposals, such
as requiring service stations to have accurate tire gauges and
working air pumps.</TE>
<TE>   NHTSA had been scheduled to issue its new rules by June 1, but
extended the time for comments to Wednesday and has yet to set a new
date for the rules.</TE>

<HD>President Elected by UAW Members</HD>
<DH>Labor: Gettelfinger will lead the union into negotiations
with Detroit's Big Three auto makers next year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Ford Motor Co. repairman Ron Gettelfinger was elected
president of the United Auto Workers on Wednesday, giving the
ex-Marine a year to prepare for a tough round of talks with U.S. auto
makers.</LD>
<LD>   The UAW faces growing pressure to protect the jobs of its
rank-and-file members and to recruit new members in a culture that
has turned increasingly indifferent to labor unions. And next year,
Gettelfinger, 57, will lead the union into contentious negotiations
with Detroit's Big Three auto makers, all of which have shed jobs and
closed plants to reduce costs.</LD>
<LD>   Gettelfinger succeeds the retiring Stephen Yokich.</LD>
<TE>   No candidate opposed Gettelfinger, whose election was virtually
assured in November when he was nominated by the union's leadership
council. The new president, who takes office today, has headed the
union's Ford department.</TE>
<TE>   While usually considered the quintessential blue-collar union, the
UAW now represents more than 100,000 graduate students, nurses,
physicians, prosecutors and other government employees. Gettelfinger
has said recruiting new members will be one of his top priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Auto workers employed at General Motors Corp., Ford and the
Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler, however, still account for more
than 40% of the union's 720,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   The UAW's membership has declined by more than half in the last
two decades and threatens to continue that trend as U.S. auto makers
slowly decrease factory jobs.</TE>

<HD>USA Interactive Won't Boost Bid for 3 Net Firms</HD>
<DH>E-commerce: Value of deal has dropped by about $400million
since it was announced Monday.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRAD FOSS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>USA Interactive Inc. on Wednesday said it has "no intention" of
increasing its offer to buy the shares it does not own of three
publicly traded subsidiaries, Expedia Inc., Hotels.com and
Ticketmaster, even though the value of the deal had dropped by
roughly $400 million in three days.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the media giant acknowledged that it might have
to discuss "other possible transaction structures" to get the deal
done. It said it would delay a tender offer.</LD>
<LD>   Since the deal was announced Monday, USA Interactive's stock price
has declined 9%. On Wednesday shares closed at $26.03 on Nasdaq, up
93 cents. But each of its subsidiaries' stock prices has risen,
diluting the value of the deal. As a result, each subsidiary would
receive less than its current market value.</LD>
<TE>   Originally, USA's offer was valued at roughly $4.5 billion. By the
end of trading Wednesday, the deal was worth about $4.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now USA is offering a discount, not a premium," said Jake
Fuller, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners. "The obvious
implication is the market is telling USA you've got to offer more to
get this deal done."</TE>
<TE>   USA Interactive has majority stakes in the subsidiaries and
controls more than 90% of the voting shares. Expedia is an online
travel company, Hotels.com sells hotel reservations online and
Ticketmaster sells tickets to entertainment events.</TE>
<TE>   Expedia shareholders would receive $70.20 a share, Hotels.com
shareholders $47.02 a share and Ticketmaster shareholders $21 a
share. Shares of Expedia closed Wednesday at $73.19, up $1.16;
Hotels.com closed at $49.29, up 70 cents; and Ticketmaster closed at
$22, up 59 cents, all on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom May Cut 16,000 Jobs</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Layoffs would be the largest in series of payroll
reduction moves by the company, which also plans to abandon its
wireless resale business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Struggling WorldCom Inc. plans to cut up to 16,000 jobs and abandon
its wireless resale business to help stabilize the telecommunications
firm's finances.</LD>
<LD>   The layoffs--equal to 20% of WorldCom's worldwide work
force--would be the largest in a string of payroll cuts at the
company.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, WorldCom eliminated 9,000 jobs, and in April the
company cut an additional 3,700.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom, based in Clinton, Miss., declined to confirm reports
about the latest cutbacks, but a company source acknowledged that it
was planning to slash about 16,000 jobs to further reduce costs.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, WorldCom announced it would quit the wireless resale
business, a move that had been expected since early this year, when
WorldCom executives began an aggressive restructuring to ease
investor fears that the company might end up in bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom is the nation's largest reseller of wireless phone
service, with nearly 2 million customers and about $1 billion in
yearly sales.</TE>
<TE>   But WorldCom did not own a wireless network, so it had to buy
space on competitors' systems, which made the operation more
complicated and expensive for WorldCom to manage.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the company said several rival carriers were
interested in the wireless operation. A WorldCom manager in the Los
Angeles area said the company had begun to shut down the wireless
business.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, the company told California managers that it
planned to eliminate distributorships, abandon leases and close at
least 45 of its 600 retail outlets for wireless service by July.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, WorldCom is considering closing a major technical
support and network design facility in Los Angeles, an operation that
employs about 1,500 people, according to the manager, who did not
want to be identified. The company has declined to comment on those
reports.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, WorldCom reduced its earnings and sales
projections and announced plans to slash capital spending. The
company also acknowledged that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was investigating its accounting and loans to executives.</TE>
<TE>   John Sidgmore, who took over as chief executive when founder
Bernard J. Ebbers resigned April 30, has said he would eliminate or
sell non-core businesses, renegotiate lending agreements and take
other steps to raise cash and reduce debt. Sidgmore has said the firm
would cut $1 billion in expenses this year.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, WorldCom announced plans to eliminate its MCI tracking
stock, which traded separately. The move will save WorldCom more than
$284 million in annual dividend payments.</TE>

<HD>Shares of 3 Energy Traders Tumble on Possibility of Losing
Licenses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of Williams Cos., Avista Corp. and El Paso Electric Co.
suffered big losses Wednesday, the day after federal regulators
threatened to revoke the power-trading licenses of the three
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of other power companies also were hard hit, continuing a
dismal stretch for an industry under investigation by regulators and
suffering harsh scrutiny by credit rating agencies.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest blow to the industry, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission said Tuesday that it may pull the trading licenses of El
Paso Electric (ticker symbol: EE), Williams (WMB), Avista (AVA) and
Portland General Electric Co., owned by bankrupt energy trader Enron
Corp., for failing to properly respond to a sweeping probe.</LD>
<TE>   FERC said responses by the firms to its probe of energy-trading
practices in California and other Western states "are indicative of a
failure by these companies to cooperate" with its investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, based in Tulsa, Okla., fell $1.89, or 17%, to $9.12,
while Avista, based in Spokane, Wash., dropped $1.89, or 13%, to
$12.26. Shares of El Paso Electric, which has no relation to El Paso
Corp. (EP), were down $1.14, or 8%, at $13.31.</TE>
<TE>   FERC gave the firms 10 days to show why the commission should not
revoke their "market-based rate authority," which would be a major
blow to their ability to conduct business in the $220-billion U.S.
wholesale electricity market.</TE>
<TE>   FERC's threat comes as it probes whether more than 100 energy
companies contributed to skyrocketing California electricity prices
in 2000 and 2001 with their trading practices.</TE>
<TE>   The agency also is examining sham or "wash" trades that some
energy companies--including CMS Energy Corp. (CMS) and Reliant
Resources Inc. (RRI)--have admitted to using. Those trades, involving
the simultaneous sale and purchase of power, artificially pumped up
revenues and also are under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</TE>

<HD>Fed Says Commercial Paper Surged in May</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The amount of commercial paper outstanding grew $14.7 billion in May,
the largest monthly increase since November 2000 and the first boost
this year, according to Federal Reserve statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial paper, corporate debt that matures in nine months or
less used to finance day-to-day operations, rose to $1.37 billion,
the highest total since February.</LD>
<LD>   Commercial paper had been dropping as issuers refinanced through
longer-term loans and bonds. Firms also got higher bank credit lines
to stave off concern about a cash crunch if a company has to
immediately pay off short-term debt as its credit deteriorates.</LD>
<TE>   The increase shows "there is certainly some possibility that the
decline in commercial paper outstanding is leveling off," said John
Puchalla, a senior economist at Moody's Investors Service.</TE>
<TE>   The increase also may mean that companies have finished addressing
criticisms about insufficient back-up credit lines and over-reliance
on commercial paper, said Louise Purtle, a corporate bond strategist
at CreditSights Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The surge in new commercial paper was fueled by a $21.2-billion
increase sold by financial companies, such as banks and credit
companies. The last time the amount of seasonally adjusted commercial
paper grew was in December, Fed statistics show.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial paper outstanding fell this year by the most in 40
years as a recession and a record number of credit rating cuts sapped
demand. The drop came as companies rushed to sell notes and bonds,
extending the average maturity of debt, before interest rates rose.</TE>

<LD>Citadel Broadcasting Corp., the sixth-largest U.S. radio broadcaster
and Forstmann Little &amp; Co.'s biggest acquisition, filed Wednesday to
raise $575 million in an initial stock offering amid rising prices
for radio stocks.</LD>
<LD>   Citadel didn't specify the number of shares to be sold or any
price per share in a filing with the SEC. The offering will be
managed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Credit Suisse First
Boston.</LD>
<LD>   Forstmann Little, the third-largest leveraged buyout firm, paid
$2.1 billion in cash and debt for Citadel a year ago, and in February
named Farid Suleman, chief executive of rival Infinity Broadcasting
Corp., as Citadel's CEO.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. radio market is recovering after the recession crimped
spending last year. A Bloomberg index of broadcasting and cable
stocks is up 14% this year.</TE>
<TE>   Las Vegas-based Citadel has 138 FM and 61 AM stations in 41
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Citadel had a loss in the first quarter of $90.9 million,
reflecting a noncash expense of $82.8 million under new accounting
rules related to goodwill. Revenue dropped to $72.6 million from
$73.1 million.</TE>

<HD>Meade Instruments Files Patent Suit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Meade Instruments Corp. said Wednesday that it has filed a
patent-infringement lawsuit against rival Celestron International
Inc., a week after the U.S. government sought to block Meade from
buying the rival telescope-maker.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit, filed against Celestron and its parent, Tasco
Worldwide Inc., also names any prospective buyers of Tasco or
Celestron. Meade, based in Irvine, said the suit also names James S.
Feltman, a trustee assigned the assets of Tasco and Celestron as an
alternative to a bankruptcy liquidation.</LD>
<LD>   The patent covers a method that lets novice telescope users align
a telescope's computer without having knowledge of the heavens. Meade
says Celestron's NexStar telescopes and Tasco's StarGuide telescopes
infringe on the patents. The suit seeks damages and a court order
blocking sales of any infringing products.</LD>
<TE>   It is the second patent-infringement suit filed by Meade against
Celestron, based in Torrance, and Tasco, based in Miramar, Fla. The
first suit, filed last October, accused them of copying Meade's
automated-telescope patent.</TE>
<TE>   Meade was in talks to buy Celestron, but the Federal Trade
Commission said on May 29 that it would fight any attempt by Meade to
buy all or certain assets of Celestron, the second-largest maker of
high-performance telescopes. Meade is the largest maker.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Celestron couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>

$35-million gift in 1997 from entrepreneur Gordon Marshall, for whom
the school was renamed.</LD>

<LD>A judge on Wednesday ordered a Pasadena man to stand trial for

<HD>Santa Ana District OKs Academy Plan</HD>
<DH>Education: Low achievers will have an extra year to prepare
for second grade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana school officials have retooled a two-year kindergarten
proposal and will create a pilot program that would send the
lowest-achieving students to two years of first grade.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Ana Unified school board voted 3 to 2 to approve the
"Primary Academy," a program developed by a group of principals
concerned about promoting students who are likely to fail the
following year.</LD>
<LD>   The academy plan will start in seven of the district's 36
elementary schools. Under the plan, kindergarten students who appear
less than fully ready for first grade will be considered for the
one-year academy, where they would receive extra attention. If they
do well in the academy, they will go to second grade the following
year. If they still are struggling, they would go to regular first
grade. Parents would volunteer their children for the program.</LD>
<TE>   The program would begin in July at six schools: Adams, Diamond,
Jackson, King, Lincoln and Monte Vista elementary schools. It begins
at Harvey Elementary School in September.</TE>
<TE>   District Supt. Al Mijares said innovative approaches are needed in
a district where many children come from poor, Spanish-speaking
families.</TE>
<TE>   "The typical way of doing business doesn't work here," said
Mijares, pointing out that 85% of the students receive free or
reduced-price lunch, all but 4% never attended preschool and most
speak Spanish at home. "The primary academy is a response to the
needs of our community."</TE>
<TE>   School board member Nativo V. Lopez said the academy is better
than a previous plan that would have sent students to a two-year
kindergarten. That would have meant two years of a half-day program,
while causing scheduling and facilities problems, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the academy, language arts classes would have lower
student-to-teacher ratios and teachers would assess student progress
more often and have more contact with parents. Phonics would be
stressed, since many academy children are expected to have reading
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope we can avoid retaining children with this program," said
Marjorie Cochran, principal of Diamond Elementary School. "We feel it
will provide deeper skills and that children will be at grade level."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran said 60% of second-graders in the seven schools do not
read at grade level. She expects 38 of her 160 kindergarten families
to opt for the academy.</TE>
<TE>   Alicia Cortez said she will ask to have her 6-year-old daughter,
Amber Rodriguez, placed in the academy because of her reading
problems.</TE>
<TE>   "She knows her numbers. She has trouble with words," Cortez said.
"I feel she needs the extra attention. I don't feel she is up to
grade level."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Orduna said her daughter, Rosa, was recommended for the
academy. "It sounds excellent. [My daughter] is very distracted and
she's not paying attention," Orduna said. "I hope she can capture
more of the sounds of letters. That is what she is missing."</TE>
<TE>   Despite favorable parent responses, school board president John
Palacio, who voted against the Primary Academy, said he believes the
program could jeopardize as much as $35 million in state funding.
Palacio said the state has frowned on programs that track
disadvantaged children into certain programs.</TE>
<TE>   State officials did not return calls for comment Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Mijares and Cochran said they would be willing to make adjustments
in the program if the state raised any issues.</TE>

<LD>   The 30-second ads, which never mention Republican rival Bill Simon
Jr., are the first advertisements either candidate has run since the
March 5 primary and underscored the incumbent's tremendous financial
advantage in the governor's race. Democrat Davis has more than $30
million in his campaign bank account, several times the amount Simon
has managed to raise since his surprise victory in March.</LD>
<LD>   The spots began running in Los Angeles, Sacramento and the Central
Valley and will air for roughly the next four weeks at a cost of
several million dollars. There were no indications that Simon planned
to match Davis' advertising anytime soon.</LD>
<TE>   The GOP candidate was in the Central Valley on Wednesday, kicking
off the first in a series of planned issue forums with an agriculture
summit in Lodi.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in front of a faux red-barn backdrop at a civic center
auditorium, Simon reiterated his support for construction of dams and
reservoirs to help the state's vital agriculture industry. He told
the invitation-only gathering of 60 people--only about half a dozen
of them farmers--that if he is elected governor the "era of neglect,
of indifference" will end for California agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Davis was making his case on the TV airwaves. In the first of his
spots, airing primarily in the Los Angeles and Sacramento areas, the
governor speaks directly to the camera and boasts of signing "the
toughest gun safety laws in the nation," protecting the state's
coastline, air and water, and creating a state department to "help
... people fight their HMOs."</TE>
<TE>   The ad highlighted contentious issues such as abortion, guns and
the environment that have bedeviled many statewide Republican
candidates. "I've signed new laws protecting a woman's right to
choose," Davis said. "But we must face down every threat to that
right."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, who personally opposes abortion, has said that as governor
he would uphold all legal and constitutional "protections of
reproductive freedom."</TE>
<TE>   In the second spot, airing in the more conservative Central
Valley, Davis touts his law enforcement endorsements and cites
efforts to crack down on gangs and the production of methamphetamine,
a particular plague in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to air largely positive spots is typical for the
start of an incumbent reelection campaign, and the launch coincides
with the normal opening of the fall election season in California.
(This year's March primary was unusually early; most years,
Californians vote on the first Tuesday in June.)</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, the governor's chief political strategist, noted the
difficulty that a governor has communicating day-to-day with voters
in a state as vast and disparate as California, "whether [it is] Gray
Davis, Pete Wilson or [George] Deukmejian. It's something you have to
do with" TV advertising. For Davis, the need may be particularly
acute, given his sagging approval rating in popularity polls.</TE>
<TE>   The governor spent about $10 million on advertising in the
primary, but most of it was aimed at Simon's Republican opponent,
former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. The blitz played a
significant role in pushing Simon past Riordan and giving Davis the
general election candidate he preferred.</TE>
<TE>   The implicit contrast in the one commercial unveiled Wednesday was
mild compared to the advertising likely to follow. "Ultimately, our
media campaign in the general election will consist both of positive
communication ... and also spots dealing with Bill Simon," South
said.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, the Simon camp said it felt no need to respond
immediately. "I fully expect we'll be competitive," said Sal Russo,
who is running the Simon campaign. "We'll have plenty of money to
tell our story, and our story is far more compelling."</TE>
<TE>   In Lodi, the GOP hopeful mostly listened as a sympathetic panel of
agriculture experts discussed a range of concerns, from the need for
more water storage to the burdens of state and federal regulation.</TE>
<TE>   "At times it seems the best thing Sacramento can do is get out of
the way," Joel Nelsen, president of California Citrus Mutual, told
Simon.</TE>
<TE>   After the discussion, the candidate declared the exercise "useful"
and vowed to much applause that if elected "one of my first official
acts will be to declare the farmer an endangered species." But he
provided few other specifics.</TE>
<TE>   When questioned about looming federal air quality restrictions
that could hurt agriculture, Simon said, "We've just started looking
at that."</TE>
<TE>   Asked about recent reports of peril to the Sierra snowpack from
global warming, Simon said he would need to take a hard look before
announcing a stance.</TE>
<TE>   Later, advisors said Simon would follow up on Wednesday's summit
by naming an agricultural task force to advise the GOP candidate and
formulate a policy agenda by election day.</TE>

<HD>Redondo Beach Officials Drop Contentious Project for Harbor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's back to the drawing board for Redondo Beach city officials who
have rescinded a controversial residential and harbor redevelopment
plan known as Heart of the City.</LD>
<LD>   In a 3-2 vote Tuesday night, the City Council acted to rescind the
existing plan rather than have it go before voters, where the mayor
and some council members believed it would surely have been killed.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Greg Hill said he and the city will do their best to work
with Redondo Beach residents to create a new plan acceptable to a
majority of the community. He and the city did not do an effective
job of communicating the details of the plan to residents and he
looks forward to beginning that process again, he said.</LD>
<TE>   "I realize there's a lot of frustration on both sides, but it's
time we put that aside," Hill said. "There's no way the whole town
can agree on everything, but we're going to try to do a better job of
informing everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The plan, which covered an area stretching from Herondo Street on
the north to Torrance Boulevard on the south, would have turned most
of Catalina Avenue into a residential neighborhood and transformed
the harbor into a seaside village. The plan called for turning acres
of parking lots into a shopping district. A large portion of the
52-acre AES power plant would have been leveled and replaced with
offices and homes.</TE>
<TE>   The plan allowed for 2,998 new residential units and 657,000
square feet of commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   If built to its maximum capacity, the project could have produced
an estimated 3,500 extra vehicle trips during the evening rush hour.</TE>
<TE>   The size and numbers outlined in the plan were enough to panic
previously complacent residents into action.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens for a Vote on Heart of the City was formed in late March
to protest the council's approval of the plan. The group circulated
two petitions against the project--one challenging the zoning, the
other the specific plan--and in April submitted more than 6,000
signatures for each initiative. The group needed about 4,000
signatures to force an election.</TE>
<TE>   The council had two choices: Rescind the plan and start all over
or put it on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what you saw was a political time bomb defused for the
time being," said Councilman Kurt Schmalz, who thought the plan
should have gone to a vote.</TE>
<TE>   He said the city had already gone through public discussion and
community meetings. It was about time to vote, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in the same place now that we would've been if this was
defeated in a vote," Schmalz said. "We can all go to meetings and
talk about this, but building the consensus is the hard thing."</TE>
<TE>   Hill said most people are concerned about the traffic the plan
might create, but are not opposed to revitalizing the harbor area.
Tuesday's vote gives the city a chance to fix some flaws in an
otherwise good plan, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have now is a good opportunity to create a maximum
capacity [of housing units] at a lower level," Hill said. In
retrospect that's what we should've done before."</TE>

<HD>Some Object to Caltrans' Re-Greening of Freeways</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a jungle out there, Los Angeles motorists stuck in freeway jams
have noticed. And state transportation planners are doing something
about it.</LD>
<LD>   The jungle, not the jams.</LD>
<LD>   Work crews hired by Caltrans are ripping out miles of dense
shrubbery and mature trees along freeways in Los Angeles and Ventura
counties and replacing them with new plants and saplings.</LD>
<TE>   Caltrans officials say the lush vegetation--some of it up to 50
years old--has become expensive and dangerous to maintain.</TE>
<TE>   But the replacement plants will take years to grow thick enough to
once again hide freeway walls and shield neighborhoods from the gaze
of motorists--who have plenty of time to stare into backyards and
windows as they idle in rush-hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   The defoliation is angering those who live next to freeways and
suddenly find themselves staring back at cars and trucks they were
never able to see before.</TE>
<TE>   "It's noisier and less private now. To be honest with you, they
should have left the bushes and trees there," said John Ohnstead,
shouting to be heard over Ventura Freeway traffic beneath the Encino
apartment where he has lived for six years.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, a work crew hired by Caltrans removed trees and
shrubbery on both sides of the freeway behind Ohnstead's home near
the Louise Avenue overcrossing. Some of the vegetation had been
growing there since the freeway's construction in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   And that's why it needed to be replaced, said Ed Boll, Caltrans'
landscape architect for Los Angeles and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going into older landscaped areas done 30, 40, 50 years ago
and upgrading them into something that will protect the roadway and
be easy to maintain by our forces," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "As freeways get wider, crews have to prune continuously to keep
the landscaping out of traffic lanes. We have 50-year-old irrigation
systems that need to be updated and automated instead of operated
manually. We need to take out plant material that has outlived its
lifecycle."</TE>
<TE>   Lanes Added to Freeway</TE>
<TE>   In the Encino area, lanes were added to the Ventura Freeway in the
1990s. They squeezed the sides of the roadway, leaving little space
for landscape maintenance crews to work safely.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere along the freeway system, workers are removing shrubs
that appear healthy but cover decades of dead branches. Also being
axed are old trees such as eucalyptus--which have been weakened by a
parasite called the lerp psyllid.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course it's quite a shock to residents who weren't there 40
years ago when everything was planted with one-gallon plants," Boll
says of the public's reaction to the landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   "They want a visual screen. The loss of that visual screen is what
people most object to--they see the freeway and claim it's noisier.
It's purely psychological; plants don't stop noise. But the
perception is they can see the freeway traffic, so it seems louder."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans officials say the wrong type of vegetation was sometimes
planted in the 1950s and 1960s when the freeway construction boom was
underway. In those days, people were looking to soften freshly minted
highways with "something big, green and yesterday," as one expert put
it.</TE>
<TE>   So highway workers planted fast-growing, supposedly short-lived
shrubs such as Acacia longifolia alongside freeways, figuring they
would screen traffic from nearby neighborhoods until other, more
permanent vegetation took hold.</TE>
<TE>   A Haven for Transients</TE>
<TE>   But the acacia thrived, producing a seemingly healthy green canopy
over dead interior branches. Although acacia cannot be pruned--it
won't regrow--its dead branches can be stripped away by transients
who use the overhead leaves to hide homeless encampments.</TE>
<TE>   Other freeway plants being replaced include Myoporum laetum, a
shrub that grows to the size of a tree when heavily watered.</TE>
<TE>   And that freeway staple, the seemingly durable and dense oleander,
could end up on the hit list. The reason: Oleander is being attacked
by the glassy-winged sharpshooter, which is also causing problems for
the grape industry.</TE>
<TE>   Other old standbys, ivy and ice plant, remain on the Caltrans list
of approved plants. Joining them are Acacia redolens, and Myoporum
pacificum, two groundcovers that grow to be 18 inches high and 15
feet in diameter; and Thevetia peruviana and Photina fraseri,
screening shrubs that grow about 10 to 12 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   Flowering trees such as Albizia julibrissin silk trees and Ginkgo
biloba, Cassia leptophylla gold medallion trees and sycamore-like
Platanus acerifolias London Planetrees are being planted to add color
to the sides of freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Once the old growth is ripped out, new irrigation systems are
installed before the landscaping is planted, according to Boll, who
is a 33-year Caltrans veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Gone will be spurting overhead "impact sprinklers." In their place
will be smaller ground-level sprayers--one for each shrub and tree.</TE>
<TE>   But sprinklers hidden by landscaping will be harder to fix when
they break, Boll said. "It's a change in maintenance philosophy.
Instead of driving down the freeway and seeing a Rain Bird that's not
working, they'll have to drive and look at the plants and recognize
signs of stress from not getting any water" because of a faulty
sprinkler head.</TE>
<TE>   $1 Million Per Mile</TE>
<TE>   Re-landscaping both sides of a freeway costs about $1 million a
mile. Contractors have a year to remove the old material, install the
new irrigation pipes and plant the new shrubs and trees. After that,
contractors must nurse along the fledgling plants for three years
before Caltrans takes over.</TE>
<TE>   About $14 million is expected to be spent annually on Los
Angeles-area landscaping over the next few years. An additional $20
million in projects have been identified but not funded. Officials
estimate that 100 additional projects will be required before the
upgrading is completed, Boll said.</TE>
<TE>   So the replanting will take place slowly. And so will the
regrowth.</TE>
<TE>   Along steep sides of the Santa Monica Freeway between downtown Los
Angeles and the San Diego Freeway, landscape crews have had to plant
gazania flowers as a temporary groundcover to prevent erosion while
permanent plants take root. Removal of the old landscaping has
exposed sound walls, making them graffiti magnets that must be
painted.</TE>
<TE>   What will the Santa Monica Freeway and other replanted roadsides
look like when they're done? Boll said the 8 1/2-year-old Century
Freeway is a good example of the new look--with native toyons and
other plants from Mediterranean climates and Australia and New
Zealand lining the highway.</TE>
<TE>   The plants are thick and look healthy, with low bushes closest to
traffic lanes and taller shrubs next to freeway walls. But the
vegetation mix seems more drab and uniform than old growth alongside
older Los Angeles freeways.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Los Angeles' newest freeway may someday have
Caltrans' oldest landscaping.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach's Termed-Out Mayor Scores One for the Record
Books</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the ballots were counted Wednesday, two remarkable things
emerged about the Long Beach mayor's race: A termed-out incumbent won
in a city ardently for term limits, and she did it as a write-in
candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Some 16,500 people on Tuesday wrote in their votes for Mayor
Beverly O'Neill, who won her third term by a healthy 10-point margin
over the one person whose name was on the ballot. Even the author of
the city's term-limits ordinance endorsed her.</LD>
<LD>   "It's very unusual," observed John Lott, a University of Chicago
law professor, who studied the influence of term limits on
California's legislative races. "I don't know of anyone who has
succeeded, at least not a person getting around term limits."</LD>
<TE>   The O'Neill victory is exceptional, he added, because it is so
rare "that write-ins win, in any case. And in a term-limits
situation, I don't think I've heard of a case that's like Long
Beach."</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of this race for mayor of the state's fifth-largest
city would have been noteworthy no matter who won: The election was a
runoff with one name on the ballot, and two write-in candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Finishing second was Vice Mayor Dan Baker, a former U.S. Customs
officer who had the ballot to himself but earned 36% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In third place was another write-in candidate, Norm Ryan, a
businessman who wrote a successful initiative to reduce utility taxes
in 2000. Ryan won 18% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Some 5,200 ballots--mostly absentee ballots delivered to polls
after 1 p.m. election day--require signature verification and remain
uncounted, the Long Beach city clerk said.</TE>
<TE>   Those results will probably not be available until Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of the mayor's race is not expected to shift, but a
Long Beach runoff for a City Council position was too close to call
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   In the 7th District election, Mike Donelon trailed Tonia Reyes
Uranga by 16 votes.</TE>
<TE>   The city's other runoff was for the 5th District position on the
Long Beach Unified School District board.</TE>
<TE>   James John Choura earned 52.3% of the vote to beat Jeannine
McManigal-Ball, who earned 47.6% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In other Los Angeles County races, voters in Saugus approved, with
a 73% margin, an elementary school bond. In Pomona, voters handily
rejected two measures that would have reduced or eliminated the
city's utility tax and sanitation fees, which city officials say fund
a large number of services to residents.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the mayor's race in Long Beach that drew widespread
attention. The mayor's job pays $99,000 a year, but has no voting
authority. However, the position carries significant influence in the
region, in part because the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles fuel
the economies of many communities in southeast Los Angeles County.
O'Neill supporters credit her eight-year tenure as mayor and
relationships with city, county and federal officials as key factors
in Long Beach's economic recovery and that of neighboring cities.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach City Councilman Dennis Carroll, a judge pro tem for Los
Angeles County Superior Court, was not a politician when he wrote the
1992 term-limits ordinance. O'Neill supported a later proposition
that would have allowed a termed-out incumbent to be on the ballot
under certain circumstances. It was defeated by 53% of the voters.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw that as a sign that voters were either softening on term
limits, or they loved the mayor," Carroll said. "And I think it was
both."</TE>
<TE>   The ordinance restricts elected officials to two terms but allows
them to run as write-in candidates. But no one, including Carroll,
anticipated all the twists of this campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Who would have expected a write-in candidate to place first in the
primary, leaving only the second-place finisher on the ballot?</TE>
<TE>   About 18 months ago when O'Neill contemplated what was clearly an
uphill run for a third term, friends told her not to do it. On
Wednesday, she recalled asking her election advisors whether a
write-in candidate had ever won. They could think of none.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the political magazines ... could only think of 1954, when
Strom Thurmond was a write-in for senator in South Carolina. I
thought, 'You've got to be kidding me, 1954?' " O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   But polls of Long Beach residents at the time encouraged her that
she had a chance of winning, she said, longshot though it might be.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll said Wednesday that he endorsed O'Neill's run, despite his
term-limits ordinance. "I think Long Beach is on the verge of pulling
things together on several major projects, and she was there and
helped institute many of them," Carroll said. "And they are about to
blossom. She will be very helpful to watering and seeing those plants
grow."</TE>

<HD>Masry Is Cleared of Harassment</HD>
<DH>Courts: Thousand Oaks mayor is absolved of former
employee's allegations but must pay her one year's salary for
slander, a Van Nuys panel decides.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks Mayor Ed Masry did not sexually harass or wrongfully
terminate a former employee who sued him after she was fired, a jury
decided Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The Van Nuys jury cleared Masry, 69, of numerous allegations by
the plaintiff, Kissandra Cohen, 23, who worked as a lawyer at Masry's
firm in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   However, jurors said Cohen should receive one year's salary,
$120,000, because Masry slandered her during a television interview.
Cohen was seeking $6.6 million in damages from Masry and his Westlake
Village law firm, Masry &amp; Vititoe.</LD>
<TE>   Masry said he was delighted by the verdict despite the slander
finding.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so happy we were vindicated," he said. "Frankly, if it cost
me $120,000 to say what I said, it was worth it."</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, who began sobbing when the verdict was read, had little to
say afterward. Her lawyer, Dan Marino, declined to comment on the
verdict, reached after three and a half days of deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Masry, depicted as the boss in the movie "Erin Brockovich," was
accused by Cohen of firing her because she refused to have a personal
relationship with him.</TE>
<TE>   Masry testified that he fired Cohen because she lied about her
academic credentials when hired and because her work performance made
him conclude she was "in over her head."</TE>
<TE>   Several jurors said outside the courtroom that there were mixed
feelings about whether Masry or Cohen was the more believable. The
civil case, which did not require a unanimous jury vote, resulted in
a 10-2 vote in favor of Masry on the sexual harassment and wrongful
termination allegations.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a he-said-she-said case," said jury foreman Massoud Azizi
of Porter Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Another juror, Karen Thompson of Valencia, said she felt Cohen had
slightly more credibility on the stand than Masry.</TE>
<TE>   Azizi said Masry should not have hired Cohen without checking her
background. If Masry had been "more subtle and professional" when he
spoke about Cohen in the TV interview, the jury would not have
awarded damages, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The jury also said on an 11-1 vote that Masry's law firm failed to
circulate a brochure on sexual harassment to all employees, as
required by law. Masry's attorneys termed the finding a technicality.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is they found no harassment," defense attorney
Norm Watkins said. "This is a very good day."</TE>
<TE>   During the 21-day trial in the courtroom of Judge Stanley
Weisberg, Cohen alleged that Masry made constant sexual advances
during the eight months she worked for him.</TE>
<TE>   Her suit said she complained about sexual harassment by two other
staff attorneys, but Masry did nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The attorneys made leering comments and repeatedly tried to date
her, she said. Cohen said Masry, Brockovich and others in the law
firm used a steady stream of foul language and sexual references.</TE>
<TE>   Masry, who denied the accusations, testified that Cohen claimed
during her job interview that she was graduating first, second or
third in her Loyola Law School class and was concurrently receiving
an MBA.</TE>
<TE>   He later learned, he said, that she was nearly last in her
398-member class and had been disqualified from the MBA program.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Toll-Road Boards Move Closer to Merger</HD>
<DH>Traffic: Foothill-Eastern finance committee recommends a
step toward joining troubled San Joaquin tollway to improve
prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials of the successful Foothill-Eastern tollway Wednesday agreed
to consider a merger with the financially ailing San Joaquin Hills
toll road--a sister highway that might not be able to meet its debts
if nothing is done.</LD>
<LD>   The operations and finance committee for the east Orange County
turnpike recommended the dramatic move based on economic studies that
show a consolidation might be the best way to keep the San Joaquin
Hills tollway solvent.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the road's outlook improves, the situation would make it
difficult to obtain bond financing for the proposed Foothill South
tollway through southern Orange County, the analysis revealed.</LD>
<TE>   The Foothill-Eastern and the San Joaquin Hills tollways are
managed by the Transportation Corridor Agencies, a government entity
based in Irvine. The TCA's toll roads are financed independent of
each other and governed by separate boards of directors.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials are planning the Foothill South, which would run 15
miles from Oso Parkway near Mission Viejo to the San Diego Freeway
south of San Clemente. If built, it would complete the agency's
67-mile network.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole system is at stake," said San Clemente City Councilman
Scott Diehl, chair of the Foothill-Eastern board and a member of the
operations and finance committee. "This is one more hurdle we will
have to get over."</TE>
<TE>   Plan to Consolidate</TE>
<TE>   The committee, made up of Foothill-Eastern board members, directed
TCA staff to study and prepare a detailed plan to consolidate the
toll roads into a new joint powers authority.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill-Eastern board is scheduled to approve the committee's
recommendation on the merger deal June 13. The San Joaquin Hills
board passed a similar measure in April. If the TCA staff determines
that a merger is possible, the leadership of both tollways might be
able to approve a consolidation by May 2003.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm confident and convinced this is the right action to take,"
said Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow, a member of the
Foothill-Eastern board. "Given the analysis, it makes sense to merge
the agencies, even without the dire straits."</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill-Eastern has been the TCA's most successful toll road,
consistently running about 10% ahead of its traffic and revenue
forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   The San Joaquin Hills has been another story. The 16-mile route
that cuts through the coastal hills from Costa Mesa to Mission Viejo
has failed to attract enough paying commuters to meet traffic and
revenue projections.</TE>
<TE>   Bond Payment at Risk</TE>
<TE>   A team of financial advisors warned in April that without quick
action, the San Joaquin Hills tollway might miss crucial bond
payments as early as 2012 unless revenue grows by 11.5% a year--a
rate the highway is unlikely to achieve.</TE>
<TE>   Three months earlier, a major Wall Street ratings agency
downgraded about $1 billion in San Joaquin Hills bonds to junk
status. Two other ratings agencies have yet to revise their ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say that if the tollway boards fail to act, they run the
risk of creating a domino effect that could further erode Wall
Street's ratings of TCA bonds and undermine its ability to borrow.</TE>
<TE>   A merger, TCA officials say, would allow the new authority to
subsidize the San Joaquin Hills and refinance the debt of both
tollways, which is about $4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Any merger, however, will be contingent upon the results of a new
traffic and revenue study for the Foothill-Eastern and San Joaquin
Hills tollways.</TE>
<TE>   The TCA is particularly concerned about a recent Irvine Co.
decision to dramatically scale back commercial and resident
development in east Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Although the performance of the Foothill-Eastern is running ahead
of projections, the Irvine Co.'s action is expected to reduce the
anticipated number of daily vehicle trips in the area by 400,000 a
day.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill-Eastern was built on the assumption of heavy growth
in east Orange County. If the lost growth is not made up elsewhere,
the toll road could find itself in the same predicament as the San
Joaquin Hills.</TE>
<TE>   There might be a short-term loss of developer fees paid to the
TCA, Diehl said, but growth is expected to continue in Riverside and
Orange counties, providing the Foothill-Eastern with more and more
commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of housing is going to be built," Diehl said. "Long-term, we
will be OK."</TE>

<HD>Body Overlooked for 2 Days</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Police say murky water obscured view of boy, 7,
who disappeared Sunday in pool. His death is ruled an accidental
drowning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a 7-year-old boy lay for two days at the bottom of a
swimming pool in Holmby Hills, overlooked during an exhaustive search
by Los Angeles police after the child went missing from a weekend
pool party, according to an autopsy completed Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Paolo Ayala died of asphyxia from freshwater drowning, probably on
Sunday between 2 and 3 p.m., said Craig Harvey, the Los Angeles
County coroner's chief of operations.</LD>
<LD>   "The death has been ruled by the coroner to be accidental," Harvey
said. "Anatomical findings show no evidence of the body having been
removed from the pool prior to discovery on June 4, 2002, at
approximately 8:30 a.m."</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department detectives said they made a visual
inspection of the pool water, which they say was chalky.</TE>
<TE>   About 50 officers took part in the two-day search, joined by
bloodhounds and a helicopter, but police never entered the pool.</TE>
<TE>   After a housekeeper spotted Paolo's body in the pool early
Tuesday, LAPD Deputy Chief David Kalish said someone had dumped the
body overnight, unleashing the prospect of a grisly murder.</TE>
<TE>   Within hours, however, Kalish conceded officers may have failed to
notice the body.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly we learned from this situation not to rely on what you
think you see," Kalish told a news conference Wednesday outside the
coroner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to questions, Kalish would not say police had made a
mistake. "I feel frustration, anguish and sadness. Our hearts go out
to the family. I feel bad we were not able to bring closure to the
family [sooner]," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Saeed Farkhondehpour, owner of the pool and host of the party,
said Wednesday his children kept saying during the search that the
pool was murky.</TE>
<TE>   "My kids kept telling me, 'Daddy, you can't see the bottom of the
pool,' " he said. "But I just ignored them. The detectives ignored
them."</TE>
<TE>   His daughter Kristina Farkhondehpour, 11, said she was about to go
for a swim on Monday when her mother called her away. "You couldn't
see," she recalled. "It was cloudy and stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Farkhondehpour said Kalish and detectives made the tragedy even
worse by suggesting a murder plot. He added that at least 10 parents
were poolside during the birthday party for his 7-year-old son,
Paolo's classmate at El Rodeo Elementary School. He said he cannot
understand why no one noticed Paolo sinking. The boy was last seen in
the shallow end with other children.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo's parents had brought him to the Wyton Drive mansion in the
early afternoon Sunday and reported him missing about 5 p.m. Family
members said the boy could not swim.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish said parents at the party, police investigators and the
boy's mother all checked the pool and never saw the boy, who was
wearing blue-and-white swim trunks.</TE>
<TE>   He said aging plaster in the pool made the water chalky and
created an optical illusion. "Everyone looked in the pool and saw
what they thought was the bottom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police officers never swept the pool, Kalish said,
even though it was the last place the boy was seen. The pool is 35
feet long, 20 feet wide and 9 feet deep at one end. It has a
light-colored bottom.</TE>
<TE>   A pool cleaner poured chemicals into the pool Monday, Kalish said,
and that may have cleared the water enough for the housekeeper to see
the boy's body. The pool cleaner did not sweep the pool, Kalish said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD sources said top officials in the department have begun
questioning officers in charge of the investigation, as well as
Kalish's announcement Tuesday that someone must have dumped the boy's
body in the pool.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way he could have been missed," Kalish said at the
time.</TE>
<TE>   Coroner officials said the failure by police Sunday to find the
boy's body made no difference in his death. "There was probably
nothing that anybody could do," said Harvey, the coroner's spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. James Ribe, who helped oversee the autopsy, warned parents
that children can drown in minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "All pools are dangerous," he said, adding that adults must always
keep watch over children who are swimming.</TE>
<TE>   Ribe said the boy's skin showed no signs that he was removed from
the pool before discovery by the housekeeper, 41 hours after he was
last seen. Ribe said skin easily bruises when a body is moved after
death.</TE>
<TE>   Paolo's parents, Franklin and Edwina Ayala, stayed in seclusion at
their two-bedroom Beverly Hills apartment Wednesday. Moments before a
coroner's news conference, they were told their son had drowned.</TE>
<TE>   The couple were joined by friends and family as they watched the
news conference on television, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel there should have been a little more supervision at
this party," said Crisanto Benuto, a family spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Benuto said the family was in shock when the boy's body was found
Tuesday. "They don't blame the police," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kalish said Los Angeles Building and Safety officials cited the
Farkhondehpour family for failing to have a fence around the pool.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities initially suspected the boy might have been abducted
because protective landscaping at the rear of the property, which
borders Beverly Glen Drive, had been removed for a remodeling
project.</TE>

<LD>It was usually dark when Lori Elizabeth Fischer ended her shift as a

subdivisions.</LD>

authorities allege that over the last two months, Fischer
meticulously planted razor blades, nails and other sharp objects in
strategic locations at parks, buried in sandboxes and under slides
and swings.</LD>
<LD>   Before many of the incidents, Fischer called police from pay
phones, sometimes using the name "Danni," to warn them of cities
about to be targeted, Orange County sheriff's officials said
Wednesday. She allegedly kept newspaper clippings of the discoveries
and filled a thick journal with musings and poems about the wave of
razor-blade findings that set area parents and children on edge.</LD>
<TE>   One of her verses, provided by the Sheriff's Department, read:
"Nature's most precious resource / Frolics in the sand / Not a care
in the world / Just unending joy / All is shattered / When the
authorities come / Beep, Beep, Beep / Shiny, sharp objects in the
sand / Of a child's playground / Who would do it / Who would hurt an
innocent."</TE>
<TE>   A day after Fischer's arrest, her friends and former teachers
Wednesday were asking that very question. Some described her as a
quiet but intense person. She was a loyal friend, they said, someone
incapable of the crimes she is accused of committing.</TE>
<TE>   But others said she was lonely and depressed. At Capistrano Valley
High School, where she graduated in 1998, Fischer was often seen
walking campus corridors alone with a pet lizard on a leash.</TE>
<TE>   "She was eccentric, and she wasn't the picture-postcard California
teenager," said Lyn Harvey, who taught her academic decathlon for
three years. Others recalled that Fischer regularly sought attention,
often staying after class to talk to instructors.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a needy student who would act out in various ways," said
Stan Nickel, her choir teacher in junior year. "I could see where she
had the need to be something or at least be recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked to see her face [on television] but not surprised,"
he added.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors in the Mission Viejo block where Fischer and her parents
lived said they often heard Fischer screaming at night from inside
the home.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Wednesday that they plan to charge Fischer today
with felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon and willful intent
to injure a child. Authorities found sharp objects at 10 parks in
Orange County, and Wednesday laid out for the first time what led
them to believe Fischer is behind the crime spree.</TE>
<TE>   Detectives zeroed in on Fischer two weeks ago, just as alarm over
the discoveries reached a peak. Investigators had already talked to
her while following vague leads, but the young woman didn't become a
suspect until May 23.</TE>
<TE>   That night, deputies staking out Joyner Park in Mission Viejo said
they noticed Fischer making a late-night visit. No sharp objects were
found at the park, but detectives took her in for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's deputies and Laguna Beach investigators interrogated
Fischer three more times. During one of those interviews, they said,
Fischer failed a voice stress test--which, like a polygraph, is
designed to detect deceit.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, deputies said, they secretly watched Fischer leave
work at the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Laguna Niguel
about 11:30 p.m., then followed her as she drove to parks in Mission
Viejo and Foothill Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't stop," sheriff's Sgt. Jim Sewell said. "She'd slow
down and speed up and made U-turns. She drove for hours going nowhere
and everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the anonymous phone warnings from "Danni"
stopped. Fischer began calling the police using her own name,
sheriff's officials said, saying that she had heard rumors that a
particular city was about to be the next target.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had a list of 20 possible suspects, but Fischer was
moved to the top. Detectives said they attached a tracking device to
her car, hoping to catch her in the act.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, more than 30 razor blades were found hidden in Alicia
Park in Mission Viejo. Had Fischer been there, the tracking device
should have recorded her visit to the park. But the device
malfunctioned.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, Fischer called to tell deputies that she had
heard that sharp objects were about to be planted at a park between
Vista del Lago in Mission Viejo and Alicia Parkway. Shortly after
midnight, a team of undercover sheriff's deputies arrived at Vista
del Lago Park. The deputies swept the park for sharp objects and
found nothing. About 12:45 a.m., the surveillance team said they
spotted Fischer.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said she spent seven minutes at the park before
returning to her car. Deputies who rushed to the park found nails
sprinkled on the playground.</TE>
<TE>   Fischer reportedly drove a short way before officers stopped her.
After a 30-minute standoff, deputies smashed the back window of her
Toyota Corolla and hauled her out, sheriff's officials said. Deputies
said they found nails and an inch-thick handwritten journal in her
car. Sheriff's officials said it's the journal's contents that
provide some of the most compelling evidence. The entries described
children getting hurt and were "vindictive and laughed at kids and
police," Sewell said.</TE>
<TE>   One of her poems, which she wrote was a "work in progress" next to
a copyright claim, he said, read:</TE>
<TE>   "More hazards are found / Nails, razorblades, broken glass / The
innocence is shattered / Yellow police tape encircles / The once
peaceful haven / Beep, beep, beep."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators searched Fischer's hilltop home Tuesday just three
miles from where she was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   They said they found another journal and nails, razor blades and
newspaper clippings about the crime spree.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies said they believe Fischer committed most--if not all--of
the crimes. Officials said they were unsure of a motive, but
speculated that she may suffer from a mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be a cry for help," said Sheriff Mike Carona.</TE>

<HD>A City's Political Turmoil Worsens</HD>
<DH>Scandals: A disbarred lawyer and felon earns $200 an hour
doing work for South Gate. Mayor says the woman just 'made a
mistake.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former attorney caught forging documents and embezzling money has
been working in South Gate for 10 months, racking up $200-an-hour
fees as the city's trial specialist.</LD>
<LD>   Known as Cristeta Klaparda in South Gate, to authorities she is
Cristeta Paguirigan, a disbarred lawyer with a history of felony
convictions and probation violations.</LD>
<LD>   Paguirigan, 42, has not been convicted in any South Gate-related
crimes, but she faces a potential three-year prison term in October
if she doesn't repay $33,900 to several past clients.</LD>
<TE>   Though she's barred from working as an attorney, Paguirigan's
hourly rate tops that of many lawyers, including the South Gate city
attorney, who earns $185 per hour.</TE>
<TE>   The revelations add to the city's turmoil. With the city awash in
political corruption investigations--the most recent raid saw 150
investigators swarm City Hall, homes and offices throughout the
city--leaders and residents bemoan South Gate's worsening image.</TE>
<TE>   But though officials defend Paguirigan's hiring, critics say it is
fresh evidence of government irresponsibility. In another often-cited
example, Treasurer Albert Robles in May was appointed deputy city
manager--at a salary of $111,000--just one month after being charged
with threatening to kill public officials. His preliminary hearing is
scheduled for Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "They are getting together individuals with similar backgrounds,
and a lack of ethics and morals ... people with a lot of baggage,"
said Councilman Henry Gonzalez, a frequent critic of the council
majority. "It's like looking at a piece of fish. After a while, it
starts to smell."</TE>
<TE>   Apart from the Paguirigan controversy, officials also have hired
an engineer, Hector A. Castillo, who, a judge said last year, may
have embezzled money from the Los Angeles chapter of the Society of
Hispanic Professional Engineers, a nonprofit group he once headed.</TE>
<TE>   Hired in December, Castillo's firm, H.C. &amp; Associates, now helps
manage South Gate projects totaling $40 million. Castillo, who has
not been prosecuted for his work with the group, denies any
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Some South Gate officials defend both appointments. Castillo's
firm is credited with providing thorough inspections and review work,
while Paguirigan is described as a hard-working labor specialist.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't get involved with who does what as long as the
work gets done," said Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba, speaking of
Paguirigan's case. "I just know that she's a very intelligent, bright
woman, who unfortunately made a mistake in the past."</TE>
<TE>   Ruvalcaba said she wasn't aware of Paguirigan's embezzlement
convictions, but suggested that her forgery conviction, a felony, was
the result of a misunderstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "From what I know, it was an honest mistake.... I don't see the
big deal about that," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan pleaded no contest in 1997 to forging a witness'
signature on court documents. She was subsequently disbarred because
the crime involved an act of moral turpitude.</TE>
<TE>   City Atty. Salvador Alva said he knew of Paguirigan's disbarment,
but not the details of her criminal past. Alva said he would not give
an opinion on her until he addresses the council on the issue next
week. Paguirigan's tenure dates to July, when the city hired her
employer, Los Angeles lawyer Clifton Albright, as the city's labor
counsel.</TE>
<TE>   A City Hall Regular</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan, who works as a labor and trial specialist, appears
regularly at City Hall, often seen at meetings or court hearings
scribbling in a legal note pad.</TE>
<TE>   Her work takes varied forms, according to a review of billing
statements. Among other things, she prepares motions, analyzes cases
and makes frequent "strategy" session phone calls to clients.</TE>
<TE>   According to state law and the state bar's rules of professional
conduct, disbarred attorneys are prohibited from practicing law. And
attorneys who hire disbarred lawyers must notify their clients.</TE>
<TE>   Albright has notified officials of Paguirigan's disbarment, and
said she does only paralegal work. But Councilman Gonzalez said
Paguirigan has given legal advice in the past and notes that her
compensation exceeds that of many attorneys. At $200 hourly, she
earns more than Alva, the city attorney ($185), and Special Counsel
Eduardo Olivo ($190).</TE>
<TE>   "She's not an attorney, but she's acting like an attorney," said
Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   South Gate officials said they had not tallied how much the city
has paid for Paguirigan's services since July. But, according to
Gonzalez, in one three-month period her law firm billed the city
$171,000 for her work.</TE>
<TE>   Albright recently admitted double-billing the city about $6,000,
some of it for Paguirigan's work. Albright said the double billing
resulted from a clerical error.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan, a 1984 graduate of UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of
Law, had a private practice before coming to South Gate. Her run-ins
with law enforcement started in the mid-1990s, when she was convicted
of forging a witness' signature on court documents.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, she was convicted on two felony counts of stealing
$37,500 from a trust account while working as legal counsel for
Spectator Management Group. The private company manages the Long
Beach Convention and Entertainment Center.</TE>
<TE>   Repayment Ordered</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan, according to prosecutors, stole money intended to
settle a wrongful termination lawsuit of an ex-employee. Sentenced to
five years' probation, Paguirigan, prosecutors say, violated the
terms of probation by not making court appearances, failing to repay
her victims and committing new felonies.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan, interviewed by telephone, vowed to make amends to her
victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I intend to keep an absolutely clean record, to be vigilant and
not having any lapses of judgment occur. And I intend to reapply for
that [attorney] license," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In April, the most recent case, she admitted to stealing $15,000
from another client. She faces a three-year prison term if by October
she doesn't return that money, and $18,900 more to other alleged
victims, according to the plea bargain agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Accusations Denied</TE>
<TE>   "The defendant is a danger to herself and the community," said
Superior Court Judge Michael A. Tynan in an April hearing. He said a
"high [prison] term is appropriate ... because the planning,
sophistication and her professionalism at which the crime was carried
indicated premeditation."</TE>
<TE>   In a separate matter, district attorney investigators recently
raided the offices of Paguirigan and Albright. Authorities suspect
they were misusing public funds by working on a voter recall drive
aimed at ousting elected officials in South Gate. Paguirigan and
Albright vehemently deny the accusations.</TE>
<TE>   Paguirigan is the name authorities use to refer to her in court
documents, though in South Gate she uses Klaparda, the name of her
ex-husband.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo, the engineer, came to South Gate a few months after a
judge ordered him to give up control of the Latino engineers group, a
100-member Los Angeles chapter of a national organization.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter's financial problems emerged in a legal battle started
in 1998 when members accused Castillo, then its president, of rigging
an election.</TE>
<TE>   After a trial, the judge sided with the members and ordered a
special master to review the finances. The special master, John A.
Messina Jr., concluded that Castillo and another official of the
organization probably stole thousands of dollars worth of the
chapter's assets.</TE>
<TE>   The organization that once raised $80,000 a year in dues and
corporate sponsorships had only 8 cents when Castillo turned it over,
Messina reported.</TE>
<TE>   The other official and "Castillo have left [the organization] in
financial ruin and have, perhaps irrevocably, damaged the reputation
of a leading minority-run nonprofit," Messina wrote in his final
report.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Stephen Czuleger expressed frustration with
the pair. He said they avoided being served court documents and, at
times, acted like "criminals."</TE>
<TE>   "What I assume is that everything the special master is saying may
be true: These people are thieves," said Czuleger, according to a
court transcript.</TE>
<TE>   However, Czuleger did not order the special master's report
forwarded to authorities, though he said members of the engineers
group could do so.</TE>
<TE>   The chapter's new president, Michael Marquez, said he has sent the
special master's final report to the district attorney's public
integrity squad. David Demerjian, head of the unit, said his office
would review the complaint.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the civil case over control of the Latino engineers
group remains unresolved while Castillo appeals the final ruling. He
has not repaid debts owed by the organization and has created another
nonprofit group, even though the judge disallowed him from competing
with the original engineers group.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo says his new organization--the Latino Engineers,
Architects &amp; Developers Society--does not compete with his former
group. He also denies defrauding anyone and said he has not been
prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   His problems, he said, grew from an internal power struggle. He
added that he gave his heart to the organization for many years,
volunteering time and money totaling more than $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is nothing more than an organization's [members] fighting
among themselves," he said.</TE>

<KH>THE WOLF FIRE</KH>
<HD>Crews Try to Slow Blaze</HD>
<DH>Firefighting: Heavy equipment will be used today to cut
breaks in the protected wilderness to halt advancing flames.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bracing for strong winds and high temperatures through the weekend,
firefighters will use bulldozers today to cut firebreaks through
protected wilderness to slow a 10,644-acre wildfire north of Ojai
before it can threaten the Sespe Condor Sanctuary.</LD>
<LD>   Using bulldozers to carve a six- to-10-mile fire line at the
southern end of the Sespe Wilderness in the Los Padres National
Forest signals a more aggressive strategy as firefighters struggle to
control a fire that some fear could burn for weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy machinery is usually prohibited by federal restrictions
protecting sensitive wildlife habitat.</LD>
<TE>   "We're still trying to set up some kind of perimeter to somehow
stop this thing," said state Firefighter Bill Rodat, one of 1,600
firefighters called up from across the country to battle the fire.</TE>
<TE>   By nightfall, the blaze was 15% contained. One firefighter was
treated for dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the 5-day-old Wolf fire, which has already cost state
and county agencies more than $3.5 million, has not been determined.</TE>
<TE>   But sources familiar with the investigation said Wednesday that
people shooting weapons near the Wolf Grill off California 33, about
12 miles from Ojai, may have sparked the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of a bicycling tour group said they saw people
shooting at an abandoned car in the area shortly before the fire
started Saturday afternoon. Merrick Cohn, 32, of Camarillo said he
heard shots and then saw smoke coming from the area near the
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept seeing [fire investigators] say they didn't know why it
started, and I knew why it started," Cohn said. "I figured everyone
did."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, triple-digit temperatures, dry conditions and 22 mph
wind gusts fed a wildfire that threatened ranch homes in Saugus in
Los Angeles County on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   But fire officials said brush-clearance efforts spared most of
those residences from damage. One house was reported destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze was reported at 2:40 p.m. near the 23100 block of Piute
Court and has burned through 3,500 acres of brush.</TE>
<TE>   More than 300 firefighters with the U.S. Forest Service and Los
Angeles County Fire Department initially clustered around 10 houses
in the San Francisquito Canyon region, fighting the blaze with the
aid of four water-dropping helicopters and two fixed-wing air
tankers.</TE>
<TE>   Two days after a brush fire burned 125 acres in Angeles National
Forest in Susana Canyon north of Azusa, spots of the singed land
began burning again Wednesday afternoon, said Kathy Peterson,
spokeswoman for the Forest Service. Fire crews who were already
monitoring the scene kept the fire from spreading further, Peterson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Peterson said, about three to five acres near the Pyramid
Reservoir in Angeles National Forest burned Wednesday afternoon. And
in the San Bernardino National Forest, two big blazes were under
control, with one 90% contained and the other nearly completely
controlled.</TE>
<TE>   The Arrowhead fire, which officials believe could have been
started by firefighters on a training exercise, consumed 2,688 acres
and destroyed four storage buildings, a trailer, bathhouse and a
commercial building. The blaze, which so far has cost $2.4 million to
fight and could reach $4 million, was 90% contained Wednesday night,
said Ruth Wenstrom of the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   To the south, the Bee fire near Hemet was contained Monday and was
expected to be completely controlled by 6 p.m., Wenstrom said. It
burned 432 acres.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, tanker planes and helicopters continued their
air assault on the region's largest fire, which cast a yellow and
orange cloud over much of the area while raining ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Although the condor sanctuary remains roughly 20 miles from the
blaze, officials said that could quickly change if winds shift to the
southeast. That is the main reason for using the bulldozers to cut a
fire line through the Sespe Wilderness, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary reason is to keep the fire out of the condor
sanctuary," said Aaron Gelopter, a member of an elite firefighting
team that took over directing fire coverage Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   From his post in a remote section of Rose Valley, 1 1/2 miles
south of the fire's head, state firefighter Rodat spent the day
Wednesday directing a small squadron of Bell 250 helicopters as they
swooped low to scoop water from a pond before heading back.</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally inaccessible up there," Rodat said.</TE>
<TE>   A winding section of California 33 between Wheeler Springs on the
south and Lockwood Valley Road on the north will remain closed at
least until Monday, officials said. Residents of the Howard Creek
area about a mile from the wildfire stayed close to their homes
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the Wolf fire scorched the 7,000-foot Pine Mountain
Ridge, it continued on an eastern path with an expanding front line
that had stretched to at least four football fields wide.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by miles of pine trees and thick chaparral brush left bone
dry by last winter's lack of rain, flames in some spots leaped more
than 100 feet in the air, firefighters said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in an extreme condition," said Dennis Burns, a captain
with the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department near Oakland, who has
been assigned to track the fire's path. "We normally don't see these
conditions until September. This is going to be a long duration
fire."</TE>
<TE>   Weather officials are predicting a return today of dry westerly
winds--ranging from 20 mph or more--through at least Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures are also expected to remain in the mid-90s,
possibility dipping over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Similar type winds and conditions gave the fire its initial push
along both sides of California 33 and helped feed the flames that
destroyed several abandoned cabins used for Native American religious
ceremonies on a private ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Burns and others monitoring the fire's progress said if the
forecast winds arrive, they will again force the fire to the east in
the path of heavy brush that has not burned since the Matilija fire
in 1932 charred nearly 220,000 acres.</TE>
<TE>   "The wind has given us a reprieve but this is going to require an
extended and focused attack on the fire," said Darren Drake, a
spokesman for the U.S Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Andrew Blankstein, Carol Chambers and Jessica
Garrison contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Aerial Tramway Pushes the Vertical Limit</HD>
<DH>The 11-minute ride from desert floor to mountaintop
inspires awe among visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FERRELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the most stunning views afforded by the Palm Springs Aerial
Tramway is from the rocky canyon floor, looking up. The cables appear
impossibly long and thread-like. They begin at a sharp angle and
become ever-steeper as they span skeletal towers to the towering
canyon rim, where the walls are all but cliffs.</LD>
<LD>   By then, the tram cars have gained more than a mile in
elevation--and are still climbing at an angle that looks almost
vertical.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going up that?" Marion Rodgers exclaimed to her husband,
Calvin, as they stepped from their rental car and saw the tramway for
the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Fear somehow intensifies the beauty. Beauty intensifies the fear.
They flicker in a tourist's mind in ways that are difficult to
express. Marion Rodgers laughed after reaching the top and talked
about visiting the Colorado Rockies and Georgia's Stone Mountains.
This 11-minute tram ride was more--beyond breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   "You're closer to God, I'll tell you that, " she said. "That's
what it does to you--makes you realize man is so humble."</TE>
<TE>   Calvin Rodgers expounded on the rock formations near the
top--ledges and outcroppings in a palette of colors, dotted with firs
growing out of the canyon walls. The escarpments are fringed with
brush, eroded by storms, broken and cut to show a thousand beguiling
patterns in the granite.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just awesome," he said.</TE>
<TE>   No attraction in California is quite like the tramway, opened in
1963 and improved two years ago with the installation of Swiss-built
round cars that rotate twice during each trip up or down the
mountain. The new cars have the look of flying saucers. They lift 80
people at a time from a desert oasis at 2,643 feet to a pine forest
8,516 feet up the side of Mt. San Jacinto.</TE>
<TE>   The trip passes through five distinct ecological zones. The barrel
cactus and yucca plants of the bottom give way to sycamore,
cottonwood and black maple. Higher up there are manzanita and
mountain mahogany, pinyon pine and scrub oak, wild apricot and
evergreens. Hiking trails meander through the dense forest at the
top.</TE>
<TE>   "What fascinates me is the difference between that side of the
mountain and this," said Wanda Wojnarowki of Kansas City, Mo. The
lower, west-facing slopes are dry and barren and covered with rocks.
The top is green and lush. In the winter, it gets heavy snow.</TE>
<TE>   Temperatures on the mountain are often 30 degrees cooler than down
below. That fact was the motivating force behind construction of the
tramway, the brainchild of an electrical engineer named Francis F.
Crocker. It is said that Crocker was visiting nearby Banning one hot
day in 1935 and peered up longingly at the snow-capped peak of Mt.
San Jacinto. Almost immediately, he began devising plans for a
tramway, a project that became known as "Crocker's Folly" in the many
futile years that followed.</TE>
<TE>   Two early legislative bills to create the tramway were vetoed.
World War II intervened. Funds were raised. The Korean War caused
further delay.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in the early 1960s, helicopters began flying missions
into Chino Canyon--23,000 trips, without accident, to construct
support towers and the mountain tram station. Built for just over $8
million, the tramway is owned and operated by the state and is prized
by residents of Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "You can swim in your pool in Palm Springs in the morning and go
up the tram and ... take cross-country ski lessons in the afternoon,"
said David Aaker, a resident for eight years. He and his wife,
Faleen, have yearly tram passes that cost $120 apiece. They take the
tram up for dinner or evening coffee and dessert, Aaker said.</TE>
<TE>   "You can watch the lights come on all over the Coachella Valley
and ride the train down at night," he said. "It's absolutely
fabulous. From my backyard, I can watch the tram cars go up at night.
It's really relaxing. There is not a lot of light pollution here.
There are no street lights. The stars here are fabulous."</TE>
<TE>   If Aaker sounds like a chamber of commerce executive, it's because
he is. But plenty of outsiders also rave about the tramway. Victor
Yap, a tropical fish breeder from the Philippines, is one.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just wonderful," Yap said upon reaching the top. "As scary
as it is, it's exciting as well. It's like riding a roller coaster."</TE>
<TE>   Tower No. 3, as the tram nears 6,000 feet, accounts for the only
real bump in the ride. Crossing the tower, the tram car kicks and
sways disconcertingly. "If you have bad balance," tram operator Craig
Tyerman tells his passengers, "you may want to hang on."</TE>
<TE>   The swaying brought nervous laughter from Yap's wife, Nina, and
their two young daughters, Colene and Pammy. "I know they got scared,
definitely," Yap said. "When the tram rolls and pitches, and you have
a backdrop of the stony mountain, it just magnifies the scariness and
excitement."</TE>
<TE>   Rex Andre, a vacationer from Minneapolis, has taken a tram up Mt.
Blanc in the French Alps--a ride above a glacier, under blowing
clouds, that he found "foreboding and dark." The Palm Springs tramway
was far more beautiful and exhilarating, he said. Andre marveled at
the miles of trails that extend from the mountain tram station into
the 13,000-acre Mt. San Jacinto State Park and wilderness area.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite the fact there are a lot of people up here, there were
many parts of the trail where I had absolute, pristine solitude," he
said. "I found myself visualizing what it must have been like on a
horse, when there were no trails, trying to get through this area."</TE>
<TE>   Many hikers take the $21 tram ride in the morning and go to the
mountain summit 10,804 feet above sea level. It's an 11-mile round
trip that left Miles Prather, of Dallas, tired but happy.</TE>
<TE>   "Once you get up here, the park is superior to anything I've ever
seen," Prather said while waiting to take the tram down. Traveling
alone, he was in the middle of a 12-day tour of the desert in
Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah. Las Vegas was one point on his
journey, but Prather had yet to encounter anything as memorable as
the aerial tramway.</TE>
<TE>   "Great views all over the place," he said. "It was everything I
expected and more."</TE>

<HD>Internet Can Be a Safe Place for Kids and for Free Speech</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMITAI ETZIONI</AU>
<BD>Amitai Etzioni is a professor at George Washington
University and the author of numerous books, including "The Limits of
Privacy" (Basic Books, 1999).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unfortunately, when Congress set out to protect children from the
media and the Internet, it used a sledgehammer instead of a surgical
scalpel.</LD>
<LD>   The 1996 Communications Decency Act made it a federal crime to
send obscene or indecent messages over the Internet to anyone under
the age of 18 or to post sexually explicit material that could be
viewed by anyone under 18. The Child Online Protection Act of 1998
made it unlawful to post materials that are harmful to minors on any
Web site that is available to those under the age of 17.</LD>
<LD>   The first was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court as overly
broad and in violation of the 1st Amendment, and the second, though
partially upheld by the high court, was sent back to a lower court
for further scrutiny and may yet be ruled unconstitutional. Now
another law has been struck down by the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.
But rather than appealing this ruling--as the Justice Department is
contemplating--recasting it could provide the shield we need to
protect children.</LD>
<TE>   The idea behind the Children's Internet Protection Act, or CIPA,
is a solid one. More than a thousand studies have shown that the
extended exposure of children to violent and vile material in the
media makes them significantly more likely to engage in antisocial
behaviors. Moreover, the courts have regularly recognized that
protecting children is a compelling public interest.</TE>
<TE>   In the CIPA, enacted in 2000, Congress tried a different and a
much more modest approach than in the earlier attempts. The law
concerns only those schools and libraries that apply for certain
taxpayer-funded programs that provide computers and Internet access.
Recipients of these funds are only required to install filters on all
computers with Internet access. Ostensibly, this means that the law
deals only with access and not with content.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union and the American Library Assn.,
in conjunction with many Internet users and content providers,
nevertheless brought suit against CIPA on two major grounds. First,
they reintroduced content issues. These civil libertarian groups
held--and the court agreed with them--that requiring filters violates
the 1st Amendment because the filtering software blocks access to
many sites that contain clearly protected speech, such as information
about sexuality and reproductive health.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the plaintiffs argued that adults should not be reduced to
reading only material that is suitable for children. This would be,
as Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter put it on another
occasion, "like burning the house to roast the pig."</TE>
<TE>   However, filtering technology is getting better. Some filters now
are reported to be more than 99% accurate. True, given the millions
of sites, filters will misclassify some. But, as UCLA law professor
Eugene Volokh put it, if one cannot create a perfect system in which
the speech of adults and children are completely separate, allowing
some restrictions that spill over into the adult world might well be
a price worth paying if these measures protect children.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the spillover can be minimized, if not avoided
completely, if that law is rewritten. The Justice Department could
work with Congress to formulate a law that would require all
libraries with more than one computer to set aside some for children,
which would be filtered, and some for adults, which would not. If the
library has only one computer, children's hours could be established.
All adult computers would be equipped with privacy panels to protect
others around the viewing adults. An additional refinement would
provide different filters for minors who are 12 or younger and for
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   One can respect the 1st Amendment and still protect children from
unbounded exposure to material the courts recognized as harmful.</TE>

<HD>Others Also Bear Blame for Tyson's Behavior</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EARL OFARI HUTCHINSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mike Tyson left the airport in Memphis, Tenn., last weekend for
his scheduled fight this Saturday with heavyweight champ Lennox
Lewis, a pack of reporters eagerly followed him. Local TV stations
aired continuous updates on his doings, even when there was nothing
to report, since Tyson seemed determined not to say or do anything to
jeopardize the staging of what is expected to be one of boxing's
biggest-grossing fights.</LD>
<LD>   Nobody shadowed Lewis. Tyson is the show's top attraction. There's
always the expectation that he may bite, kick or explode in an
expletive-laced rage.</LD>
<LD>   If that happens, the hordes of sports fans, writers and boxing
officials who have screamed for his head will again engage in the
ritual orgy of Tyson-bashing.</LD>
<TE>   But Tyson won't be the only one to blame for that behavior. Others
must also shoulder some responsibility. His history as a street thug,
bully, lecher and convicted rapist is well known. After his release
from prison, many boxing promoters and corporate media owners openly
played on Tyson's bad-boy image. They greedily hoped that this would
swell the gate and bring colossal paydays back to the dying sport of
boxing. They were right.</TE>
<TE>   Tyson--pumped up by sports fans, admirers, the media and the money
crowd as boxing's primal-force gladiator--took full advantage. He
believed he was "Iron Mike," a man above the law who could do
anything and get away with it. He almost did.</TE>
<TE>   The frightening thing is that in an era when the media routinely
turn the thug behavior of some athletes into fortune and ratings,
Tyson's stock will soar even higher if he whips Lewis. Many who
clamored for his blood will clamor for tickets to see him bludgeon
someone inside--or just as likely outside--the ring. If Tyson is a
monster, he's our monster.</TE>

<HD>Clueless About Nuclear Holocaust</HD>
<DH>S. Asians need to be educated on the horrors of death under
this scenario.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAHNAZ ISPAHANI</AU>
<BD>Mahnaz Ispahani is a senior fellow at the Council on
Foreign Relations in New York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Buddha's birthday in 1998, there was national jubilation when
India conducted nuclear tests. Hindu extremists suggested that the
radioactive desert sands in which the tests had been conducted be
distributed across the nation. And now, in New Delhi think tanks,
scholars discuss the ready prospects of controlling the nuclear
escalatory ladder in a "limited" conventional war with Pakistan. They
feel confident that the U.S. will disarm Pakistan.</LD>
<LD>   In Pakistan, meanwhile, frivolous talk about an "Islamic" bomb is
bandied about in a country housing thousands of committed Islamist
extremists. Pakistanis appear sanguine; some are pictured dancing in
the embrace of a missile replica. In lieu of new ministries,
hospitals or schools, cities are littered with sleek models of
Shaheen and Ghauri missiles.</LD>
<LD>   In both India and Pakistan, there is virtually no nuclear fear.
People seem to think of nuclear weapons as no more than larger tanks
or bigger bombs. And in both countries, there is strong public
support for war.</LD>
<TE>   These people don't have a clue about what nuclear war means. Those
in the West who want to move the two governments away from nuclear
escalation must, in addition, let the Indian and Pakistani people
know in graphic detail what a nuclear war would do.</TE>
<TE>   For starters, U.S. intelligence sources estimate that up to 12
million people could die almost immediately in a nuclear exchange in
South Asia. Then would come the radioactive contamination, famine and
disease.</TE>
<TE>   This is a region where, by international standards, peacetime
levels of suffering--from disease, AIDS, poverty and domestic and
public violence--are painfully high. Urban hospitals would not be
able to deal with the aftereffects of catastrophe. By sharing
information, experience and expertise, concerned countries and groups
should try to let ordinary Indians and Pakistanis know the true
nature of a nuclear holocaust. And they should seek to build up civil
society groups, including doctors, teachers, scientists and retired
military officers who oppose the spread of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. and other international donors identify ways to aid
and assist the region, educating South Asians on the true, long-term
agony of dying by nuclear fallout and radiation should be near the
top of the agenda. There are Japanese groups that can share
experiences of Hiroshima and Nagasaki; they already run small model
programs. There are groups in the U.S. and Europe with experience in
helping their communities grapple with the dangers of nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   And in South Asia, there is a small but active peace education
movement. Members of the movement run small-scale projects--videos,
films, essay competitions in schools--but they have neither the funds
nor the staff to carry out broader nuclear education. Expanding their
work will not be a quick fix, but it is vital.</TE>
<TE>   Not just governments, but international civil society must be
engaged in averting this threat. The nascent antinuclear
constituencies in the region need greater exposure. Give the peace
movements a chance. South Asian's citizens have a right to know the
true terror contained in the decisions their governments are making.</TE>

<HD>Another Sorry Excuse for FBI's Own Failures</HD>
<DH>Wen Ho Lee's case can't be blamed for making the bureau
gunshy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALBERTA LEE</AU>
<BD>Alberta Lee is a writer and speaker in San Francisco.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The FBI blew it in its failure to heed warnings that could have
alerted investigators to the terrorist hijackers of Sept. 11. Now, in
what seems to be an attempt to distract attention from bureau
incompetence, there have been suggestions that the case of my father,
Wen Ho Lee, made the bureau gunshy about pursuing Zacarias Moussaoui.</LD>
<LD>   Apparently, the distortions and lies about my father and his case
will never cease.</LD>
<LD>   After my father was held in solitary confinement for nine months,
58 of 59 charges against him were dropped. He pleaded guilty to one
count: downloading restricted data, nearly all of which later
testimony showed could be found in libraries or on the Internet. On
the day my father was released from prison, U.S. District Judge James
A. Parker apologized to him for the "demeaning and unnecessarily
punitive conditions" in which he was held. Parker explained that he
had been "led astray" by the Justice Department, the FBI and the U.S.
attorney's office.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the FBI has been effectively spinning the bungling of their
case against my father. By using terminology that suggests clumsiness
or ineptitude on their own part, my father is portrayed as the spy
who got away. My family endured intense scrutiny and endless
interviews by official investigators. The political pressure on
rank-and-file FBI agents led to the lies that were told to Parker so
he would deny bail and keep my father in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, top U.S. nuclear scientists came to my father's
defense, arguing that the government's case was bogus. The National
Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering and the
Institute of Medicine intervened on his behalf--an unheard-of effort
by these prestigious organizations. The case against my father fell
apart not because of incompetence or ineptitude, but because he was
not a spy.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few days, commentators including William Safire have
made the far-fetched claim that because of the selective prosecution
and racial profiling defenses made on behalf of my father, who is
Chinese American, the FBI was intimidated about pursuing Moussaoui, a
Frenchman of Moroccan descent who is the alleged 20th hijacker in the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III has acknowledged
that the bureau did not aggressively pursue red flags in Minnesota
and Arizona that could have led investigators to the terrorist
hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   News reports of the numerous investigative memos that led to
suspicions of terrorist plots suggest that there was good reason for
further inquiry and questioning of Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>   In my father's case, however, Robert Vrooman, the former chief
counterintelligence officer at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and
Charles E. Washington, the former acting director of
counterintelligence at the Energy Department, both gave sworn
statements declaring their belief that ethnicity played a large
factor in the government's scapegoating of him.</TE>
<TE>   Invidious racial profiling occurs when a person is singled out
solely on the basis of race or ethnicity. That's harmful; that's
discriminatory. Barring racial profiling is not a matter of being
politically correct. It's a matter of preventing racism.</TE>
<TE>   My father was singled out because of his ethnicity, and that was
shameful. He was vindicated because he was not a spy. Officials and
commentators should acknowledge the malevolence that was demonstrated
toward my father and stop using his case as an excuse for Sept. 11
blunders.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a connection to be made, maybe it is this: The FBI
wasted millions of dollars and man-hours investigating my father.
Meanwhile, the real enemies succeeded.</TE>

<HD>Media Can Dish It Out but Can't Take It</HD>
<DH>Exposing biases is what a free press is all about.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NORAH VINCENT</AU>
<BD>Norah Vincent is a senior fellow at the Foundation for
the Defense of Democracies, a think tank set up after Sept. 11 to
study terrorism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is criticism traitorous? In the workplace it usually is. If you
bad-mouth your employer within earshot of the head honcho or the
office snitch, you'll probably face the consequences. It's one of
Dilbert's laws.</LD>
<LD>   But somehow we think it should be different with news people
because, after all, they make a living poking their pens and lenses
into other people's infelicities and then trumpeting the results for
all to hear and see. Surely they can take some of the voyeuristic
pedantry they dispense?</LD>
<LD>   Think again. No one bleats more loudly than a critic who's been
critiqued, a reporter who's been reported, especially by one of his
own. So it goes in the American media, where biting the feeding hand
of the Fourth Estate seems to be the order of the day and has claimed
some famous casualties lately.</LD>
<TE>   First, there was Bernard Goldberg's 2001 book "Bias." Years before
he published it, in 1996 to be exact, Goldberg wrote an op-ed for the
Wall Street Journal on the subject of liberal bias in the news, using
his then-employer, CBS News, as Exhibit A. Unsurprisingly, soon
thereafter he was sidelined and later retired from CBS. What he
described in the book as shunning by his colleagues after he wrote
the op-ed was the motivating force, no doubt, behind his decision to
expand his criticism into a best-selling book.</TE>
<TE>   Another apparent traitor, Web pundit Andrew Sullivan, met a
similar fate at the hands of the New York Times Sunday magazine, for
which he had been a regular contributor since 1998. As readers of
Andrewsullivan.com know, he makes a habit of deconstructing the New
York Times' liberal slant, which, he says, has crept in recent years
from the editorial page to the front page. Purported news stories are
now infected with the artfully jaundiced verbiage of the Old Gray
Lady's steely orthodoxies. For example, the Times routinely labels
conservatives as such yet rarely identifies political liberals.</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan, who had written for the magazine about subjects ranging
from the effects of testosterone to the war against militant Islam,
says he was banned because his presence in the Times, he is told,
makes Times Executive Editor Howell Raines uncomfortable. Sullivan
considers it retribution for the sharpness of some of his broadsides
against the Times in general, and in particular, op-ed columnist Paul
Krugman, whom he repeatedly slammed.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes William McGowan's "Coloring the News," a book that
claims to expose "an invisible liberal consensus" in some major
broadcast and print news outlets. As columnist Nat Hentoff reported
May 15 in the Village Voice, "McGowan's [book] has received generally
favorable reviews, even in such papers as the Washington Post and the
Los Angeles Times, which are sharply criticized in his book. But the
influential New York Times Book Review has so far ignored McGowan's
indictment of much of the press."</TE>
<TE>   Why? Hentoff cites an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle in
which New York Times Book Review Editor Charles "Chip" McGrath said
the following: "I think there's a question, and I don't know the
answer: Is this newspaper ... the best place to discuss a book that
is so critical of this newspaper?"</TE>
<TE>   Hentoff duly notes: "The Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times
had no difficulty answering that question."</TE>
<TE>   And that is the issue at hand. Shouldn't the media be open to
criticism from their own? Exposing biases and blind spots,
including--or perhaps especially--those that appear in their own
pages is what a free press is all about. If journalists cannot be
honest with themselves, then what authority do they have to question
the truth-telling of anyone else? Why should we trust their reports
if we suspect them of biases they refuse to acknowledge, much less
redress?</TE>
<TE>   It is an inauspicious time for the 1st Amendment when media
outlets put themselves above meaningful reproach and beyond
professional critique. But as long as Hentoff, Sullivan, Goldberg and
McGowan can keep writing and--more important--keep getting published,
we're on the road to recovery.</TE>

<LD>Now that U2's Bono and the Treasury Department's Paul O'Neill are out
of Africa, critics are dismissing their nine-day tour as a GOP ploy
to attract MTV votes.</LD>
<LD>   Not so. As O'Neill credibly asserted Wednesday, the two agreed far
more often than not on such issues as keeping foreign aid out of the
hands of corrupt officials. Similarly in Congress, Democrats and
Republicans are closer than they have been in many years to retooling
foreign aid to help Africa rein in the spread of AIDS (HIV infects
9,000 people on the continent every day) and clean up contaminated
water. (More than 250 million Africans, nearly the population of the
United States, lack access to clean water.)</LD>
<LD>   Today, the Senate begins considering a short-term "emergency" bill
that would funnel about half a billion dollars in global aid to help
developing nations curb HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. These
intertwined infectious diseases are responsible for almost one-half
of deaths in developing countries.</LD>
<TE>   Democratic senators want the United Nations to distribute most of
the money. Republicans, led by Tennessee Sen. Bill Frist, want
President Bush to more directly distribute the money to programs he
deems effective. Congress should take a middle tack: earmark a
substantial portion of the aid for Africa and prevent Bush from
diverting money into the war on terrorism, but also give the
president freedom to use some of the money to leverage private
charity and aid from other nations.</TE>
<TE>   To those who complain that free-market incentives, such as
encouraging exports, are a more permanent and less corrupting path to
prosperity: Washington careened off that track with this year's farm
bill. The measure lavishly subsidizes U.S.-grown food that competes
with farm products from the poorest countries, making it impossible
for African nations to export their way out of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Congress isn't about to reverse the farm bill, but Bush suggested
a more modest solution in March. With the ubiquitous Bono by his
side, the president announced that he would seek $5 billion a year in
long-term assistance to help developing nations meet basic
health-care goals such as subsidizing drugs that protect babies from
HIV during childbirth. To this list should be added relief for famine
in southern Africa, a crisis that has welled up only in the last few
weeks, well after the Bono-O'Neill tour had been planned.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Mathabo Lekoatsa, wife of a Lesothan tribal leader,
posed a reasonable question to the reporters accompanying O'Neill and
Bono. "Talk, talk, talk," she said. "We hear a lot of words, but
where is the food?" By earmarking aid for Africa now, Bush and
Congress can in good conscience answer her, "It's coming."</TE>

<LD>Redemption is a noble ideal for individuals and institutions. On
Tuesday, a committee of American Catholic bishops stepped toward that
goal with a vaguely worded apology and the most specific proposal to
date for dealing with the sexual abuse that has scandalized their
faith.</LD>
<LD>   Now, for the church to fully redeem itself in the public's mind,
the bishops must reconsider the nature of the redemption to which a
priest who has violated an innocent child should be entitled. They
think a past abuser should have one chance to prove that he has been
rehabilitated. We agree that even child molesters, after release from
prison or other appropriate punishment, deserve a second chance to
live a virtuous life--so long as they earn their living on a Gulf
Coast oil rig or in some other job where they won't have access to
and authority over more potential victims.</LD>
<TE>   The bishops will vote on the proposal next week at a meeting in
Dallas. Many positive elements of the plan merit strong support,
including a call for the church to turn over any new allegations of
sexual abuse against minors to civil authorities for investigation.
The plan calls for defrocking any priest who commits sexual abuse
after the policy is in place. But priests found to have molested only
one child in the past, who have undergone psychological treatment and
whose cases were favorably reviewed by a board that includes lay
members, could remain in the priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   We hope the bishops will amend the plan next week and hold priests
to the same standards as public schoolteachers. One reason the church
has been hemorrhaging credibility since the scandal began is because
its leaders too often seem to view the priests rather than the
children as the victims. The plan's willingness to let one instance
of abuse slide suggests that the bishops remain confused in their
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   A decade ago, U.S. bishops discussed a similar if even less
restrictive plan, but no meaningful structural change came about. Had
a firm policy on pedophilia and a system of accountability been put
in place, the church might have avoided this potentially schismatic
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The new plan will most likely be amended in Dallas. Hopefully the
bishops will do away with the provision that bets so recklessly on
redemption. Those who call for "flexibility" in dealing with one-time
offenders should keep in mind that a victim has no second chance.</TE>

<LD>Minneapolis FBI agent Coleen Rowley's testimony before a Senate panel
today should be accompanied by the applause of an appreciative
nation, both for her and for other principled whistle-blowers.</LD>
<LD>   Rowley, who fired off the now-famous 13-page memo to FBI Director
Robert S. Mueller III about the roadblocks her office faced in
obtaining a search warrant against suspected 20th hijacker Zacarias
Moussaoui, took a big risk. Despite legal protections,
whistle-blowers often suffer retaliation from their bosses. But
Rowley's and other cases show why whistle-blowing isn't snitching,
but a public service.</LD>
<LD>   In California, it was Department of Insurance lawyer Cindy Ossias
who leaked documents to the Assembly Insurance Committee that led to
the demise of Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush's career.</LD>
<TE>   Ossias showed in detail that Quackenbush had reached secret
settlements with six insurance companies after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake that permitted the companies to avoid fines by
contributing funds to private foundations Quackenbush had
established. Even if you're a government attorney, Ossias
demonstrated, the public interest comes first. She risked her job by
technically violating client confidentiality rules, and Quackenbush
tried to fire her, but in the end the state Legislature protected
Ossias' job.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, whistle-blowing has only acquired more importance.
Bogdan Dzakovic, a Federal Aviation Administration special agent for
14 years, said this year that government officials have brushed aside
his complaints that security tests at airports have been manipulated
for success and that agents were told to bury information about poor
security. The Office of Special Counsel, an independent federal
investigative agency, has said that there is a "substantial
likelihood" that Dzakovic's allegations are correct.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Robarge, a nuclear plant safety expert who lost his job
after warning about safety defects at a commercial plant in Illinois,
has recently warned about nuclear plants' vulnerability to aerial
attack and inadequate employee screening.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Congress passed the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act,
federal employees who sound the alert about cover-ups, incompetence
or outright wrongdoing have been offered some safeguards from bosses
who try to fire them or transfer them into meaningless jobs. But
whistle-blowing is still no painless exercise. It brings possible
ostracism by colleagues and the glare of publicity.</TE>
<TE>   When Rowley testifies today, listeners will be reminded that she
had the courage of her convictions while others around her found
reasons to stay quiet. Congress can honor her by making sure that
Mueller does not transfer her to a lesser job as punishment for
exposing his agency's weaknesses.</TE>

<HD>Sinn Fein Wins Belfast Mayor's Post</HD>
<DH>N. Ireland: The victory is a first for the IRA-linked
party. A compromise- minded bloc on the City Council plays a key role
in the outcome.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BELFAST, Northern Ireland</DL>
<LD>The IRA-linked Sinn Fein party won the post of Belfast mayor for the
first time Wednesday, another important step away from its terrorist
past and toward a mainstream political future.</LD>
<LD>   Furious Protestant politicians walked out of Belfast's City
Council after the election of Sinn Fein candidate Alex Maskey, a
former Irish Republican Army prisoner who nearly died in an
assassination attempt 15 years ago. He became the city's second Roman
Catholic mayor in recent years after nearly two centuries of
Protestant dominance.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a disgraceful decision, rewarding an organization which
has been involved in the destruction of Belfast over the past 30
years," said a losing Protestant candidate, Chris McGimpsey.</LD>
<TE>   Maskey, 50, prevailed thanks to the council's most
compromise-minded party, Alliance, whose three members backed Sinn
Fein, despite expressing reservations about continued IRA violence.
Maskey received 26 votes from the 51-member council, while the
Protestant camp--certain beforehand that it would lose--split its 25
votes between two candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Alliance is the only cross-community party on a council otherwise
divided into two diametrically opposed camps: 25 British Protestants
and 23 Irish Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   In previous years, Alliance refused to back Maskey for the
annually elected and officially neutral post. But before the vote,
Councilman David Alderdice said all three Alliance councilmen were
"prepared to hold our noses and swallow for the sake of the peace
process."</TE>
<TE>   Rhetorical battles between the two council blocs have long
centered on the growing involvement of Sinn Fein, which boycotted
Northern Ireland elections until the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Maskey, a former amateur boxer, was interned as an IRA suspect
twice in the 1970s and emerged from prison as a favorite target for
Protestant extremists. He was shot in the stomach at his home in
1987. The IRA has fought British rule of Northern Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   After becoming Sinn Fein's first elected councilman in 1983,
Maskey endured several years of attempted isolation. Protestant
politicians either bolted from the council's red leather benches as
he spoke or drowned out his words with heckles and horns.</TE>
<TE>   But civility in Belfast City Hall has gradually risen along with
Sinn Fein's strength in working-class Catholic neighborhoods. Sinn
Fein today holds 14 posts on the council, more than any other party.</TE>
<TE>   The council, founded after the provincial capital's birth as an
industrial city in the early 19th century, got its first Catholic
mayor in 1997 with the election of Alban Maginness, representing the
moderate Social Democratic and Labor Party. The SDLP's nine members
also backed Maskey in Wednesday's vote.</TE>
<TE>   Alderdice said Maskey should be supported because the IRA in the
last year had unveiled two of its arms dumps to disarmament
officials--a pivotal part of Northern Ireland's 1998 peace accord.</TE>

<LD>   The death toll from a dam burst in northern Syria reached at least
10, the state-run news agency said, as villagers began returning to a
scene of devastation.</LD>
<TE>   About 100 homes were destroyed when the Zeyzoun Dam burst Tuesday,
dumping nearly all of its water over 23 square miles of farmland and
swamping several villages. President Bashar Assad ordered immediate
assistance of $1,000 to the families of each of those killed.</TE>
<TE>   Near the village of Zeyzoun, where most of the houses were
destroyed, the corpses of sheep and goats floated around a huge,
gaping rent in the dam. Residents said they had warned authorities of
cracks in the dam days ago.</TE>

<HD>There's Nowhere to Hide in India, Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Security: Neither nation has readied its citizens in the
event of nuclear war. Officials pass the buck on who's responsible
for civil defense.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON and TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW DELHI</DL>
<LD>The angry rhetoric flying between Indian and Pakistani leaders has
forced their people to face a frightening reality: If nuclear
missiles ever rain down, there is nowhere to hide.</LD>
<LD>   During the darkest days of the Cold War, when the U.S. and Soviet
Union were on the brink of a nuclear war, Americans built backyard
bomb shelters, tested air raid sirens and used Bert the Turtle
cartoons to teach their children to "duck and cover."</LD>
<LD>   In India and Pakistan, which are on the brink of war over the
disputed region of Kashmir, the only people with any hope of finding
shelter from a nuclear attack are top political and military leaders
and, if regular rules apply, people with enough money to ease their
way into a bunker.</LD>
<TE>   Across this subcontinent of more than 1.2 billion people,
virtually all residents are on their own if the unthinkable happens.</TE>
<TE>   Several Indian officials in local and national departments that
are responsible for handling emergencies passed the buck when asked
about civil defense planning.</TE>
<TE>   Shiva Ramakrishnan, New Delhi's director of civil defense, steered
calls to more senior officials, who apparently were out the country.</TE>
<TE>   An aide to Ajit Nimbalkar, special secretary for home affairs in
the federal government, said Raj Kumar Singh, India's joint secretary
in the Home Affairs Ministry, was responsible for civil defense.</TE>
<TE>   When Singh was asked for an interview on how the Indian government
was planning to protect its people in the event of a nuclear strike,
he replied, "Utter nonsense," and hung up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last month, Pakistan's Interior Ministry has run drills
for police, fire and hospital workers, but it hasn't educated the
public on how to increase chances of surviving a nuclear attack. In
the capital, Islamabad, there are said to be fallout shelters for the
generals and politicians, but none for ordinary people.</TE>
<TE>   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf have both said repeatedly that they don't want war,
certainly not a nuclear one. But experts warn that the two countries
have slipped steadily closer to Armageddon since testing nuclear
weapons in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really say that they're going to have a nuclear war, of
course," said Achin Vanaik, an Indian writer. "All you really can say
is that the likelihood of a nuclear conflict in this part of the
world is greater than anywhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-nuclear campaigners such as Vanaik have long argued that
civil defense is a waste of money and that the only way to prevent
mass death from nuclear war is to get rid of the weapons altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the opposite is happening as India and Pakistan continue
to build up their arsenals and test new missiles to deliver them
farther and more accurately.</TE>
<TE>   The countries' people, meanwhile, haven't been told the most basic
precautions, such as how prevailing winds would carry the fallout
plume or how iodine tablets could help them survive radioactive
poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   India's defense department did announce last month that the
military is deploying battlefield nuclear shelters designed by its
research branch. Each shelter can protect 30 people for 96 hours, has
water tanks, chemical toilets, a pump for sewage disposal and can be
transported on a 3-ton truck.</TE>
<TE>   And two front-line cities held small-scale civil defense drills
this week.</TE>
<TE>   Jammu, the winter capital of Indian-controlled Jammu and Kashmir
state, tested its sirens Tuesday night while residents stayed in
their homes. Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city, followed with a
limited drill Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   New Delhi, India's capital and a prime target for what nuclear
strategists call a "decapitation strike" by Pakistani missiles, has
no air raid sirens, no fallout shelters for the public and no known
evacuation plan for almost 13 million residents.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, the municipal government proposed a phased plan costing
more than $240 million to handle the aftermath of a nuclear attack,
which assumed that the blast would create a "dead zone" with a radius
of 14 to 30 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The plan included emergency medical bunkers, a disaster alert
system, more than 200 protective suits for emergency workers and 750
decontamination and first aid kits, the Hindu newspaper reported in
November 1999.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no evidence that the plan was implemented, Vanaik
said, and nuclear activist Nallukunnel Damodaran Jayaprakash called
it bogus.</TE>
<TE>   "People are making money out of this, nothing else," said
Jayaprakash, an executive member of the Delhi Science Forum.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to protect anyone," Jayaprakash said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, New Delhi's health minister, Dr. A.K. Walia, took a
small step toward preparing for the worst. He ordered hospitals to
prepare 2,500 extra beds, which was a little like ordering more
buckets when cracks are spreading across the dam.</TE>
<TE>   Indian hospitals are notoriously overcrowded and understaffed, and
health care is worse in Pakistan. There is only one doctor for every
2,337 Indians, compared with one physician for every 406 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   According to a 1999 study on the likely effects of a nuclear
attack on Bombay, India's largest city and commercial hub, the blast,
fire and radioactive fallout from a 15-kiloton explosion would kill
between 160,000 and 800,000 people in a population of more than 16
million and injure several hundred thousand more.</TE>
<TE>   "These estimates are conservative, and there are a number of
reasons to expect that the actual numbers would be much higher,"
physicist M.V. Ramana wrote in his report, "Bombing Bombay?"</TE>
<TE>   He added that the estimates don't include long-term effects such
as cancer and birth defects.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the results of nuclear weapons tests, Pakistan is
believed to have an arsenal ranging from battlefield, or tactical,
nuclear weapons that would deliver a blast as small as a tenth of a
kiloton, to missile warheads with yields of 25 kilotons or more.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan probably has between 25 and 50 nuclear weapons available
for use, the authoritative journal Jane's Strategic Weapon Systems
reported last month.</TE>
<TE>   India is likely armed with many more nuclear warheads, between 100
and 150, according to Jane's. India's second-generation nuclear
weapons have yields ranging from 20 kilotons to 150 kilotons.</TE>
<TE>   India and Pakistan's rush to build and deploy warheads has far
outpaced the development of strategy, safeguards and civil defense.</TE>
<TE>   An arms race that began in the mid-1970s was driven more by a
desire for status, namely membership in the exclusive club of nuclear
powers, than by real military threats, Vanaik said.</TE>
<TE>   "Therefore, the issue that they may be embarking on a course, with
very serious consequences in terms of the possibility of nuclear war,
was never really taken seriously," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After the Pakistani army's 1999 attack on Indian forces at Kargil,
Vanaik said, Indian commanders and political leaders realized "that
if you are to have a credible nuclear deterrent, then your opponent
must believe that you are prepared to wage a nuclear conflict."</TE>
<TE>   The shock of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the U.S. and
Soviet Union were close to nuclear war at several key moments,
immediately led to a hotline between their two capitals, better
early-warning systems and other measures to manage the dangers of
nuclear deterrence.</TE>
<TE>   There is a hotline linking the Pakistani and Indian leaders'
offices, but Vajpayee now refuses to even look at Musharraf, so it's
anyone's guess whether each would be willing to pick up the phone, or
answer it, in a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   The whole theory that expanding nuclear arsenals could deter war
between India and Pakistan, two neighbors with long borders and 55
years of hostility over the disputed state of Kashmir, is a fallacy,
Vanaik argued.</TE>
<TE>   "The greater danger here lies in the very simple fact that this is
a part of the world that has had a continuous hot-cold war between
the two rivals, which has shown no signs of diminishing," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis between India and Pakistan has another, worrisome
dimension: religious extremism.</TE>
<TE>   Hindu and Muslim radicals have powerful state positions, in
India's ruling party and in Pakistan's military, for example.</TE>
<TE>   India says Pakistan is the biggest risk, in part because it
refuses to declare it won't be the first to use nuclear weapons, as
India has.</TE>
<TE>   But the Hindu extremist organization Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh,
which counts Vajpayee as a member, has publicly called for all-out
war against Pakistan. "Its very existence has become inimical, not
only for India, but for the entire civilized world," declared a Dec.
30, 2001, editorial in the party's newspaper, the Organizer.
"Pakistan deserves to be punished for all its errors of commission
and omission."</TE>
<TE>   "The time has come to solve the problem of Pakistan forever and
for all," it concluded.</TE>

Hussain in Islamabad contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Israeli Incursion Complicates U.S. Diplomacy Efforts</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Ramallah raid comes on eve of Bush's talks in
Washington with Mubarak and Sharon.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An Israeli raid early today on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
compound in Ramallah comes at a bad time for the Bush administration,
occurring on the eve of talks here with Egyptian and Israeli leaders
over the next several days aimed at prodding along the troubled
Middle East peace process.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. effort, launched two months ago by President Bush, is now
at a critical juncture as the administration presses for an
international conference on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The
administration has been trying to find enough common ground among
Israelis, Palestinians and moderate Arab leaders to work out a
formula and timetable for resolving the decades-old dispute.</LD>
<LD>   Administration officials said they were still trying to get
details about the scope, intent and duration of the Israeli attack on
Arafat's compound. But Washington is clearly piqued about Israel
launching the action just ahead of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
meetings with Bush here Friday and Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not the path to peace," said an annoyed administration
official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. mediation efforts already had been rocked by a suicide
bombing early Wednesday outside the Israeli town of Megiddo, which in
turn sparked the Israeli raid in the West Bank city of Ramallah. The
radical movement Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Bush condemned "in the strongest terms" the bombing, which killed
17 Israeli bus passengers.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has been pressing hard to get Arafat to rein in
extremists. This week, CIA Director George J. Tenet held talks with
the Palestinian Authority president about forming a new unified
security force to deal with militants and reopening security talks
with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   The administration has also been urging restraint by the
Israelis--to allow Arafat a chance to act and the United States to
organize the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Before the Israeli assault on Ramallah, there were growing
indications that U.S. officials were questioning the power and future
role of Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the suicide bombing, Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell said, "We note the Palestinian Authority's condemnation of the
attack and reiterate the critical need for Chairman Arafat to show
leadership by continuing to signal clearly to his people that terror
and violence cannot help the Palestinians achieve their national
aspirations."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer used sharper terms,
saying, "In the president's eyes, Yasser Arafat has never played a
role of someone who can be trusted or who was effective."</TE>
<TE>   The administration has begun looking to other Palestinians to
assume leadership roles, including members of humanitarian aid groups
and other nongovernmental organizations, academics and professionals,
as well as others in the Palestinian Authority.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration also wants to avoid inflaming Arab
sensibilities by being seen as formally rejecting Arafat or
determining who leads the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   "People are coming forward [among Palestinians] and there are more
people to talk to, and I think that's a good thing," a senior
administration official told a group of reporters Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "But I want to be very clear--we're not going to try to choose the
leadership for the Palestinian people."</TE>
<TE>   The White House seemed to be signaling to Arafat that the U.S.
would not wait indefinitely for him to follow through on his recent
promises to try to end the sporadic series of suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   "What the president is interested in is results, from whatever
corner they may come from," Fleischer said. "If that's Arafat, that's
fine with the president. If it's others, that's fine with the
president."</TE>
<TE>   The question of Palestinian leadership will be among the issues on
the agenda when Bush meets with Mubarak and when he meets Monday with
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The peace conference, which the administration originally hoped
could be held this month, has been pushed to next month at the
earliest, U.S. officials say.</TE>

<HD>Hunger Casts a Deep Shadow Over Malawi</HD>
<DH>Africa: Drought, floods and mismanagement of grain stores
cause the nation's worst food crisis in 50 years. Countries nearby
also face trouble.</DH>

<DL>KAUNDUMA, Malawi</DL>
<LD>On most days, Melina Jakasoni's three small children survive on a
single meal of boiled and mashed pumpkin leaves. When her scrounging
pays off, the young mother is able to make porridge from donated corn
husks. On rare occasions, a neighbor allows her to forage in her yard
for groundnuts.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, hunger is stalking Africa.</LD>
<LD>   The calamity here is one piece of a food crisis--partly natural
and partly man-made--that is sweeping southern Africa. It is biting
in every household of this dusty settlement about 18 miles from
Lilongwe, the country's capital.</LD>
<TE>   "This year has been very terrible for me," said Jakasoni as her
scrawny 3-year-old son, Vita, sucked in frustration on her shriveled
breasts. "I have even been forced to eat wild roots."</TE>
<TE>   Medical workers say that since January, 13 of Kaunduma's 474
residents have died of hunger. Jakasoni's mother was among them. Her
two youngest children are in need of therapeutic feeding. Her oldest
child, a 7-year-old, is so gaunt that she could pass for 5.</TE>
<TE>   "This year, I think many more people will die," said Kenius
Mkanda, a local health worker. Malawi, a densely populated country
slightly smaller than Pennsylvania, is facing its worst hunger crisis
in more than 50 years. About 70% of its 11 million people are in
desperate need of food aid, according to government estimates. And
that figure is expected to rise. Hundreds of adults and children have
died of hunger-related illnesses since December, aid workers say.</TE>
<TE>   Severe flooding in some parts of the country, coupled with drought
in others, has slashed crop yields in the last several years.
Although April's harvest of corn has brought temporary relief, the
yield was small. Experts and government officials predict that most
families' food stocks will run out by August.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unthinkable what might happen if food is not available by
the time it is needed," said Chigomezgo Mtegha, an assistant program
officer for the U.N. World Food Program in Malawi.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is preparing to launch an emergency operation to get
food to about 2 million people by September.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, people are eating from their [unripe] gardens in many
parts of the country," said Lucius Chikuni, Malawi's commissioner for
disaster preparedness, relief and rehabilitation. "They have sold
their assets. They are completely overstretched when it comes to
coping mechanisms."</TE>
<TE>   As bad as things are here, Malawi is only one part of a larger
problem.</TE>
<TE>   In neighboring Zimbabwe, which is suffering from both drought and
the effects of President Robert Mugabe's land-redistribution
policies, about 3 million people will need daily food aid starting
this month, according to the Washington-based Famine Early Warnings
Systems Network, which monitors food supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Drought and floods have caused food shortages for more than 1.2
million of Zambia's 10 million people. Lesotho's prime minister
recently declared that the country was starving, while in Swaziland,
the government says more than 150,000 of its 1 million citizens are
facing severe hunger.</TE>
<TE>   The scourge of AIDS is compounding the food crisis. An estimated
15% to 20% of the adult population in southern Africa is
HIV-positive. Riddled with disease, many of them are unable to find
jobs or till their fields.</TE>
<TE>   Older Malawians say they have not seen such hunger since 1949,
widely considered the year of the country's worst famine. And even
those days seem less catastrophic than now.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1949, we had somewhere to buy food, and we got handouts from
the government," recalled Shoes Namitambo, chief of Nthumba village
in the southern part of the country, one of the hardest-hit regions.
"This year the problem is, there is nothing to buy, and if there is,
we can't afford it."</TE>
<TE>   The official price of corn has increased nearly 400% to about $7
for a 110-pound bag, a fortune in a country where 60% of people
survive on $1 a day.</TE>
<TE>   Nthumba, a community of 74 households, has lost three people to
hunger since November. Three others fell prey to crocodiles as they
tried to pluck water lily roots, a poor substitute for green
vegetables, from the nearby Shire River.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest tragedy, aid workers, diplomats and donors say, is
that the situation never should have become this bad.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to climatic factors, donors say the crisis is the
consequence of bad management of Malawi's grain reserves, logistics
problems with importing corn, and the vicious circle of poverty that
leaves people too poor to buy food, seeds and fertilizer. In 2000,
Malawi was ranked 163rd out of 174 countries on a U.N. list that
rated countries on prosperity and development.</TE>
<TE>   Donors accuse the government of mismanaging the country's food
stocks by selling off nearly 167,000 tons of surplus grain last year.</TE>
<TE>   The government argues that some of the grain was going bad and
that Western donors pushed it to sell the reserve, insisting that it
was too expensive to store. Officials in Lilongwe also blame donors
for cutting funding to a program that was providing free seeds and
fertilizer to needy families.</TE>
<TE>   Donors counter that they urged Malawi to sell old corn in its
reserves before it rotted and then buy new reserves, reducing the
grain stock--but not down to zero.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence of bad governance, corruption and overspending have made
donors less sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of the donors are frustrated, especially when they feel the
government is partly to blame," said Kerren Hedlund, head of the
World Food Program's Vulnerability Analysis and Mapping Unit in
Malawi. "They feel this situation should not have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Ginies, a Lilongwe-based advisor for the European Commission,
said that flooding the country with donated food is not the answer to
Malawi's woes, since this would undermine the local market, slashing
the price of corn to levels at which small-scale farmers could no
longer compete.</TE>
<TE>   Some donors wonder whether Malawi is suffering from an overall
food shortage, or just a shortage of corn, its staple crop.</TE>
<TE>   Maurizio Borzini, an economic diversification specialist with the
European Commission, said that other crops such as cassava, sweet
potato and rice are available in most parts of the country, but that
most people do not feel that they have eaten a proper meal unless it
includes corn.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a difficult food situation, this is clear," Borzini
said. "But to quantify the gap between the needs and the
availability, that is the problem."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials acknowledge that the country's agricultural
policy is biased toward corn. But they argue that certain crops, like
cassava, only grow well in some parts of the country and do not store
well. Furthermore, corn is the most popular choice.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that our people should diversify their dietary habits,"
said Chikuni, the relief official. "But telling the average Malawian
not to eat maize flour, eat something else, is like telling a Chinese
person not to eat rice."</TE>
<TE>   In rural areas, some schools have closed because of the food
shortages. Scores of students have dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   Among such children is 12-year-old Madalitso Kachepa of Kaunduma.
She and her four younger siblings stopped attending school last year.
It was just too hard to study on a single daily meal of boiled
pumpkin leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still hungry when we go to sleep," Madalitso lamented.</TE>
<TE>   Her mother, Titheranji, didn't plant anything this year. She
couldn't find a job that would bring in the money she needed to buy
seeds. She has lost hope.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot even plan what I can do for my family, not for next
week, or for next month," she said as her scaly 3-year-old son,
Saidi, clutched at her breast, his bloated belly protruding. "I
really don't know what's going to happen."</TE>
<TE>   In despair, many families have resorted to selling off their
meager belongings. Almost all households in Nthumba have had to sell
firewood or livestock to buy grain. Many slash their asking prices
just to make a sale.</TE>
<TE>   A goat, for example, used to sell for about $7. Hungry people, who
don't own freezers to store meat, are now willing to sell their
livestock for as little as $1.50. Instead of buying corn by the bag,
most people can afford to buy only a mug full, costing about 3 cents,
at a time, said Namitambo, the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Desperation has also led to stealing, and vigilantism is on the
rise.</TE>
<TE>   Two people in Kaunduma have been killed since January because they
stole crops, said Mkanda, the health care specialist, who also has
had crops stolen. Many farmers have taken to sleeping in their fields
to guard their scant produce.</TE>
<TE>   The government says that it is pulling out all stops in an effort
to avert famine.</TE>
<TE>   Chikuni said plans are being made to contract commercial
farmers--who normally grow tobacco, tea or sugar cane--to grow corn,
the first such endeavor in Malawi's history. Ways are being sought to
offer affordable credit to farm families to allow them to buy seed
and fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   But this help will come too late for many Malawians.</TE>
<TE>   In the pediatric ward at Lilongwe's Central Hospital, mothers
clutch and pray over infants who display the classic traits of
malnutrition: swollen stomachs, withered limbs, bulging, listless
eyes, and wispy, yellowing hair.</TE>
<TE>   Some will bear the physical scars of undernourishment for the rest
of their lives. Many will not live to see next year's harvest.</TE>
<TE>   The children's ward has 60 patients. Doctors are bracing for many
more.</TE>

<HD>Pakistan Unmoved by Joint Patrol Idea</HD>
<DH>Asia: Officials note that archrival India had floated the
plan for Kashmir before, to no avail. U.S. envoy is to arrive today
for talks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>The government of Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf reacted coolly
Wednesday to an Indian proposal for joint patrols of soldiers to
monitor the cease-fire line in the disputed Kashmir region.</LD>
<LD>   "Given the level of mistrust that exists [between India and
Pakistan], this proposal doesn't seem to be workable," Pakistani
Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan said in an interview. But
Information Minister Nisar Memon later said that the comments did not
constitute an outright rejection of the idea.</LD>
<LD>   "If they are serious about it, they should make a formal
presentation to Pakistan," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Pakistan's reaction to the latest diplomatic proposal, offered
early in the day by Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee,
marked just one of several developments that kept the two
nuclear-armed adversaries disturbingly close to armed conflict.</TE>
<TE>   As part of international efforts to defuse the crisis and avert
war, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage is due to
arrive here today for urgent meetings with Pakistani leaders before
departing for talks in New Delhi with Indian officials.</TE>
<TE>   Khan said the idea of joint patrols had been suggested previously
by New Delhi for areas along the India-Pakistan border outside
Kashmir, but it had failed because of differences over how the
patrols should be conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials also questioned Vajpayee's sincerity for
airing the suggestion before approaching them with the idea through
diplomatic channels.</TE>
<TE>   "If India was serious about this, why float it through the press
first?" Khan asked.</TE>
<TE>   Vajpayee offered the idea at a news conference after the final
session of an Asian security summit in Almaty, the former capital of
Kazakhstan. The initiative came after India had repeatedly turned
down Pakistan's call for international monitors on grounds that
Kashmir was an issue involving only the two nations.</TE>
<TE>   Although Vajpayee and Musharraf attended the Almaty gathering of
16 Asian leaders, efforts by Russian President Vladimir V. Putin to
bring them together for a face-to-face meeting failed. Instead, the
two spent much of their time painfully avoiding even eye contact.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, President Bush spoke by telephone with Vajpayee and
Musharraf, urging them in separate calls to take steps to reduce the
risk of war.</TE>
<TE>   "The president reiterated to President Musharraf that the United
States expects Pakistan to live up to the commitment Pakistan has
made to end all support for terrorism," White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer said.</TE>
<TE>   In the call to the Indian leader, Fleischer said, Bush emphasized
"the need for India to respond with de-escalatory steps."</TE>
<TE>   In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, the government on Wednesday
ordered the expulsion of a low-level Indian diplomat five days after
he was allegedly observed receiving sensitive documents from a
Pakistani national.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities in the Pakistani-held portion of Kashmir said Indian
artillery shelling across the Line of Control was less intense than
on Tuesday. Two Pakistanis were killed and nine others wounded near
the town of Chikothi, a few miles from the frontier. Officials in the
Indian-held city of Jammu reported intermittent firing into the
predawn hours Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Indian officials also said that their forces operating in
Indian-ruled territory about 150 miles northwest of Jammu killed six
suspected militants allegedly belonging to the Pakistan-based Islamic
extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba.</TE>
<TE>   The crisis that has brought India and Pakistan close to war was
triggered by a series of attacks in India by armed Muslim extremists.
India says that the incursions have been carried out by militants who
trained in Pakistani camps and crossed into India-controlled
territory with the help of Pakistani armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf counters that such infiltration from Pakistan was
stopped in the aftermath of an armed assault in December on India's
Parliament in New Delhi, which left 14 people dead, including five
gunmen. He and other Pakistani officials argue that the recent
terrorist attacks were carried out by local pro-independence
Kashmiris trying to loosen New Delhi's grip on their land.</TE>
<TE>   Armed conflict between the two nations seemed perilously close
last month after an attack on an Indian military facility in Jammu
left 34 dead.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking in the Indian city of Bangalore on Wednesday, Defense
Minister George Fernandes said that there had been little change in
the level of infiltration of militants from Pakistan into
Indian-controlled Kashmir in recent weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever information so far coming [in] doesn't indicate there
has been any substantial or noticeable reduction in infiltration,"
Fernandes told a group of reporters.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1 million troops from the two nations have been massed
for weeks along the border, many of them on the 460-mile-long Line of
Control. Both powers claim the mountainous Kashmir region, which has
been the focal point of two of their three wars in the last 55 years.
There are growing worries that a fourth war between them could be the
world's first in which both sides use nuclear arms. Despite
Wednesday's setbacks, some diplomats and other political observers
said they believed the prospects of war had diminished in recent
days. They pointed to assurances given in Almaty by both leaders
pledging to resolve their problems peacefully.</TE>
<TE>   The diplomats also noted that sustained diplomatic pressure from
the United States, Europe, China and Russia in recent days was
helping nudge the two countries away from armed conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf, at least, appeared to agree. "The tension has not
ended, but it's been reduced," he said after returning to Pakistan
early Wednesday. "With forces still massed on the borders, the danger
is not over."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer James Gerstenzang in Washington contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>On a Quiet Israel Road, a Bus Ride Ends in Carnage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN K. STACK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEGIDDO, Israel</DL>
<LD>MEGIDDO, Israel -- Mickey Harel drove the same road Wednesday that he
always drives through these piney hills. And just like any other
dawn, the soldiers he picked up at daybreak dozed and daydreamed in
the back of the crowded bus.</LD>
<LD>   The driver knew the Israeli soldiers, their faces and their
schedules, where they climbed aboard and where they hopped down.
"They were wonderful," he said. The young people in their smart
khakis reminded him of his sons, and of his younger days fighting in
the 1967 Middle East War.</LD>
<LD>   Harel felt the bomb before he heard it, as if some great hand had
given the bus a hard shove from behind. He knew what it meant--it
wasn't his first brush with suicide bombings. This time, a
Palestinian teenager had roared up in a stolen vehicle packed with
homemade explosives, pulled alongside the bus' gasoline tank and
blown himself up.</LD>
<TE>   The Wednesday morning blast on a northern Israel roadway was the
deadliest attack since March: 17 passengers were killed, and more
than 30 hospitalized. Most of the commuters were young soldiers, in
their late teens and early 20s, on their way to the military bases
sprinkled throughout this predominantly Arab farmland. They burned to
death at a crossroads whose name is Hebrew for Armageddon.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza City, the radical group Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility for the attack on the "Zionist bus." According to a
statement by group leader Sheik Abdullah Shami, the bombing was meant
to mark the 35th anniversary of the Middle East War, in which Israel
seized the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights and East Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   "We say to the enemy, we will continue to destroy the protective
shield [that Israeli Prime Minister Ariel] Sharon talks about," the
statement said. "They will never enjoy security as long as occupation
exists in our land."</TE>
<TE>   The bomber, 17-year-old Hamza Samudi, drove here from the nearby
West Bank city of Jenin, according to Islamic Jihad. By midday,
dozens of Israeli tanks had rolled into Jenin. Early today, tanks
rumbled to the headquarters of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah and unleashed a torrent of
shells and gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat had earlier condemned the Megiddo attack and declared that
his Palestinian Authority "has no link to and no information about,
nor does its security apparatus have ties or information" about the
explosion.</TE>
<TE>   It is apricot season here in Megiddo, a land whose honeyed light,
cool winds and watermelon fields belie its turbulent politics.</TE>
<TE>   A short drive to the south, the hills of Israel give way to the
hills of the West Bank. This quiet countryside has been the backdrop
for a string of suicide bombings and shootings.</TE>
<TE>   Harel has witnessed explosions before, involving two of his fellow
drivers' buses. Another time, he watched as a radical Palestinian
disguised as a soldier pulled a gun, opened fire and mowed down four
passengers at a bus station. Other drivers teased him about his
brushes with death. "You have an attraction to it," they said.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept getting through it," Harel said. "But this time.... "</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's blast was strong enough to lift his bus off the
pavement and make a gas station a mile up the road shudder. Charred
chunks of steel sailed far and wide into flowered slopes. This
stretch of road runs in front of a military prison with a large
population of Palestinian inmates. When the prisoners heard the
blast, they broke out into cheers, guards said.</TE>
<TE>   Steel siding from the blasted bus was tangled in the barbed wire
on the outskirts of the prison yard.</TE>
<TE>   After the bomb exploded inside Samudi's vehicle, the gas tank of
the bus followed suit. The bus skidded to one side, then the other,
flipped, then grated along the road. Harel grabbed at the wheel, but
it was useless. By the time the vehicle came to rest, there was fire
everywhere, roaring and strong.</TE>
<TE>   "It lit up instantly," a prison guard named Andre told Army Radio.
"People were escaping like ants."</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers kicked open the doors, leaped through shattered windows,
rolled and stomped to squelch the flames.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how I got up--I just got up and walked," said Meital
Mordechai, an 18-year-old soldier whose right eye was badly burned in
the blast.</TE>
<TE>   In the front of the bus, Harel jumped out a broken window. There
was smoky pandemonium all over the scorched roadway--bleeding
soldiers gaped, too shocked to move. "I did what I could," the driver
said. "I dragged them to the side of the road." Those who weren't
quick enough died in the flaming bus. Witnesses described a couple
who embraced as they burned to death.</TE>
<TE>   Mordechai switched bus lines months back, after a suicide bomber
struck the route she used to ride to work. Like many Israelis, she
lives under the vague logic that lightning can--and probably
will--strike twice in the same place. Everything is safe, until, one
day, it isn't. On Wednesday morning, Mordechai awoke in her parents'
house, showered and headed into the sunny morning for the bus stop.
She missed the first bus, so she waited around for another one to
rumble up the road from Tel Aviv. Hours later, spread flat on a
hospital cot with a patch over her eye, she explained the logical
remedy. "Now I won't take this bus anymore," she said.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAO PAULO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>Sergio Bezerra sat on the sidewalk a defeated man, the prisoner of
two young gangsters who were letting him take a breather after
keeping him locked for hours inside the trunk of a car.</LD>
<LD>   The sun rose and the neighborhood around him stirred awake. His
kidnappers told him to keep his eyes trained on the ground, but
Bezerra could hear footsteps going past, the men and women of the
slum, or favela, heading to work.</LD>
<LD>   "Good morning," they called out, "bom dia," as if it were a normal
thing to see a business executive in suit and tie in their favela,
being held at gunpoint. Dozens of people walked past. No one was
brave enough to call police.</LD>
<TE>   Bezerra isn't angry with the people of the favela. He understands
the fear that kept them from helping him. He understands, too, that
kidnapping has become something almost normal in Sao Paulo, as much a
part of the fabric of life in favelas as it is in the high-society
gatherings where people exchange kidnapping horror stories.</TE>
<TE>   "You get together with friends at social events and people say,
'Such and such just married off his daughter, and such and such is
kidnapped, and such and such just paid a big ransom,' " said Bezerra,
a 42-year-old banker. "We live in golden cages, surrounded by
bodyguards, wondering if the kidnappers are watching us."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 240 men, women and children were kidnapped in Sao Paulo
state, which surrounds South America's largest city and is the
epicenter of a kidnapping epidemic that has seen outbreaks in other
Latin American cities, including Buenos Aires and Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   A regionwide economic crisis--which has increased the ranks of the
unemployed and hit hard at police budgets--appears to be feeding the
crime wave. In greater Buenos Aires, home to 11 million residents,
one person is kidnapped every 36 hours, according to a study by the
daily Argentine newspaper Clarin. Most are released unharmed after a
few hours, the victims of what are known as "express kidnappings."</TE>
<TE>   In Sao Paulo, kidnapping prevention has become de rigueur for the
city's elite. Private citizens employ 3,500 bodyguards. About 15,000
bulletproof vehicles transport executives, politicians and family
members around the city.</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra had no bodyguards or armored sport-utility vehicle when he
fell into the hands of a large kidnapping band, a group of at least a
dozen criminals operating with the ruthlessness and secrecy of an Al
Qaeda terrorist cell.</TE>
<TE>   For 11 days, he was an object with a value, his price set by Sao
Paulo's kidnapping market. Fear, family love and the duration of the
kidnapping were all part of the final business equation that
determined his ransom, which his brother paid in daylight on a Sao
Paulo street corner to more than a dozen criminals armed with
submachine guns.</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra, a divorced father of two, is an executive at Bicbanco, a
regional bank owned by his family that posted $11 million in profits
last year. He is a shy, unassuming man with long eyelashes and a
tall, lanky physique and didn't think of himself as a target. "I
lived a very quiet life," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He was driving home, after a busy Wednesday with clients, when
three men in police uniforms ordered him to pull over on a crowded
avenue. It was the beginning of a surreal journey into a nether world
of cruelty, violence and absurdity.</TE>
<TE>   One day, a blindfolded Bezerra would overhear the mother of one of
his captors arguing with the teenager: "When your father gets home,
I'm going to tell him what you're doing!"</TE>
<TE>   After a few days, Bezerra came to understand the businesslike
logic behind even the more demented aspects of his kidnapping. For
example, only once did his captors threaten to kill him--just before
they put him on the phone with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   They cocked a gun to his head. "They wanted me to sound completely
destroyed," he said. The fear in Bezerra's voice when he talked
helped drive up the price of his ransom. Once he got off the phone,
they left him alone, blindfolded on a lumpy mattress, where he would
spend up to 20 hours at a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Bezerra's kidnapping was an ordinary one by Sao Paulo
standards, garnering no headlines during his captivity and a single
magazine interview after his release. A handful of the city's most
prominent kidnapping victims have paid ransoms reaching $1 million.
Bezerra's likely was a fraction of that amount. For reasons of
personal safety, he declines to say how much.</TE>
<TE>   According to police, an increasing number of Sao Paulo's
kidnapping victims are middle-class residents who pay $15,000 to be
freed. During a recent typical day, eight people were being held by
kidnapping gangs: four men, three women and a 15-year-old boy.</TE>
<TE>   "Eight are not so many when you stop to consider that there are
almost 40 million people in the state of Sao Paulo," said Saulo de
Castro Abreu, the region's secretary of public security. "This is a
problem we are beginning to get under control."</TE>
<TE>   De Castro was appointed in January, with a mandate to get tough on
kidnappers after the notorious two-month abduction of a prominent
advertising executive last year. De Castro has since broken up
several kidnapping bands, including one led by a pint-sized criminal
whose band, or quadrilha, often pulled off two or three abductions in
a day.</TE>
<TE>   "They started robbing freight trucks and banks," De Castro said of
the kidnapping gang. "But when that dried up" because of increased
security measures, "they started taking people."</TE>
<TE>   The criminal bands have their origins in the political abductions
of the 1960s in Brazil, Argentina and other Latin American countries.
Since then, kidnapping has been a crime fad, coming into fashion
every decade or so, dying out in the face of police crackdowns, then
reappearing.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, kidnapping has once again reached the peak levels of
the 1990s, with 200 to 300 cases reported in the last 12 months. (The
exact number is uncertain because many people refuse to contact the
authorities.) The victims include high-ranking police officers and
the relatives of soccer stars and movie actors.</TE>
<TE>   In Sao Paulo, kidnapping came back into vogue two years ago. Only
19 people were kidnapped in the state in 1999. A year later, the
figure had jumped to 267. The criminals had learned that taking
humans hostage was infinitely safer than robbing banks--and, when
done right, it could be just as profitable.</TE>
<TE>   "The most organized bands will operate with 10 to 20 people," said
Jose Jacobsen Neto, president of the association of private security
companies in Sao Paulo. The abductors operate in cells, dividing the
work into separate tasks: One group researches potential victims;
another pulls off the capture; others hold the victim and collect the
ransom.</TE>
<TE>   "The different units will communicate with each other on cell
phones or on the Internet," Jacobsen said. "One unit doesn't know
who's in the other. So if one is captured, the others will be safe."</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra's abductors operated that way. The head of the kidnapping
band was an educated, well-spoken man. Separate teams abducted and
released him. The tedious work of guarding him fell to teenage
criminals, most of whom had never met before. Bezerra spent hours
listening to them get acquainted, trying to outdo one another with
stories about their exploits as "bandidos."</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra was following his usual route home in November when he was
abducted during the bright late afternoon of a Southern Hemisphere
spring. The three "police officers" who pulled him over were part of
a band of kidnappers, although Bezerra didn't realize that at first.</TE>
<TE>   "We're arresting you for receiving stolen automobiles," one of the
men said. Something didn't seem right about the three, Bezerra
thought, but because they were pointing guns, he didn't have any
choice but to obey as they handcuffed him and led him to their car.</TE>
<TE>   They ordered him into the trunk, forcing him to bend his 5-foot-11
frame into the smallish space. "If I had known this guy was so big,"
one kidnapper said, "I would have gotten a bigger car."</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra spent an hour inside the trunk as they drove back and
forth across Sao Paulo's notoriously traffic-clogged streets.
Finally, the car stopped. The kidnappers took Bezerra's cell phone
and called his brother.</TE>
<TE>   The brother contacted the police. From that moment on, the Bezerra
family's actions would be guided by police negotiation experts. The
family filed no formal complaint--and told employees at Bezerra's
bank that he had taken a vacation--so that the story of the
kidnapping wouldn't appear in the media. News coverage drives up
ransom demands.</TE>
<TE>   The police offered another, odd piece of advice: "Don't pay right
away. Wait a few days." Why? the family asked. "Because if the
kidnappers see that you pay $100,000 in two days, they'll think you
can pay $200,000 in four days and will ask for more."</TE>
<TE>   Any rescue by the understaffed Sao Paulo police was out of the
question. "It's either pay or die," Bezerra remarked later.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers took him to a small basement room in a cinder-block
favela home, where the only furniture was an old bed with a dirty,
frayed mattress. He spent three days there, often blindfolded,
guarded by groups of young men.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who are guarding you are adolescents; they are 18, 19
years old at most," Bezerra said. "They have a desire to prove to
themselves, and to the people that hire them, that they can kill."</TE>
<TE>   One of his young captors told him, in chillingly direct language,
"Look, if I get to kill you, it's good for me, it's good for my
reputation."</TE>
<TE>   On the third day, Bezerra heard the leader's voice again,
instantly recognizable because he spoke a more articulate, educated
Portuguese than his underlings.</TE>
<TE>   The leader wanted to talk about Bezerra's ransom. He knew that his
captive had a medical degree and addressed him as "doctor," although
Bezerra had long ago given up any notion of being a physician. The
kidnappers also knew facts about his family life, work habits and the
financial details of his small bank.</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra estimates that it must have taken them a month to gather
so much information. But there was one thing they didn't know, and
Bezerra thought that it might work as ransom-reducing leverage. "You
got the wrong guy," he said. "I'm not even a real member of the
family. I'm adopted."</TE>
<TE>   The kidnapping leader mentioned this the next time he talked with
Bezerra's brother. By now, the brother had learned from the police to
play it cool: "You're right, he's not my real brother.... So listen,
call me back in 30 minutes," he told the kidnappers. "I'm on my way
to work now, and I can't talk."</TE>
<TE>   The leader started to query Bezerra about his finances. The money
in his checking account wasn't enough. The problem, Bezerra said, was
that most of his assets were tied up in real estate that was hard to
sell because of Brazil's economic crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, yes, I know," the kidnapper said, sounding a rare note of
empathy. "I've invested in real estate too."</TE>
<TE>   Later, the young underlings put him in the trunk of another car
and took him far away from Sao Paulo. He spent seven days in a
windowless room from which he could hear cows mooing.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to send you back by mail," one of his captors
announced finally. They began an execution ritual that involved
driving him to another location and clicking a gun near his head.
Then they stopped. "We're going to give you one more chance," one of
the captors said.</TE>
<TE>   They put him on the phone with his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to die five minutes earlier," Bezerra recalled. "I
wasn't in any condition to speak."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he managed to sputter: "They're going to kill me. Give
them what they want."</TE>
<TE>   On the 10th day of Bezerra's ordeal, his brother made the payment
in a Sao Paulo neighborhood, facing 16 men with machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, the kidnappers turned friendly and chatty.</TE>
<TE>   "You know why we did this, right?" one asked. They launched into a
series of explanations about needing money. That evening, they put
him back in the car; when it stopped, they told him to stand up and
walk straight ahead and not look back.</TE>
<TE>   When the car had driven away, Bezerra took off his blindfold and
found himself on a darkened road. He was free. But before he had much
time to think about precisely where he was, he heard a motorcycle
approaching. The sputtering engine sounded familiar--it belonged to
one of his kidnappers.</TE>
<TE>   He had become the target of a "kidnapping within a kidnapping."
Some kidnapping bands are so large that one group splits off and
tries to snatch the victim right after he's released, to collect a
second ransom.</TE>
<TE>   Bezerra hid in a ditch near the darkened roadside. Finally, the
kidnappers left. But he still had one last indignity to suffer. A
pack of dogs chased him. He climbed up a utility pole to get away
from the animals, staying there until daylight, when it was safe to
come down and try to find his way home.</TE>
<TE>   When he reached a taxi stand in a nearby town, one driver turned
away. After 11 days in captivity, Bezerra looked like a wandering
ghost, unshaven, wild-eyed and shallow-faced. He finally got home
that evening.</TE>
<TE>   His former wife had told their two daughters that he had been on a
business trip to Japan. But as soon as the girls saw their gaunt
father, they knew that it was a lie. Everyone in the family is
guarded now, 24 hours a day.</TE>
<TE>   Since his ordeal, Bezerra has spent a lot of time thinking. He
holds little rancor toward his kidnappers and even feels a bit of
pity for them. "These people won't have long lives," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From behind the bulletproof windows of his car and the security
doors at his apartment, Bezerra sees people who have never been
kidnapped go about their lives the way he once did. They window-shop;
they take long walks at night. "Are they crazy?" he thinks. "Don't
they know?"</TE>

<HD>Ex-Rebel Leader's Sanity Questioned</HD>
<DH>Sierra Leone: On trial for murder, Foday Sankoh appears
incoherent and defiant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone</DL>
<LD>His hair and beard in unkempt white dreadlocks, Sierra Leone's once
mighty and feared rebel leader appears today to hover on the verge of
madness--but insists he's still at the pinnacle of power.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a god," the handcuffed former warlord, Foday Sankoh, said
Wednesday at the Freetown high court where he's standing trial for
murder. "I'm the inner god. I'm the leader of Sierra Leone."</LD>
<LD>   Sankoh is being tried along with 49 other rebels of his
Revolutionary United Front for the deaths of nearly two dozen peace
demonstrators in a shooting outside his home here in the capital on
May 8, 2000. Together they face 70 counts, including murder,
conspiracy to murder and shooting with intent to kill.</LD>
<TE>   Wednesday's proceedings were adjourned until July 10 to give
prosecutors time to prepare indictments. If convicted, Sankoh could
face the death penalty, Judge Patrick Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   Sankoh denied all charges during preliminary questioning in a
lower court but has not entered a formal plea.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say Sankoh is fit to stand trial.</TE>
<TE>   Sankoh, however, when asked repeatedly by journalists who his
lawyer was, first said he couldn't understand the question, then said
he didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   Frail-looking in a pale yellow African robe, the former rebel
chief climbed slowly up the courtroom steps gripping a handrail for
support, surrounded by a dozen unarmed policemen.</TE>
<TE>   As Sankoh was leaving, his daughter, Mbalu, trailed him, saying
tearfully, "It's me, Daddy. It's me." Appearing puzzled, Sankoh
replied simply, "Oh."</TE>
<TE>   Then, after a pause, he kissed her extended hand and smiled.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, he was medically examined--physically and
psychologically--at the request of his lawyer, Edo Okanya.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors prescribed only drugs for high blood pressure and other
minor ailments, Okanya said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sankoh appears incoherent at times, at others he seemed
lucid.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he thought of the current trial, he said: "Oh, these
are just old games."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>KATMANDU, Nepal--Wrapping up his first year on the throne he assumed
after Nepal's royal family was massacred, King Gyanendra called for
unity as Nepal's military battles Maoist insurgents.</LD>
<LD>   "We should have the attitude of doing something for peace,
development and good governance and take pride in being Nepalese and
remaining Nepalese," the king said in an interview published
Wednesday by the state news agency.</LD>
<LD>   Today marks Gyanendra's first anniversary as the nation's mostly
ceremonial monarch, and there was no indication he would lift the
emergency rule that has suspended civil liberties as the government
seeks to crush the revolt.</LD>
<TE>   Gyanendra's brother, the beloved King Birendra, was killed by
Crown Prince Dipendra on June 1, 2001. The massacre left 10 members
of the royal household dead, including Dipendra, who ended the palace
blood bath by turning a gun on himself.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Target Arafat Offices</HD>
<DH>Mideast: It is unclear if the troops are trying to capture
the Palestinian leader. Military action comes after a bus bombing
kills soldiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON and MAHER ABUKHATER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli tanks blasted their way into the headquarters compound of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat early today, hours after a suicide
bomber in a car killed 17 Israelis on a crowded bus.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli forces pounded buildings in the complex and fought with
Palestinian guards but did not immediately move to capture Arafat,
whom the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon blames for
Wednesday's bombing, the deadliest in more than two months. After a
devastating suicide bombing in March, Israeli tanks and troops laid
siege to Arafat's Ramallah compound for 34 days.</LD>
<LD>   Flashes of light illuminated the dark sky over this West Bank
city, and huge explosions--as many as 20 in one half-hour
period--echoed as tanks pounded the complex with shells and heavy
machine-gun fire. A Palestinian official, speaking by telephone from
one building, said that 20 tanks had penetrated the outer walls of
the block-long complex and that there was considerable damage.</LD>
<TE>   Daylight revealed scenes of destruction. The national security and
police intelligence buildings within the compound were flattened.
Huge chunks of concrete, pieces of lumber and metal bars littered the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat retreated to an underground bunker and was safe, said the
Palestinian official, Deputy Gov. Saeb Nassar. The Palestinian
Authority president's guards returned fire sporadically. According to
reports, at least six guards were wounded and one intelligence
officer was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We are prepared for anything," Nassar said.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokeswoman said troops and armor were surrounding
the complex and were engaged in "heavy exchanges of fire." She later
said some Israeli troops were withdrawing.</TE>
<TE>   Six hours after the operation began, the troops pulled out of the
compound.</TE>
<TE>   Furious Israeli payback had been expected after Wednesday's
suicide bombing during the morning rush hour near Megiddo in northern
Israel. The attack killed 17 Israelis. Most were young soldiers--male
and female, in their late teens and early 20s--on their way to duty
at a string of military bases.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian drove a stolen car laden with explosives to the rear
of a crowded inter-city bus, detonating the bomb and engulfing the
bus in a massive fireball.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the attack, Sharon delayed a scheduled departure
for the United States until Saturday, calling off appearances in New
York. He plans to meet with President Bush on Monday as the United
States tries to revive peace talks.</TE>
<TE>   The bus exploded hours after CIA Director George J. Tenet met with
Arafat to discuss the Palestinian administration's failure to control
the recent run of militant attacks on Israel. News reports said Tenet
had warned Arafat that another bombing would unleash an Israeli fury
that Washington would not halt.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad, a radical Palestinian organization, claimed
responsibility for the Megiddo attack. Arafat's Palestinian Authority
condemned the bombing and denied having any link to it or having any
prior knowledge of it.</TE>
<TE>   But Israel held Arafat exclusively responsible.</TE>
<TE>   In a heated emergency Cabinet meeting, several Israeli ministers
demanded that Arafat be expelled--an option that has been on the
table for some time but avoided because of the likely repercussions
both here and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   "The time has come ... to dismantle the Palestinian Authority and
get Arafat out of here," Public Security Minister Uzi Landau said.</TE>
<TE>   More moderate ministers argued that removing Arafat will not
squelch terrorism. Israel has been pursuing a strategy of daily raids
into Palestinian cities and towns with the stated purpose of rounding
up potential militants and dismantling bomb-making factories.</TE>
<TE>   But Israeli officials say death tolls are likely to climb in
coming months as Palestinian militants attempt "mega-attacks" against
Israel. Militants have been varying their tactics in the pursuit of a
bigger bang and higher death toll, especially as Israeli forces
tighten their grip on most Palestinian towns and cities.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian who killed 29 people in a hotel bombing at a
Passover Seder in late March, for example, planned to use lethal
cyanide gas but botched its release, army and intelligence officials
revealed this week.</TE>
<TE>   It was the Passover carnage that provoked Israel to launch a
five-week assault on Palestinian towns and cities in the West Bank.
The prolonged crackdown was meant to shatter the infrastructure of
violent militants, but the attacks against Israel have continued and
appear to be worsening.</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday's attack in Megiddo was unusual: The assailant used a
moving vehicle to attack a moving target. It was the first such
attack in the last 20 months of bloodshed, in which more than 1,800
people have been killed. And the use of a vehicle allowed him to pack
a far more lethal amount of explosives into his weapon than would be
possible with the more common belt or satchel worn by suicide bombers
on foot.</TE>
<TE>   Islamic Jihad said the Megiddo attacker hailed from the West Bank
city of Jenin.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the Ramallah compound, Arafat is believed to be accompanied
by about 200 guards and associates. Nassar, the official, said tank
shells had struck the building in which Arafat was holed up, damaging
a bridge that connects two parts of the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli armored bulldozers then shoved mounds of dirt and crumpled
cars against the doors leading to Arafat's headquarters, witnesses
said, blocking the main entrance.</TE>
<TE>   In their siege that began in late March, Israeli troops invaded
several of the outer buildings, ransacked offices, seized documents
and destroyed equipment and cars. Some of the damage had only
recently been repaired.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers were careful then not to hurt Arafat. The tanks and
troops withdrew May 1 after a deal whereby six Palestinian men wanted
by Israel who were confined in the compound with Arafat were
transferred to a jail in Jericho under U.S. and British supervision.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the White House condemned the suicide attack and
said it raised questions anew about Arafat's relevance to the Middle
East peace process.</TE>
<TE>   "In the president's eyes, Yasser Arafat has never played a role of
someone who can be trusted or effective," White House Press Secretary
Ari Fleischer said. Later, White House officials said they had
learned of the new operations inside Ramallah and were looking into
the situation.</TE>

<DH>South Korea: Suwon, a World Cup host city, has spent $4
million to fix up its public toilets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SUWON, South Korea</DL>
<LD>As the tourists crowd in for a better look, Lee Pil Ung opens one of
the stalls of the ladies' room and, speaking through a hand-held
microphone, extols the virtues of the toilet.</LD>
<LD>   He demonstrates the plastic wrap that revolves to supply a fresh
toilet-seat cover for every user. Then, closing the door to the
stall, he points to the loudspeakers piping in chamber music and to a
rack of reading material that this city supplies in its public
restrooms.</LD>
<LD>   "This is not just a toilet," says Lee, a volunteer tour guide who
works for the city. "This is a space for culture, a space for music."</LD>
<TE>   When South Korea was selected in 1996 to co-sponsor soccer's 2002
World Cup with Japan, officials began discussing what needed to be
done to improve the infrastructure. At one session, one official
embarrassed Suwon's mayor by asking if he had ever dared to step
inside the public toilet in the park downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, the mayor, Shim Jae Duck, visited the park restroom.
He was so horrified by its squalid condition that he declared a war
on filthy toilets.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a $4-million toilet-improvement campaign that has
succeeded beyond anybody's wildest imagination. The public toilets
have become Suwon's claim to fame, although the city (population: 1
million) on the outskirts of Seoul also boasts an 18th century
fortress and the best barbecue ribs in the South, and is one of 10
World Cup cities in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Suwon might be the only city in the world (if not, certainly one
of the few) that runs guided tours of its loos and has huge
advertisements on its buses touting the toilets. ("Enjoy the World
Heritage Fortress and Beautiful Restroom Tour," reads the blurb on
the green-and-white tour buses.)</TE>
<TE>   The city also publishes a map and special guide to its
toilets--which even have their own names. "The theme for this toilet
complex is the harmonious joining of nature and mankind," reads the
description for a restroom called the Firefly, a name picked because,
according to city officials, fireflies live only in clean
environments.</TE>
<TE>   The newest restrooms, not surprisingly, are in domes that look
like giant soccer balls on the grounds of the World Cup stadium where
the U.S. team played its first match Wednesday against Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   "I had heard there were beautiful toilets in Suwon, but I didn't
believe it until I saw it with my own eyes," said Chu Ho, a
17-year-old South Korean tourist who was photographing the
soccer-ball toilets for a high school project over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   In the finest tradition of vernacular architecture, others are
shaped like castles, towers and mountains, and one looks like
traditional Korean pottery. Huge windows above some urinals offer
panoramic views of the city. The complexes boast accoutrements rarely
seen in public restrooms--bidets and child potties, among them--and
touches such as music, skylights and art on the walls.</TE>
<TE>   Some special features might be unfamiliar to Western tourists,
such as the "etiquette bell"--when pressed, it makes a sound like
running water to cover up any embarrassing sounds emanating from the
stall.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of Suwon's bathrooms have wheelchair-accessible
toilets, which used to be quite a rarity in South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, until recently, public toilets were a rarity. The few
that existed were little more than porcelain troughs in the ground
for squatting, and they were notoriously foul-smelling.</TE>
<TE>   The very idea that a toilet could be something to be proud of was
a novelty. The lowly position occupied by the toilet in Korean
culture was typified by a popular saying: Toilets are like
mothers-in-law--the farther from home, the better.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't merely the coming of the World Cup games but the
co-hosting arrangement with Japan that inspired Koreans to invest in
their toilets. They worried that their infrastructure would look
especially shabby next to that of their larger, richer neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "This began with an inferiority complex toward Japan,"
acknowledged Shim, Suwon's mayor. "But now Suwon is the leader in the
culture of toilets. We are showing the rest of the world the toilet
of the future.</TE>
<TE>   "Rome or New York or Los Angeles might have clean public toilets,
but we are trying to do something more. We want to make the toilet a
place of culture."</TE>
<TE>   Besides building state-of-the-art public toilets, Suwon has
introduced regular competitions among restaurants for the cleanest
restrooms. The city occasionally has concerts at the larger public
toilets.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor's high-minded ideas about toilets have spread to Seoul,
where city officials also spent $4 million last year building new
toilets in advance of the World Cup. The capital also sponsors an
organization called Citizens Alliance for Toilet Culture, which
organizes rallies in support of clean toilets and runs a Web site on
public toilets.</TE>
<TE>   To Shim's immense satisfaction, he was invited to Japan last year
to lecture about toilets. More kudos for Suwon's toilets should be
forthcoming this fall, when the World Toilet Organization, a group
dedicated to raising public toilet standards, holds its annual
convention in South Korea. (The convention itself will be 20 miles
away in Seoul because of its better hotels, but Suwon will be the
major excursion of the meeting.)</TE>
<TE>   In Suwon, some residents complain that too much money was
squandered on the toilets and that the city shouldn't have bothered
with expensive features. "The first time I saw this bidet, I didn't
even know what it was for," schoolteacher Kim Kyun Yang said.</TE>
<TE>   Chung Sung Kyu, a contractor who has been building a new
mountaintop restroom with stunning views of the city, said residents
shouldn't discount the psychological boost of using such lovely
bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes you happy," he said. "The whole day will be pleasant
afterward."</TE>

<HD>Web's Film, Music Pirates Sail Free From Copyrights</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the Middle East to the South Pacific, renegade online movie and
music services are setting up shop in far-off lands to dodge
international copyright rules.</LD>
<LD>   The maneuvering complicates efforts by Hollywood studios, record
labels and other copyright holders to clamp down on online piracy,
which is eating into profits and threatening the entertainment
industry's way of doing business.</LD>
<LD>   Although the unauthorized movie and music sites don't match the
quality of DVDs and CDs, they offer goods at rock-bottom prices and
beat their authorized competitors to the market.</LD>
<TE>   Film88.com, for example, is a video-on-demand service that shows
hit movies such as "Ali" and "American Pie 2" over the Internet for
$1 apiece--from computers in Iran. The company put its computerized
library of 1,500 films there, a representative said in an e-mail,
because "Iran does not provide protection to foreign copyright."</TE>
<TE>   Film88.com's backers may be the first alleged pirates to seek a
safe harbor within the "Axis of Evil"--President Bush's moniker for
Iran and five other so-called rogue states. But plenty of others have
launched services offshore since the entertainment industry turned up
the heat on Internet pirates.</TE>
<TE>   The list includes several of the most popular online file-sharing
sites, which let users copy music, movies and software freely from
one another's computers. The Kazaa file-sharing software--which has
been downloaded more than 86 million times--is distributed by a
company based in the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu. Similar
networks outside the United States are Grokster, based in Nevis in
the West Indies; Blubster in Spain; and IMesh in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Movie and music companies are suing Kazaa and Grokster for
copyright infringement, with a preliminary ruling expected this year.
The music companies already have succeeded in shutting down
file-sharing service Napster Inc., a company in California.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the studios and the labels say they still have plenty
of legal weapons to bring to bear against offshore pirates, even if
they land in hostile territory. The problem, copyright experts say,
is in enforcing court orders and making sure an illegal operation
stays down after it is knocked offline.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one thing if they're in England or Europe or many parts of
Asia," one copyright attorney said. "But if they're in Iran or North
Korea, forget it. You're on your own."</TE>
<TE>   Film88.com makes watching a movie online as simple as clicking on
a Web page, although the picture quality is no better than that of a
beat-up videotape. The service offers more movies than its authorized
competitors, such as Culver City-based Intertainer, and it is months
ahead of the studios' own services.</TE>
<TE>   This year the technologists behind Film88.com launched a nearly
identical service, Movie88.com, using computers based in Taiwan. But
the Hollywood studios responded quickly, persuading Taiwanese
authorities to pull the plug on Movie88.com's Internet access.</TE>
<TE>   A representative of Film88.com insisted that his company is not a
band of pirates. In an unsigned e-mail, he likened his firm to a
David fighting an uphill battle with copyright Goliaths.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intention is to pay a percentage of the rental price to
copyright owners directly," the rep- resentative said, adding that
Film88.com's service represents "an additional market for the
copyright owners without affecting their conventional income (such as
box-office income)."</TE>
<TE>   The company still is calculating what a "fair percentage" would
be. But the Motion Picture Assn. isn't waiting.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that the site infringes the copyright of any MPA
member company, the MPA intends to take swift and immediate action to
stop the illegal activity," the studios' international trade group
said in a prepared statement.</TE>
<TE>   P.J. McNealy, an analyst with consulting firm GartnerG2, said the
unauthorized music and movie services started in the U.S., then moved
to Europe and Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect more in the Asia- Pacific [region], and parts like that
area of the Middle East" where Film88.com landed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 150 countries have signed the Bern Convention for the
Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, a treaty governing
copyright.</TE>
<TE>   That treaty sets minimum levels of copyright protection and
requires countries to provide the legal means to enforce those
rights, said Fritz Attaway, executive vice president and Washington
general counsel for the Motion Picture Assn. of America.</TE>
<TE>   The treaty doesn't spell out the enforcement measures, "so there's
great variances in the ease with which remedies can be exercised,"
Attaway said. The World Trade Organization provides trade remedies
against countries that fail to enforce copyrights, but the WTO
doesn't reach as many countries as the Bern Convention.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., the Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires
Internet service providers to respond quickly when their networks are
used to transmit pirated works. When the Internet company is
overseas, copyright owners have to ask U.S. service providers to
block traffic coming from those Internet addresses--a much trickier
task.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard because that kind of goes against what the Internet was
built to do," said Bruce Forest, a consultant on piracy and online
security. The Internet regards attempts to block traffic as a broken
link in the communication chain and responds by routing data around
the blockage, Forest said.</TE>
<TE>   One bright spot for copyright holders is that pirates need good
telecommunications networks. That's why they tend to situate at least
part of their operations in countries that have signed the
international copyright treaty.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the company that distributes the Kazaa software is
based in Vanuatu, but many of its operations are in Australia. It
distributes the software and sells advertising largely through U.S.
companies.</TE>
<TE>   So if a U.S. court rules that the company is infringing, copyright
holders have enforcement options that don't rely on the Vanuatu
government.</TE>

<HD>Higher Standards for Standardized Tests</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Value of Standardized Tests," editorial, May 31: In order to
generate the comparisons in student performance that you claim are
indispensable for judging educational quality, standardized
test-makers need to create differences among student scores. If
test-makers included only items measuring the most important content
emphasized by teachers, scores might be too similar, making
comparisons unsatisfactory.</LD>
<LD>   To engineer score spread, test-makers build into standardized
tests items assessing content that is highly unlikely to be taught in
class. As a result, when tests are impervious to instruction, the
results mislead the public. Arguing that standardized tests should
continue to be used until a better instrument is developed is like
arguing that antibiotics should be used to treat viral infections
until something better comes along. Standardized tests and
antibiotics are the wrong course of action in their respective cases.</LD>
<LD>   Walt Gardner</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for correctly pointing out that standardized testing is
an essential tool. California has made great strides over the past
three years in developing a system of measuring student achievement
and school improvement, one that will become even more informative
over the next few years. Prior to adoption of a statewide,
standardized test and a system of measuring improvement year to year,
parents and the public had no way of determining how well their
schools were performing compared with other schools nationally or to
schools with similar demographics.</TE>
<TE>   The Academic Performance Index now includes both a test based on
national norms, to let the public know how California students are
achieving compared with students in other states, and tests based on
our rigorous state standards for what students should know in every
grade. Both measurements provide important information and, when
combined with classroom assessments and evaluations, should help
schools and policymakers target instructional resources where they
are needed most.</TE>

<TE>   Education, Sacramento</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You write, "It is ... unfair to lower expectations for poor,
minority children." This isn't the point at all. We have higher
expectations of our educational system than what it is presently
providing for our children: We expect a well-rounded curriculum, with
an emphasis on critical thinking skills, instead of a narrow
curriculum, teaching to an unfair, culturally and racially biased
test.</TE>

<LD>I like Clifford Bob's idea for the next round of reality TV ("On
'Slum Survivor,' No One's a Winner," Commentary, June 3). But our
"Slum Survivor" production crew and contestants needn't go all the
way to a squalid Third World locale. Any ghetto in America would do
nicely.</LD>
<LD>   As with overpopulation in the developing world, too many
ill-prepared young people having babies in our own slums trap
generation after generation in hopeless poverty and despair.
Presuming he doesn't advocate forced birth control or sterilization,
and certain that a college professor couldn't be so naive as to think
that a massive redistribution of wealth would result in anything
other than increasing numbers of those unable to compete in
mainstream economies, I'd be curious to know what Bob prescribes as a
solution.</LD>

<LD>Yet another comment on big SUVs in small spaces (letter, May 25). I
don't see what all the fuss is about. If a big SUV is parked too
close to me, I can still manage to get into my beat-up old car. I
don't worry about one more dent ... at least not if it isn't on my

<HD>Dandelions: Be Careful What You Wish For</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Concern Grows in Weed War," June 1: Having just spent the past
hour pulling knotweed and digging dandelions from my lawn, I feel
obliged to comment on Emily Green's excellent article about lawn
chemicals. I have been tracking connections between 2, 4-D and human
and pet illnesses for many years and am pleased to see The Times give
this front-page coverage.</LD>
<LD>   This spring I have repeatedly seen a TV ad where some suburban
man, eyeing his neighbor's perfect lawn, says, "I hate dandelions!"
Now, I like a nice lawn as much as the next person, and I dig plenty
of dandelions out of my lawns, but hate? "Hate" seems a little strong
for dandelions. I wonder if the chemical companies haven't pulled a
fast one on us. They promote "complete" fertilizers, billed as "turf
builders." These contain ample amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus and
potassium, but here in California we can generally grow excellent
turf just using nitrogen fertilizers.</LD>
<LD>   Excessive phosphorus and potash encourages the growth of broadleaf
plants such as clovers and dandelions at the expense of the grasses.
Then they sell us some "weed and feed" laced with 2, 4-D, that
chemical kissing-cousin of Agent Orange, to kill off our "weeds."</LD>
<TE>   I long to see the day when the homeowner with a few dandelions and
daisies in her lawn is considered progressive. So, too, I eagerly
await the day when a front sidewalk littered with seeds from a
"messy" female tree (pollen-free) is likewise an indicator of the
owner's wisdom, sophistication and consideration for others.</TE>

<TE>   It never ceases to amaze me how so many would rather have a yard
full of poisoned plants and lifeless soil than see a few little
yellow and white flowers sprinkled across the lawn. Every time you or
your kids or your dog walks across that lawn, those poisons get
tracked onto your carpets. And the residue not tracked in washes off
into the nearest creek or gutter and flows to the ocean. We worry
about foreign terrorists but are capable of our own biological
warfare.</TE>

<TE>   You helped clear up a mystery I have pondered for many years. When
I was a kid, dandelions were delightful. I remember not only enjoying
the splashes of color around my neighborhood but, especially, blowing
away the seeds. I remember picking bouquets of dandelions to bring
home to my mother. Somehow, between then and now, dandelions became
an enemy. I never understood why. Now I do.</TE>

<LD>Re "U.S. Details Warming Threat but Defends Its Policy," June 4: In
the spring of 2001, when Enron and other Texas companies were raiding
billions from the people of California, the Bush White House had a
clear policy: Do nothing. Later that year, as reports poured in from
the FBI, the CIA and foreign law enforcement and intelligence
agencies of an imminent terrorist attack on the U.S., it advocated
the same policy. Now White House officials have finally stopped their
deceit and obfuscation about global warming, its primary causes and
its likely consequences.</LD>
<LD>   And the White House plan of action: Do nothing. Why are our
putative leaders so resolute about fanning the flames of violence
around the world and so cowardly and morally weak when it comes to
dealing with the real threats facing our people?</LD>

<HD>Mahony Ads Betray a Bunker Mentality</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mahony Ads Seek to Reassure Public," June 4: The cardinal's newly
hired public relations firm, Sitrick &amp; Co., seems to be taking the
church a few steps backward as it tries to protect Cardinal Roger
Mahony in the wake of a growing church scandal.</LD>
<LD>   It is disturbing to see Mahony, who only weeks ago was talking
honestly about the church's problems, react now as if every criticism
is part of a strategy to damage the church. In deploying this type of
spin, the cardinal has demonstrated an unhealthy bunker mentality.
Why in the world would the archdiocese hire Enron's PR firm?</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it is time the church leaders are held accountable for the
abuses they have furthered by their laxity in dealing with the
"problem." Is prosecution too much? As far as I can tell, they're
co-conspirators for knowing the problem existed and doing, in effect,
nothing except covering it up.</LD>
<TE>   Candice Weber</TE>
<TE>   Agoura</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mahony is looking for a benefactor to subsidize the cost (under
$50,000) of his ads [scheduled to run today] in three Los Angeles
newspapers. With crypts at the almost completed Taj Mahony projected
to sell for as much as $50,000 and the church sitting on untold and
untaxed wealth in the form of real estate, jewels and artworks,
surely the archdiocese can scrape up the cash to pay for these ads,
ads that will tell us that things are going to be different now.</TE>
<TE>   If change is coming, it is only because Mahony was exposed in his
cover-up of scandalous, pernicious behavior by some of his priests.
Now he is looking for someone else to foot the bill for his
save-the-church ad campaign.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Your May 30 editorial, "Holden's Outstretched Palm," and the May 26
article that prompted it, "Councilman Cleared Way for Koreatown
Nightspots," were inaccurate and misleading about me and my son,
Chris Holden. "Koreatown Firms Aid Chris Holden" (April 1, 1999) was
reprinted by my son's opponent in the race for mayor of Pasadena and
mailed out to the voters, which affected the outcome of the election.
For that reason, I am encouraging my son not to enter the upcoming
race in Pasadena. My family has already taken enough hits.</LD>
<LD>   The timing of your editorial is curious. It attempted to cast a
shadow on who might succeed me. Thus far I haven't made a choice.</LD>
<LD>   It is important for your readers to know that the state Board of
Alcoholic Beverage Control issues liquor licenses--not the city or
me. In Koreatown, if there are "twice as many liquor establishments
relative to population as called for in state guidelines," it
indicates a problem at the ABC board. Regarding campaign
contributions, where all this money was supposed to have changed
hands: My votes are not based on campaign contributions; check the
record.</LD>
<TE>   Finally, we live in a multicultural city, and it is the custom in
Korea to sell liquor by the bottle in restaurants. I am opposed to
this, but it has been approved by the ABC board. Why haven't you
questioned the number of liquor licenses in Hollywood or the proposed
downtown entertainment district? I am proud of what we have been able
to accomplish with the Korean community.</TE>

<LD>Jonathan Powers laments the military and political weakness in Europe
and the overriding power and influence of the United States in world
affairs (Commentary, June 3). Perhaps he should take off his
backward-looking rose-colored glasses and remember another side of
Europe. Does constant war in Europe, imperialism, anti-Semitism and
appeasement sound familiar?</LD>
<LD>   The latter two are once again emerging in that gloriously
"civilized" continent. While Europeans can take pride in many of
their contributions, they have inflicted untold pain on themselves
and others around the world. They have consistently refused to
acknowledge this, as Powers reminds us.</LD>

<TE>   Powers asserts that obtuse and bloodthirsty U.S. foreign policy is
contributing to the decline of Europe's political and cultural
influence over the rest of the world. And I always thought that a
century's worth of individual-rights-denying socialism and communism
was to blame for the Continent's waning global influence. Luckily for
mankind, the European left is as outmoded as the guillotine.</TE>

<HD>Massive Project in Irvine Gets OK</HD>
<DH>Land use: Irvine Co. will develop 3,600 acres near closed
base. With 12,350 homes, it'll be the size of San Juan Capistrano.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA BORGATTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A massive development near the closed El Toro Marine base won
unanimous approval early Wednesday from the Irvine City Council.</LD>
<LD>   Officials said the project will solidify Irvine's nationwide
reputation as a well-planned city, but it still took them seven hours
to reach a decision. Council members fielded a flurry of last-minute
questions and heard pleas to scale back the development, which at
completion will be about the size of San Juan Capistrano.</LD>
<LD>   Lingering concerns about traffic congestion, housing affordability
and loss of agricultural land resulted in heated exchanges in an
hours-long question-and-answer period during a marathon council
meeting that started at 4 p.m. Tuesday. The vote came shortly after
midnight as some Irvine Co. officials looked on and others nodded off
in their seats.</LD>
<TE>   The plan calls for 12,350 homes plus business and research space
on 3,600 acres that are now largely agricultural. The city has long
planned to annex the area to guarantee that its development fits
Irvine's village theme, with homes near schools, parks and shopping
centers.</TE>
<TE>   "We're striving to maintain the same standard of development that
has existed for the last 30 years," Mayor Larry Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   To address remaining traffic issues, the city ordered the
formation of a task force to begin working with Caltrans on potential
freeway expansions. The project is expected to generate about 255,000
vehicle trips a day</TE>
<TE>   The city and the Irvine Co. had already agreed to set aside money
for future improvements, clearing a hurdle that often hinders road
work. Still, some residents suggested holding off on a vote and urged
the council to reconsider the density of the development. The plan
allows for construction of about six units per acre, roughly the same
as Irvine's Westpark Village and fewer than Woodbridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish I had a nickel for every time a resident came to us
touting the quality of life in Woodbridge," Councilman Chris Mears
said.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the night, as the council neared a vote, a debate arose
between Agran and Councilman Greg Smith over wording in the plan that
suggests placing 1,800 low-income homes near businesses. Smith said
the homes should be dispersed throughout the residential areas. The
council decided to resolve that issue separately.</TE>

<LD>Homeowners in the rugged hills above Ojai are watching and
waiting--and hoping for the best.</LD>
<LD>   This is the fourth time 80-year-old Jerry Peterson has watched as
wildfires approached his red-tiled home. The worst was in 1985, when
a 125,000-acre blaze roared down the mountain, and Peterson used his
own fire hose and water tank to save his house.</LD>
<LD>   When your backyard is the Los Padres National Forest you learn to
be prepared, the retired builder said.</LD>
<TE>   "On a clear day, I can see Anacapa Island from my deck," Peterson
said of his home up a twisting private road, about 12 miles from the
front lines of the Wolf fire. "But the flip side is that when you've
got mountains all around you, fire is a constant threat."</TE>
<TE>   Vigilant but not yet worried, Ojai residents went about their
daily routines Wednesday as 1,700 firefighters battled a forest fire
that is out of control in the mountains north of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Now in its fifth day, residents are coping with a nearly constant
stream of ash that settles over cars, clothes and patios. Firetrucks
rumble through downtown and helicopters thump overhead.</TE>
<TE>   Though flames are hidden by high mountain ridges, each afternoon
the skies fill with huge plumes of smoke, casting a yellowish light.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this gloomy, eerie feeling that is unavoidable," said
Jenni Mack, a 28-year-old college student who stopped to chat with
friends at a local coffeehouse. "It's surreal."</TE>
<TE>   But longtime residents know it could be much worse.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1985 Wheeler fire, the flames came into the city, nearly
consuming Joy Grove's home. Firefighters managed to save the house,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It burned until it looked like a moonscape everywhere," she said
of her five-acre property.</TE>
<TE>   Like others, Grove is making sure that the thousands of
firefighters battling the Wolf fire know they are appreciated. Grove
printed a bunch of large buttons that say, "Ojai Loves Firefighters"
and "Firefighters Rock!"</TE>
<TE>   She's selling the buttons, at 50 cents a pop at her surplus store,
along with a lot of socks for weary firefighters. The fire crews get
the buttons for free.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever the firefighters come, we always welcome them," she
said. "I mean, they save our lives."</TE>
<TE>   So far the fire has not disrupted business in the
tourist-dependent town. At the Ojai Valley Inn, Carmen Hofer of
Arcadia said news about the wildfire did not deter her from enjoying
a four-day getaway with her mother, daughter, a girlfriend and two
grandsons.</TE>
<TE>   "When I talked to my husband last night he said, 'Are you sure
you're OK?' But look, it's beautiful here," Hofer said. "You can't
even tell there's a fire."</TE>

<HD>Body May Be Missing Girl's</HD>
<DH>Crime: It is discovered not far from where her father was
found shot to death in his pickup truck, an apparent suicide.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The body of a young girl matching the description of a missing
Altadena child was found Wednesday not far from where her father
apparently committed suicide last week, Butte County authorities
said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl's body, which was hidden under a blanket and brush, had a
single gunshot wound to the head, according to a news release.</LD>
<LD>   Kim Almodovar, the mother of Jeanene Bonner, 11, who was reported
missing May 27, said police told her the body could be her
daughter's, but an autopsy will be performed to conclusively identify
the remains.</LD>
<TE>   The body of the girl's father, Joaquin "Jack" Garcia, was found in
his pickup May 29 along a sparsely traveled road in Butte County,
about 100 miles north of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies investigating his apparent suicide said that based on how
Garcia's body was found, not all the blood in the passenger seat
could have come from his wound.</TE>
<TE>   The father's seat was reclined, and he had a gun in his right hand
and appeared to have been dead a few days from a gunshot to the head.
The passenger-side door of the vehicle had been locked, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Wednesday afternoon, Butte County sheriff's officials and a
botanist searched remote Highway 32 looking for plant species that
matched material found on the girl's jacket, which was found inside
the truck.</TE>
<TE>   There was blood in and on the jacket, officials said, and dried
leaves and pine needles inside one of the sleeves.</TE>
<TE>   The botanist and the sheriff had walked only two-tenths of a mile
from the truck when they came across the body of a young female
resembling the physical description of Jeanene.</TE>
<TE>   Though sheriff's officials had searched the area with a helicopter
and a search and rescue team, they did not locate the body because it
was covered by the blanket, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanene is a sixth-grade honors student at Loma Alta Elementary
School, and was last seen on May 21, when her father picked her up at
school.</TE>
<TE>   "We're at a loss," said Almodovar. "I would never have expected
something like this."</TE>

<HD>New L.A. Borough Plan Draws Interest</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The first detailed proposal to reorganize Los Angeles municipal
government into boroughs would offer voters an alternative to
secession, but its architect acknowledged Wednesday that it may face
opposition from the City Council, which would be eliminated by such a
system.</LD>
<LD>   The borough plan by Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks)
could appear on the Nov. 5 ballot if it wins the backing of eight
members of the City Council and Mayor James K. Hahn. Their support is
needed, Hertzberg said, because there is not enough time to gather
signatures to place the measure on the ballot without council
backing.</LD>
<LD>   On the same ballot would be two proposals to break up the city by
creating new cities from the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Hertzberg's proposal is the second in recent weeks to recommend a
borough form of government for Los Angeles. Unlike another
proposal--by City Council members Wendy Greuel, Janice Hahn and Tom
LaBonge--Hertzberg's plan spells out a number of specifics of the new
system, including the number of boroughs and their boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, it attracted some early interest, including that of
David Fleming, who helped pay for the early efforts of Valley VOTE,
the organization that led the campaign to put Valley secession on the
ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great proposal," said Fleming, a Studio City
attorney. "It goes along with what I've been saying for years. But I
don't think the council is going to adopt it, frankly. I just don't
see them voting themselves out of office."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg's plan would create nine boroughs. Voters in each
borough would elect a five-member council that would control local
budgets and services, including animal regulation, community
development, housing, cultural affairs, parks and libraries. Each
borough would also have its own planning commission, which would rule
on small and medium-sized projects. Large projects would be overseen
by a citywide commission.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the boroughs would be formed in areas of the city where
African American voters command a majority. Three or four would have
substantial numbers of Latino voters, Hertzberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the five council members in each of the boroughs would
represent wards comprised of 82,000 people, drawn from districts
whose boundaries roughly parallel neighborhood councils, empowerment
districts and other community lines. They in turn would elect borough
presidents, who would serve for two years on a citywide Board of
Presidents.</TE>
<TE>   Former Assembly member Richard Katz, who is chairing the San
Fernando Valley secession campaign, said he is skeptical that
Hertzberg's plan can win City Council approval.</TE>
<TE>   Katz said he supports boroughs for a new Valley city, but that
Hertzberg's proposal would make wading through the proposals facing
voters in November "more difficult and confusing."</TE>
<TE>   Other secession advocates also have questioned the recent debate
over boroughs, complaining that the idea is surfacing now in order to
create a confusing ballot option that would doom the Valley and
Hollywood efforts to break away from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But Hertzberg said his plan "changes the debate" over secession.</TE>
<TE>   "Neither argument works--it doesn't work to just quit the city and
it doesn't work to leave things the way they are," said the former
Assembly speaker, who carried the legislation that made Valley and
Hollywood secession possible. "What we've done here is the best of
both worlds."</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg said he has been working on the plan for months. The
draft he distributed Wednesday included color maps and detailed
descriptions of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   But he conceded there is no time to gather signatures to place his
proposal on the ballot independently of the council, forcing him to
seek the backing of a majority of that 15-member body.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Hertzberg has tended to some political details: The
nine City Council members who will not be forced to leave office in
the coming two years because of term limits all would have the option
of running for office in their own boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel, who is leading the effort to win City Council support for
boroughs, said she would be willing to incorporate elements of
Hertzberg's plan into her own.</TE>
<TE>   Greuel said, however, that she was concerned that Hertzberg's plan
seemed fully formed, without input from public hearings. And, she
said, the former speaker did not pay enough attention to how city
services would be delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Janice Hahn, who met with Hertzberg on Wednesday, welcomed the
plan, saying that it needed only to be "tweaked" to win her support.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Sue Fox contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Looking for the Rot Behind Oracle Odor</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO</LD>
<LD>   This is what is known so far about the Oracle software scandal,
based on a long legislative investigation: The Davis administration
exhibited incompetence.</LD>
<LD>   But that's just for starters.</LD>
<TE>   "Gross and reckless incompetence," says Assemblyman Rod Pacheco
(R-Riverside), a member of the investigating joint audit committee.
Hardly anybody following this would disagree.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, given the smelly circumstances, Gov. Gray Davis would
happily settle for a verdict of incompetence. Even gross and
reckless.</TE>
<TE>   The governor might wince, however, at some other conclusions: His
appointees have displayed arrogance, a cavalier attitude toward the
taxpayers' money and unseemly finger-pointing.</TE>
<TE>   And, oh yes, some surely have been lying--like Arun Baheti, Davis'
fired director of e-government. Baheti swore he couldn't remember the
name of a bar where an Oracle lobbyist slipped him a $25,000 check
for Davis' reelection just days after the $95-million software
contract was signed.</TE>
<TE>   What has not been determined is the level of corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Was it merely corruption of common sense caused by a desire to
curry favor with a Silicon Valley high roller, Oracle CEO Larry
Ellison? Or maybe a natural inclination, by some administration
officials, to please an important senator? Or a last-ditch effort to
save a troubled department, Information Technology?</TE>
<TE>   Or was this plain old sleazy corruption involving payoffs?</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't discount it," says Assemblyman Dean Florez
(D-Shafter), the committee chairman. Fortunately, Florez has been
pushing the investigation, even if some fellow Democrats would rather
he not dig too deeply.</TE>
<TE>   At the minimum, this scandal reflects badly on government
generally and the Davis administration specifically. There is a
careless disregard for taxpayers' money that is legitimate fodder for
any right-wing talk host.</TE>
<TE>   Just one sign: Kari Dohn, an aide to Cabinet Secretary Susan
Kennedy, testified that the Oracle deal "was a low priority" in the
governor's office. (It then was fighting the energy crisis.)</TE>
<TE>   Dohn referred to the signing of a "governor's action request"
(GAR)--which was needed to authorize the Oracle contract--as "almost
a ministerial act."</TE>
<TE>   It was a ministerial act that, very strangely, needed only 22 days
to accomplish--light speed for government.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything that large move this quickly," testified
Debbie Leibrock, technology chief for the state Finance Department.
She, like other civil servants, opposed the deal, but was overruled
by Davis' appointees.</TE>
<TE>   This was a ministerial act, according to state Auditor Elaine
Howle, that could waste $41 million over six years. Davis is trying
to rip up the contract.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle and its middleman, Logicon, claimed the state would save
$16 million over the same period because of volume discounts. Like
car salesmen, they threatened to quickly withdraw the offer if the
state didn't move fast.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in state government checked out Oracle's figures or even
negotiated with the hustlers. Officials merely converted the offer
into a contract, bureaucrats have testified. "We had only a
PowerPoint presentation from Logicon," Leibrock recalled.</TE>
<TE>   You could get dizzy trying to follow the finger-pointing.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, who added the final crucial signature on the GAR, said
she expected Finance Director Tim Gage to check it all out. Gage
testified that General Services Director Barry Keene (since fired)
had assured him he'd analyzed the data. But Keene and Consumer
Affairs Secretary Aileen Adams testified they had relied on
Information Technology Director Elias Cortez (since suspended). And
Cortez said crunching numbers was Gage's job.</TE>
<TE>   Nobody has linked Davis directly to any of this. But Republicans
are suspicious of Oracle campaign donations--not the little $25,000
(since returned), but the potential for bundles.</TE>
<TE>   "You got rolled," Sen. Ray Haynes (R-Riverside) told Gage Tuesday
night, adding that the only person powerful enough to roll a finance
director is the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "How on God's green footstool can you tell us that Director Keene
buffaloed you?"</TE>
<TE>   Here are some pieces of a possible scenario:</TE>
<TE>   Gage is a former legislative staffer, low-key and deferential.
Keene had been an important senator.</TE>
<TE>   This Oracle mess started with Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los
Angeles), a budget subcommittee chairman, phoning Gage and asking him
to set up a meeting with Logicon pitchmen. Gage did. Polanco's son
works for Oracle. Also, Polanco strongly pushed Cortez for department
director.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Cortez's department needed a big score to save it
from the ax.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe some of that fits.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it does or not, Davis aides have displayed incompetence.
And some are still working for him.</TE>

<HD>Bradley Sues Compton, Perrodin Over Election Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compton's former mayor sued the city, its city clerk and its current
mayor Wednesday, alleging they violated his civil rights and
manipulated the names on last June's ballot, causing him to lose the
mayoral election.</LD>
<LD>   Omar Bradley's lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court names Mayor
Eric J. Perrodin, former City Council candidate Leslie Irving and
City Clerk Charles Davis, among others, said Hermez Moreno, Bradley's
lawyer.</LD>
<LD>   Former council candidate Melanie Andrews filed a similar lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   Bradley is seeking more than $5 million, Moreno said.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Perrodin nor Davis could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The suit is one more wrinkle in Compton's contested election of
June 5, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Perrodin outpolled Bradley, a two-term incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Bradley contested the election, and Superior Court Judge Judith
Chirlin in February agreed with Bradley and reinstated him, citing
ballot irregularities and other problems.</TE>
<TE>   Days later, the state's 2nd District Court of Appeal stayed
Chirlin's ruling and put Perrodin back in, pending a final review of

<LD>Top California officials on Wednesday deplored disclosures that a
company run by H. Ross Perot provided energy traders with a blueprint
for manipulating the state's electricity market, and Gov. Gray Davis
called on the federal government to investigate.</LD>
<LD>   "If true, this is an ethical violation of the highest order and
quite possibly a criminal offense," Davis said in calling on the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate the allegations
against Perot Systems Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The company helped develop the computer systems used to track
California electricity trading, and then peddled a detailed
presentation to energy companies on ways to "game" the state's power
market, newly released documents show.</LD>
<TE>   Perot Systems officials on Wednesday denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The blueprint outlined a number of "strategic decisions" that
companies could make to maximize profits. It said Perot Systems had
"discovered a hole" in state protocols and provided specific examples
of how to exploit it to increase power prices.</TE>
<TE>   Among the examples was one dubbed "Game," which described how
companies could purposely clog transmission pathways by scheduling to
send electricity that, in reality, is never sent anywhere but helps
to drive up prices and leads to profits for energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   That mirrors the scheme Enron Corp. nicknamed "Death Star," one of
the ways the now-notorious energy trader deliberately spiked prices
in California, according to recently released company memos. Because
California's market system pays energy traders for relieving
congestion before any electrons actually flow, energy companies may
have been making profits--and disrupting the legitimate transmission
of power--by creating the illusion of clogged power lines.</TE>
<TE>   A state Senate committee investigating whether companies
manipulated the market during last year's crisis obtained the
blueprint from Reliant Energy. Lawyers for the Houston-based company
said Perot Systems made the same sales pitch to other firms selling
power in California.</TE>
<TE>   California lawmakers said they were stunned by the 44-page
presentation, a series of computer graphics that provided a primer on
the state's deregulated electricity market and then illustrated ways
to exploit it to raise power prices.</TE>
<TE>   An industry consultant testifying before the Senate committee
Wednesday likened it to "handing grade-school children loaded
revolvers," and concluded that power traders armed with such
information would clearly have put the schemes to use.</TE>
<TE>   "This is corporate behavior at its despicable worst," said state
Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), the lawmaker leading the inquiry,
adding that it appeared that Perot's firm might have played a role in
the "economic rape of California."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, the Plano, Texas-based firm said it had not
provided any confidential information to Reliant or anyone else and
had in fact "actively alerted" two energy-market oversight bodies
about "defects in market rules" already adopted by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems spokesman Eddie Reeves said the company is
internally investigating why the document was produced, and added
that earlier this year the firm shut down the energy consulting arm
that apparently put it together.</TE>
<TE>   "We're trying to find out who exactly produced it, to whom they
presented it, when, what the context was and what the goal was,"
Reeves said. "Integrity is our bread and butter, and that's why we
want to get to the bottom of this."</TE>
<TE>   Perot, the former presidential candidate who serves as the
company's chairman, also telephoned Dunn on Wednesday morning, the
senator said, and assured him that the firm would place "absolutely
no obstacles of any kind" before California investigators. He then
offered to testify--an offer that state lawmakers appear inclined to
accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Perot Systems itself is going to have to account for this," said
Dunn, who has concluded that the rolling blackouts that darkened much
of the state last year were the result of improper business conduct
and could have been avoided.</TE>
<TE>   Perot could not be reached for comment Wednesday. Perot Systems'
stock price fell $3.43 per share, or about 19%, to close at $14.55 on
the New York Stock Exchange. The plunge wiped out about $364 million
of the firm's market value.</TE>
<TE>   The company was hired in 1997 to help set up the computer systems
for the California Power Exchange, the body that was supposed to be
the state's primary power market but that went out of business last
year during the height of the energy crisis, and the California
Independent System Operator.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO handles real-time electricity trades and manages the power
grid for most of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems was one of three firms hired by Cal-ISO as part of a
$57-million contract to establish its computer system, according to
the agency, which said its relationship with the company ended in
1998. Cal-ISO was not immediately sure how much of the money Perot
Systems received. The firm also entered into a $35-million
information technology services agreement with the Power Exchange in
2000. It was not clear Wednesday how much Perot Systems was paid to
set up the computer system for the exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Cal-ISO officials on Wednesday reviewed the Perot Systems
blueprint and concluded that it did not contain any confidential
information, said spokesman Gregg Fishman.</TE>
<TE>   "There isn't anything that anyone with some knowledge and know-how
of the energy business couldn't have figured out for themselves," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers, however, raised a number of questions Wednesday about
the ramifications of the blueprint. Among them, said Dunn and state
Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey), was whether the members of the
Cal-ISO board, who include energy company representatives and other
so-called stakeholders in the market, had learned about the loopholes
outlined in the Perot Systems document.</TE>
<TE>   Though it was largely overshadowed by the Perot Systems
revelation, state lawmakers also heard testimony Wednesday from an
industry consultant who suggested that some of the state's municipal
utilities should have known--and may well have known--that Enron and
other power companies were possibly engaging in questionable business
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Robert McCullough, a former utility executive who runs an Oregon
consulting firm, said the state's utilities should have suspected
that something was wrong when power companies such as Enron were
offering to split profits with them--in some cases 50-50--for the
right to their capacity on power lines, and were then sending little
or no power.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Enron's ploys were specifically tailored to employ the
municipal utilities--including one dubbed "Red Congo" that used a
portion of the Redding utility's transmission line, he said, citing
new documents obtained by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale's municipal utility recently announced that it was
investigating whether it unwittingly took part in some of Enron's
schemes by participating in similar arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   But McCullough said at least one municipal entity, the Northern
California Power Agency, appears to have known something was afoot,
citing a document that showed it was "aggressively" marketing use of
its lines to Enron and to Williams, an Oklahoma-based energy company,
for a 50% cut of profits.</TE>
<TE>   A lobbyist for the agency, John Fistolera, disputed McCullough's
accusation, saying his client was simply trying to make the best use
of its assets, and had actually thought it was helping relieve power
shortages during the energy crunch.</TE>

<HD>Martin Esslin, 83; Drama Critic and BBC Producer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Esslin, a theater critic and radio producer who coined the
phrase "theater of the absurd," has died. He was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Esslin died Feb. 24 in London. He had suffered from Parkinson's
disease.</LD>
<LD>   Esslin was best known for his book "The Theatre of the Absurd,"
first published in 1961, which examined the work of a group of
playwrights--Samuel Beckett, Jean Genet, Arthur Adamov and Eugene
Ionesco--and younger talents such as Harold Pinter and Edward Albee.</LD>
<TE>   In his book, Esslin quoted Ionesco's definition of "absurd"--"that
which is devoid of purpose.... Cut off from his religious,
metaphysical and transcendental roots, man is lost; his actions
become senseless, absurd, useless."</TE>
<TE>   These writers illustrated this condition by forsaking "rational
devices and discursive thoughts" in their plays, Esslin said. The
book became a frequently read text in college courses, and the
titular phrase has been adapted to many other contexts since 1961. By
the time he wrote his preface to the book's second edition, Esslin
noted that the writers he described did not make up "an organized
movement" and that "theater of the absurd" was only "a working
hypothesis."</TE>
<TE>   Two other achievements of Esslin's were perhaps as influential as
his most famous book: his work as a BBC producer and as an advocate
of the plays of Bertolt Brecht.</TE>
<TE>   Esslin worked for the BBC from 1940 to 1977, serving as head of
radio drama from 1963 to 1977. He was instrumental in commissioning
radio plays by young writers even before they achieved stage success,
said Charles Marowitz, a Los Angeles-based stage director and critic
who lived and worked in England from 1956 to 1980. Esslin "was a
great advocate of the new writing of that time, and one of the few
who understood the European background of the theater and brought it
into British theater. He brought a gravity to the BBC that it never
had before."</TE>
<TE>   Among the European writers Esslin championed was Brecht. "Every
time I spoke to him, it was about Brecht," Marowitz recalled. "Even
after the Soviet Union dissolved and people were saying [the Marxist]
Brecht was old hat, he said that the best of the Brecht plays were
great poems for the theater, not necessarily propaganda."</TE>
<TE>   Esslin wrote "Brecht: The Man and His Work" in 1960 and "Bertolt
Brecht" in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote books, published in 1967 and 1970, about Harold
Pinter, one of the writers whose work he commissioned for the BBC,
and two books on the French director and theorist Antonin Artaud.</TE>
<TE>   Esslin's roots were in central Europe. He was born Julius
Pereszlenyi in Budapest and studied English and philosophy at the
University of Vienna and theatrical direction at Vienna's Reinhardt
Seminar of Dramatic Art. When the Nazis invaded Austria, the young
scholar fled to Brussels and, after another year, to England, where
he found work with the BBC. He became a naturalized British citizen
and changed his name to Martin Julius Esslin.</TE>
<TE>   Esslin taught theater at Florida State University from 1969 to
1976 and theater, German studies and comparative literature at
Stanford University for two quarters each year, from 1977 through
1989.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1987 book "The Field of Drama," Esslin wrote about drama in
movies and television as well as theater. He told an audience at a
seminar at UC San Diego in 1990 that culture "is never fixed. It is
changing from second to second."</TE>
<TE>   Esslin married Renate Gerstenberg in 1947. In addition to
Gerstenberg, he is survived by a daughter, Monica Esslin of London.</TE>

<HD>Volunteers' Time Is Asset to Food Bank</HD>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the course of 13 years as a volunteer at Food Share, Mary Page
figures she has sorted more than 5 million canned goods. So it was
only fitting she was crowned the "Queen of Cans" at the first Food
Sorting Relay on Wednesday at the Oxnard warehouse operated by
Ventura County's food bank.</LD>
<LD>   Page joined more than 100 volunteers from local businesses,
colleges and churches in boxing 55,000 pounds of food collected last
month by postal carriers in Oxnard and Ventura during their annual
food drive.</LD>
<LD>   "What I find is that people who have the least give more because
they've been there before," said Simi Valley letter carrier Sandy
Gaunce, who has served as the food-drive coordinator the past five
years. "But this year I think Sept. 11 played a big part, because
people wanted to find a way to help others and with this they know
exactly where their help is going."</LD>
<TE>   Gaunce said the group of post offices stretching from Ojai to
North Hollywood collected 420,000 pounds of food this year.</TE>
<TE>   Page and her royal court of volunteers have spent the past two
weeks sorting through the collected food to make sure nothing was
broken, damaged or beyond the expiration date.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we are helping people less fortunate than us and we want
to make sure the food is safe," said the Camarillo resident, who will
celebrate her 80th birthday Monday. "I may have a sore back
sometimes, but when I'm not here I sure miss it. There is a lot of
camaraderie, and we have fun."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to representatives from local businesses such as Red
Lobster and Wells Fargo, county Supervisor Steve Bennett and members
of his office staff were among the first to box the food that will
help feed 100,000 county residents this year through a network of
more than 200 charities.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of 25 at a time congregated around bins filled with canned
and boxed goods. Three assembly lines were set up to take food items
from the bins and place them into cardboard boxes, which were then
taped and stacked on pallets.</TE>
<TE>   "In my first year [in office] I tried to tour as many local
organizations as I could, and I was so impressed by Food Share,"
Bennett said. "When they put out this call to action for volunteers,
I felt like we had to help. This is such a volunteer-dominated
organization, and they really need another wave of people to start
volunteering.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally it will be the baby boomers that are getting ready to
retire." The relay was part of a series of events held across the
country in support of National Hunger Awareness Day, born out of a
call for an additional 365 million pounds of food to combat hunger in
America. It is estimated Ventura County's share of that need is 4
million pounds.</TE>
<TE>   While food is the top component needed for Food Share to operate,
it also requires volunteers to not only sort the food but pick it up
and deliver it, work in the office and glean the fields of
participating local growers.</TE>
<TE>   "Volunteers are a key part of our program," Food Share President
Jim Mangis said. "They enable us to do what we need to do. Our
dilemma is that not only is the need growing for more food, but our
long-term dedicated volunteers are now in their 70s, 80s and 90s. So
they can't do the same physical work they used to do."</TE>
<TE>   Mangis said he hopes the relay will help plant the seeds of
volunteering in younger people.</TE>
<TE>   After her volunteer shift was up, Alex Mooney of Ventura decided
to donate more time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good for our kids to see us leading by example, so I
signed us all up as family volunteers on Saturdays," said Mooney, a
Web site designer. "I just love participating, and it's a great
workout. I did a lot more bending at the waist than I do sitting at a
computer all day."</TE>
<TE>   Anyone interested in volunteering can call 983-7100, Ext. 43. Food
Share's collection and sorting operation is open from 5 a.m. to 2
p.m. weekdays, and every third Saturday.</TE>

<DH>Fast: Protesters oppose federal seizure of West Hollywood
facility that supplied medical marijuana.</DH>

<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five supporters of the sale of marijuana for medical purposes at a
West Hollywood building launched an "open-ended hunger strike and
encampment" Wednesday against federal authorities who last week filed
a forfeiture action against the property.</LD>
<LD>   They will be joined each day by a number of sympathizers who will
fast for 24 hours, said Scott Imler, executive director of the Los
Angeles Cannabis Resources Center. The center, at 7494 Santa Monica
Blvd., was shut down in October when federal agents seized files,
plants and other assets.</LD>
<LD>   Under the forfeiture action filed Friday in U.S. District Court in
Los Angeles, the federal government said the 1996 state ballot
proposition that allows the sale of marijuana for medical purposes is
invalidated by federal prohibitions on the use of controlled
substances. A federal jury will decide whether the government can
seize the $780,000 property where marijuana was grown and
distributed.</LD>
<TE>   The strike and encampment will take place in a parking lot across
the street from the main property, which is also owned by the
Cannabis Resources Center.</TE>
<TE>   The city of West Hollywood authorized a loan of $350,000 in
redevelopment funds to the center, which would not be repaid in the
event of government forfeiture.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Lucey, one of those on hunger strike, said she and the others
will consume only water, juice and perhaps a little milk so they can
take their regular AIDS medication. She said the strike will last
until the federal action is dropped.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters said they may file a civil action against the
government for allegedly violating their civil rights, as well as for
wrongful death should any of those on hunger strike die.</TE>
<TE>   Imler, Lucey, Myron Willis and others who spoke at a news
conference Wednesday said the federal government is violating states'
rights by challenging laws in California and other states that use
marijuana as a medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   A copy of the federal complaint said more than 1,000 marijuana
plants were seized from the property, as well as other plants in
Ventura County. Financial records indicated as much as $20,000 a week
in marijuana was being sold by the nonprofit center.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those buying marijuana suffer from AIDS. They say
marijuana reduces the side effects of AIDS medicines.</TE>
<TE>   The government has not yet brought a direct action to invalidate
California's Proposition 215, which was approved by voters.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters said Wednesday that last week's forfeiture was intended
by the government to harass marijuana supporters without risking a
definitive setback in court.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles said he
was not prepared to discuss the government's strategy. He referred
inquiries to officials in Washington, D.C., who were not immediately
available for comment.</TE>

<HD>Van Dams' Sex Life Aired</HD>
<DH>Trial: Slain girl's father admits to lying at first about
being in bed with a friend of his wife the night Danielle vanished.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>At the murder trial Wednesday of the man accused of killing
7-year-old Danielle van Dam, the girl's father testified that he
initially lied to police when he denied smoking marijuana and being
in bed with one of his wife's friends the night Danielle disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   Under questioning by the prosecutor and two attorneys for
defendant David Westerfield, Damon van Dam said he did not think the
marijuana use was relevant to his daughter's disappearance and that
he did not "want to get in trouble."</LD>
<LD>   Lead defense attorney Steven Feldman accused Van Dam and his wife,
Brenda, of agreeing "to withhold anything from police about your
sexual behaviors."</LD>
<TE>   Feldman, in his opening statement to the jury Tuesday, had
suggested that the Van Dams engaged in a sexually permissive
lifestyle and that one of their alleged sex partners--not
Westerfield--might have kidnapped and murdered their daughter.</TE>
<TE>   By withholding information about those partners, Feldman said, the
couple may have hindered police and kept them from identifying
suspects.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Feldman asked Van Dam if he had ever had sex with
one of his wife's friends "in the presence of your wife."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," said Van Dam, 36, a software engineer employed at a company
under contract to telecommunications giant Qualcomm.</TE>
<TE>   Feldman also sought to question Damon Van Dam about allegedly
"risque" Halloween parties held at the family home. But after an
objection from Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Dusek, Superior Court Judge
William Mudd ruled that Van Dam did not have to answer.</TE>
<TE>   The murder victim's father remained calm as the defense attorney
probed for information about his marijuana use and sexual habits. He
lost his composure only once, starting to cry when asked to describe
Danielle's room.</TE>
<TE>   Questions about the Van Dams' lifestyle have added an incendiary
element to the case, which has drawn extensive national and local
media coverage since Brenda van Dam discovered her daughter missing
on the morning of Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Westerfield, 50, is accused of murder, kidnapping and misdemeanor
possession of child pornography. Prosecutors allege that Danielle's
hair and blood were found in Westerfield's recreational vehicle. Her
body was discovered in a rural area 26 days after her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Several San Diego television stations are providing gavel-to-gavel
coverage of the trial. Each station has one or more lawyers and jury
consultants providing commentary before, during and after the court
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Mudd warned jurors to avoid media coverage. "Every lawyer
who ever practiced law in this county is now providing analysis of
this case," he said. "They're not going to decide this case. You
are."</TE>
<TE>   At the first break after Damon Van Dam's admissions about lying
about marijuana and sex, analysts were opining on the significance.</TE>
<TE>   Jan Ronis, a defense attorney, told the ABC affiliate that the
sympathy of jurors for a father of a murdered girl was being undercut
by Van Dam's testimony about drugs and sex. "I think a lot of that
goodwill has been eviscerated by the cross-examination," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Toni Blake, a jury consultant, told the CBS affiliate that
Feldman's strategy is to paint the Van Dams as unreliable witnesses,
who may have hindered the police investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some eye rolling on the part of jurors that shows they
are not sure of his [Damon van Dam's] credibility," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dan Williams, a former prosecutor, told the NBC affiliate that
the Feldman strategy may not work. "I don't understand how, other
than trashing the witness, the sex stuff works," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Van Dam testified he had sex with two of his wife's friends in the
months before Danielle's disappearance. On Feb. 1, those friends
accompanied Brenda van Dam to a restaurant-bar for a night of dancing
and drinking, according to testimony by several witnesses at the
preliminary hearing.</TE>
<TE>   In the early hours of Feb. 2, Brenda van Dam, her two friends and
two other people returned to the Van Dam home. Damon van Dam
testified that one of his wife's friends came upstairs to his
bedroom, got in bed with him and engaged in some "snuggling."</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning by Dusek, Damon van Dam said that while he
initially lied to police, he quickly decided to admit facts about his
use of marijuana and the couple's sex life.</TE>
<TE>   "I realized the magnitude of the situation," Van Dam said. "I
opened up my private life to try to get my daughter back and to try
to get justice for her."</TE>

<HD>Soldier Recalls Horrors of Nazi Labor Camp</HD>
<DH>World War II: On the anniversary of D-Day, Assembly will
honor a Camarillo man, one of the first Americans to help liberate
Ohrdruf.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eyes still haunt him.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever Bob Hasen sees someone with enchantingly large eyes, he
is visited by the hollow gaze of survivors at a concentration camp
called Ohrdruf, the first Nazi camp liberated by American forces.
Hasen was among the first through the gates there, and amid the
thousands of corpses and near-corpses stacked like firewood, he gazed
in numb horror on the faces of the starving.</LD>
<LD>   "They had big, hungry, pleading eyes," he said. "Starvation
shrinks everything but the eyes."</LD>
<TE>   Hasen fought his way onto the beach at Normandy, endured the
Battle of the Bulge, caught a chunk of shrapnel in his chest and led
an assault on a sniper's nest that earned him the Bronze Star. But
nothing he saw before or since equaled the depravity he encountered
on that quiet April afternoon in Germany's Black Forest.</TE>
<TE>   On the anniversary of D-Day today, Hasen is being honored on the
floor of the California Assembly. Assemblyman Tony Strickland
(R-Moorpark) will read a resolution praising the 81-year-old
Camarillo resident's war service and his efforts to teach young
people about the Holocaust.</TE>
<TE>   "To me he's a hero," Strickland said. "I'm humbled to know him."</TE>
<TE>   At Ohrdruf, it was Hasen who was humbled.</TE>
<TE>   "In all our training, we had never been prepared for the day we
would meet something like this," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Days after the discovery of Ohrdruf, U.S. generals George Patton,
Omar Bradley and Dwight D. Eisenhower came to bear witness.</TE>
<TE>   Eisenhower ordered every American GI in the area--as well as
residents in the village a mile away--to see the camp as well.
Afterward, the mayor of Ohrdruf--a peaceful village in which Bach had
written music--hanged himself, alongside his wife.</TE>
<TE>   By Hasen's account, he and two other GIs were the first Americans
to come across the camp, which took up no more room than an average
high school campus.</TE>
<TE>   "We were lost," he recalled this week, sitting in his paneled
Leisure Village den.</TE>
<TE>   Assigned to find a Nazi camp holding American prisoners of war,
the soldiers were approached on a lonely road by a man who was little
more than a walking skeleton. Weeping, he collapsed before them and
begged for food. Half a dozen others shuffled out of the woods in
long robes reeking of human waste.</TE>
<TE>   Just down the road, a metal gate opened on the all-but-abandoned
Ohrdruf camp, admitting the three overwhelmed GIs to a circle of hell
unimagined by Dante.</TE>
<TE>   Stacks of rotting corpses were crawling with maggots. Here and
there, a finger moved, a limb quivered, a voice moaned for help. In a
barracks building, a few survivors crawled, too weak to stand.</TE>
<TE>   The camp's assistant commander expressed no remorse as he gazed
out at piles of bodies through a window in his office.</TE>
<TE>   "The color drained from his face and he crumpled to an absolute
zero when I told him I was Jewish," Hasen said.</TE>
<TE>   The prisoners at Ohrdruf, a satellite of Buchenwald, were all men.
They were assigned to dig underground rooms that would be Hitler's
headquarters if he fled Berlin, said Peter Black, a senior historian
with the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C.</TE>
<TE>   The laborers were not gassed. When they were too weak to work,
they were beaten to death or shot. In the days before the discovery,
Nazi guards burned bodies in what Black called "an open-air oven."</TE>
<TE>   Which American unit got to Ohrdruf first is a matter of debate
among scholars.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Haynes, an archivist with the U.S. Army Center of Military
History, said the matter hasn't been fully researched, although it
appeared that men from the 89th Infantry Division played a large part
in opening the camp. Hasen was with the 65th Infantry Division, which
also was in the area at the time.</TE>
<TE>   There was no doubt, though, about the discovery's importance.
Auschwitz had been liberated by Soviet troops months earlier but, for
top American commanders, Ohrdruf underscored the horror.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never felt able to describe my emotional reactions when I
first came face to face with indisputable evidence of Nazi brutality
and ruthless disregard of every shred of decency," Eisenhower later
wrote. "Up to that time, I had known about it only generally or
through secondary sources. I am certain, however, that I never at any
other time experienced an equal sense of shock."</TE>
<TE>   After the war, Hasen married and raised three children. For years,
he was a sales executive for the Ghirardelli chocolate company. The
war seldom came up.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, he attended a conference of concentration camp liberators
in Washington. He met Elie Wiesel, the author and camp survivor, and
was inspired. "He told me, 'Bob, what you have to do is go back to
California and teach the young people. They don't know.' "</TE>
<TE>   In retirement, he did just that, opening students' eyes as a
speaker at dozens of schools.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the military photos and honors displayed on his den walls, he
proudly points to a framed, neatly handwritten letter from a student
at El Rio High School.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks for making me see the light," the letter says. "I'm
dropping out of my skinhead gang. I guess I really didn't know what
they were talking about."</TE>

<HD>Life Is Longer in L.A. County, Where Death Rates Drop by
26%, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: HIV- and AIDS-related deaths plummeted 77%, but
deaths due to diabetes soared 48%, 10-year survey finds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County death rates have dropped by 26% in the last
decade, giving county residents a life expectancy two years greater
than the national average, according to data released Wednesday by
the county Department of Health Services.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the fact that medical advances and prevention programs are
helping to stave off chronic illnesses such as heart disease and
strokes,  those remain the leading causes of death in Los Angeles
County, according to the study.</LD>
<LD>   Disparities in mortality rates among ethnic groups persist as
well, with blacks in 2000 dying at three times the rate of Asians and
Latinos and 1 1/2 times the rate of whites.</LD>
<TE>   A major factor in these disparities is that blacks and whites tend
to smoke more than Asians and Latinos, researchers said. Nutrition,
stress and genetics also play a role.</TE>
<TE>   The report examined data from 1991 to 2000 to help officials
target disease prevention strategies and health care services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now reaping the harvest of some changes in personal health
habits that have been made over time, particularly in respect to
smoking," said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, the county's director of public
health.</TE>
<TE>   "For every year during the past decade that we lived, we increased
our average longevity by over three months," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the trends mirrored those in the rest of the country,
although pneumonia is a more prevalent cause of death locally than
nationwide, where cancer is more common.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for that difference is that Californians smoke less
overall.</TE>
<TE>   County mortality rates dropped for nearly every cause of death.
HIV- and AIDS-related deaths plummeted 77% due to improved drug
treatments, but deaths due to diabetes soared 48%, an increase that
officials attributed to low levels of physical activity and growing
rates of obesity.</TE>
<TE>   The report shows the need for more exercise and substance abuse
prevention programs, Fielding said.</TE>
<TE>   "We obviously need to redouble our efforts in some areas to try to
continue these declines for all populations," he said. "For example,
we have to treat substance abuse as a chronic disease rather than a
character flaw."</TE>
<TE>   Although county homicide and suicide rates dipped during the 1990s
by 51% and 34%, respectively, Fielding expects the recent economic
downturn to prompt a reversal within the next decade.</TE>

<HD>Signs of Merger Seen at O.C. Toll Road Agencies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials of the successful Foothill-Eastern tollway Wednesday agreed
to consider a merger with the financially ailing San Joaquin Hills
toll road--a sister highway that might not be able to meet its debts
if nothing is done.</LD>
<LD>   The operations and finance committee for the east Orange County
turnpike recommended the dramatic move based on economic studies that
show a consolidation might be the best way to keep the San Joaquin
Hills tollway solvent.</LD>
<LD>   Unless the road's outlook improves, it will be difficult to obtain
bond financing for the proposed Foothill South tollway through
southern Orange County, the analysis revealed.</LD>
<TE>   The Foothill-Eastern and the San Joaquin Hills tollways are
managed by the Transportation Corridor Agencies, a government entity
based in Irvine. The TCA's toll roads are financed independently of
each other and governed by separate boards of directors.</TE>
<TE>   TCA officials are planning the Foothill South, which would run 15
miles from Oso Parkway in Aliso Viejo to the San Diego Freeway south
of San Clemente. If built, it would complete the agency's 67-mile
network.</TE>
<TE>   The Foothill-Eastern board is scheduled to approve the committee's
recommendation June 13.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County coroner's office has ruled the death of a man
in the custody of El Monte police in October a homicide.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Tranquilino, 31, died Oct. 24 after police said he fought
with several officers, then lost consciousness after he had been
handcuffed.</LD>
<LD>   Tranquilino was walking in the 3300 block of Maxson Road when he
attracted the attention of police, who suspected he was carrying
narcotics. He sprinted down the street and climbed over several
chain-link fences before being grabbed by an officer, police said.</LD>
<TE>   At the time of Tranquilino's death, El Monte's then-police chief,
Bill Ankeny, said that police had used a control hold to restrain the
man.</TE>
<TE>   Coroner's spokesman David Campbell said the office ruled that
Tranquilino's death resulted from the combined effects of neck
compression and cocaine and methamphetamine intoxication.</TE>
<TE>   John Sweeney, a lawyer representing Tranquilino's 15-year-old son,
Rudy, said Wednesday that he believed the report suggested that a
chokehold had been used. An independent pathologist he had hired, he
said, "concluded that the death was due to asphyxia, probably a
chokehold."</TE>
<TE>   The coroner's report does not use the word chokehold to describe
how the Tranquilino was restrained.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the El Monte Police Department killed this man," Sweeney
said. "They denied it. It took the coroner's report to verify what we
knew all along. The family is very distraught, and this young man has
to be raised without his father. We are going to make sure that this
young man is well taken care of through compensation by the city of
El Monte."</TE>
<TE>   Pete Ferguson, an attorney representing El Monte, disagreed with
that assessment, pointing out that the coroner had found high levels
of cocaine and methamphetamines in Tranquilino's blood. "Minimal
force was applied," Ferguson said. "If the guy didn't take drugs,
he'd be alive today and would be sitting in jail for assaulting and
battering police officers."</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department had no comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Stephen Yagman filed suit in October on behalf of parents
Sergio Tranquilino and Rosemarie Richardson, seeking $20 million in
general and punitive damages, plus attorney's fees and injunctive
relief, as well as an additional $10 million under a Racketeering
Influence and Corrupt Organization claim.</TE>
<TE>   Yagman was unavailable for comment Wednesday, but charged in
October that the El Monte police were lying about what happened in
the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "They said that, all of a sudden, he stopped breathing," Yagman
said. "He stopped breathing because they were choking him."</TE>

<HD>Pictsweet Told to Rehire UFW Supporter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state labor board Wednesday upheld a judge's decision that the
Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Ventura illegally fired a mushroom picker
who was engaged in organizing activities for the United Farm Workers
union.</LD>
<LD>   In a 27-page ruling, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board
ordered Pictsweet to offer Fidel Andrade his job back and reimburse
him for lost wages. Andrade, 44, an ardent UFW supporter, was fired
in May 2001 from his job of nine years after company officials
accused him of pushing a foreman.</LD>
<LD>   Administrative Law Judge Douglas Gallop, however, ruled earlier
this year that Andrade's firing violated a provision of state law
that prohibits agricultural employers from interfering with union
organizing activities.</LD>
<TE>   The labor board, established by state law in 1975 to referee farm
labor disputes and oversee union elections, backed that decision.</TE>
<TE>   "The record supports the conclusion that absent his union and
other protected concerted activities, Andrade's altercation ... may
have resulted in some lesser form of discipline," the labor board
concluded. "It is apparent that management seized on the incident as
an opportunity to rid itself of a [pro-union] employee."</TE>
<TE>   Pictsweet and the UFW have been locked in a protracted labor
dispute over wages and benefits. Company officials, who could not be
reached for comment Wednesday, can challenge the ruling in appellate
court.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an Oxnard attorney representing the UFW in
negotiations, said the board's order is a boon to the union's
two-year push for a new contract. To press the issue, the UFW has
launched a campaign to persuade supermarket chains, restaurants and
retailers to boycott Pictsweet products.</TE>
<TE>   "It returns a leader back to the plant and shows the work force
that there is a law, assuming [the company] abides by it,"
Macri-Ortiz said. "And I think it validates what we've been saying
all along: This is a very anti-union company that will do anything to
try to squelch the legitimate desires of the work force."</TE>

<LD>The Board of Supervisors this week ordered the county counsel's
office to appeal a judge's order that prosecutors release a letter
written to Huntington Beach police citing a lack of evidence for
filing criminal charges against an officer.</LD>
<LD>   Huntington Beach paid $25,000 to one person who said he was
punched and kicked by Officer Edmond Kennedy, who was off duty at the
time. A day later, a 17-year-old said the officer threw him to the
ground in response to a vulgar gesture. Kennedy has denied
wrongdoing.</LD>
<LD>   Denied a copy of the letter by the district attorney's office, the
Los Angeles Times sued. An Orange County Superior Court judge ordered
the letter released.</LD>

<HD>Cypress Residents Get Street Theater Delivered to Their
Doors</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new kind of street theater? The police log of the Los Alamitos
News-Enterprise carried this item out of Cypress: "Moody Street, 9000
block, 8:27 p.m.: A man in his 20s wearing an olive shirt and
knee-length shorts was going door-to-door and asking the residents to
rate his acting."</LD>
<LD>   Hey! Watch where you're slaloming there, buddy:</LD>
<LD>   In West Yellowstone, Ginny Piccolo of Valencia found an unusual
restroom sign (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Speaking of recreation: From the looks of the notice forwarded to
me by John and Eileen Olmsted of Fullerton, that city will give you a
good time, but it'll cost you (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Dueling signs: Luis Ycasas of Alhambra snapped a pair of warnings
arguing over no-parking hours (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Just to complicate things even further, the "2 Hour" sign says
"Except Sunday" at bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Aerial advisory: Anyone who dares look up at the sky knows that
crows are taking over the world (listen--you can hear them outside
your window right now). And what's worse, they appear to be
recruiting from other species.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Wheeler of Mar Vista said a flock of crows accompanied by
a white, silver-crested cockatoo visits his neighborhood every
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "He caws with them," Wheeler said of the newcomer. "When he flies
off, they will follow him to the next tree. I've seen them run off
hawks, and he's right there with them."</TE>
<TE>   Hotel California Down Under? In New Zealand, Lance and Becky
Larsen of Irvine came upon a sign for a bed and breakfast place that
was next to a cemetery sign. "You can check in," they wrote, "but you
can never check out."</TE>
<TE>   Did he root for the Lakers or Kings? Rusty Hammer was trying to
enter the downtown Library Tower the other day when the security
guard asked to see his identification.</TE>
<TE>   "My driver's license still has my Sacramento address on it," he
told the L.A. Business Journal. "When he saw that he said, 'Oh, I'm
sorry, I can't let you in. You guys poisoned Kobe [Bryant].' "</TE>
<TE>   The guard, who was referring to the reported case of food
poisoning suffered by the Lakers basketball star in that city, was
joking. He allowed Hammer to enter.</TE>
<TE>   Which is only right. After all, Hammer is the new president and
chief executive of the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce, a post similar
to the one he held in Shaq-ramento.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Eddie Cress of Sylmar observed that a Times story on a
winery mentioned that one of the co-founders was a Brewer: Greg
Brewer. The name doesn't quite fit, of course. Steve Dahlerbruch of
Beverly Hills read that the plant manager of the Miller Brewing Co.'s
Irwindale plant is retiring. Alas, his position has been filled.
Incidentally, the name of the retiree is Ed Beers.</TE>

<HD>Auditors Debate Merits of Oracle Software Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>It was the battle of the auditors in the Capitol on Wednesday. And
for at least part of the day, everyone without an MBA struggled to
stay awake.</LD>
<LD>   Continuing its inquiry into the state's much-maligned software
contract with Oracle Corp., a panel of lawmakers heard conflicting
testimony about whether Californians got a good deal.</LD>
<LD>   State Auditor Elaine M. Howle portrayed the contract as a
money-loser that was hurriedly signed and based on faulty
projections.</LD>
<TE>   Then her former boss--Kurt Sjoberg, who worked in state government
for 25 years but now consults for Oracle--took the microphone to
defend the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Sjoberg predicted it would save California between $110 million
and $160 million over the next 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   Despite forecasting such savings, however, Sjoberg--the first
witness testifying on behalf of Oracle--declined to say whether he
would encourage the Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis to retain the
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "There's much more to this than just my analysis of the contract's
value," he said, referring to the swirl of political controversy that
shrouds the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Signed a year ago, the Oracle contract was supposed to save the
state up to $111 million through volume purchasing and maintenance of
database software.</TE>
<TE>   But in April, Howle issued a highly critical report predicting the
agreement could cost up to $41 million more than if the state had
kept its previous software contracts.</TE>
<TE>   As Oracle continues negotiations with the state over whether to
rescind the contract, the Joint Legislative Audit Committee continued
its scrutiny of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the day was consumed with dizzying talk about statistical
methods, spending projections and arcane elements of the software
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   But there was a bit of drama.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators were particularly interested in why Oracle hired
Sjoberg to prepare his analysis of the contract in late
January--several months before Howle issued her report.</TE>
<TE>   Sjoberg deferred to Oracle lawyer Stephen Ryan, who said that his
law firm decided to hire its own auditor to evaluate the agreement
after media reports suggested that Howle's assessment might not
sufficiently portray the "appropriate value of the contract" to the
state.</TE>
<TE>   The company chose Sjoberg to "fill the gaps," Ryan said, because
of his background and credibility.</TE>
<TE>   Sjoberg's credibility, however, came under attack throughout the
day, first by Republican Assemblyman Rod Pacheco of Riverside, who
repeatedly emphasized that the consultant had been paid--$275 per
hour--to prepare his report.</TE>
<TE>   Sjoberg said that in all, his firm would be paid as much as
$100,000 for the Oracle work.</TE>
<TE>   But he insisted that his conclusions were objective and based on
"an analysis of data and facts."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, Sen. Steve Peace (D-Chula Vista) returned to the
issue of Sjoberg's credibility--and was far less subtle.</TE>
<TE>   Peace said that it was inappropriate of Sjoberg to take a job that
might lead him to oppose work produced by the state auditor, with
whom he so recently worked.</TE>

<HD>School Trustee Accused of Molestation Waives Trial</HD>
<DH>Courts: Judge will decide the case of Ventura County board
member Albert Rosen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ventura County school board member accused of molesting a
6-year-old girl more than 30 years ago waived his right to a jury
trial Wednesday and submitted the case to a judge, who is expected to
rule next week.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Charles McGrath warned retired teacher Albert
Rosen, a 75-year-old Simi Valley resident, that he would most likely
find him guilty. McGrath presided over Rosen's preliminary hearing on
molestation charges last year and found there was sufficient evidence
to order him to stand trial.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the warning, Rosen waived his right to trial and asked
McGrath to determine his guilt or innocence based on transcripts from
the preliminary hearing.</LD>
<TE>   "It was my decision," Rosen said during a court appearance. The
judge plans to hear arguments Tuesday morning and then announce a
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime member of the Ventura County Board of Education, Rosen
is charged with 10 counts of lewd conduct with a child younger than
14. Prosecutors allege Rosen forced a 6-year-old girl to engage in
sexual conduct with him between 1966 and 1971.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted, Rosen could be placed on probation or sentenced to
life in prison. Either way, Rosen plans to ask the court to stay his
sentence pending an appeal, said Oxnard attorney Joseph O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   The defense plans to challenge the constitutionality of a state
law that permits prosecution of certain sex crimes after the six-year
statute of limitations has expired.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill said the charges against Rosen were filed decades after
the alleged crimes occurred, making it difficult for the defense to
challenge evidence or witnesses' testimony.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, O'Neill filed a motion to dismiss the case based on his
objections to the state law. But McGrath denied the motion because
the law has been upheld by the California Supreme Court and because
Rosen's previous lawyer raised a similar objection that was also
rejected.</TE>
<TE>   Rosen, who is free on $50,000 bail, remains a member of the school
board, but he could be removed from the panel if convicted of a
felony, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   In December, board members asked Rosen to step down, but he
refused, saying: "There's no reason for me to resign."</TE>

<HD>Shark Sighting Puts Water Off Limits</HD>

<LD>A new shark sighting has prompted lifeguards to close the waters off
Stinson Beach, about 20 miles northwest of San Francisco, rather than
allow swimmers and surfers back into the waves as planned after a
recent shark attack, officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A diver saw a shark about 100 yards offshore about 7 p.m. Tuesday,
said Xavier Agnew, a lifeguard with the National Park Service. Though
the beach and park remain open, swimming and surfing remain
off-limits until Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's attack was the second at Stinson in the past four
years. A surfer was bitten and injured Friday at the mouth of the
Bolinas Channel, about 300 feet from Stinson Beach. He was pulled
from his surfboard by a shark about 15 feet long, witnesses said.</LD>

<HD>Hollywood Tryout for Secession to Join Valley Bid on Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NITA LELYVELD and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Already given the chance to determine the future of the San Fernando
Valley, voters will also decide in November whether to let Hollywood
break away from Los Angeles, taking with it a chunk of the city's
identity and some of its best-known landmarks, including the
Hollywood sign and the Walk of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   The Local Agency Formation Commission on Wednesday voted 6 to 2,
with one abstention, to put the Hollywood secession measure on the
Nov. 5 city ballot, alongside the Valley cityhood plan. The
commission last week rejected the breakaway move by the city's harbor
area, so Wednesday's vote completes the secession proposals cleared
for this fall's ballot.</LD>
<LD>   LAFCO's decision sets the stage for a five-month campaign that
could end with Los Angeles breaking into as many as three cities.
Together, the Valley and Hollywood make up about 40% of the city's
population of 3.7 million.</LD>
<TE>   "We've won today," said Gene La Pietra, the Hollywood nightclub
owner who is leading the secession movement. "This is a small step
for Hollywood and a great big step for Los Angeles. The people will
get to decide."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood secessionists have argued that a smaller city, of
160,000 people, would be better able to attack crime, spruce up the
area's famous boulevards and restore Hollywood to its former glory.
Like Valley secessionists, they have argued that Los Angeles is too
big to work well.</TE>
<TE>   "We're actually doing [Mayor] Jim Hahn a favor," said La Pietra.
"When it's all over, he'll have a manageable L.A."</TE>
<TE>   The vote--which prompted supporters of an independent Hollywood to
start chanting "Hooray for Hollywood!"--came after more than six
hours of debate during which some commission members expressed
concern that the cityhood plan was being rushed through without
adequate research.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not comfortable in voting for this," added County Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, who abstained. "The bottom line is I believe
we are rushing for political reasons or just to get rid of it."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, also a commission member, voted
to put the measure on the ballot, but warned that "Hollywood is in
the middle of the city. You are poking a hole in the middle of Los
Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn did not attend Wednesday's meeting, but issued a statement
saying, "I am disappointed that LAFCO chose to ignore the residents
and businesses that petitioned to be excluded from the proposed
Hollywood secession area."</TE>
<TE>   He said those seeking exclusion "understand that secession will
likely lead to higher taxes and reduced services such as police and
trash pickup."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Valley secession, which has been talked about for decades,
the Hollywood independence movement did not begin until 2000. In
August of that year, Hollywood secessionists filed petitions with
signatures from 25% of Hollywood's voters, triggering the financial
study that found that the area could survive as a city.</TE>
<TE>   A Hollywood city would have five City Council members elected at
large, a budget of $183 million a year, and would contract for most
municipal services from Los Angeles for at least one year. The
council would choose a mayor from its members and appoint a city
manager, city clerk and city treasurer. The city would begin
operations July 1, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The city's irregular borders would stretch in places as far as
Laurel Canyon to the west, Hoover Street to the east, Griffith Park
to the north and Melrose Avenue to the south.</TE>
<TE>   A new Hollywood city would be much bigger than the Hollywood that
incorporated in 1903 but then joined Los Angeles seven years later to
get water. But it would be far smaller than the proposed Valley city,
whose population would be 1.35 million.</TE>
<TE>   For secession to pass, it must capture a majority of votes both
within the breakaway area and citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles officials made last-ditch arguments against putting
the Hollywood measure on the ballot, just as they did before LAFCO
approved the Valley proposal last month. They argued, among other
things, that LAFCO had used faulty methodology to determine that a
Hollywood city was viable and that its departure would not harm Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The city also asserted that LAFCO had no right to determine that
residents of an independent Hollywood would pay the same water and
power rates as Los Angeles residents.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO found that the proposed city's revenue would exceed its
expenditures by $11 million. To maintain healthy reserves, Hollywood
would have to reduce costs by $10 million by the third year, LAFCO
said.</TE>
<TE>   A new city would have to pay Los Angeles $21.4 million in
so-called alimony payments. That would cover the $17.7 million in
revenue that Los Angeles gets from Hollywood over and above what it
spends on the area, as well as $3.6 million in property transfer
taxes that Los Angeles would lose in a breakup.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski and Pico Rivera
Councilwoman Beatrice Proo were the two LAFCO members who voted
against the Hollywood measure. They said they were not given enough
time to consider both the potential pitfalls in the breakup and
requests by some neighborhoods to be excluded from the proposed city.</TE>
<TE>   The LAFCO vote creates a new dynamic for the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   "It just expands the battlefield," said Joe Cerrell, a political
strategist who has been running campaigns since the 1950s. "Now the
mayor of Los Angeles has to fight two campaigns and it spreads his
resources thinner. It seems the secessionists have the momentum."</TE>
<TE>   "We have our work cut out for us," said Los Angeles City Council
President Alex Padilla, who opposes secession. Many Los Angeles
residents spoke up at the meeting, some delivering impassioned
speeches.</TE>
<TE>   "We have gone from being a city in its infancy to becoming the
abused child of a giant metropolis that fattened itself at the table
of annexation as its foster children starved," said Joe Shea,
president of Hollywood's Ivar Hill Community Assn., referring to the
1910 annexation by Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   " ... Here comes Hollywood reborn!"</TE>
<TE>   Some at the meeting were upset by the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Developer Tom Gilmore, who has projects in Hollywood, said the
secession proposal is full of holes and is being pushed through only
to help the Valley win cityhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't use Hollywood as a pawn to make your Valley dreams come
true," he said. "Leave us alone."</TE>
<TE>   In response to requests from Los Angeles and a Los Feliz
homeowners group, LAFCO removed a section of Griffith Park territory
from the proposed new city's boundaries, as well as a small area
north of Franklin Avenue and east of Western Avenue, including the
gated neighborhood of Laughlin Park, where residents made clear they
wanted no part of a new city.</TE>
<TE>   LAFCO also gave Los Angeles continued ownership of six fire
stations that would be within the new city. Los Angeles officials
said those stations serve broad areas of the city. The commission
also ruled that Los Angeles would retain sales tax and parking
revenue from the Hollywood &amp; Highland mall, a city redevelopment
project.</TE>
<TE>   The panel declined to require that Hollywood council members be
elected from districts, despite complaints by Latino activists that
the at-large system would dilute Latino voter strength. The activists
said they would file a complaint with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   In Hollywood, one anti-secession resident, retired management
consultant Richard Mankiewicz, said, "I don't think people who are
supporting secession have any idea what they're getting into. Knowing
human nature and California politics, [the new Hollywood leaders]
won't be much different than Los Angeles'."</TE>
<TE>   But supporters were thrilled.</TE>
<TE>   "If L.A. continues to treat Hollywood in the same manner [as in
the past] with the same service level, secession will probably
happen," said Hollywood businessman Dave Gajda, who owns four
buildings and has an interest in two nightclubs there.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters were already in a festive mood at 7:30 a.m., when about
25 of them gathered with pro-secession signs and matching new "City
Of Hollywood" T-shirts at the Hollywood &amp; Vine subway station to ride
together to the LAFCO meeting.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard High Student, 16, Stabbed on Campus; Alleged
Attacker Held</HD>
<DH>Violence: Police say the girl's assailant is a female
classmate. Victim is expected to recover.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 16-year-old girl was stabbed in the stomach at Oxnard High School
on Wednesday in what authorities said was a fight over a boyfriend.</LD>
<LD>   The victim, a junior at the school, was treated at St. John's
Regional Medical Center in Oxnard, authorities said. They said the
injuries are not life-threatening. The girl was standing near a pay
phone in the school quad about 12:20 p.m. when she was stabbed by a
17-year-old female student, who was arrested on suspicion of
attempted murder and booked into Ventura County Juvenile Hall,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The alleged assailant did not try to flee, Oxnard Police Sgt. T.
W. Lumas said.</LD>
<TE>   The identities of the girls were not released because they are
juveniles.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities gave few details about the incident, saying only that
the stabbing came after a confrontation between the girls over a
boyfriend.</TE>
<TE>   But a friend of the victim who saw the stabbing said the student
with the knife entered the campus during the lunch hour, walked up to
the victim, said a few words to her and then twice plunged the 3-inch
blade into her stomach.</TE>
<TE>   The friend, who asked to not be identified, said there was a lot
of blood and that she held the victim until an ambulance arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "She was screaming, 'I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die!' " the
17-year-old junior said. "I was just saying, 'You're going to be all
right.' "</TE>
<TE>   The friend was one of about nine witnesses interviewed by police.
Counseling will be provided today for any student requesting it,
Oxnard High Principal James Edwards said.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said he will recommend the alleged attacker be expelled,
regardless of whether she is convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The Oxnard Union High School District has a zero-tolerance policy
about weapons on campus, Edwards said. Large signs warning students
that knives and guns are illegal greet them at the front gate, and
there are posters in every classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1994, students at each of the district's six high schools
are randomly searched twice a day with hand-held metal detectors,
Supt. Gary Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   School resource officers visit one classroom in the morning and
one in the afternoon, searching about half of the students in each
class. In a school such as Oxnard High, with 2,900 students, that
represents about 1% of the student body, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our intent was for this to be a deterrent for weapons on campus,"
he said. "This shows you that even with all the security measures we
have in place, these things can happen."</TE>

<HD>2-Year Transfers to Set UC Record</HD>
<DH>Education: The number accepted is 3.8% higher than last
year and the fourth year of increases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California announced Wednesday that it has accepted
a record number of community college transfer students for the fall,
the fourth straight year of such increases.</LD>
<LD>   University-wide, the proportion of Latino, African American and
American Indian students within the transfer group stayed virtually
unchanged from last year, at 17.8%, according to annual figures
released Wednesday. But the percentage was up slightly at UC Berkeley
and UCLA, the two most competitive campuses.</LD>
<LD>   Across all eight undergraduate campuses, the university this year
admitted 13,627 transfer students from California community colleges,
a 3.8% gain from last year, the figures showed. The increase, which
comes alongside a 4.9% rise in freshman admissions for the fall, is
part of an expected decadelong jump in enrollment as the children of
baby boomers reach college age.</LD>
<TE>   UC and community college officials, who have worked together in
recent years to encourage more community college students to enter
the UC system, said they were satisfied with the gains.</TE>
<TE>   But they also noted that the increase was not as large as last
year, when 8.3% more transfer students were admitted than the year
before. They attributed the slowdown to the state's budget crisis,
which has forced cutbacks in outreach efforts and stalled plans for a
proposed "dual admission" program that would streamline UC entry for
community college students.</TE>
<TE>   UC President Richard C. Atkinson said Wednesday's figures showed
that the university was making progress in expanding access for
community college students. But he said that he hoped the number of
transfers would grow with the eventual funding of the dual admission
program, which would guarantee UC admission to qualified students who
agree to spend their first two years at community colleges. The
program was put on hold last year when the Legislature did not OK its
funding.</TE>
<TE>   California Community Colleges Chancellor Thomas J. Nussbaum noted
that the year's figures fell short of a UC goal, set in a
"partnership agreement" with Gov. Gray Davis in 2000, to increase
enrollment from the state's community colleges by 6% annually through
2005. But given the circumstances, "we're encouraged that the numbers
are still moving up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Transfers long have been viewed as a means of bringing increased
ethnic diversity to UC because the state's 108 community colleges
have a large number of underrepresented minority students.</TE>
<TE>   Across the UC system, the proportion of such students in
Wednesday's transfer figures remained almost flat from last year,
climbing slightly at several campuses and dipping at others.</TE>
<TE>   But at Berkeley , the proportion of such students admitted in the
transfer group was 16.5% this year, compared with 15.3% last year. At
UCLA, this year's figure was 21.2%. Last year's was 18.8%.</TE>

<LD>A 16-year-old Oxnard girl has been charged with vehicular
manslaughter and causing a hit-and-run crash while intoxicated after
allegedly running over a man inside his garage last week, prosecutors
said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Francisca Amezcua remained in custody Wednesday pending
arraignment in Juvenile Court on Monday, prosecutors said.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, the Channel Islands High School junior would face up
to four years in the California Youth Authority.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities alleged Amezcua was drunk May 31 when she struck
Evarado Ramirez, 32, with his pickup truck inside the garage in the
500 block of East Dollie Street.</TE>
<TE>   Amezcua fled on foot after the incident, authorities said. Ramirez
suffered head injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene,
officials said. Authorities have not stated the nature of the
relationship between Amezcua and Ramirez.</TE>

<HD>Council to Debate Hike in Water, Sewer Rates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The City Council will consider an ordinance this month to raise water
and sewer rates.</LD>
<LD>   City staff members told the council that the rate hike, the first
since 1994, is necessary because of a growing number of customers and
increasing costs to the city. The ordinance would raise water rates
by about 9% and sewer rates by about 12% and would generate nearly
$2.5 million in additional revenue a year.</LD>
<LD>   The council will hear the ordinance and public comment on June 17.
If adopted, the new rates would take effect July 29.</LD>

<HD>Saugus Blaze Threatens Homes</HD>
<DH>Firefighting: One is destroyed and others are in danger as
3,500 acres burn. Near Ojai, flames consume more than 10,600 acres.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES and CAROL CHAMBERS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A home was destroyed Wednesday by a fast-moving fire in Saugus in
northern Los Angeles County, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   By 10 p.m., the blaze, which started about 2:30 p.m., had consumed
3,500 acres and was only 15% contained, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   More than 500 firefighters rushed to protect the homes in San
Francisquito Canyon, but were thwarted by triple-digit temperatures,
dry conditions and 22 mph wind gusts.</LD>
<TE>   Along with the house in the 31000 block of San Francisquito Canyon
Road, a garage separate from that residence was damaged. Several
other outbuildings also were damaged, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   As the night wore on, firefighters moved to guard about a dozen
homes in Drinkwater Canyon near a Department of Water and Power
plant.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters fought the blaze with the aid of four water dropping
helicopters and two fixed-wing air tankers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a few miles to the north in neighboring Ventura County,
firefighters continued to battle the 5-day old Wolf fire, which has
burned 10,644 acres and was only 15% contained.</TE>
<TE>   Bracing for strong winds and high temperatures through the
weekend, firefighters will use bulldozers today to cut firebreaks
through protected wilderness to slow the wildfire north of Ojai
before it can threaten the Sespe Condor Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Using bulldozers to carve a 6- to 10-mile fire line at the
southern end of the Sespe Wilderness in the Los Padres National
Forest signals a more aggressive strategy as firefighters struggle to
control a fire that some fear could burn for weeks. Heavy machinery
is usually prohibited by federal restrictions protecting sensitive
wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still trying to set up some kind of perimeter to somehow
stop this thing," said state firefighter Bill Rodat, one of 1,600
firefighters called up from across the country to battle the fire. No
injuries have been reported.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the 5-day-old Wolf fire, which has already cost state
and county agencies more than $3.5 million, has not been determined.
But sources familiar with the investigation said Wednesday that
people shooting weapons near the Wolf Grill restaurant off California
33, about 12 miles from Ojai, may have sparked the blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Several members of a bicycling tour group said they saw people
shooting at an abandoned car in the area shortly before the fire
started Saturday afternoon. Merrick Cohn, 32, of Camarillo said he
heard shots and then saw smoke coming from the area near the
restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept seeing [fire investigators] say they didn't know why it
started, and I knew why it started," Cohn said. "I figured everyone
did."</TE>
<TE>   Although the condor sanctuary remains roughly 20 miles from the
blaze, officials said that could quickly change if winds kick up and
shift to the southeast. That is the main reason for using the
bulldozers to cut a fire line through the Sespe Wilderness, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The primary reason is to keep the fire out of the condor
sanctuary," said Aaron Gelopter, a member of an elite firefighting
team that took over directing fire coverage Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   From his post in a remote section of Rose Valley, 1 1/2 miles
south of the fire's head, state firefighter Rodat spent the day
Wednesday directing a small squadron of Bell 250 helicopters as they
swooped low to scoop water from a pond before heading back. "It's
totally inaccessible up there," Rodat said.</TE>
<TE>   A winding section of California 33 between Wheeler Springs on the
south and Lockwood Valley Road on the north will remain closed at
least until Monday, officials said. Residents of the Howard Creek
area about a mile from the wildfire stayed close to their homes as
teams of firefighters parked in their frontyards.</TE>
<TE>   A day after the Wolf fire scorched the 7,000-foot Pine Mountain
Ridge, it continued east with an expanding front line that had
stretched to the length of at least four football fields. Fueled by
miles of pine trees and thick chaparral left bone dry by last
winter's paucity of rain, flames in some spots leaped more than 100
feet high, firefighters said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are in an extreme condition," said Dennis Burns, a captain
with the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department near Oakland, who has
been assigned to track the fire's path. "We normally don't see these
conditions until September. This is going to be a long-duration
fire."</TE>
<TE>   In the San Bernardino National Forest, two big blazes were under
control, with one 95% contained and the other nearly completely
controlled. The Arrowhead fire, which officials believe could have
been started by firefighters on a training exercise, consumed 2,688
acres and destroyed four storage buildings, a trailer, bathhouse and
a commercial building. The blaze, which so far has cost $2.6 million
to fight and could reach $4 million, was 95% contained Wednesday
night, said Ruth Wenstrom of the U.S. Forest Service.</TE>
<TE>   To the south, the Bee fire near Hemet was contained Monday and was
expected to be completely controlled by, Wenstrom said. It burned 432
acres.</TE>
<TE>   Weather officials are predicting a return today of dry westerly
winds--ranging from 20 mph or more--through at least Saturday.
Temperatures are also expected to remain in the mid-90s, possibility
dipping over the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "The wind has given us a reprieve but this is going to require an
extended and focused attack on the fire," said Darren Drake, a
spokesman for the U.S Forest Service.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Panel Backs Plan to Rescue Troubled Watershed</HD>
<DH>Senate: Program to save Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta
includes funds to preserve wildlife and improve water quality.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A key Senate committee voted Wednesday to renew an ambitious program
to rescue the imperiled Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, the state's
major watershed.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm a happy camper," Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said after
the Energy and Natural Resources Committee voted 18 to 5 to
reauthorize the CalFed program for three years and to provide an
additional $1.6 billion for projects meant to preserve wildlife,
improve water quality and decrease pollution and silting.</LD>
<LD>   Last year a similar bill by Feinstein stalled in committee amid
disputes between farmers and environmentalists as well as some
partisan wrangling between Republicans and Democrats.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the disputes have been ironed out by extensive
negotiations between what are called "stakeholders" in the state's
water future. The delta provides water for 22 million people and tens
of thousands of acres of farmland.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the CalFed effort had worried that failure of
Feinstein's bill would jeopardize an unprecedented agreement among
state and federal officials, farmers, environmentalists and urban
interests to work together toward an equitable distribution of delta
water.</TE>
<TE>   Pending in the House is a CalFed reauthorization bill drafted by
Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Corona). There are differences between his bill
and the Senate version, but Calvert said he was heartened by the
committee's endorsement of the Feinstein legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "We have no shortage of water crises [in California], just a
shortage of water," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a lot of mountain left to climb but we reached an
important plateau today," said Tim Quinn, an official of the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   California officials have lobbied hard for passage of the CalFed
measure, saying it is critical to ensuring that the state has enough
water to satisfy a growing population and compensate for cutbacks
from the Colorado River.</TE>
<TE>   In a plaintive letter to Senate leaders, Gov. Gray Davis noted
that California has provided more than $1 billion for the latest
phase of CalFed. "However, the absence of a federal authorization
threatens to undermine the continued progress of this vital program,"
he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, who co-wrote the bill with Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.), reduced the cost of the legislation by a third, from $2.4
billion, to overcome objections from committee Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein also reduced the duration of the bill from five years to
three. The change means CalFed would require another congressional
vote of approval sooner, in 2005 rather than in 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Several Republicans noted that the changes also would increase the
annual federal contribution to CalFed from $480 million to $530
million. "That's an actual annual increase, not a reduction," Sen.
Larry Craig (R-Idaho) said.</TE>
<TE>   Craig was one of six Republicans to vote for the legislation
because it includes money to study expansion and construction of
water-storage projects, which are among the most contentious and
costly issues in CalFed.</TE>
<TE>   "California can't solve its water problems unless it ... is able
to take water from wet years and store it off-stream for dry years. I
think it's inescapable," Feinstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that the cost of new reservoirs would be
prohibitive. Critics of new storage projects would rather spend the
money on a broad range of conservation programs and promote water
transfers between regions of the state.</TE>
<TE>   The full Senate is not expected to consider the legislation before
late summer. Similar legislation is pending in the House of
Representatives.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) said he plans to try to broaden
Feinstein's bill by including water projects elsewhere in the West.</TE>

<HD>Laughlin E. Waters, 87; U.S. District Judge and Politician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Laughlin E. Waters, U.S. District Court senior judge based in Los
Angeles and a Republican stalwart who served as an assemblyman and
once ran briefly for governor, has died. He was 87.</LD>
<LD>   Waters died Monday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of natural
causes, court officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Known for issuing tough sentences in violent and drug-related
crimes, Waters more regularly decided civil trademark infringement
cases or entertainers' contract disputes. In the last few years, he
presided over cases to revamp special education in Los Angeles
schools, and enable Venice Beach boardwalk performers and vendors to
continue peddling their wares. He forbade limiting the number of
flights at Los Angeles International Airport to curb noise.</LD>
<TE>   Waters examined the courtroom from a plaintiff's point of view in
1994, when he and his wife, Voula, sued their insurance company after
a fire at their Hancock Park home. He told The Times afterward that
every judge should have such an educational experience, and that,
although he won his case, the trial made him doubt particularly
whether cross-examination brings out the truth.</TE>
<TE>   "I perhaps will give more thought," he said, "about whether I
should exercise greater latitude in allowing someone to explain
himself when I'm back on the bench."</TE>
<TE>   Waters was named to the Central District federal bench in 1976 by
President Ford and served for 10 years before taking senior status,
which halves a judge's caseload.</TE>
<TE>   Before he moved into semiretirement, the courtly Waters offered an
opportunity to the 1,981 attorneys who had appeared before him to
tell him what they thought of his performance. Almost 650 returned
the questionnaire, which was to be answered anonymously.</TE>
<TE>   "One guy referred to me as a crusty old judge, and that's probably
not too inaccurate," Waters told The Times. "The responses overall
were extremely encouraging. I got passing grades in every area by a
substantial margin."</TE>
<TE>   The questionnaire was part of an experimental project among
federal trial judges in the jurisdiction of the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals. Waters said he felt obligated to be the first
federal judge in Los Angeles to take part because he was chairman of
the circuit's lawyer and judge evaluation program. He said the survey
results included comments indicating that he was sometimes too
impatient and that his criminal sentences were too severe.</TE>
<TE>   Waters' federal judicial appointment by the Republican Ford capped
a long dual career in law and politics characteristic of his family.
After serving briefly as a deputy state attorney general, Waters was
elected to the Assembly in 1946 from the same Wilshire-area district
previously represented by his father and brother Frank. His sister,
Mary, was a Los Angeles Municipal Court judge.</TE>
<TE>   When Waters left the Legislature in 1953, he was named by
Republican President Eisenhower as U.S. attorney for what was then
California's Southern [now Central] District, based in Los Angeles.
He served until President Kennedy, a Democrat, took office in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Waters, former Republican state chairman as well as legislator, in
1965 became the earliest announced candidate for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination to challenge Democrat Gov. Pat Brown. But
four months later, the politically moderate Waters withdrew from the
race in favor of former San Francisco Mayor George Christopher in the
mistaken belief that Christopher could defeat conservative Ronald
Reagan in the primary.</TE>
<TE>   In the Nixon administration, Waters was named consultant to
international conferences in London and Prague and was appointed a
member of the White House Conference on Aging.</TE>
<TE>   A native of Los Angeles, Waters was educated at UCLA and the USC
School of Law. As an Army captain, he led a rifle company onto Utah

<HD>Zoo Gets Interim Manager</HD>
<DH>Appointments: Retired director of Cincinnati facility is
selected but says he doesn't want the L.A. job permanently.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edward Maruska, who ran the Cincinnati Zoo for 32 years, has been
named interim general manager of the Los Angeles Zoo, Los Angeles
Mayor James K. Hahn announced Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Maruska, 68, retired from the Cincinnati post in 2000 after a
career that included the opening of exhibits devoted to manatees and
the rain forest, the birth of the first test-tube gorilla and a
national record for the number of black rhinos born in captivity.</LD>
<LD>   He will replace outgoing zoo Director Manuel Mollinedo, who will
become general manager of the city Department of Recreation and
Parks.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn also announced that David Towne, 70, former director of the
Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle, would become a consultant to the zoo.
Both appointments are effective July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Towne, a frequent visitor to the Los Angeles Zoo, said he had
strongly recommended Maruska for the interim position.</TE>
<TE>   Both men are active in the American Zoo and Aquarium Assn. They
were on an accreditation team that identified numerous problems at
the zoo seven years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Those problems included overcrowding of the chimpanzees and other
animals, inappropriate habitats and inadequate drainage and other
infrastructure flaws.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Maruska said, Mollinedo "has done a spectacular job"
in improving the zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Towne credited Maruska with helping make Cincinnati's one of the
top zoos in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Maruska, who has a special interest in endangered amphibians,
first made his reputation in Cincinnati with innovative exhibits,
including the first "World of Insects" exhibit in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Maruska, who has been visiting the Los Angeles Zoo as a consultant
on its "Rainforest of the Americas" exhibit, said: "It's going to
take me awhile to assess the operation. There's a great deal of
construction going on, and I'm very excited about that."</TE>
<TE>   Julie Wong, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said the search for a
permanent zoo director has not begun. Maruska's and Towne's
appointments must be confirmed by the City Council, which usually
limits them to six months.</TE>
<TE>   Maruska, who is expected to be paid at the rate of about $175,000
a year, said neither he nor Towne wanted to be considered for the
permanent post.</TE>
<TE>   Towne said he thinks that the zoo, which was recently accredited,
now has a sound development plan in place.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's on a launching pad to greatness," he said. "We're
not coming in to change anything. We're coming in to keep it on
track."</TE>
<TE>   Lora La Marca of the zoo's development office said she was hopeful
that Maruska and Towne's involvement would attract strong candidates
for a permanent director. "I'm thrilled that we're going to have two
recently retired zoo directors looking after us," she said.</TE>

<HD>Carnahan Crash Causes Detailed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal investigation of the plane crash that killed Missouri
Gov. Mel Carnahan found that his pilot son, Randy, became disoriented
and lost control of his Cessna 335, in part because the key
instrument guiding him through darkness, rain and fog malfunctioned.</LD>
<LD>   The National Transportation Safety Board on Wednesday issued its
final word on the probable cause of the crash, saying the pilot
failed to control the twin-engine aircraft because he was
disoriented. The instrument failure and turbulent weather contributed
to the accident, the board said.</LD>
<LD>   The plane crashed on Oct. 16, 2000, into wooded hills south of St.
Louis, killing the governor, his son and aide Chris Sifford.</LD>
<TE>   Mel Carnahan, a Democrat, died three weeks before the election in
which he sought the Senate seat held by Republican John Ashcroft, now
the U.S. attorney general. Carnahan's name remained on the ballot and
he beat Ashcroft. His widow, Jean, was appointed to serve the first
two years of the six-year term that would have been his, and she is
now campaigning for election in November to finish out the term.</TE>
<TE>   Since the crash, investigators have focused on the main instrument
Randy Carnahan used to navigate, the primary attitude indicator.</TE>
<TE>   Also called the artificial horizon, the attitude indicator reports
a plane's position in the air, telling whether a plane is banking and
whether the nose is high or low.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB investigators concluded that the primary attitude indicator
"was not displaying properly at the time of impact."</TE>
<TE>   A smaller, secondary attitude indicator was working, investigators
concluded. Thus, "the loss of the primary attitude indicator alone
does not explain why the pilot lost control of the airplane and
crashed," the report says.</TE>

<DH>Weather: Melted snowpack worsens the drought and adds more
risk to climbing season.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>The miserable news on weather just keeps coming for Colorado. The
entire state has been declared a federal disaster area because of a
prolonged drought. Blistering temperatures and hot winds fanned at
least four wildfires over the weekend, including one that destroyed
100 homes.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes the sobering but not unexpected announcement that the
snow in Colorado's mountains is totally melted, about two months
sooner than normal.</LD>
<LD>   The absence of a snowpack worries the cities and towns that rely
on snowmelt to fill reservoirs. But the bald peaks are causing
another concern: the early onset of the Fourteener Season, usually a
four-month window in which about 250,000 climbers mount assaults on
Colorado's famous 14,000-foot peaks.</LD>
<TE>   The Fourteeners are a great source of pride in Colorado, which is
home to 54 of the nation's 91 peaks over 14,000 feet. But rescuers
and alpine experts fear the weather conditions here could conspire
for a risky climbing season. Already, they say, inexperienced and
ill-prepared climbers have attempted ascents they would have balked
at in years past, when portions would have required slogging through
snow and ice.</TE>
<TE>   Now, more enthusiasts are climbing earlier, just when the state's
high-altitude peaks are potentially more dangerous than ever. The
extensive snowmelt has exposed vast, unstable boulder fields that
usually remain snow-covered year-round and that now are prone to
slide. And, if current weather patterns hold, the early heat and lack
of moisture suggest the likelihood of sudden and severe lightning
storms in the mountains, which can prove highly dangerous to exposed
climbers.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been climbing since late April, and the summer season
usually begins in July, if you want some kind of measure of how it is
now," said Melissa Maestas, a visitor information specialist for the
San Isabel National Forest near Leadville. The forest had eight
Fourteeners, including Mt. Elbert, Colorado's highest peak at 14,433
feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Without a doubt, we are seeing more people on the mountain, and
much, much earlier. We tell them they climb at their own risk."</TE>
<TE>   Many here saw the deaths of six climbers on Washington's Mt.
Rainier and Oregon's Mt. Hood last week as cautionary tales for the
summer climbing season. Three people died on the 14,411-foot Mt.
Rainier after being trapped by a severe storm. On Mt. Hood, a
climber's misstep sent nine people plummeting into a deep crevasse,
and a helicopter dispatched to rescue the climbers crashed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a foregone conclusion that people will venture into
the back country earlier this season than in a year of average
snowpack," said Charley  Shimanski, executive director of the
American Alpine Club, based in Golden, Colo. He is also the club's
education director for search and rescue. "It's important for people
to know that the absence of snow on the ground does not change the
fact that snow is still likely at night. One variable to climbing is
gone--the snowpack--but other variables still remain."</TE>
<TE>   Ed Crothers is one of the owners of the Colorado Mountain School
in Estes Park, which is the oldest guide service in the state. The
school recently held a guide meeting and reviewed the special
problems in store for this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our biggest concern is rock fall. There are receding snowfields
with rocks held in place by snow and ice. Those rocks are no longer
being held in place," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The other problem is the weather predictions about a dry, hot
summer. That means more lightning in a state where lightning is
already a huge factor. In the middle of our discussion, we got a
burst of thunder in the mountains that could be heard in town. That
drove the point home."</TE>
<TE>   With hundreds of climbers heading to the mountains each weekend,
biologists and others are concerned that hikers will unwittingly
damage the fragile off-trail plants that are already stressed by lack
of moisture.</TE>
<TE>   "Alpine vegetation is very brown right now; it's very brittle and
fragile. We know that people can be very unaware of the landscape,"
said Bruce Morrow, outreach director for the Colorado Fourteeners
Initiative, a group that seeks to preserve the peaks' ecosystems.
"We're concerned that this year people will be less diligent about
staying on the trails and staying off fragile vegetation that looks
dead anyway. These plants take a long time to regenerate."</TE>
<TE>   In a year when climbing a Fourteener seems more possible,
Shimanski said, the belt-notching urge will increase.</TE>
<TE>   "People call peaks like Mt. Rainier 'cocktail peaks,' " he said.
"People are drawn to it because they overheard someone at a cocktail
party say they climbed Rainier. They want to be overheard at the next
cocktail party.</TE>
<TE>   "Longs Peak and Pikes Peak [in Colorado] are like that. It's going
to be an interesting summer."</TE>

<HD>Right Leads Assault on CIA, FBI at Bush's Expense</HD>
<DH>Intelligence: Leading conservatives drive for reform after
missteps, complicating the White House response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Friendly fire from fellow Republicans is looming as an increasing
risk for the White House as Congress gears up its investigations of
government intelligence failures before Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   In recent weeks, the sharpest public criticism of the CIA--and
especially the FBI--has come not from Democrats but from three
Republican senators: Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa. At the same time,
several leading conservatives have denounced the new FBI guidelines
for initiating terrorist investigations as an infringement on civil
liberties. And the Wall Street Journal editorial page, a leading
conservative voice, has urged FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III to
resign.</LD>
<LD>   None of these views appear to represent majority opinion among
Republicans. But they greatly complicate the political challenge
facing the White House as the House and Senate intelligence
committees continue their joint investigation and the Senate
Judiciary Committee joins the fray with hearings on the FBI today.</LD>
<TE>   Many analysts believe that the prominence of these GOP critics
will make it more difficult for the White House to paint the
congressional inquiries as a partisan exercise. Indeed, though Vice
President Dick Cheney last month forcefully brushed back Democratic
leaders who questioned the administration's performance before Sept.
11, the White House hasn't publicly or privately pressured the GOP
critics to lower the volume, administration and congressional sources
say.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had one bit of conversation or pressure or anything
regarding that," Shelby said.</TE>
<TE>   For now, key Democrats appear willing to let the Republican
mavericks take the point in the escalating political skirmish over
the FBI and CIA. "I am more than comfortable letting Republicans
stake out this turf and letting us come in behind them," said one
senior Senate Democratic strategist. "It is just much, much safer.
Frankly, the attacks ... are much more credible to the public coming
from Republicans."</TE>
<TE>   Appearances by matched pairs of Democratic and Republican senators
on network talk shows Sunday crystallized the contrast. The two
Democrats leading the main congressional investigations--Senate
Intelligence Committee Chairman Bob Graham of Florida and Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont--expressed
strong support for Mueller, President Bush's choice to run the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   "I have complete confidence in the director," Leahy said. "He's
the last person that should resign."</TE>
<TE>   But Shelby, appearing with Graham, and Specter, appearing with
Leahy, pointedly refused to second those endorsements. "I believe
he's got a lot to learn," Shelby said.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley, who had previously been supportive, offered Mueller a
shorter rope in his comments: "I'm willing to give ... [him] a little
longer to see if he can make the changes that need to be made within
the FBI."</TE>
<TE>   Mueller does not appear in any imminent danger of losing his job.
GOP insiders say he still has strong backing in the White House. And
one GOP senator on the Judiciary Committee said no other Republican
on the panel is nearly as cool toward the director as are Specter and
Grassley.</TE>
<TE>   "The general feeling among the rest of the Republicans on the
committee is he's a solid guy," said the senator, who asked not to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican challenges to the intelligence community's
performance draw momentum from ideological and personal currents.</TE>
<TE>   In part, the accusations of FBI incompetence and the resistance to
new FBI investigative guidelines from groups such as the American
Conservative Union merely continue a striking ideological trend of
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   With the Cold War over, conservatives long suspicious of federal
activism on issues such as education and the environment have grown
increasingly hostile toward expanded federal law enforcement
authority as well. The FBI's roles in the violent confrontations with
a white supremacist at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, and at the Branch Davidian
complex near Waco, Texas, intensified that impulse. The two incidents
"created an institutional distrust of the FBI by the right that has
never really abated," said a former Clinton Justice Department
official.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, all three of the GOP senators most critical of the
intelligence community's performance before Sept. 11 have been
longtime scourges of the agencies.</TE>
<TE>   As the New Republic magazine pointed out in a recent profile,
Shelby has been in conflict with the CIA since 1998. He was chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, and the agency
refused to cooperate with his investigation of the transfer of U.S.
missile technology to China.</TE>
<TE>   Specter, a former Philadelphia district attorney, has been banging
heads with the FBI since Ruby Ridge. He led a harshly critical
Judiciary Committee investigation of the shootings in that case,
questioned the FBI's actions in Waco and proposed legislation to
create an independent inspector general to investigate misconduct at
the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley, a conservative with a strong belief in the Senate's
oversight role, also traces his conflict with the FBI back to the
Ruby Ridge confrontation (which claimed the life of Vicki Weaver, a
woman born in Iowa, among others). Since then, Grassley has feuded
with the bureau over issues such as its investigation of the crash of
TWA Flight 800 off the coast of New York in 1996 and reports of
tampering at the FBI crime lab.</TE>
<TE>   The persistent conflict between the three senators and the
intelligence community has led some White House allies to disparage
their critiques as grudges--or a search for headlines. "If you go
back and look, these are the same people who are always griping about
the Justice Department," said a senior GOP operative close to the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   But a senior White House official said the situation is more
nuanced. "Each one is different," the official said. "Grassley is a
long-term critic of the FBI. Shelby, frankly, has a problem with [CIA
Director] George [J.] Tenet, and Specter is a former prosecutor who
has his own views."</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts in both parties also say the criticisms from the
three aren't being dismissed simply as a matter of personal
idiosyncrasies. One senior Senate GOP aide said that, although Shelby
has inspired private grumbling over the ferocity of his rhetoric,
none of the trio has faced any backlash because they are raising
"serious issues"--and are not focusing their criticism on Bush and
the White House.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Grassley argued that the questions surrounding
the agencies are so grave that he isn't concerned whether he and
other Republican critics are providing cover for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   "What makes this different than all our other hearings, going back
to Ruby Ridge, is now we are in a war on terrorism," he said. "And if
the FBI can't turn around this battleship from a Bonnie and Clyde
mentality to a Bin Laden mentality ... we can't win this war."</TE>

<HD>Hello, Dolly- and More Hurricanes That May Be Coming This
Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Arthur. Bertha. Cristobal. Dolly. The names are spelled out in
magnetized letters stuck to the wall, like those of children on the
first day of elementary school. Between now and the end of November,
any of them could become synonymous with destruction, death and
heartbreak. For these are the names chosen this year by hurricane
forecasters for the storms that can swell to encompass 1 million
cubic miles of the Earth's atmosphere, some of the mightiest forces
known to nature.</LD>
<LD>   The encouraging news is that the ability of meteorologists to
predict a hurricane's path has improved over the last decade,
becoming 1% to 2% more accurate each year, said Max Mayfield,
director of the National Hurricane Center near here. The cautionary
fact is that more Americans than ever are exposed to the dangers.</LD>
<LD>   From Portland, Maine, to Brownsville, Texas, an estimated 50
million people reside in counties along the shorelines of the
Atlantic Ocean or the Gulf of Mexico. Add inland areas that could
experience high winds or flooding, and the number of people
potentially at risk from a hurricane's brute, often lethal, force
rises to 150 million.</LD>
<TE>   "As you fly along the U.S. coastline and see the development, you
can't but be concerned that we're building for a hurricane disaster,"
said Mayfield, 53. "One of my greatest fears is that we'll have
people in cars caught in gridlock as a major storm makes landfall."</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season began this month, a time of
year when people in Florida and other Atlantic and Gulf Coast states
pay special attention to weather bulletins--or are supposed to. It
also is a season when Lixion Avila, a forecaster at the hurricane
center, must be prudent about his shopping habits. If he shows up at
a Home Depot--where many folks stock up on supplies in the event of a
major storm--people who know his face from TV might wrongly deduce
disaster is imminent.</TE>
<TE>   For the next six months, Avila's job will be studying the warm
waters and layers of air in the eastern Atlantic off Africa, where
the tropical storms that bloom into hurricanes undergo their genesis.
"Now we go into a watching mode," the 51-year-old forecaster said.</TE>
<TE>   Better computer modeling and a probe that can be dropped by a
chase plane to measure a storm's wind velocity may have made the
predictions of Avila and his colleagues more accurate, but
forecasters still cannot be anything approaching precise. Thirty-six
hours before a hurricane crashes ashore, its expected track may be
off by as much as 150 miles either way, National Hurricane Center
spokesman Frank Lepore said. That means those forecasts can be
accurate only to within 300 miles--"and that's pretty much the length
of the state of Florida," Lepore said.</TE>
<TE>   Of special concern in the Sunshine State is the number of new
residents who've never gone though a hurricane--or those who were
whipped by the fringes of a storm and emerged believing hurricanes
aren't that big a deal.</TE>
<TE>   "I do worry that a whole lot of Floridians have never experienced
the kind of storm I personally experienced 10 years ago," Gov. Jeb
Bush said Tuesday in Tallahassee. He spoke at a meeting at the
capital of state agency heads called to discuss hurricane
preparedness.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Hurricane Andrew--rated a Category 4 on the 5-point
scale--ripped into Florida south of Miami like a buzz saw, with winds
gusting to 200 mph. By the time it plowed across the state to the
Gulf, Andrew had destroyed property worth $30.5 billion and killed 43
people. About 140,000 homes, mobile homes and apartments were damaged
or pounded into rubble, and 160,000 people were evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   Florida's Republican governor was a Miami real estate developer at
the time. The younger brother of President Bush recalled how he rode
out Andrew, hunkered down at 1:30 a.m. in the hallway of his home
with his wife, their three children, his mother-in-law, another
family and two dogs. "It felt like the house was going to implode,"
Bush said. "I've never experienced anything like that before, and it
was just a very scary thing."</TE>
<TE>   With the most recent hurricane to touch the United States dating
back to September 1999--when Hurricane Floyd flooded North Carolina
and other mid- and northern Atlantic states--many Americans may be
tempted to underestimate the threat.</TE>
<TE>   A group of professional hurricane watchers at Colorado State
University is predicting a "reasonably active" storm season this
year, with a 63% probability that one or more major hurricanes will
hit somewhere along the coast of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been very fortunate over the past seven years in having
only three major hurricanes make landfall in the United States, but
we cannot expect this luck to continue," atmospheric scientist
William Gray said. "With the exploding growth in coastal populations,
people living on the southeastern U.S. coastline, especially along
the southern half of the Florida peninsula, must be prepared in the
next few decades for landfalling hurricanes and levels of destruction
many, many times greater than anything that has been witnessed in the
past 35 years."</TE>
<TE>   Even longtime residents of Florida and other hurricane-prone
states, said Mayfield, seem to suffer a bizarre sort of "hurricane
amnesia" about how devastating the storms can be. "We really need
people to understand their vulnerability to all the dangers of a
hurricane: storm surge, high winds, heavy rains, tornadoes," the
Oklahoma-born weatherman said.</TE>
<TE>   On a university campus well inland from the Atlantic, Mayfield and
his staff of 80 work in a low, flat building protected by walls of
10-inch reinforced concrete that are designed to withstand sustained
winds of 134 mph. The National Weather Service facility also tracks
Pacific hurricanes in waters as far west as Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   "Our message has been clear for decades," Mayfield said. "We want
every individual, every family, every business, every community, to
have a hurricane plan and to have it in place before a hurricane
comes knocking at their door."</TE>

<HD>Congress Fattens Its Dossier on Sept. 11 Intelligence
Errors</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Agents missed other chances to detect the plot, as
seen in a flood of evidence that a senator suggests was 'not
adequately pursued.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Congressional investigators are fielding a flurry of new tips and
documents indicating that the nation's intelligence community missed
other opportunities to anticipate the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the
chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators are getting "new reports, new documents that are
purported to be examples of evidence that was not adequately
pursued," said Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.), adding that they appear to
represent a number of additional "dots" that the CIA, the FBI and
other agencies failed to connect.</LD>
<LD>   Graham declined to provide details about the new evidence but said
it goes beyond the recent revelations about the FBI's failure to act
on warnings from a Phoenix agent or to aggressively investigate
suspected terrorist Zacarias Moussaoui in Minnesota before the
attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The flow of information has spiked in recent weeks from various
corners of the intelligence community, he said, adding that he is
increasingly convinced that U.S. intelligence officials had enough
information to stop the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Had one human being or a common group of human beings sat down
with all that information," he said, "we could have gotten to the
hijackers before they flew those four airplanes either into the World
Trade Center, the Pentagon or the ground of Pennsylvania."</TE>
<TE>   Panel Gets Background</TE>
<TE>   Graham's remarks came as House and Senate intelligence committee
members completed their second day of closed hearings on Sept. 11
intelligence failures.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of Wednesday's session was devoted to a lengthy
presentation by committee staffers on the nation's counter-terrorism
efforts of the last 15 years. The joint committee is expected to
resume its examination of that timeline today and begin calling its
first witnesses next week.</TE>
<TE>   Graham noted that much of the new information flowing into the
joint investigative committee was uncorroborated. He also said that
what he has seen has not "reached the level of importance of the
Phoenix document or the Moussaoui case."</TE>
<TE>   But other congressional sources familiar with the new material
said otherwise. "It's substantive stuff," said one aide close to the
investigation. The material "is coming in every day," he said.
"People are calling, people are volunteering information from a
variety of places."</TE>
<TE>   The surge of information signals new momentum for an inquiry that
just weeks ago seemed stalled amid internal squabbling that led to
the ouster of the investigation's staff director, as well as
accusations that the FBI and the CIA were refusing to cooperate with
the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Graham's remarks could signal fresh trouble for FBI and CIA
officials who insisted for months that they had no way to anticipate
the attacks, but who now appear to have mishandled multiple
opportunities to piece together the Sept. 11 puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, the CIA has struggled to explain why it had not
adequately notified the FBI and immigration authorities on the
travels of two Sept. 11 hijackers whom the agency had been watching
since January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller Set to Testify</TE>
<TE>   The FBI's failings are expected to be highlighted in hearings on
Capitol Hill today, when FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III is
scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee just hours
before the panel is to hear from bureau whistle-blower Coleen Rowley.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley, an attorney in the FBI's Minnesota field office, accused
Mueller in a memo of a "subtle shading/skewing of facts" in his
defense of the bureau's handling of the investigation of Moussaoui, a
suspected terrorist arrested last August after enrolling in a
Minnesota flight school.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley complained in her memo that the investigation of Moussaoui
was undermined by Washington bureaucrats who blocked efforts by the
Minnesota field office to obtain permission to place Moussaoui under
surveillance and search his computer.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials have previously said they feared that there was not
adequate evidence to support an application for a warrant under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.</TE>
<TE>   Aiming to eliminate that excuse in future cases, Sens. Charles E.
Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) said Wednesday that they plan
to introduce legislation that would make it easier to obtain a
surveillance warrant under the act. Their bill would eliminate a
requirement that authorities show that a suspect has a link to a
foreign government. Law enforcement officials say such links are not
always clear in terrorist cases.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence committee members likened Wednesday's closed-door
session to a "Terrorism 101" course covering a 10-year period after
the creation of the CIA's counter-terrorism center in 1986 and the
rise of Osama bin Laden as a primary threat to the United States in
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Graham said the panel could begin calling witnesses next week.
Among the first expected to appear before the joint committee is
Cofer Black, who headed the CIA's counter-terrorism center for three
years before accepting another assignment within the agency last
month.</TE>
<TE>   Graham also said the committee expects to hold its first public
hearings during the week of June 24.</TE>

<HD>Singer Kelly Arrested, Held on 21 Charges</HD>
<DH>Crime: Grand jury indicts R&amp;B star on child pornography

<DL></DL>
<LD>R. Kelly, the R&amp;B star who has sold millions of albums with his
inspirational ballads and languid songs of seduction, was arrested
Wednesday afternoon in Florida just hours after authorities in his
hometown of Chicago announced an indictment on 21 counts of child
pornography stemming from a now-infamous home video.</LD>
<LD>   The charges against the Grammy-winning singer, whose name is
Robert Kelly, are based on a 26-minute videotape that allegedly shows
him engaging in sexual acts with several female partners, including
one who prosecutors contend was 14 years old when the video was made.
The tape has been a tawdry sensation on the black market since it
surfaced in February and has hobbled Kelly's career.</LD>
<LD>   If convicted, Kelly could face 15 years in prison and a fine of as
much as $100,000.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly, 34, was arrested in Polk County, Fla., where he lives with
his wife and three children. The arrest infuriated his attorneys, who
said they had previously arranged for Kelly to surrender today in
Illinois. The singer maintains a recording studio and residences in
Chicago, where prosecutors say the incidents allegedly took place.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before his arrest, Kelly released a statement in his
defense:</TE>
<TE>   "Even though I don't believe any of these charges are warranted,
I'm grateful that I will have a chance to establish the truth about
me in a court of law. I have complete faith in our system of justice,
and I am confident that, when all the facts come out, people will see
that I'm no criminal."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly was expected to be held overnight in Florida and transported
to Chicago today.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago Police Supt. Terry Hilliard said at a news conference that
the videotape--which came to light after it was anonymously mailed to
the Chicago Sun-Times--had been examined by FBI forensics experts and
found to be genuine. Hilliard spoke in terms that seemed to portray
the case as a betrayal by one of the city's favored sons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate to see Mr. Kelly's talents go to waste,"
Hilliard said. "But it becomes a tragedy when behavior damages the
community. Make no mistake, these are very harmful crimes ...
involving harmful acts which damage and degrade our children [and]
diminish the integrity of our entire community."</TE>
<TE>   More serious charges of aggravated sexual abuse had been sought by
authorities, but the Cook County grand jury did not include that in
its indictment. Prosecutors may face a difficult road, because the
allegedly underage girl depicted in the footage has refused to
cooperate with the investigation. The girl's name has not been
released by police.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has been dogged in recent years by rumors of liaisons with
young girls, murmurs that were amplified by a series of lawsuits
against him and by his relationship with the late singer Aaliyah.</TE>
<TE>   That involvement would lead to Kelly's first brush with public
controversy about his personal life. In 1994, he produced "Age Ain't
Nothin' but a Number," the debut by Aaliyah, the then-15-year-old
Detroit R&amp;B singer. Later it would be revealed that the two married
that year, although the marriage was annulled. Aaliyah died last year
in a plane crash.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly has acknowledged settling two lawsuits by women who claimed
to be former lovers of the singer during their pre-adult years.
Another suit was filed in April by a woman who claims Kelly had sex
with her when she was a minor and forced her to have an abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Susan Loggans, who represents the three women in those
civil cases, is skeptical that the current case will lead to a
conviction. "For a lot of people, R. Kelly is still an icon, and
they're going to be very disinclined to convict him without the girl
[on the videotape] coming forward and saying, 'Yes that's me.' "</TE>
<TE>   The tape not only pushed the controversy into criminal territory,
it also has made Kelly an outcast of sorts in music circles. He has
been publicly chided by other artists, and his most recent album,
with rapper Jay-Z, has fizzled despite longtime expectations that it
would be a hit. Some urban radio stations around the U.S. stopped
playing Kelly's music as reports of the videotape circulated and
community groups began to organize boycotts against outlets who kept
his songs on playlists.</TE>
<TE>   Many music executives and artists declined to comment Wednesday,
but Bill Adler, a media consultant who was publicity director for
rap-pioneering Def Jam Records from 1984 through 1990, said the
unfolding scandal has been intensely watched.</TE>
<TE>   "What you saw immediately when the tape first popped up was that
Jay-Z withdrew from all of the promotion for the project, he withdrew
from R. Kelly in a big way and, looking at the sales of the project,
it seems that R. Kelly's fan base is also recoiling from him. This
was a super blockbuster that everyone thought was going through the
roof, something that was going to sell 5 million copies or more."</TE>
<TE>   "The Best of Both Worlds" has sold 690,000 copies since its April
release. Kelly's label, Jive Records (part of the Bertelsmann Music
Group), has a new disc from him titled "Loveland," due in stores by
the end of the year, but the fate of that album is now uncertain.
Label officials declined to comment Wednesday.</TE>

<HD>Utahans Seek Girl Abducted by Gunman</HD>
<DH>Crime: Alert is issued after teen is taken from bedroom.
Police said incident wasn't random.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A gunman broke into a home and took a 14-year-old girl from her
bedroom Wednesday, warning the girl's younger sister he would hurt
her if she told anyone what she saw, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Police, some with tracking dogs, began searching nearby foothills
for Elizabeth Smart before dawn, and authorities used a statewide
emergency alert system for the first time to broadcast information
about the missing child.</LD>
<LD>   At a late afternoon news conference, Elizabeth's father appealed
for her safe return.</LD>
<TE>   "Elizabeth, if you're out there, we're doing everything we
possibly can to help you. We love you, we want you to come home
safely to us," Edward Smart said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Rocky Anderson also offered a $10,000 reward for information
about her disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Police said there was no indication the man knew Elizabeth, but
authorities were looking at the family's computer to see whether the
girl had contacted strangers online and interviewed the
eighth-grader's classmates at Bryant Intermediate School.</TE>
<TE>   "This was not a purely random act. He'd have to know that she
lived there," said Wes Galloway, a victims' advocate for the Salt
Lake City police.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister waited several hours before alerting
her parents about the abduction because of the threat, police
spokesman Duane Baird said.</TE>
<TE>   The sister told police that the soft-spoken man gained entry by
forcing open a window and was armed with a small black handgun.
Elizabeth was wearing red pajamas, and the man let her take a pair of
shoes, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Baird also said the family's seven-bedroom home is listed for sale
at $1.19 million, and police are looking at a list of people who had
toured the property. Elizabeth's schoolmates attended an
end-of-school-year talent assembly Wednesday, dedicating some of the
performances to her.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope she's safe and hope she comes back soon," classmate
Tiffany Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   The incident prompted the first use of Utah's Emergency Alert
System, created in April to broadcast information as soon as possible
about an abducted child.</TE>

<HD>Lindh's Goal Was Violence, U.S. Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh joined the Taliban to commit violence rather than
to assert his freedom of expression, the government argued Wednesday
in opposing an effort to dismiss his indictment.</LD>
<LD>   The government said joining the Taliban militia was not like
joining a political party, and argued the U.S.-born Lindh had no
"combat immunity" from criminal prosecution that is granted enemy
soldiers fighting for a lawful army.</LD>
<LD>   Lindh's lawyers had portrayed him as an American who asserted his
constitutional rights when he decided to fight for Afghanistan's
former Taliban rulers. They asked U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III
to dismiss the indictment that charges Lindh with conspiring to
murder Americans, among other things.</LD>

<HD>Dentists Biggest Mercury Polluters, New Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Health: The metal is widely used in fillings and ends up in
the nation's waste water.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Coal-fired power plants are notorious for being the
biggest source of mercury pollution in the air. But now, new
attention is being directed at another, much less known source of
mercury contamination in water--dentists.</LD>
<LD>   A new report shows that dentists are the largest single source of
mercury pollution in waste water funneled into the nation's treatment
plants.</LD>
<LD>   Mercury is a potent toxin that can damage the human brain, spinal
cord, kidney and liver, and is especially dangerous for unborn
children.</LD>
<TE>   While many other sources of mercury pollution have drastically cut
their use of the heavy metal, dentists continue to use it widely in
fillings.</TE>
<TE>   ''Pretty much all the mercury they're using gets released into the
environment. Why aren't they doing more to reduce that use?'' said
Michael Bender, director of the Mercury Policy Project, a
foundation-funded group that was one of the authors of the study.</TE>
<TE>   Power plants emit mercury into the air and it falls into streams
and rivers. Many dentists flush it down their drains and it goes
directly into waste-water treatment plants, which do not effectively
filter it from the water.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement responding to the report, the American Dental Assn.
said it was aware that some particles from fillings end up in waste
water, and it urges dentists to follow proper procedures for handling
and recycling the composite used for fillings, which they refer to as
''amalgam.'' But the association argued that the mercury from their
fillings remains in a form that is not harmful to humans.</TE>
<TE>   ''However, a 1996 study found that when amalgam particles were
subjected to simulated waste-water treatment processes, no soluble
mercury was detected, even at a concentration of 1 part per
billion,'' according to the statement.</TE>
<TE>   The group stressed that it was currently implementing a new plan
to address the problem.</TE>
<TE>   The new report's authors said that dentists, through voluntary or
mandatory measures, should trap their waste mercury before it flows
into plumbing fixtures that have been contaminated with mercury for
years.</TE>
<TE>   The report referred to a 2001 study by the Assn. of Metropolitan
Sewerage Agencies that evaluated seven major municipal waste-water
treatment plants and determined that dental uses were ''by far'' the
greatest contributors to the mercury reaching their facilities. They
were responsible for 40% of the load, three times more than the next
largest contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Several other countries regulate releases of dental mercury. In
Canada, a new standard requires dentists to trap the pieces of
filling before they go down the drain. The goal is to reduce releases
by 95% by 2005.</TE>
<TE>   In May, the New Hampshire Legislature became the first in the
nation to pass legislation governing disposal methods for dental
mercury.</TE>
<TE>   The California Assembly considered a measure to phase out the use
of mercury in fillings but did not adopt it.</TE>
<TE>   The report suggests that mercury in dentistry has become the
exception while other major users of mercury have changed their
practices.</TE>
<TE>   In 1985 dental facilities used 3% of all the mercury used
nationwide. Last year, although dentists used less mercury, their use
accounted for 20% of all uses. Only two other industries--wiring
devices and switches and chloralkali--used more.</TE>
<TE>   Gina Solomon, a physician who focuses on the health effects of
mercury for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that there
was still controversy about whether the fillings put dental patients
at risk. And she stressed that those who have such fillings should
not get them removed, because taking them out heightens the chance of
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   However, she said the science is clear that the mercury that goes
down the drain can end up in the food chain.</TE>
<TE>   ''There is scientific consensus that mercury that ends up in the
waste water and water bodies will accumulate in the fish and pose a
direct human health problem to people who eat the fish; that is
uncontroversial and is something that can be fixed,'' Solomon said.</TE>

<HD>Parties Differ Sharply on Safety of Nuclear Plants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI KEMPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The philosophy and politics of homeland defense got a full airing
before a Senate committee Wednesday as Republicans and Democrats
offered sharply different views on whether nuclear power plants were
vulnerable to terrorist attack and what the government should do
about it.</LD>
<LD>   Democrats, citing Al Qaeda documents retrieved from caves in
Afghanistan as well as President Bush's State of the Union speech,
said the nation's 103 nuclear plants were a top target for terrorists
and that Americans who lived near them were more worried than ever.</LD>
<LD>   They used the almost 50% failure rate of previous ''mock attack''
tests at the power plants--conducted, on average, every eight
years--and the attacks of Sept. 11 to support their call for
beefed-up security exercises and a modernized method for threat
assessment.</LD>
<TE>   Republicans, however, insisted that nuclear plants were extremely
safe and said the country needed more of them.</TE>
<TE>   ''If I were a terrorist, the last place I would try and take over
would be a nuclear power plant,'' said Sen. George Voinovich
(R-Ohio). Led by Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire, the Republicans
also accused proponents of added plant security of pushing "an
anti-nuclear agenda.''</TE>
<TE>   The chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would not
specify what security measures the industry had taken since Sept. 11.
But he told Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) that his agency was working
closely with FBI and CIA ''analysts who evaluate threat information,
and they are not aware of a credible threat directed at a nuclear
power plant.''</TE>
<TE>   He told reporters the government was developing computer models to
show how nuclear power plants would fare if, like the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, they were attacked by commercial airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   What was billed as a straightforward hearing on proposed
amendments to the Atomic Energy Act, chaired by the Senate's lone
Independent, evolved instead into a high-octane discussion of how
much of the nation's resources to devote to homeland defense and
whether private industry or government should direct security
programs.</TE>
<TE>   ''There are limited assets to spend on security efforts, and we
need to allocate those in a careful way,'' said NRC Chairman Richard
A. Meserve.</TE>
<TE>   ''We have to deal with the fact that none of our civilian
infrastructure was built to withstand an air attack,'' he added
later. ''We have to make a decision as a country about what level of
risk we're willing to accept.''</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) said such decisions should
not be made before the nuclear power industry had completed a
vulnerability assessment.</TE>
<TE>   ''I don't believe we should be limiting ourselves before we figure
out what our needs are,'' Clinton said. The government and industry
officials must work together to determine how to make the country
safe from terrorists and how much that will cost, she said, adding,
"then it's up to Congress and the American public to decide whether
they want to bear that cost.''</TE>
<TE>   The spirited back and forth recalled the congressional debate over
whether to make airport security screeners federal employees and may
have been a preview of a broader national discussion over the Bush
administration's developing plan for national security.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Ridge, director of the Office of Homeland Security, is
scheduled to present a strategic security blueprint to President Bush
on July 1.</TE>
<TE>   A terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant ''is a terrible thing
to contemplate but we have to,'' Clinton said, adding that 20 million
people live near New York's Indian Point plant.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing revealed sharp differences over what level of
preparation is needed to defend against terrorist attack. Responding
to a question from Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman
James M. Jeffords (I-Vt.) about weaknesses in plant security, Meserve
said, ''It's very doubtful that an attacking force would have that
level of knowledge.''</TE>
<TE>   The nuclear power industry and the NRC, its federal regulator,
support a bill sponsored by Republican Sens. Smith and James M.
Inhofe of Oklahoma that would empower guards at all nuclear power
plants to carry guns.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, guards in some states cannot carry weapons or fire
their guns unless life is endangered.</TE>

<LD>College students who work long hours and study part time--a strategy
used by many to manage the costs of their educations--are far more
likely than their classmates to drop out of school, research shows.</LD>
<LD>   The study, released today by the American Council on Education,
found that 52.3% of the freshmen it tracked who worked 15 or more
hours a week and studied part time quit school within three years.</LD>
<LD>   By comparison, the dropout rate was 9.7% for students who studied
full time and held jobs ranging from one to 14 hours a week.</LD>
<TE>   "The way that a lot of students are choosing to finance their
education--namely, by working and by attending part time--can have
really negative implications for their likelihood of succeeding,"
said Jacqueline E. King, author of the study and director of the
council's Center for Policy Analysis.</TE>
<TE>   King said that some students, particularly those who are older or
who are raising children, may have no option but to work long hours
and study part time. But she said many other students could "make
other choices" that would better their chances of staying in college
and earning degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of students are just assuming that it's better to work than
to take out a student loan, and that's not necessarily the case,"
King said.</TE>
<TE>   A key factor that many part-time students overlook, King said, is
that, over time, they lose money by completing their studies more
slowly. The main reason: People generally earn far more after they
graduate, so anything that delays their degrees costs them earnings.</TE>
<TE>   "The job market today isn't the super-hot job market it was, say,
two years ago. But still, with the income you're going to command
once you finish your bachelor's degree and you're out there working
full time, it makes sense to get out into the job market," King said.</TE>
<TE>   Although working long hours appears to hinder students, the
research also showed that a part-time job might actually help
students stay in school. The dropout rate among all students,
full-timers and part-timers, who did not hold jobs was 26.7%. By
comparison, the rate was 15.8% among all students working one to 14
hours; 30.6% among those working 15 to 34 hours and 52.8% among those
working 35 or more hours.</TE>
<TE>   King speculated that students who work part time may manage their
time more efficiently than those who don't work at all.</TE>
<TE>   The findings were drawn by using federal research to track, over a
three-year period, 12,000 students who began college as freshmen in
the 1995-96 school year. The study lists as dropouts those students
who no longer were in college in the fall of 1998 and had not
received degrees. Thus they may have missed some students who later
returned to school and eventually earned degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Lucie Lapovsky, president of Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.,
and an economist specializing in higher education issues, said King's
research has broken important new ground.</TE>
<TE>   Lapovsky said that she previously recommended on her campus that
students struggling to balance school and work responsibilities cut
back their course loads. But after getting an early look at King's
research, Lapovsky reversed her policy.</TE>
<TE>   She now tells her admissions and financial aid staff to urge
students to cut their working hours so that they can improve their
odds of earning degrees.</TE>
<TE>   People working full time face the stiffest obstacles in trying to
complete their studies, according to King's research. That came as no
surprise to Jennifer Pettibone, 31, a psychology student at Mercy
College. She has worked full time most of the last decade while
trying to earn a bachelor's degree.</TE>
<TE>   Pettibone, who has worked as a waitress, bartender and restaurant
manager, said schedule conflicts were one of the main obstacles
hindering her progress in school. She often had to work when the
courses she needed were offered.</TE>
<TE>   Finding time to study and write papers was another problem. In
addition, while working full time and living on her own, Pettibone
said she earned too much money to be eligible for grants to help pay
for school, but she still had to struggle to pay for the classes she
took as a part-time student. "It's a Catch-22," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Pettibone said, she found that "the longer you
wait, the more aggravating it gets."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a year ago, Pettibone became a full-time student, spurred
by the concern that she would hurt her chances to establish a career
in psychology if she took any longer to get her degree. She took out
a loan and won grants from her college to pay for her final year of
undergraduate school.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of this summer, Pettibone expects to receive her
bachelor's degree. "I still feel like, 'Oh my God, it's never going
to happen.' "</TE>

<LD>A severely mentally retarded woman who was raped while in state care
will receive $7.6 million under a bill signed by Gov. Jeb Bush on
Wednesday, more than 10 years after the assault.</LD>
<LD>   Kimberly Godwin was raped and impregnated in 1991 while living in
a group home operated by what is now the Department of Children &amp;
Families. Her family later learned she had been abused and neglected
in the home for at least three years. A doctor performed an abortion
after determining she was not healthy enough to safely deliver the
baby.</LD>
<LD>   "We made a mistake and this child deserves better," Bush said.
"This money will go to the care of this precious person."</LD>
<TE>   Associated Press doesn't usually identify sexual assault victims,
but the family and their attorneys have chosen to make the case
public.</TE>

<HD>Romney Taxed as a Utah Resident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Mitt Romney, the former Salt Lake City Olympics chief now running for
Massachusetts governor, paid property taxes on a Utah home as his
"primary residence" from 1999 to 2001, and received a $54,000 tax
discount as a result, the Boston Globe reported Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The tax records could add to debate about whether Romney meets
Massachusetts' residential requirements to be governor. The state
constitution requires a candidate to live in Massachusetts for seven
years before an election. Romney also has a home in Belmont.</LD>
<LD>   A Romney spokesman said Romney never sought the "primary
residence" designation for his Park City, Utah, home, and both Romney
and the county assessor in Summit County, Utah, blamed it on a
clerical mistake.</LD>
<TE>   "Mitt was under-billed for his property tax," said Romney's
spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom. In Utah, nonresidents pay taxes on 100% of
the assessed value of a home, while residents pay on 55%. Romney paid
$22,599 on the home, valued at $3.8 million, about $54,000 less than
he would have paid as a nonresident, the Globe reported.</TE>

<HD>Space Shuttle Launched With New Station Crew</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The space shuttle Endeavour roared into orbit Wednesday on a flight
to deliver new residents to the International Space Station, after
nearly a week's delay.</LD>
<LD>   The launch had been postponed first by thunderstorms, then by a
leaky valve. The weather finally cooperated late Wednesday afternoon,
and the shuttle and its crew of seven climbed through low, puffy
clouds on their way to space.</LD>
<LD>   It was welcome news to the three space station astronauts, in
orbit since December. They were passing 240 miles above the Indian
Ocean near Australia, and out of communication, when Endeavour
blasted off with their replacements.</LD>
<TE>   The bulletin came 24 minutes later from Mission Control: "It's on
its way."</TE>
<TE>   "All right!" space station astronaut Daniel Bursch shouted as
crewmate Carl Walz whooped in delight.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew you would be happy to hear that," added Mission Control's
Frank Culbertson, who commanded the previous station crew. "You have
a lot to do yet. But you've done a great job up there, far exceeded
what's been done before, and we're very proud of you."</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour--the astronauts' ride home--is due to arrive at the
space station Friday.</TE>
<TE>   As a precaution against terrorists, fighter jets patrolled the
no-fly zone around the launch pad until after Endeavour's liftoff.
Also, NASA shrouded the activities of the U.S., Russian and French
crew until it was climbing aboard their spaceship.</TE>
<TE>   In midafternoon, a small plane that had taken off from a flight
school was ordered out of the restricted area and instructed to land.
The plane came no closer than 40 miles to the shuttle, Air Force
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour is due back on Earth June 17.</TE>

<HD>Air Pollution Deaths Overstated, Study Finds</HD>
<DH>Environment: Research linking smog and mortality was
flawed, second look determines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A second look at a study linking soot and smoke in the air to
mortality indicates fewer deaths than previously thought among people
exposed to high levels of the pollution.</LD>
<LD>   The findings by a team of leading researchers is rekindling debate
over air pollution and could delay a review of limits for particle
air pollution underway at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</LD>
<LD>   For years, scientists around the world have linked microscopic
specks of dust, chemicals and smoke to premature death and sickness,
and the new analysis affirms that connection. More than 100
scientific papers have been produced on the topic, including one
2-year-old study from Johns Hopkins University that examined death,
disease rates and air pollution in 90 major U.S. cities.</LD>
<TE>   Although that study, called the National Morbidity, Mortality and
Air Pollution Study, also links particle pollution to sickness and
premature death, when scientists reevaluated the paper this year they
discovered a glitch in the computer software used to calculate
statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The scientists reported that, in some cases, their original
findings overstated death rates from microscopic airborne particles.</TE>
<TE>   For example, deaths attributable to dirty air occurred only about
half as often as first believed, according to the Boston-based Health
Effects Institute, which sponsored the research.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever particle concentrations in the air increased by 10
micrograms--smoke and dust levels approach 200 micrograms on a very
hazy day in Riverside or San Bernardino--deaths caused by heart
attacks and respiratory failure increased an average of two-tenths of
1%, not four-tenths of 1% as the study first reported.</TE>
<TE>   The revision may seem small, but it is likely to be used as
ammunition in a long-running feud over national clean-air standards.
Industry groups have been battling the EPA since the agency approved
two new particle pollution standards in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The limits have not yet gone into effect. The last five years have
been spent in legal wrangling that culminated in a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling last year rejecting most of the objections in a lawsuit
brought by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Trucking
Assns.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA is in the midst of a periodic review of its particle
pollution standards. Agency officials say they have no plans to back
off stringent air pollution limits, although in light of the new
findings they say they will take more time to review the mortality
study and others that might have used the same methodology.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't pull the whole thing down. The problem is not that
great. It doesn't derail the PM [particulate matter] standard," said
EPA spokesman Joe Martyak.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the controversy is blunted because the state has
long had its own set of air pollution standards more stringent than
the national limits. The state Air Resources Board has proposed
tightening one particle pollution standard while adding another to
reflect new medical findings. A public workshop on the proposal is
scheduled today in El Monte.</TE>
<TE>   In several ways, the reassessment of the Johns Hopkins study in
question affirms what scientists and the EPA have long believed--that
daily changes in death and sickness due to air pollution correspond
to changes in pollution levels.</TE>
<TE>   "These preliminary analyses suggest that the new findings, though
resulting in smaller estimates of effect, appear to be similar to the
original in several respects," wrote Daniel Greenbaum, president of
the Health Effects Institute, in a May 20 letter.</TE>

<HD>Alleged 9/11 Mastermind Linked to Hamburg Cell</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: A '99 meeting of the Bin Laden aide and hijackers
shows his key role, investigators say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who authorities now believe conceived the
Sept. 11 attacks, apparently met with the terrorist plot's chief
suicide hijackers in 1999 in Hamburg, Germany, U.S. intelligence
officials said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   A senior intelligence official said "several different sources"
had placed Mohammed at the Hamburg apartment that was used for
meetings by three of the Arabs who are believed to have piloted the
hijacked planes, as well as by several others implicated in planning
and funding the operation.</LD>
<LD>   The new intelligence may help to solve one of the major puzzles
about Sept. 11--who outside the hijacking teams helped coordinate
their actions and provided the link to senior Al Qaeda leaders.
Mohammed is now believed to have filled at least part of that pivotal
role.</LD>
<TE>   The intelligence official said interrogation of Al Qaeda prisoners
captured in Afghanistan and elsewhere, as well as "tracing of
documents" and other raw intelligence collected in recent months,
indicated that Mohammed was one of the few people with direct
knowledge of the recruiting, training, funding and other operational
details behind the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "The number of people central to this plan was very small," said
the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "He was one of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Although Mohammed was little known to the public until this week,
officials said he has now been tied to the 1993 bombing of the World
Trade Center, a foiled 1995 attempt to bomb 12 U.S. airliners over
the Pacific, the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya, and the Sept. 11 attacks on New York and the Washington area.</TE>
<TE>   "He is the Forrest Gump of Al Qaeda," a Bush administration
official said. "He has more of a presence in some of their plots than
we had previously known."</TE>
<TE>   The official said counter-terrorism experts had focused their
attention over the last two years chiefly on the more high-profile
Abu Zubeida, the Al Qaeda operations chief who was captured in March
in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had been quiet and had stayed off the
airwaves," the official added. "In hindsight, I don't think people
appreciated how important a player he had become in the Al Qaeda
hierarchy. We are learning all that now."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed was indicted by a U.S. court in 1996 for his alleged role
in the airliner plot, but the federal arrest warrant was sealed so he
wouldn't know that authorities were scouring the globe for him.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said it is still unclear precisely when Mohammed visited
Hamburg, or which of the hijackers he met there. Mohamed Atta, Marwan
al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah--who are believed to have piloted three of
the hijacked planes--lived in the northern German city for most of
1999.</TE>
<TE>   Atta's two roommates--Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Said Bahaji--also are
suspected of participating in the plot. Unable to get a U.S. visa,
Bin al-Shibh helped wire tens of thousands of dollars to the
hijackers and to Zacarias Moussaoui, who was arrested before Sept. 11
and later was charged with conspiracy. Investigators have said
Moussaoui was supposed to take Bin al-Shibh's place as the 20th
hijacker.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed's whereabouts are unknown, although officials hinted that
at least one unsuccessful covert operation was launched to capture
him in the late 1990s in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have a real good bead on where's he been," another
intelligence official said. "Obviously we'd love to talk to him."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities are offering a reward of as much as $25 million
for information leading to his capture. He is believed to be in
Afghanistan or Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed initially was known as an accomplice to Ramzi Yousef, the
convicted mastermind of the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993
and of a 1995 plot to detonate bombs aboard 12 U.S. airliners over
the Pacific Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   According to the 1996 U.S. indictment, Yousef, using the name Dr.
Adel Sabah, rented an apartment in the Tiffany Mansion condominium
building in the San Juan section of Manila, the capital of the
Philippines, in August 1994.</TE>
<TE>   In the next two months, Yousef and Mohammed lived there and used
the location to mix chemicals for explosives. They were also in
possession of "modified timing devices," the indictment said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 1, 1994, they and a number of other men detonated an
explosive device at Manila's Greenbelt Theater. That was a test,
authorities say, for the explosive device placed 10 days later on
Philippine Airlines Flight 434 from Manila to Tokyo. The small bomb
exploded in midair, according to the indictment, killing passenger
Haruki Ikegami.</TE>
<TE>   The plot was uncovered in January 1995 when Mohammed's "bomb
factory" caught fire and authorities searching Yousef's computer
found detailed plans to blow up the airliners. Abdul Hakim Murad, a
commercial pilot who wanted to hijack planes, and Wali Khan Amin
Shah, a suspected associate of Osama bin Laden, were captured and
convicted in the plot along with Yousef.</TE>
<TE>   Also in the computer: a communication signed by "Khalid Shaikh"
and an apparently related letter that threatened to attack American
targets "in response to the financial, political and military
assistance given to the Jewish state in the occupied land of
Palestine by the American Government."</TE>
<TE>   The letter, apparently written by Mohammed and his associates,
also threatened to assassinate the president of the Philippines,
attack aircraft or even launch a biochemical attack if one of their
co-conspirators was not released from custody.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, U.S. counter-terrorism officials tried but failed to
find connections between the group and the still-embryonic terrorist
network called Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   They concluded, however, that Mohammed was unlike the low-level
"soldiers" who had helped Yousef in the airliner plot, which was
called Bojinka, Bosnian for "big noise."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, they said, appeared to be an equal to Yousef, and
someone whom Yousef trusted and respected, said one former law
enforcement official involved in that investigation and prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   "Yousef was a one-man band who planned it, built [the explosives],
and it never would have happened without him," said the official, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. "The others were a bunch of
clowns who couldn't have done it without Yousef."</TE>
<TE>   Except Mohammed, the official said. "He was someone of stature
that Yousef respected," said the former official. He also said
Mohammed was believed to be Yousef's relative by marriage.</TE>
<TE>   But Mohammed now appears to have had early links to the larger
terror network. His citizenship remains in question--the FBI says he
is from Kuwait, while other officials suspect he may be from
Baluchistan, a Pakistani province. Moreover, he has had access to
significant sums of money, an indication that others may be backing
him, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always under the impression that he had connections; he
could move around, had money and could go from one place to another,"
said the former official.</TE>
<TE>   Later, authorities linked Mohammed to the 1998 bombings of the two
U.S. embassies in Africa. On Wednesday, they said his role in those
attacks was still being investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, authorities have struggled to piece together the
complex plot, as well as the Al Qaeda hierarchy and network that
spawned it. They now have concluded that Mohammed had quietly risen
from a low-level figure to a position of relative authority.</TE>
<TE>   He had access to Zubeida and Bin Laden, and authorities now
believe that he thought up the Sept. 11 plot, possibly incorporating
elements of the first World Trade Center attack and the botched
airliner plot.</TE>
<TE>   "He's definitely a player," said the Bush administration official
Wednesday. "He's definitely a major guy. People have known about him
for a while."</TE>
<TE>   The latest information places him in Hamburg in 1999, after the
Sept. 11 cell had been assembled.</TE>
<TE>   The young Arabs who formed it had arrived in Germany over the
previous decade, but all were in Hamburg and were in contact with one
another by 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Atta came first, arriving as a student in 1992 from his home in
Egypt. In early 1999, he moved out of student housing and into a
refurbished apartment on Marienstrasse that investigators think
served as the base for the cell.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Shehhi moved to Germany from the United Arab Emirates in 1996,
settling two years later in a Hamburg apartment close to Atta's.
Jarrah arrived in the fall of 1997.</TE>
<TE>   German investigators think that the Hamburg group was chosen by Al
Qaeda for their technical skills and relative sophistication. The
investigators say the three probably were singled out at Al Qaeda
training camps in Afghanistan, probably in late 1998 or early 1999.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, German federal police say airline records show that
the three presumed pilots, plus Bin al-Shibh, flew to Pakistan in
late 1999, presumably en route to Afghanistan. The three pilots were
in Florida by July 2000, the first leg of the U.S. travel that
ultimately would end in the airborne attacks.</TE>

<HD>A Call for Segregating Truck Traffic</HD>
<DH>Highways: Congress will look at a plan to separate the
rival streams of big rigs, cars on interstates.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The mismatch between big rigs and family vehicles is a source of
constant tension and random danger on the nation's freeways as trucks
bear down on minivans and cars cut in front of fully loaded semis.</LD>
<LD>   With truckers and car drivers blaming each other for more than
450,000 crashes and 5,000 deaths a year, Congress is giving serious
consideration to separating the rival streams of traffic.</LD>
<LD>   A plan to be announced today on Capitol Hill calls for new "truck
freeways" on interstate highways that would allow heavier, longer
trucks than now permitted, but would keep them apart from cars. The
special lanes would be open to "long double" and triple trailer
combinations, as well as trucks currently allowed on the interstate.</LD>
<TE>   Truck freeways could be built on existing highway medians, and
would be separated from car lanes by concrete barriers. They would
have their own entrance and exit ramps, as well as staging areas to
assemble and disassemble trailer combinations. The cost would be
financed with tolls paid by truckers.</TE>
<TE>   The plan was drafted by the Los Angeles-based Reason Foundation, a
Libertarian think thank. Proponents--including House Transportation
Committee Chairman Don Young (R-Alaska)--say it would reduce the
number of deaths from crashes between cars and trucks while also
benefiting the industry. Bigger trucks are more efficient to operate,
leading to higher profits.</TE>
<TE>   Young would like to include a pilot program to test the idea in
next year's highway bill, an aide said.</TE>
<TE>   It could be years before the pilot program leads to changes on a
national scale because of the extensive construction work that would
be needed, the aide said.</TE>
<TE>   An economic feasibility study by the Reason Foundation found that
special lanes would reduce costs associated with the trucking
industry by $10 billion to $40 billion a year. This includes
efficiency savings for trucking companies as well as maintenance
savings for state highway departments from less truck-related damage
to freeways. The think tank proposed that trucking companies receive
a tax credit to offset the additional tolls they would pay.</TE>
<TE>   Among transportation issues, truck safety ranks as one of the most
emotional; 80% of the victims killed in crashes involving large
trucks are occupants of smaller vehicles. The government has set an
ambitious goal for reducing deaths from truck crashes, but the number
has remained at around 5,000 a year since 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "We would not be adding a single heavy truck to any lane of
interstate," said Robert Poole, a policy analyst with the Reason
Foundation and one of the plan's authors. "In fact, there is going to
be some shifting of existing truck traffic to these lanes. Big gains
for safety would come from separating the cars from the trucks."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeffrey Runge, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said the idea deserves consideration, but he had not
seen enough information to make a judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's simple public health mitigation," Runge said. "While the
principle makes sense, the devil is always in the details."</TE>
<TE>   The National Safety Council, a leading advocacy group on auto
safety, supports the plan. "We think this is a really interesting new
idea that has the potential of advancing safety," spokesman Chuck
Hurley said. "It's going to require a full and fair debate, [but] by
separating trucks and passenger cars, there can be substantial safety
benefits."</TE>
<TE>   However, another group, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety,
said it could not support longer, heavier trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government currently limits trucks to a gross weight
of 80,000 pounds. The Reason study concluded that the technology
exists to safely operate tractor-trailer combinations almost twice as
heavy.</TE>
<TE>   "A 4,000-pound automobile will be destroyed in any collision with
a large truck, regardless of whether the truck weighs 80,000 pounds,
97,000 pounds or 150,000 pounds," the Reason study said. "To make
highways safer, policymakers should shift their focus on weight and
size restrictions to ... separating automobiles and trucks wherever
possible." California does not permit triple trailer combinations or
long doubles. Poole said the Interstate 5 corridor would be an ideal
candidate for the special lanes. The truck tollways would have
specially reinforced pavement to accommodate the huge rigs.</TE>
<TE>   Trucking industry officials expressed guarded interest in the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We have had people in the past get very emotional about these
issues," said Warren Hoemann, a spokesman for the California Trucking
Assn. "Any proposal to increase size and weight must be a proposal
for safe operations, must protect the highway infrastructure and has
to make practical business sense."</TE>
<TE>   The American Trucking Assns., an industry federation, will take a
close look at the idea, spokesman Mike Russell said. "This is a very
complex proposal and we are likely to have members on both sides of
the issue. If there is some sort of offset for the proposed tolls,
that would make this worth looking at."</TE>

<HD>Debate Turns to Aid for More Terrorism Victims</HD>
<DH>Attacks: Congress weighs opening the 9/11 fund to Americans
killed in earlier bombings. Administration balks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHANNA NEUMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>As federal law enforcement agencies brace for another terrorist
attack, Washington is grappling with whether to compensate victims of
previous ones.</LD>
<LD>   Over the Bush administration's objections, the House recently
passed a bill that would open the Sept. 11 victims' fund to U.S.
citizens killed or injured in the U.S. embassy bombings in Tanzania
and Kenya in 1998--Osama bin Laden's first assault on what is legally
U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   The 11 families who lost loved ones in that incident see chilling
similarities--Americans killed on U.S. territory by Al Qaeda
terrorists, amid security warnings ignored by the U.S. government.</LD>
<TE>   But now the Senate is talking about expanding the fund even
further to include victims of the Oklahoma City bombing and the 1993
World Trade Center attack, raising thorny ethical and financial
questions about which victims and what kind of terrorism the federal
government plans to compensate in the future.</TE>
<TE>   If Congress broadens the reach of compensation to include victims
of domestic terrorism, it could set a precedent that would apply
whenever a serial killer shoots up a school or a mass murderer guns
down patrons of a fast-food restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   ''This is a recipe for bad legislation,'' said Heidi Li Feldman, a
law professor at Georgetown University Law Center. ''Historically, we
have not provided social welfare compensation to people who are
victims of domestic crime. Does the federal taxpayer really want to
soften all those losses, or was the sheer scale and drama of the
attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon a special case?''</TE>
<TE>   The White House has quietly tried to stop the bill, arguing for a
comprehensive study of principles to guide future compensation. But
no one believes President Bush will veto the bill should it reach his
desk, given the emotional outpouring of support in the House, where
the vote was 391 to 18.</TE>
<TE>   ''It is the sheer fairness of it for these 11 families,'' said
Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chief deputy majority whip in the House and
the bill's sponsor. ''Because the situation was exactly analogous to
what happened on 9/11--Americans were killed on U.S. territory and Al
Qaeda took credit--I thought this was a group we could add with the
least debate about whether we are setting any new standards. But the
truth is that all of this is new ground.''</TE>
<TE>   In the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, Congress
passed a $15-billion bailout bill meant to keep the grounded airline
industry afloat until passengers--and passenger confidence--returned.
Part of the package was unprecedented compensation, estimated at $6
billion, for victims of the attack, provided they agreed not to sue
the airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Only 55 lawmakers voted against the bill. Rep. F. James
Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), cited the very issues now churning
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   ''No entitlements were enacted by Congress to compensate victims
of the Oklahoma City bombing, earthquakes in California, hurricanes
in Florida and floods along the Mississippi River,'' he said during
House debate. ''If this entitlement is approved, does Congress really
want to say no to the victims of future tragedies?''</TE>
<TE>   Edith Bartley hopes not. Having lost her father and her brother to
Bin Laden's destruction in the embassy bombings in Africa four years
ago, she almost single-handedly muscled Congress to consider
compensation for the diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   ''Our families were the first victims of Osama bin Laden,'' said
Bartley, who was in law school when she started the campaign and is
now a Washington attorney. ''Our pleas had fallen on deaf ears. After
Sept. 11, it made it harder for Congress to ignore us.''</TE>
<TE>   For the embassy families, there is one more similarity to Sept. 11
that makes an appeal for equal treatment especially poignant. In an
administrative claim seeking from $1.5 million to $2 million for each
victim, they allege that the U.S. government knew--and
ignored--warnings that might have prevented disaster.</TE>
<TE>   According to the claim, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
repeatedly ignored warnings from the U.S. ambassador in Kenya,
Prudence Bushnell, that the embassy was vulnerable to attack. The
administration knew that an Al Qaeda cell was operating in Kenya, the
claim alleges. Bushnell flew to Washington to beg for more security,
according to the families, but Albright summarily ordered her back to
her post, threatening that unless she stopped complaining, she might
never get another posting.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's the ultimate indignity,'' said Stuart Newberger, a
Washington lawyer who represents 10 of the 11 families who lost
relatives to the bombs. (The other family elected not to seek
compensation.) ''These are families of the foreign service. The
government failed them at the time, and then they deliberately forgot
them.''</TE>
<TE>   But the Oklahoma bombing victims also feel forgotten. ''We lost
168 lives in Oklahoma City and many more were injured,'' said Sen.
Don Nickles (R-Okla.). ''It seems only fair if we are going to have
compensation for terror suffered, both New York and Oklahoma should
have equitable compensation.''</TE>
<TE>   Blunt, whose daughter went to law school with Bartley, worries
that if victims of domestic terrorism are added to the Sept. 11 fund,
it could delay or torpedo compensation for the embassy victims.</TE>
<TE>   ''I have concerns about how you define terrorist activity,'' he
said. ''Was Columbine an act of terrorism?''</TE>
<TE>   William Galston, who directs the Institute for Philosophy and
Public Policy at the University of Maryland, thinks the congressional
debate is healthy.</TE>
<TE>   ''The principle of horizontal justice says that similar cases
should be treated similarly,'' he said. ''Then there's always the
judgment call--are they similar enough? That's where the debate is. I
don't think that's a bad debate to have.''</TE>
<TE>   Leo V. Boyle, president of the American Trial Lawyers Assn., sees
little legal or moral reason not to expand the special masters' fund
to include the previous victims of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   ''I think it would be exceedingly just and right-spirited of our
country to do that,'' Boyle said.</TE>
<TE>   The emotional sway of helping victims of terrorism that was
directed at the government--whether from domestic or foreign
sources--may prove too hard for Congress to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Kavaler, a former foreign service officer in McLean, Va.,
lost his wife in the embassy bombing and took a part-time job at the
State Department so that he could raise their two daughters. Last
week, he wrote a scathing letter to Secretary of State Colin L.
Powell.</TE>
<TE>   ''I never would have thought in a million years that the
institution that I have served faithfully and honestly since 1975
would so let me down and abandon me,'' he wrote.</TE>

<HD>Study Says School Violence Often Predictable, Preventable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Evan Ramsey told friends to stand in the school's mezzanine above the
lobby if they wanted to watch him shoot the school principal to
death. Word spread and 24 students showed up, one boy clutching a
camera to record the event.</LD>
<LD>   But no one told any staff member or administrator.</LD>
<LD>   Ramsey, now serving a life term for killing the principal and
another classmate five years ago in Bethel, Alaska, is a classic case
of how such targeted school-based violence is often preventable,
according to a study released Wednesday by the U.S. Dept. of
Education and the Secret Service.</LD>
<TE>   The report will be used at training sessions around the country to
help school and law enforcement officials identify and stop potential
student attackers. It recommends ways to build trust between other
students and adults for the flow of such crucial information.</TE>
<TE>   That may involve making sure every teen on campus is personally
known by at least one teacher or counselor. And the guide urges
schools to teach students that any inhibitions about squealing on
others are less important than possibly saving lives.</TE>
<TE>   The agencies examined 37 attacks during a 25-year period,
including the 1999 Columbine High School bloodbath in Colorado that
left 15 people dead, and found similarities in the perpetrators'
approach and personalities. The violent students usually discussed
plans beforehand, had experience with weapons and were bullied. But
not all had poor grades or a mental health history, as previously
assumed.</TE>
<TE>   The federal study, entitled "Threat Assessment in Schools," found
that in 30 of the cases an attacker had told at least one person
beforehand. Nearly all of the attacks were planned at least two days
in advance, with half planned for at least a month.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who didn't mention their plans showed evidence in their
behavior before the attacks, including the student who asked his
friends to help him get ammunition and went shopping with his mother
for a trench coat.</TE>
<TE>   The threat assessment process, modeled on the Secret Service's
program to prevent political assassinations, involves interviewing
any identified student and his family to assess whether he poses any
risk. An investigation follows to determine the consequences, whether
it's arrest, expulsion or referral for psychological help.</TE>
<TE>   "Many schools approach the issue of threat assessment in an ad hoc
manner," said Bill Modzeleski, director of the education department's
Safe Schools Program. "If you don't plan, you don't practice, you
don't do this as a team, you're not going to be successful in
preventing violence."</TE>
<TE>   Officials emphasized that the guide only provides a basic
framework and that different districts and schools apply the process
in varied ways.</TE>
<TE>   Key team members should include an administrator, teacher, mental
health worker, nurse and school resource officer, with at least one

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>About 100,000 visitors a year from more than two dozen countries
where terrorists have been known to live will be required to give
fingerprints, register with the U.S. government and detail their
movements under an unprecedented plan unveiled Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Another group of nearly 100,000 foreigners who are already in the
country to work, study or visit will also be required to undergo
fingerprinting and photographing in an effort to weed out suspected
terrorists, Justice Department officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The visa registration system, marking the first time the United
States has demanded fingerprints of such a large population of
foreigners, sparked immediate protests from politicians, civil
liberties groups and Arab American advocates, who said it amounts to
wide-scale racial profiling of Muslims and Middle Easterners.</LD>
<TE>   "What is next? Forcing American Muslims to wear a star and
crescent as a means of identification for law enforcement
authorities?" asked Nihad Awad, executive director of the Council on
American-Islamic Relations in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration experts also expressed doubts about whether such a
major expansion of the mandate of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service--an agency already riddled with problems--could be
implemented effectively. And some diplomats within the Bush
administration have expressed frustration over the impact that the
proposal could have on U.S. relations abroad and on U.S. residents
traveling overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said the program "will provide a vital
line of defense in the war against terrorism," giving the INS
expanded authority to stop terrorist suspects at the border and track
foreigners once they arrive. The Justice Department is free to enact
the proposal after it undergoes a period of public review.</TE>
<TE>   Critics expressed particular frustration, however, that Ashcroft
refused to say what criteria will be used to identify the vast
majority of those foreign visa-holders subjected to the new system.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually everyone entering the country on visas from five
countries on the State Department's list of nations that sponsor
terrorism--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan and Syria--would be subjected to
fingerprinting, registration and much more rigorous questioning than
in the past about their plans in the United States, Justice
Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors from those countries make up less than a fifth of the
100,000 new visitors who would be subjected to the new registration
system, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder, Ashcroft said, would be targeted based on criteria
to determine their "risk of involvement in terrorist activity" and
whether they fall into "categories of elevated national security
concern."</TE>
<TE>   He refused to say what those categories would be, but Justice
Department officials who asked not to be identified said they would
likely include nationality, gender and age, among other factors.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official said the number of countries the
Justice Department is targeting numbers more than two dozen. Another
source placed the figure at 26, with Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt,
Kuwait, Jordan and other Middle Eastern nations among those thought
to represent a higher risk.</TE>
<TE>   The criteria for the registrations will be modeled in part on a
controversial program that authorities conducted last year in
requesting voluntary interviews with more than 5,000 young men in the
United States from mainly Middle Eastern countries, according to a
law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Golub, senior director of advocacy at the American
Immigration Lawyers Assn. in Washington, said, "These are secret
criteria from everything we can tell, and that's very worrisome....
It sends a terrible signal: If you come from a certain country,
you're a problem."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal comes on the heels of an expanded effort to do a
better job tracking and monitoring foreigners who are studying in
this country.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials, relying in part on half-century-old
regulations, say that current law already allows them to register and
fingerprint any visitor on a non-immigrant visa over age 14 who is in
this country for more than 30 days. Those provisions have rarely been
employed, but Ashcroft said the immigration vulnerabilities exposed
by the Sept. 11 hijackers--all of whom came into the country through
legitimate visas--demand extraordinary measures.</TE>
<TE>   "Our enemy's platoons infiltrate our borders, quietly blending in
with visiting tourists, students, and workers. They move unnoticed
through our ... public spaces. They wear no uniforms," Ashcroft said.</TE>
<TE>   The program has several key components: fingerprinting and
photographing those visitors who may pose higher national security
risks; subjecting them to much more rigorous questioning about their
histories and their plans and contacts in the United States;
requiring those who stay more than 30 days to submit to periodic
registration with the INS to verify that they are living, working or
studying where they said they would be; and better monitoring when
visitors leave and whether they have overstayed their visas.</TE>
<TE>   The plan vastly expands the burden on the INS' resources and
manpower, threatening to cause long delays at ports of entry once the
plan is implemented in the fall as proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Many members of Congress say the INS is already so riddled with
management problems that it should be broken up, but Justice
Department officials said a $380-million increase in President Bush's
budget request for INS upgrades should cover the expanded policing
role that the agency would assume under Ashcroft's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft said the results of a pilot program fingerprinting some
would-be visitors at selected ports of entry have been "extremely
promising."</TE>
<TE>   Running the prints against databases of known criminals and
terrorist suspects, the program has scored an average of 67 "hits"
per week, leading to the arrest of 1,400 wanted criminals in the last
five months, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrorists and wanted criminals often attempt to enter the
country using assumed names or false documents, false passports. But
fingerprints don't lie," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he noted that many European nations already have
registration programs in place that require foreign travelers to
register within a week or so of their arrival.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials acknowledged, however, that they were
unaware of any major nation that would require widespread
fingerprinting of foreigners, and that issue provoked debate in
Congress and among immigration advocates about how far the United
States should go in its effort to rein in terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.), chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, said he thought Ashcroft's plan was "a
reasonable first step in regaining control over illegal immigration
in the United States, which is currently out of control."</TE>
<TE>   But Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), while not
reaching any final conclusions on the plan, said he was "concerned
about the long arm of the federal government when it comes to taking
actions like this that may or may not be helpful and certainly may be
invasive."</TE>

contributed to this report.</TE>

revised visa regulations, The Times incorrectly stated that the new

<LD>Patterns. A matter of habit. That's all the NBA Finals have become
for Shaquille O'Neal.</LD>
<LD>   It's an established routine here in the Lakers' third consecutive
trip to the finals. O'Neal dominates Game 1, a trend that's become as
traditional as Jeffrey Osborne singing the national anthem
beforehand.</LD>
<LD>   Then O'Neal insists, "It's all about us." He teases the
stenographers. He forces the opponents, the media and any outside
consulting groups willing to take on the challenge to address all the
inherit problems in trying to stop him.</LD>
<TE>   June 7, 2000: 43 points for O'Neal in Game 1 against the Indiana
Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   June 6, 2001: 44 points for O'Neal, in an overtime loss to the
Philadelphia 76ers, followed by a week's worth of teasing the typists
in every interview session and challenging them to get his every
word, epithet and gibberish.</TE>
<TE>   Take 3 was Wednesday night. O'Neal had 36 points, 16 rebounds and
four blocked shots as the Lakers won a mundane NBA Finals opener
against the New Jersey Nets by a score of 99-94.</TE>
<TE>   Then he sat down at a microphone and saw his favorite
stenographer/victim.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is usually at his most effective in the first game of a
series. That's because opponents have no way to simulate him in their
preparation for the Lakers. It's hard enough for Western Conference
opponents who face him multiple times throughout the season.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the poor Nets, who saw him only once this year (he had a
wrist injury and sat out the teams' second meeting).</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to attack them inside," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said.
"It's always a shock to have to play against Shaquille."</TE>
<TE>   Apparently it's even a shock to out-of-town media.</TE>
<TE>   One New York Times photographer, looking at a digital photo of
O'Neal on a computer screen after the game said, "It's amazing how
big he is."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just that.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a big guy with skills," said Net backup center Aaron
Williams, one of three men given Shaq duty Wednesday night. "It's not
easy."</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd doesn't have to guard O'Neal. He does everything else
for this team, however, and he did come up with some creative
suggestions about what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to defeat him is to figure out what car he's going
to drive and put sand in the gas tank," Kidd said. "If he makes it to
the arena, we're going to be in trouble."</TE>
<TE>   Other ideas: "Put a detour sign up.</TE>
<TE>   "Send him to the Forum."</TE>
<TE>   All Net Coach Byron Scott could do was send his overmatched center
corps of Williams, starter Todd MacCulloch and reserve Jason Collins
in to guard O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   He went with a lot of single coverage, and he told them to go
ahead and foul O'Neal if the situation got desperate.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter, O'Neal made five of seven shots, the longest
coming from seven feet away. He scored 10 points in only nine minutes
of work. With the Lakers comfortably ahead, Jackson rested O'Neal for
the final three minutes of the first quarter and the first three
minutes of the second.</TE>
<TE>   But with the Nets closing on a suddenly disinterested Laker squad
and cutting a 23-point lead to three, the Lakers needed O'Neal down
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt we had to get back to basics," Kobe Bryant said. "Get
back to executing. Pound the ball inside and let Shaq take us home."</TE>
<TE>   And the Nets needed to foul him.</TE>
<TE>   "When he's getting the ball as deep as he's getting it, we try to
make him earn it from the stripe," Scott said. "Especially later in
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "The more he's trying to dominate in the paint the way he's doing,
the more I try to tell Aaron Williams, you're going to have to use up
some fouls.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's not our intention to put him on the free-throw line 20
times a game."</TE>
<TE>   He took 21 free throws on Wednesday, 16 of them in the fourth
quarter. O'Neal made only 12, a drop off from his run of 24 of his
last 32 against Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really worry about percentages," O'Neal said. "I just
have been shooting them the same way all year and I'm known to hit
them when I need to hit them."</TE>
<TE>   We've heard him say variations of that theme, what, 1,000 times
now? But that's part of O'Neal's Finals routine, too.</TE>
<TE>   But there are some changes. He made four of his last six free
throws in the final 3 1/2 minutes, and it doesn't seem so astounding
anymore.</TE>
<TE>   During one late timeout, Jackson instructed O'Neal to inbound the
ball if New Jersey scored so the Nets couldn't foul him and basically
deny the Lakers a possession.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal said to Jackson: "Those days are gone."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he said, 'They're going to foul you,' " O'Neal said. "I
was like, 'So what? Let them foul me.' "</TE>
<TE>   He was finished with his postgame interview.</TE>
<TE>   He got up, walked around the table and stared at the stenographer
as she typed away.</TE>
<TE>   Back to his usual routine, right down to the little details.</TE>

<HD>For Shaw, It Didn't 'Feel Like NBA Finals'</HD>
<DH>Game 1: Backup guard makes observation and Fox agrees,
saying early 42-19 lead probably led to a boring victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One quarter into Game 1 of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night, the
Lakers led by 15 points over the New Jersey Nets and a fan in the
upper deck at Staples Center was already complaining. "Sacramento,"
he said, "was more exciting, dude."</LD>
<LD>   And it wasn't only the natives growing restless.</LD>
<LD>   "It seemed like we got out to a big lead and then we got bored,"
reserve guard Brian Shaw said after the Lakers had sleepwalked
through a 99-94 victory. "We stopped doing the things that enabled us
to get the lead in the first place."</LD>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Magic Johnson had called the Lakers
"vulnerable," saying they would have a hard time recharging after
wrapping up a grueling Western Conference final series against the
Sacramento Kings with an overtime Game 7 victory Sunday night at
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to watch out," Johnson said. "Everybody
thinks it's going to be a cakewalk [but] ... they're going to be all
over us."</TE>
<TE>   A few hours later, the Lakers raced out to a 29-14 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Ennui settled into Staples.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a start like we had tonight gave us a false sense of
security," said forward Rick Fox, who had 14 points and eight
rebounds. "A good start was maybe what we were looking for, but maybe
it wasn't the best thing."</TE>
<TE>   Just maybe, he suggested, it had come too easily.</TE>
<TE>   "We got off to the kind of start we wanted to, offensively and
defensively, played with a lot of intensity in the first quarter, got
the lead, and then we started to experiment," Fox said. "Simplicity
in our offense is what makes us great and at times it's also what
bores us.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we create an extra angle on our triangle."</TE>
<TE>   In geometric terms, that would put the Lakers in a rectangle or a
square, which apparently is bad because the underdog Nets outscored
them, 80-70, over the last three quarters, getting a triple-double
from Jason Kidd.</TE>
<TE>   Though they never got closer than three points, the Nets kept the
crowd from leaving early.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Lakers needed reminding, but somebody spelled it out
for them on a locker room grease board: "Gave them some confidence.
Take it back."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "I think if I was a Net, I would look at the last three
quarters of that game and I would take a lot of positive things away
from them, which they did.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to be dealing with a different beast on Friday simply
because with a 20-point lead [in the second quarter, they led, 42-19]
we didn't push it to 30. We didn't squash their hopes of making this
a series."</TE>
<TE>   All because they got bored.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weird feeling out there," Shaw said. "It didn't even
feel like it was the NBA Finals. It just felt like a game, like going
through the motions. We're happy that we came away with the win, but
we know we can play better."</TE>
<TE>   A victory is a victory and all, especially in the NBA Finals, but
...</TE>
<TE>   "The way we started out it looked like it was going to be a lot
prettier than it was," Shaw said. "... They weren't hitting their
shots in the first period and our offense was real fluid. We got the
ball inside to the big guy [Shaquille O'Neal], had a lot of movement.</TE>
<TE>   "In the second quarter, we just kind of stalled with the ball, let
it stay on one side of the court, and they started to hit some shots
and the momentum swung in their favor for the last three quarters. We
know we have some work to do. We have to do a better job of staying
focused."</TE>
<TE>   No kidding, dude.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: It sure didn't seem like Game 1 of the NBA Finals,
what with the Staples Center crowd relaxed and the New Jersey Nets
overwhelmed. The opening quarter lacked the charged atmosphere
typically associated with such events, and the Lakers and their fans
welcomed the change of pace after an emotionally draining seven-game
Western Conference finals against the Sacramento Kings. The Lakers
played with purpose from the outset this time, quickly ending the
Nets' hopes of catching the two-time defending champions with their
guard down.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: How easily the Lakers breezed. They have not
had many quarters like that in these playoffs, having usually been
scrambling to overcome big early deficits or trying to hold off late
charges. It almost seemed like 2001 again.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Too many to fit here, but Shaquille O'Neal's
five-for-seven shooting and no fouls were high on the long list.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Take your pick for the Nets: 27.3% from field (six
for 22) and outrebounded, 17-10.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 10, Derek Fisher 9, Kobe Bryant 6;
Nets--Kenyon Martin 6, Jason Kidd 4, Kerry Kittles 4.</TE>

<TE>   SECOND QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Nets, determined to at least keep the Lakers
interested a while longer, rallied behind Kidd and center Todd
MacCulloch, pulling to within 12 points at halftime after trailing by
as many as 23. MacCulloch showed he planned to be more than a piece
of furniture after getting pushed around by O'Neal in the first
quarter, coming to life with six points (on three-of-five shooting)
and three rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: How calm the Nets remain under Kidd's smooth
floor guidance. It would have been easy for them to have crumbled
under the weight of their poor shooting and O'Neal's fast start, but
Kidd, who was considered the most valuable player by many this
season, keeps them cool. Also, the Lakers were in a position to put
the game away, but they seem to play at their best only when they
feel threatened.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Kidd's three-of-four shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Van Horn's one-of-four shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 6, Fox 4. Nets--Kidd 7, MacCulloch
6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Samaki Walker 5, O'Neal 3.
Nets--MacCulloch 3, Richard Jefferson 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Someone forgot to tell the Nets to give up after
the first quarter. Their Game 1 jitters apparently gone, they
outplayed the Lakers out of the locker room, suddenly making things
not so comfortable for the Staples Center crowd. It was a familiar
pattern for the Lakers, who have been out of practice with big leads.
The Nets were quicker to every loose ball and were more active in
general, with Kidd setting the tone by example. They pulled to within
60-56 on Kerry Kittles' three-pointer with 5:23 to play, but trailed
by nine entering the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: How the crowd suddenly got into the game.
Watching the Nets chip away at the Lakers' once-commanding lead
prompted fans to stop chanting, "three-peat, three-peat," and focus
on the moment. The Lakers took more interest in the Nets as well.
However, that "Make some noise" recording wasn't the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Lakers' 12-of-14 free-throw shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: Martin's two-of-nine shooting. Not exactly a
blue-light special for Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 11, O'Neal 6, Horry 5; Nets--Kidd
6, Martin 6, Van Horn 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry 4; Nets--MacCulloch 4, Kidd 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: No matter how much the Lakers or their fans hoped,
the Nets simply wouldn't go away quietly, cutting the Lakers' lead to
84-81 on two free throws by Martin with 4:47 left. They continued to
show that this series might not be as easy for the Lakers as some
believe, matching the Lakers' intensity and giving them a lot to
think about the rest of the series. In the end, the Lakers' talent
and free-throw shooting in the quarter were too much for New Jersey
to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: O'Neal's commanding presence. He had another
monster game with 36 points and 16 rebounds, but the frustration he
causes the opposition is almost as important. The Lakers went to him
almost every opportunity down the stretch, then the Nets watched as
O'Neal shot 16 free throws (making eight), fouling him repeatedly
because they couldn't move him from near the basket. The Kings can
definitely relate.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Lakers' 25 free throws (they made 15).</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Nets' shooting one for seven on three-pointers.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 14, Fox 6; Nets--Martin 9, Kidd 6.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 9; Nets--Kidd 5.</TE>

<HD>Magic, Brown Enter Hall</HD>
<DH>Basketball: Laker great and former UCLA coach honored,
along with Olson, Petrovic, Yow and Globetrotters.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Magic Johnson, whose legendary basketball career was defined by his
passion for the game, couldn't help himself Wednesday when he was
introduced as one of the newest members of the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   He got choked up.</LD>
<LD>   "That's it for me," the former Laker great explained after a
luncheon at the Biltmore Hotel. "It closes everything as far as
basketball....</LD>
<TE>   "It's like the dessert of a great career: to know people respected
the way I played, the way I approached the game, the way I played the
game."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, whose engaging personality and dazzling playmaking put
the sizzle in Showtime and helped the Lakers to five NBA
championships in the 1980s, is the most prominent member of the
hall's Class of 2002, but not the only one with Southland ties.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Brown, the well-traveled former UCLA and Clipper coach, also
will be inducted into the hall at Springfield, Mass., on Sept. 27, as
will Arizona Coach Lute Olson, whose career included stops at Anaheim
Loara and Huntington Beach Marina high schools, Long Beach City
College and Long Beach State.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be joined by Drazen Petrovic, a Croatian who played in two
Olympics and four NBA seasons before he was killed in a car crash in
1993; North Carolina State women's Coach Kay Yow, who guided the U.S.
to the gold medal in the 1988 Seoul Olympics; and the Harlem
Globetrotters, who will become the fifth team enshrined.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 24 finalists who didn't make the cut were former Laker
forward James Worthy, who played on three championship teams with
Johnson, former Laker coach Bill Sharman and Laker assistant Tex
Winter.</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson, speaking before Wednesday night's game
against the New Jersey Nets, said he was perplexed that Winter had
been passed over.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of amazing that this guy's been coaching for 55 years
in basketball, he's contributed the bulk of his knowledge to the
game, he's a ready clinician, has always been able to speak to
people, have time for people, spread the word of basketball ... and
yet the Hall of Fame has refused to acknowledge his influence on the
game," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, whose Philadelphia 76ers reached the NBA Finals last June,
guided UCLA to the NCAA championship game in 1980 before moving on to
become the only coach in NBA history to lead six teams to the
playoffs, the Clippers among them, and helping Kansas win the 1988
NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   "The experience I had at UCLA is something that I'll always
cherish," said Brown, who left in 1981 after staying for only two
seasons. "I always felt it was one of the big mistakes I made in my
life [leaving to coach the Nets]."</TE>
<TE>   Coaching, he said, is a gift.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm doing exactly what I love to do," he said, "and if it wasn't
at the professional level or college, I'd be coaching my son in high
school and be perfectly happy....</TE>
<TE>   "If I had my druthers, I would have coached ... high school
basketball on Long Island, like I was supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who grew up in North Dakota, said he never dreamed of
moving on to a major college when he was coaching in Orange County in
the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   "When I first started on the high school level," he said, "all I
wanted to do was a good job. Things broke well and I got an
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   After one season at Long Beach State, he moved on to Iowa and
Arizona, where he has guided the Wildcats to the nation's best
winning percentage over the last 15 seasons and four Final Four
appearances. They won the NCAA title in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Globetrotters, formed 76 years ago, never won a title, but
they are "ingrained in our culture as goodwill ambassadors to the
game," master of ceremonies Dick Enberg said in introducing them.
They have played more than 20,000 games in 100 countries.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to think that the Harlem Globetrotters were partly
responsible for some of the integration of [African American] players
into the NBA and the game of basketball," Globetrotter Coach Tex
Harrison said Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "The game of basketball enjoys a great popularity worldwide today
and most of it is due to the popularity ... of the Harlem
Globetrotters."</TE>
<TE>   Also enjoying a great popularity worldwide is the NBA. Much of
that is due to such players as Johnson, whose rivalry with Larry Bird
lifted the league to unprecedented heights in the 1980s and paved the
way for Michael Jordan, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and others to
cash in later.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the No. 1 pick in the 1979 NBA draft, arrived in Los
Angeles after helping Michigan State win the NCAA championship in an
epic battle against Bird and Indiana State, a rivalry that would
continue throughout the '80s with the Lakers and Boston Celtics.</TE>
<TE>   "I think everyone looked at Larry and I, we tried to make
ourselves better, as well as our teammates," Johnson said of his
adversary, who was inducted into the hall in 1998. "We played the
team game. We did anything to win....</TE>
<TE>   "We've been linked together for not only college but in our NBA
careers, so to be in the Hall of Fame with him, who is a guy I
admired ...</TE>
<TE>   "I still say that Michael was the greatest to play in the air, but
Larry was the greatest to play on the floor. He is a special guy and
it was a special time....</TE>
<TE>   "It was wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   A 12-time NBA All-Star and three-time most valuable player,
Johnson led the Lakers to titles in 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987 and 1988,
captivating fans with his radiant smile and obvious love for the
game.</TE>
<TE>   His November 1991 announcement that he had contracted HIV
effectively ended his playing career and was treated at the time as a
death notice, but Johnson is healthy and robust entering the Hall of
Fame.</TE>
<TE>   For that, he is grateful.</TE>
<TE>   "You thank God that you are here instead of my wife receiving
[posthumous recognition]," he said. "I know what a blessing it is. I
know how wonderful it is to be standing here ... and, more so, I get
to enjoy it with my family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the icing, the cake and the ice cream."</TE>

the Lakers and Boston Celtics. First overall pick in the 1979 NBA
draft, Johnson was an immediate superstar, leading the Lakers to the
1980 NBA championship (the first of his five: 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987,
1988) over the Philadelphia 76ers. In the NBA Finals, the rookie

<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't think we're in Sacramento any more, Toto.</LD>
<LD>   From the sublime to the finals. The Lakers were drained from their
previous series, they said. The Nets were awed at the start, they
said. Talk about your Herculean matchups.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, now that I think our guys got their first-quarter jitters
out of the way," said Net Coach Byron Scott, "maybe this is going to
be a better series than people think it's going to be.</LD>
<TE>   "I think our guys being in the championship series for the first
time were a little nervous and getting off to a bad start in the
first quarter obviously didn't help.... I think it's human nature. I
think guys who haven't been here, you know, you're going to be a
little nervous.</TE>
<TE>   "You know this is the biggest stage in basketball so you're going
to have some jitters and you're going to probably go out there and do
some things that you're not accustomed to.... I wasn't nervous at
all. I just wanted to calm down and relax and get back to playing
basketball."</TE>
<TE>   Oh yeah, in addition to being smaller than the Lakers and less
accomplished than the Lakers, the Nets are also less experienced than
the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Only two of the players they used Wednesday night had ever been
past the first round of the playoffs before this season. Only one,
Todd MacCulloch, had ever been in the finals, as a reserve for the
76ers last spring.</TE>
<TE>   So Friday, having added one invaluable game in the NBA Finals to
their resumes, they'll have to try it again,</TE>
<TE>   Of course, their best shot is that the Lakers doze off on them,
which is what happened Wednesday night. Fortunately for the Lakers,
they ran up a 23-point lead first, then spent the rest of the game
watching the Nets whittle it down. In case you missed the Lakers'
season, this was a nice re-enactment: fast start, nap, wake up at the
end, hope for the best.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets, of course, were coming in as massive underdogs, or as a
headline in the New York Post put it, "DAVID, MEET GOLIATH."</TE>
<TE>   Not that there weren't people who thought the Nets could win,
although most of them were Nets or Net fans or had a rooting interest
in seeing a competitive series. Speaking on behalf of the NBC
broadcast team, Bill Walton gave them an excellent chance of making
this a series (and keeping viewers from clicking over to "Survivor
III," "The Moon" or an infomercial.)</TE>
<TE>   After showing precisely why they were such massive underdogs in
the first quarter, when the Lakers toyed with them, the Nets settled
in. Led by Jason Kidd, they cut the Laker lead to 12 by halftime, and
to three in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   That was some fourth quarter, too. The Lakers, who shot 27 free
throws in their last one here against the Kings, got 25 more
Wednesday night. Not that the Nets protested because most of the time
they were grabbing Shaquille O'Neal, who shot 16 of them, making
eight.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, everyone started making a fuss about how well Shaq has
been shooting free throws, although Wednesday night, he was only 12
for 21. If he doesn't do better than that, he's going to get a lot
more practice.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that mean I won't foul him?" said Scott, noting O'Neal's
improvement. "No. I'd rather take my chances with Shaq shooting from
15 feet than three or four feet."</TE>
<TE>   Last spring as a 76er, MacCulloch had several nice moments against
O'Neal, but he was only playing as Dikembe Mutombo's backup and Shaq
may not have even known his name.</TE>
<TE>   As Phil Jackson noted, "It's always a shock to play against
Shaquille," and MacCulloch got the full treatment in the first half,
when O'Neal scored 16 points, shooting eight for 13 from the field.
However, the Nets started making it more difficult to get the ball
inside and/or the Lakers stopped trying and Shaq made only four of
nine in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   So the Nets can hope. "I think we were a little too excited to be
here, maybe, I don't know.... We just needed a while to calm down and
unfortunately, it took us too long," MacCulloch said. "It didn't get
through our heads the first couple of minutes when it needed to."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kenyon Martin: "We got their attention. We're a young team.
They came out like champions but I think we got their attention."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets say they'll be calm next time and the Lakers say they'll
be rested. For the sake of everyone involved, let's hope so.</TE>

<HD>O'Neal Finds Relief for Sore Toe</HD>

<LD>Shaquille O'Neal's doctors have not settled on a course of postseason
treatment for the center's arthritic big toe but continue to make
subtle adjustments to the orthotic piece in his right shoe.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who goes through an orthotic each game, recently has
played with more freedom, suggesting he is getting some relief from
the malady that has nagged him since early in the season.</LD>
<LD>   Laker trainer Gary Vitti and O'Neal's podiatrist, UCLA's Dr.
Robert Mohr, speak every two or three days about O'Neal's condition.
The combination of anti-inflammatory medication and orthotics has
achieved the early goal, which was to keep O'Neal playing
productively into June.</LD>
<TE>   O'Neal said during the season that surgery was a strong
possibility, but there are no current plans for that. Mohr has
stressed alternative treatments and, indeed, they have seen less
swelling in the first joint in O'Neal's big toe recently.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll make a decision after the season," Perry Rogers, O'Neal's
agent, said. "What we want to do is figure out the steps short of
surgery first. We're not going to rush into surgery."</TE>
<TE>   The recovery period for surgery is about two months, which gives
O'Neal time to consider alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to get other opinions," O'Neal said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Devean George, a free agent after the season, could return to the
Lakers, but he apparently is beginning to have his doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like it's winding down," George, a first-round pick in
1999, said of his time with the club. "It's just a feeling I've got."</TE>
<TE>   George made large strides in the offense in the first few months
of the season, when he often played the fourth quarter in place of
Rick Fox. He played only 29 minutes in the final three games of the
Western Conference finals and 11 minutes Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Laker General Manager Mitch Kupchak has said he would attempt to
re-sign the young free agents, George and Slava Medvedenko among
them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two-and-a-half hours before the game, an NBC crew knocked off a
sprinkler head in a room off the Kings' locker room, flooding a back
hallway and setting off an alarm heard throughout Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen workers mopped up the mess.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A game after the Sacramento Kings missed 14 of 30 free throws
against the Lakers in the Western Conference finals, the Nets missed
eight of their first 12 free-throw attempts.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Lakers are three victories now from their glorious three-peat,
and yet the message in Phil Jackson's handwriting on the grease board
late Wednesday night suggested they had made the NBA Finals more of a
series than it needed to be.</LD>
<LD>   "Gave them some confidence," it read. "Take it back."</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, whose generosity with leads and focus long ago became
a personality trait, defeated the New Jersey Nets, 99-94, at Staples
Center in the first game of the best-of-seven series. Game 2 is
Friday night at Staples.</LD>
<TE>   They turned a 23-point, second-quarter lead into a game. By the
end, the Nets, prodded by Jason Kidd's triple-double, twice came
within three points. The crowd, dulled by the early advantage, became
louder, but never frantic. The Lakers, dulled perhaps by the strain
of the seven-game series against Sacramento, played with more intent,
but did not panic.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal scored 14 of his 36 points and took nine of his
16 rebounds in the fourth quarter, despite missing half of his 16
free-throw attempts. And by the end, the Nets never actually had the
basketball in their hands with a chance to tie or lead.</TE>
<TE>   When the long strands of confetti fell at the end, the Lakers
tilted their heads and walked through it, fairly displeased with
their loss of concentration, but quite willing to take the final
result. Overwhelming favorites to win the series and therefore become
the fifth team to win three consecutive championships, the Lakers
happily moved past their errors and to the message Jackson had
written above his gentle admonishment: "3 mo'."</TE>
<TE>   "We came out with the intensity and focus we had in the last
series," Kobe Bryant said. "It carried over. Then, the second
quarter, third quarter, it died down."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant scored 22 points despite missing 10 of 16 field-goal
attempts. He saved the Lakers in the third quarter, when he scored 11
points and almost everybody else went bad.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox scored 14 points and Derek Fisher, breaking free of a
shooting slump that had cost him most of the postseason, made four of
seven shots and scored 13 points.</TE>
<TE>   The difference was O'Neal. While Kidd did laps around the Laker
defense and finished with 23 points, 10 assists and 10 rebounds,
O'Neal pounded Todd MacCulloch, Aaron Williams and Jason Collins--the
Nets' Shaq Pack--with spin moves and turn-around jump shots.</TE>
<TE>   In the first games of his past three NBA Finals, O'Neal has scored
43 points, 44 points and 36 points. And so he tore into the Nets, who
fouled him often, and he made 12 of 21 free throws. The Lakers shot
45 free throws to the Nets' 26, but the numbers reflected the Nets'
defense on O'Neal, particularly in the final quarter, and no one
complained afterward with any conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "I missed a couple shots that I shouldn't have missed," O'Neal
said. "You know, we've seen every type of defense. I'm sure they're
probably going to switch it up in Game 2, and I'm going to continue
to do the same thing I've been doing, taking the high-percentage
shots. And if they triple or double, I'll just kick it out."</TE>
<TE>   Net Coach Byron Scott opted for fresh bodies on O'Neal, primarily
MacCulloch early and in the middle, Williams behind MacCulloch and
then Collins for five fouls in eight minutes at the end. The Nets
threw occasional zones at the Lakers and concentrated harder on
disrupting the entry passes than doing something with O'Neal.</TE>
<TE>   "Later on in the game, the more he tries to dominate the paint
like he was doing, the more I try to tell Aaron Williams, 'You're
going to have to use up some fouls,' " Scott said. "I don't mind
getting two points and giving up one. If he hits both, then he's done
his job. But it's not our intention to put him on the free-throw line
20 times a game."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers played their 12th NBA Finals game in three years, the
Nets their first. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   At times, particularly early, there was hardly confusing the two.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets scored 36 points in the first half, the fewest given up
by the Lakers in a finals' half since the advent of the shot clock.</TE>
<TE>   That was fine for the Lakers, but he Nets did most of the work.</TE>
<TE>   They missed a lot of open jump shots, starting with Keith Van
Horn. The Lakers barely bothered to guard Kenyon Martin outside 15
feet.</TE>
<TE>   In the first quarter New Jersey missed 16 of 22 field-goal
attempts and the Lakers had a 17-4 run. O'Neal scored 10 points on
seven shots in the quarter, and Scott called two timeouts before the
series was six minutes old.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I thought we were real vulnerable that first game, knowing
the kind of energy we expended in the last series," Jackson said. "I
got them revved up for the first quarter, but we kind of let up on
the gas from the rest of that. The rest of the game, the Nets kind of
handled the action, especially in the second half."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers made half of their 26 field-goal attempts in the first
quarter, and 43.5% after that. Meantime, the Nets--led by 21 points
(on 22 shots) by Martin and Kidd's all-around play--outscored the
Lakers in every quarter but the first, after which they trailed,
29-14.</TE>
<TE>   "We just have to relax," Kidd said. "We have nothing to lose....
Nobody said it was going to be easy to win on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do it for four quarters instead of three."</TE>
<TE>   The final three quarters showed the Nets indeed will have a
shooter's chance to win some games in the series, particularly in New
Jersey, beneath familiar rims.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes, the Lakers are like a bunch of 10-year-olds, discovering a
new toy.</LD>
<LD>   Consider what happened at Staples Wednesday night. For the third
consecutive game, they were suddenly in accord that their newest best
friend should get the ball every time down the floor. And golly, look
at what happens.</LD>
<LD>   They are rewarded with the overwhelming results of his skill and
expertise, as well as the benefits of playing with one of the most
unselfish players ever to inhabit the basketball post.</LD>
<TE>   I love Shaquille O'Neal's temperament. He just plays. He's so big
and imposing that we forget that he just loves to play.</TE>
<TE>   This was all Shaq, all the time. And for the Nets, it was just too
much. No stunning analysis there. Read the box score line: 12 of 22
field goals, 12 of 21 free throws, 16 rebounds, four blocked shots
and, amazingly, only two personal fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Since murder is not an option in a civilized country, the Nets
have to try something else to defend Shaq. The best way to defend the
post is to keep the ball out of the post. And you can try doing that
with extended defense--pick the Lakers up higher when they cross the
time line or even press a lot more, or zone more. The Nets tried some
zoning Wednesday night, and it was effective for short spurts,
especially when the Lakers started jacking up some threes. If you are
the Nets, better to face those than the Shaq Slam, also known as the
Aristotle Air Hammer.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the guys Byron Scott sent against Shaq, I thought the
Stanford kid, Jason Collins, did the best. He gave a great effort,
but was so overmatched he looked like a middleweight sparring with
Mike Tyson. Collins is, for information sake, 7-feet and 260 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Collins showed the most energy, the best fight, but he doesn't
have the savvy needed to do that. Nor, will he get a call. He's one
of those guys who comes into a game and the three referees lick their
lips. In order for Collins to get a call against Shaq, Shaq would
have to mutilate him, which is entirely possible with at least three
games left in the series.</TE>
<TE>   Let's look at the other side of the coin, the play of the Nets'
best player, Jason Kidd. At times, it looked like the Lakers were
defying him to shoot behind the pick, and in the last four minutes of
the game, he missed at least two critical threes.</TE>
<TE>   He is a great player, a wonderful leader who is willing, and able,
to load a lot of weight on his shoulders and carry this team. But in
this opening game, it struck me that Kidd almost tried to do too
much. And it also looked like the rest of the Nets were more than
willing to let him.</TE>
<TE>   If I were the Nets, I'd make one slight adjustment. They seemed a
little three-point-shot happy, and while Kidd has a range that goes
out to the three-point line, I think he is more effective working
around picks a bit closer to the basket. I would pick for him a
little lower than they did in this first game, to create better
angles for him and give the Lakers less recovery time as Kidd goes to
the basket.</TE>
<TE>   The psychological aspect of this game should be addressed. The
Lakers resembled a team very comfortable with the setting. They
brought an attitude that they have been there and done that, which
they have. New Jersey, on the other hand, appeared happy just to be
there.</TE>
<TE>   That being said, the Nets' comeback that made somewhat of a game
out of it should be something they can build on for the next game. I
didn't sense that the rest of the game was so much complacency by
L.A. as it was good energy by New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   This game came down to what almost all basketball games come down
to, the two most important elements:</TE>
<TE>   * Shot allocation and shot distribution to the best players. Very
simple. The Lakers got the ball to Shaq as much as they needed to,
probably more, and won.</TE>
<TE>   * The Lakers got to the free-throw line much more than the Nets
(45 attempts to 26) and those trips for all those free shots are fast
becoming the belle aire of Laker domain.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, the Nets have to figure out a way to play Shaq. And based
on what I saw Wednesday night, with the weapons Byron Scott has at
hand, he would not only earn an NBA title for doing that, but also a
Nobel Prize in war strategy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst on the Lakers for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the
fourth-winningest active coach in major college basketball, will
begin his 14th season at Utah this fall.</TE>

<HD>Scott Has Center by Committee</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Todd MacCulloch, the New Jersey Nets' 7-foot center, approached Coach
Byron Scott the other day in an attempt to offer some insight into
defending Shaquille O'Neal, his 7-1 Laker counterpart.</LD>
<LD>   As Scott related their conversation, MacCulloch told him he
believed "he caught Shaq on a night when he was tired." Scott was not
pleased, but he has come to appreciate his center's twisted sense of
humor.</LD>
<LD>   You see, O'Neal torched MacCulloch for 40 points and 12 rebounds
in the Nets' 101-92 loss March 5 against the Lakers at Staples
Center. O'Neal sat out the Nets' 94-92 victory April 3 at East
Rutherford, N.J., because of a sprained right wrist.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a mismatch for anyone," Scott said in a more serious tone of
attempting to slow O'Neal, who began the NBA Finals with a 26.4-point
scoring average. "Are we depending on Todd to neutralize Shaq? No.
Are we going to depend on our three centers to play Shaq? Of course."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to MacCulloch, who faced O'Neal in last season's
finals while serving as Dikembe Mutombo's backup with the
Philadelphia 76ers, Scott also will call on 7-0 rookie Jason Collins
and burly 6-9 forward Aaron Williams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   By now, you probably know the oft-told story that former Laker
Coach Pat Riley trademarked the phrase, "Three-peat."</TE>
<TE>   What you might not know, what Scott explained Wednesday afternoon,
was that Riley was not alone in coming up with a catchy slogan for
the Lakers' attempt at a third consecutive NBA championship in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "We were sitting in the pool in Hawaii, trying to come up with a
phrase to motivate the guys," Scott said. "We had just won our second
championship and we were going for our third. We came up with
'Three-peat.' The next thing I knew I saw it on T-shirts and caps.
Everywhere. Then Chicago asked about using it when they were going
for three in a row. It's a catchy phrase."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but whose tongue did it roll off first?</TE>
<TE>   All Scott would say was, "I think [Riley] owes me $2 or $3
million. But I guess he was smart enough to trademark it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Kenyon Martin was suspended twice this season for a total
of seven games because of his thuggish play. He says he has learned
his lessons but won't back away from the physical side of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "What I did was I made a couple of mistakes," he said. "I'm not
going to change the way I play. I played smarter. I played the way
the game is supposed to be played."</TE>
<TE>   Martin is one of several Nets who are expected to shadow Laker
guard Kobe Bryant. Martin, at 6-9 and 230 pounds, has a size
advantage against Bryant, who is 6-7.</TE>

<LD>The first sweat has fallen, the first wounds have opened, the first
battle has been waged, and the Laker challenge is clear.</LD>
<LD>   Boredom.</LD>
<LD>   It infiltrated them worse than Mike Bibby.</LD>
<TE>   It pulled on their shorts worse than a faulty Nike drawstring.</TE>
<TE>   It swelled their shoes worse than Shaquille O'Neal's right big
toe.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' opening duel in the NBA Finals Wednesday was supposed
to be against the New Jersey Nets.</TE>
<TE>   It was, instead, against the infernal yawns.</TE>
<TE>   They won by five points but could have won by 30.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal scored 36 points but could have scored 60.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers could have soared but, instead, they shrugged, ending
their 99-94 victory with a wink and a trudge.</TE>
<TE>   "Cruise control," said Laker Coach Phil Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   It was more like power brakes.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers dashed to a 23-point lead midway through the second
quarter with everything these startled New Jersey visitors had
feared, the Santa Monica energy, the Hollywood sights.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal hit a reverse layup on a no-look pass from Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox hit a layup on a floor-length pass from Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant sank a left-handed runner in the dazed face of Kerry
Kittles.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher hit a three-pointer after grabbing a pass by a
falling-out-of-bounds Horry.</TE>
<TE>   In four consecutive possessions.</TE>
<TE>   It was wild. It was loud. It all figured.</TE>
<TE>   And then, it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   Like oversized cartoon characters, the Lakers suddenly dug their
heels into a screeching stop while a light bulb flashed above their
heads.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute! This series really is a mismatch!</TE>
<TE>   This realization intact, they spent the remainder of the evening
being outscored by 18 points, although the Nets never had the ball
with a chance to tie the game, never looked like serious contenders,
and didn't sound like it afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long, loooong series," Richard Jefferson said. "We've just
got to get one."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers need to realize it's about much more. For them, it's
about four wins, three championships, and one legacy.</TE>
<TE>   How do they want this team to be remembered?</TE>
<TE>   If they think everyone will remember them only for the heart they
showed in winning the defacto NBA championship during the Western
Conference finals against the Sacramento Kings, they are wrong.</TE>
<TE>   This team, like any team, will be remembered not by its best
games, but its final games.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, those games were the inspirational, injury-plagued
fights against the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, those games were the street brawls against the
Philadelphia 76ers.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year?</TE>
<TE>   "It seemed like a regular-season game, just going through the
motions," said Brian Shaw, the veteran guard who can feel the Laker
heartbeat better than most.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if his team appeared bored, Shaw nodded.</TE>
<TE>   "We did," he said. "Why did we do that? I don't know. But it was
weird. It wasn't like it was the NBA Finals. Everybody going through
the motions."</TE>
<TE>   The game became so dull and uninspiring, the Staples Center folks
took it upon themselves to play cheerleader, to which I would make
one suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   Shut up!</TE>
<TE>   Ten days ago on this court, as Horry stalked away after his
last-second heroics, public-address announcer Lawrence Tanter
wonderfully intoned, "Never underestimate the heart of a champion."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, it was all about a tape recording of some jackal
shouting, "Laker fans! Let's make some noise!"</TE>
<TE>   Then the recording would blare, "That's not loud enough! We can't
hear you!"</TE>
<TE>   Again and again and again.</TE>
<TE>   The game was a snooze but, what is this, Sacramento?</TE>
<TE>   You see what happens when champions don't swagger like champions?</TE>
<TE>   Somebody else tries to do it for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It is important for us, for our pride, to play to the very best
of our ability in this series," Shaw said. "We cannot get bored."</TE>
<TE>   On that same night 10 days ago, fans poured into the streets
singing, "Hor-ry, Hor-ry, Hor-ry."</TE>
<TE>   The postgame murmurings heard Wednesday were reportedly something
more like, "I paid $1,200 for a tiny seat plus $20 to a rude parking
attendant to watch this?"</TE>
<TE>   Things will be more difficult for the Lakers in Friday's Game 2.
The Nets will have more confidence. The Lakers will have only
themselves to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a new deal now," said Fox. "Instead of taking
that 20-point lead and turning it into 30 points and crushing them
and taking them out of the series, we let them back in."</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase Bryant after the second loss to Sacramento, the
Lakers aren't bored now.</TE>
<TE>   We think.</TE>

<HD>Sorry Salma, but Mimi Has Come Into His Life</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T.J. Simers</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I mentioned in the newspaper that if J-Lo, Britney or Charlize Theron
wanted Laker playoff tickets they would have to fend for themselves,
because I'm no baby-sitter, but if actress Mimi Rogers wanted to go,
I'd take care of it.</LD>
<LD>   Hey, I can't tell you how many girls I asked to dance going all
the way back to eighth grade, but I don't recall a single one saying,
"yes."</LD>
<LD>   However, when I arrived at work Wednesday, I had a message on my
answering machine: "Hi, this is Mimi Rogers. I was reading the
newspaper, and saw what you wrote. Would I like to go to a Laker
game? Yes. Yes. Yes."</LD>
<TE>   Now I've never heard a woman yell, "yes, yes, yes" like that
before, and after replaying it 20 or so times, I'm a little upset now
51 years into life to learn it just took a ticket to get that
reaction. A ticket, by the way, I didn't have.</TE>
<TE>   My first thought was to take columnist Rick Majerus' press row
seat, and that way we could also replace his mug shot in the
newspaper with Mimi's pretty face.</TE>
<TE>   "My husband and I would love to go to the game," she said.</TE>
<TE>   No. No. No.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW I had to find two Laker playoff tickets for the happy couple.</TE>
<TE>   I called Hugh Hefner, knowing he likes to go to Laker games, and
maybe just this once he'd agree to go with only five of his seven
girlfriends, but his publicist said he was busy behind closed doors
and could not be disturbed.</TE>
<TE>   I called USC President Steven Sample, because I've seen football
Coach Pete Carroll and other athletic administrators sitting in the
front row, and asked if the Prez would be using his two tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," said his secretary, and when I asked her to
transfer me to the big guy so I could find out, she hung up on me.</TE>
<TE>   My wife called, and I said I was busy trying to get Mimi Rogers
tickets for the Laker game. She wanted to know why I wasn't trying to
get a ticket for her. I told her now that I've heard Mimi's reaction
to getting a ticket, I planned on getting all kinds of tickets for
her, and that seemed to satisfy her.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I GOT two tickets from the Lakers' John Black, my new favorite PR
guy, called Mimi and made plans to meet her at halftime outside the
Chairman's Room at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Now I don't know how many times this has happened to you, but I
was just standing there as Mimi came running down the hall to throw
herself at me, and Salma Hayek turned the corner. It could have been
worse: My wife could have gotten a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE GAME was boring so I decided to challenge myself while
standing in the hallway outside of celebrity central looking for a
tall actor.</TE>
<TE>   I hope Dustin Hoffman and James Van Der Beek (Dawson's Creek)
didn't take it as an insult or think I was arrogant because I was
looking over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't have seen Jada Pinkett-Smith, Will's wife, if it hadn't
been for Salma taking offense to her advances.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm watching you," Salma said, as Pinkett-Smith told me she has a
"sweet spot for Gary Payton and I don't think Will knows about it."</TE>
<TE>   I promised it would be our little secret.</TE>
<TE>   "You look like you have a little rough edge to you just like
Gary," she said, and now I know why Brad Pitt has let himself go to
seed; sometimes it's better not to look so good and have a little
peace and quiet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIMI, AND her husband, Chris Ciaffa could not have been nicer, and
if I got two free tickets to a Laker playoff game I could probably
fake being nice for a few minutes, too. I think I could. I really do.</TE>
<TE>   Now most people know Mimi as Tom Cruise's first wife or from her
Playboy pictorial, but I've always admired her work, including movies
like "Someone to Watch Over Me," and my favorite, "Full Body
Massage."</TE>
<TE>   When we talked on the phone she said she was the mother of two
now, and I guess she detected some disappointment in my voice,
because she said, "Don't worry, I still have a body to lust for."</TE>
<TE>   That's good, because when I write down $420 on my expense report
for two tickets to the Laker game, the form requires a good reason.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I ASKED Salma if she was upset Mimi was at the game as my guest,
and she said, "I'm furious," and I thought she did a great job of
controlling her rage. "She gets free tickets, and what do I get?"</TE>
<TE>   How about Majerus' column?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE record, I asked Dodger chairman Bob Daly earlier in the
day if he would give up his ticket for the Laker game for Mimi. He
said, "no."</TE>
<TE>   It was a very short conversation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAKERS said Elisabeth Shue was also going to be in attendance
for the game, and when Times' sports editor Bill Dwyre heard that, he
said, "Owwwwwwwwghh!" and appeared as if he was going to faint.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know why people have such a fascination with celebrities.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WAS a rumor the Lakers' win over the Kings in Game 7 cost
Rick Fox $200,000 and a part in the movie, "Holes," which had been
scheduled to begin shooting last week. "I'm close to losing it, but
not yet," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He said producers changed the movie's shooting schedule, but the
part will still be his "if this series ends quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Fox hit five of eight shots and scored 14 points in Game 1,
certainly doing his part to keep his acting career alive.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Robert R.</TE>
<TE>   "Do the people at Staples Center think Laker fans are so dumb we
need to be told when to 'make some noise?' "</TE>
<TE>   That's for the actors and actresses who require direction to do
anything.</TE>

<LD>Laker executive Magic Johnson and Net Coach Byron Scott are former
Laker teammates, but their friendship is on hold, Johnson said.</LD>
<LD>   "I told him, 'I love you up until Wednesday, then I can't speak to
you for two weeks,' " Johnson said before Game 1. " 'You know I'm
going to be mad at you for two weeks. I'm going to be pacing, I'm
going to be going crazy. But I can't say hi to you for two weeks.' He
said, 'I know, Buck, I know, Buck.'</LD>
<LD>   "I wish him well against everybody else but us."</LD>
<TE>   Said Scott: "He's one of the best players, one of the best
winners, one of the most competitive guys I've ever been around, and
not just on the basketball court. We used to play softball in the
summers. We used to play cards together."</TE>
<TE>   When they ran into each other before the game, however, Johnson
and Scott couldn't help themselves. Johnson had earlier been
introduced as one of the newest members of the Basketball Hall of
Fame, and Scott had to say something.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a chance to see Earvin today," Scott said. "I congratulated
him. I gave him a big hug."</TE>

<LD>Ralph Nader apparently has plenty of time on his hands.</LD>
<LD>   The consumer advocate wants the NBA to review Game 6 of the
Western Conference finals, saying the nation's confidence has been
shaken enough lately by business headlines.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers beat the Sacramento Kings, 106-102, in the game. But
Nader, a former Green Party presidential candidate, and the League of
Fans, a sports-industry watchdog group, sent a letter to NBA
Commissioner David Stern on Tuesday asking for a review.</LD>
<TE>   "At a time when the public's confidence is shaken by headlines
reporting the breach of trust by corporate executives, it is
important, during the public's relaxation time, for there to be
maintained a sense of impartiality and professionalism in commercial
sports performances," the letter said. "That sense was severely
broken ... during Game 6."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers shot 27 free throws in the fourth quarter and scored 16
of their final 18 points at the foul line. The letter also addresses
an incident in which Kobe Bryant elbowed opponent Mike Bibby in the
nose. A foul was not called with less than 20 seconds remaining in
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless the NBA orders a review of this game's officiating,
perceptions and suspicions, however presently absent any evidence,
will abound," the letter said. "A review that satisfies the fans'
sense of fairness and deters future recurrences would be a salutary
contribution to the public trust that the NBA badly needs."</TE>

<LD>Today's die-hard Laker trivia question:</LD>
<LD>   Slava Medvedenko, from Ukraine, became the first player from his
nation to play in the NBA Finals. Can you name the four other
internationally born players who have played for the Lakers in an NBA
Finals?</LD>
<LD>   You've probably guessed Mychal Thompson of the Bahamas in 1987,
1988 and 1991. And maybe, if you thought hard enough, you remembered
that Rick Fox was born in Canada. And, of course, there was
then-Yugoslavia's Vlade Divac in 1991.</LD>
<TE>   But did you complete the list with Canada's Mike Smrek, who played
for the Lakers in the finals in 1987 and 1988?</TE>
<TE>   Didn't think so.</TE>

<HD>Kidd Is Facing Tougher Task</HD>
<DH>Game 1: Net star has triple-double in loss to Lakers but
never has the ball in a clutch possession.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New Jersey Net point guard Jason Kidd dribbled toward the basket in
the first quarter of his first NBA Finals game, head down, as
purposefully as ever. He slowed a few feet from the hoop and launched
the ball toward the basket.</LD>
<LD>   In a flash, Shaquille O'Neal appeared as if from nowhere, rising
and reaching high into the air to spike Kidd's shot out of bounds.</LD>
<LD>   Uh-oh.</LD>
<TE>   The Nets entered a brave new world Wednesday, failing to get where
Kidd took them in their earlier round victories over the Indiana
Pacers, Charlotte Hornets and Boston Celtics. Kidd leads and the Nets
follow, but not in a 99-94 loss to the Lakers on Wednesday in Game 1
at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   True, Kidd would continue to press the issue, even after it seemed
the game was lost. Although he would finish with 23 points, 10
rebounds and 10 assists, he was perhaps only the third-best player on
the court, overshadowed by O'Neal's raw power in the paint and Kobe
Bryant's finesse from one end of the floor to the other.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, the Nets' jittery start obscured all the good things
Kidd and his teammates accomplished in the second half, when they
rallied late to within three points.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line was that Kidd had a triple-double, but the ball
was never in his hands for a meaningful possession. The Nets drew
close in the fourth quarter, but never had the ball with a chance to
tie the score or take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very important to come out Friday and get a good start,"
Kidd said, referring to Game 2 of the best-of-seven series. "We can't
be down 15 or 16 points like we were tonight. Five or six points
would be OK. We have to relax. We have nothing to lose. Now we all
understand it's just like the [other rounds of the] playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd seemed a bit tentative at first, uncertain with the ball. The
Lakers made their shots at the start, but the Nets missed 16 of 22 in
the first quarter. New Jersey's players stood on the perimeter,
looking for openings that never became available. The up-tempo style
of play, triggered by Kidd, never materialized until the second half.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Lakers were in control and cruising.</TE>
<TE>   When Kidd settled into his more familiar pattern of driving,
drawing Laker defenders to him and passing to open teammates, matters
improved greatly for the Nets. Kidd, acquired in an off-season deal
with the Phoenix Suns, transformed the Nets from 26-game winners last
season to a franchise-best 52 victories in 2001-02.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to run when you keep taking the ball out of the
basket," Kidd said of the Nets' failure to push the pace. "I felt we
were a little nervous to start the game. Everybody was a little
tense. It's a learning experience for a young team that's never been
here before. We have to relax and try to go out there and execute,
take the same approach that we had against Boston."</TE>
<TE>   Kidd was masterful against the Celtics, controlling play and
averaging a triple-double (17.5 points, 11.2 rebounds and 10.2
assists) in the Nets' six-game victory in the East finals. He is
facing a dramatically different opponent here, however, starting with
Bryant, who dogged him relentlessly Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Toughened by chasing Sacramento's Mike Bibby, in particular, as
well as San Antonio's Tony Parker and Portland's Damon Stoudamire in
the earlier rounds, the Lakers now know what it takes to thwart an
elite point guard.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd presents different challenges for the Lakers. O'Neal said on
the eve of Game 1 that Kidd was his pick for the most-valuable-player
award that went to San Antonio's Tim Duncan.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, asked about stopping Kidd in Game 2 said, "It's different
if a guy is going out there and he's trying to score 40 or 50 points.
You can put the shackles on a guy like that. Jason Kidd is pretty
much all over the place, getting rebounds, getting other people
involved. If other guys are hitting shots, you can't stop that."</TE>

<LD>Things weren't looking good for NBC early on. After the Lakers made
nine straight baskets to take a 25-10 lead, one NBC executive,
watching the game in a production trailer at Staples Center, quipped,
"This is not the way we drew it up."</LD>
<LD>   As the Lakers continued to dominate the first half, it was
apparent that something was needed to save the show. Until the New
Jersey Nets came back to make things interesting for a while in
second half, that something was an entertaining halftime
show--starring none other than Charles Barkley.</LD>
<LD>   Barkley must have gotten Los Angeles viewers' attention when he
proclaimed the Nets, who were down by 12 at the time, were going to
win the series in seven games.</LD>
<TE>   He was part of an all-star cast. NBC's Bob Costas and Tom Tolbert
were joined by Barkley and TNT partners Ernie Johnson and Kenny
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley, Johnson and Smith were on hand to do a one-hour pregame
special for their network, a show that also included special guest
analyst and new Hall of Famer Magic Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   About a week and a half ago, the NBC brass and the TNT brass
decided it might be a kick if they pooled their resources for a
special halftime show.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Ebersol, NBC Sports chairman, also decided the plan should be
kept a secret.</TE>
<TE>   The first hint of what was up came near the end of the first half.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know who might show up at a Laker game," Costas
informed viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly there were Barkley, Johnson and Smith on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Barkley said the Nets had "that deer-caught-in-the-headlights
look."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the Lakers had taken their own crowd out of the game
by taking the big early lead.</TE>
<TE>   Smith talked about how the Nets needed to go to a pick-and-roll to
get Shaquille O'Neal away from the basket.</TE>
<TE>   Said Bill Walton to Marv Albert, "I can't believe that group. Are
there enough microphones? Is there enough time? Who's in charge up
there?"</TE>
<TE>   When the halftime show began and Barkley announced he was picking
the Nets, Costas said to Ernie Johnson, the host of TNT's "Inside the
NBA":</TE>
<TE>   "Ernie, this is the kind of thing you deal with on a regular
basis.</TE>
<TE>   "In the paper Charles picks the Lakers in seven. On the air
tonight before the game, he picks the Nets in seven."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson: "The best way to describe his prognostication ability, he
just wants to cover every base. In fact in the first half of this
game, he flip-flopped five times and in fact once went back and
picked Sacramento to win this series. It was stunning."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley: "I picked the Lakers in seven games. After going over
some more research this afternoon, I changed my pick before the game.
I like New Jersey to win the series.</TE>
<TE>   "I said Keith Van Horn was gonna be a star. He played terrible.
New Jersey is all right. They came out real nervous like we did [with
Phoenix] in '93 in the finals. They've never been in this situation
before. This Lakers' team is not as good as that Bulls' team. I still
like New Jersey to win."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley said he'll stick with that pick.</TE>
<TE>   Costas, referring to the TNT guys switching networks, wrapped up
the halftime show by saying, "Later this week I'll be doing a poetry
reading on C-SPAN. You won't want to miss it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the TNT pregame show, Magic Johnson talked about how great it
was being named to the Basketball Hall of Fame but expressed sadness
over teammate James Worthy not making it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a sad day in terms of that...." he said. "He always came
and did his job ... and did it on such a high level."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBA Commissioner David Stern, who appeared on the TNT show, had
this to say about Ralph Nader saying that the NBA should review the
officiating in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals:</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is fair to respond in two ways. No. 1, we monitor
every game more than you know. We work with our officials and by and
large they have a tough job and they are exceptionally good. Ralph
Nader notwithstanding ... we have the best officials in sports.</TE>
<TE>   "No. 2, I am glad that he is finished with the presidency and
moved himself up."</TE>
<TE>   Barkley chimed in with this about Nader: "He is an idiot."</TE>
<TE>   Stern: "A little respect please."</TE>
<TE>   Stern on the issue of whether or not the NBA is going to have
instant replay next year: "Yes. It is up to the owners, but if you
ask me, yes. I can't take it anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Said Barkley: "You're the boss aren't you? I thought the only vote
that mattered was the boss'."</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to Barkley to sum up things perfectly.</TE>

<LD>What? You were expecting scintillating competition? That ended Sunday
night in Sacramento, with Chris Webber deferring, Doug Christie
missing and Peja Stojakovic coming up empty.</LD>
<LD>   Game 1 of the NBA Finals, a mandated completion of this playoff
process, proved to be an uneven as the difference between the
league's half-full and half-empty conferences, with the Los Angeles
Lakers retaining their attention long enough to hold on for a 99-94
victory Wednesday night over the New Jersey Nets at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not going to blame our mental letdown," said center Shaquille
O'Neal, who lifted the Lakers with 36 points and 16 rebounds. "We
have to pick it up--and we will."</LD>
<TE>   The opening act of this anti-climax to the riveting Western
Conference finals confirmed all suspicions about the Eastern
Conference in general and the Nets in particular. Feisty? Certainly.
Complete? Not nearly enough by left-coast standards.</TE>

<LD>They left the floor shaking their heads and punching their palms,
fully aware of what they'd just squandered. Lucious Harris muttered
something to Kenyon Martin, and Martin shrugged his shoulders
ruefully. Keith Van Horn folded his fingers on the back of his head.
Jason Kidd stared blankly ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Then gazed at the Staples Center ceiling. Studied the scoreboard.</LD>
<LD>   Lakers 99, Nets 94.</LD>
<TE>   Kidd couldn't chase those numbers away during another magnificent
triple-double of an evening, and he couldn't blink them away now. He
couldn't overturn the 23-point canyon the Nets had dug for
themselves, and he couldn't retrieve the fumbled opportunity that had
slipped from their grasp.</TE>
<TE>   Turns out, there are some basketball miracles that elude even
Jason Kidd's gifted fingertips.</TE>
<TE>   And some big moments these Nets are still incapable of seizing.</TE>
<TE>   For an extended and perfectly unacceptable time, early in the
game, the Nets barely seemed capable of holding the court during a
lunchtime run at the El Segundo Y.</TE>
<TE>   There wasn't a thing about the game's first 15 minutes--after
which the Nets trailed by 23 points--that suggested this was a team
worthy of the NBA Finals.</TE>
<TE>   And there wasn't a thing about the game's next 33 minutes-- during
which they chopped 20 points off that lead, played better on both
ends of the floor, and still couldn't make their free throws--that
should trick them into believing they changed anyone's minds about
their chances of even making this a competitive series.</TE>

<LD>Before Magic Johnson took his courtside seat, the newly appointed
Hall of Famer had one more assist to give. Let the record now show
that No. 10,142 landed smack in the hands of Jason Kidd.</LD>
<LD>   "He took the baton," Johnson said. "He's magic with the ball.</LD>
<LD>   "What can I say? I'm Magic 1 and he's Magic 1-A.'</LD>
<TE>   The NBA Finals returned to L.A., and for the first time in a
decade, so did a three-dimensional point guard. Kidd played his first
game since the Eastern Conference finals, where he averaged a
triple-double against the Celtics. The last player to pull that off
was just a bounce pass away from the Staples Center floor last night.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson may still identify with the Lakers, but he admitted that
he connects with a Net. As the once-lowly team from New Jersey made
its way through the season, the playoffs and on to L.A. on the
talents of Kidd, Johnson couldn't help but ask himself: Haven't I
seen this before? "In a lot of ways," said Johnson, "we're so
similar."</TE>
<TE>   Not since 1975, when Rick Barry led the Warriors, has a team
leaned so heavily on one player to win a title. Kidd is the core of
the Nets' universe. He doesn't need to put up big scoring, rebounding
or passing numbers, but he must do all three for the Nets to shake up
a basketball nation. A bad performance by Kidd can only infect his
teammates, just like a solid effort will lift them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the few players who makes his guys better," Johnson
said. "I think there are only five or six left like that.</TE>
<TE>   "We do one thing very well, something that most guys can't do,"
Magic said. "We get the rebound and we take off. That way, we've
already beaten three guys down the floor. That's why New Jersey is so
tough. You only think you can stop him if he isn't scoring. But
there's no way you can really stop him."</TE>
