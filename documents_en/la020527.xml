as another fitness fad. But the book has sold 3 million copies, spent
more than two years on bestseller lists and is still ...</DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Phillips will not leave your local bookstore. Diet-and-exercise
guides come and go, but for the past three years, Phillips' handsome,
grinning mug and bulging biceps--which grace the cover of his book
"Body-for-Life"--have greeted anyone who wanders into the fitness
section.</LD>
<LD>   As of mid-May, this slender volume of workout plans, nutritional
counseling and motivational backslapping had been on the New York
Times bestseller list for more than two years (122 weeks). That's a
remarkable feat, given the glut of diet guides published each year
and considering that the book costs $26--pricey for a self-help
manual. ("Dr. Atkins' New Diet Revolution," by Dr. Robert Atkins, has
been on the same list for 250 weeks, but you can pick up a copy in
paperback for as little as $7.)</LD>
<LD>   In short, the book has become a publishing phenomenon. Today,
there are 3 million copies in print (publisher HarperCollins
initially printed 20,000), and it has been translated into 15
languages. Not since Barry Sears' "The Zone" made millions of
Americans swear off pasta and potatoes during the 1990s has a book
captured the imaginations of so many people in pursuit of shapelier
bodies.</LD>
<TE>   Some nutritionists dismiss Bill Phillips as a latter-day Atkins or
Sears or another self-styled guru preaching a high-protein,
low-calorie diet. But "Body-for-Life" stands apart from most other
diet books in one significant way: More than any other in recent
memory, Phillips' guide stresses the importance of building muscle
while trimming flab.</TE>
<TE>   Readers won't find a lot of talk about reducing the risk for heart
disease or cancer in "Body-for-Life." A unique feature of Phillips'
book--dozens of before-and-after photos of people who buffed their
bodies by following his creed--may be the book's strongest selling
point.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Phillips didn't invent the concept of before-and-after
photos. But no other fitness czar has ever used them to such powerful
effect. As publisher of a bodybuilding magazine called Muscle Media,
Phillips ran a contest in 1997, challenging his readers to bulk up
and slim down over a 12-week period. More than 54,000 people entered
the contest, and many of their pre- and post-challenge photos are
reproduced in "Body-for-Life." (The contest, now known as the
Body-for-Life Challenge, is still held every year.) Some
metamorphoses are astonishing: Toothpick arms sprout chiseled biceps.
Chests puff up. Belly rolls disappear, replaced by wasp waists and
six-pack abs.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to make people wonder: Are they real? Phillips'
manager, Jim Nagle, insists the photos were taken by the contestants
themselves, and there's no evidence that any of the images were
doctored. "Body-for-Life" also includes inspirational stories about
people who boosted their self-esteem and built muscle by following
advice Phillips offered in his magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "If it were just me saying what works and what doesn't, in terms
of eating right and exercising, I don't think the book would be the
success that it is," says Phillips by telephone from his home in
Golden, Colo. Readers see the striking transformations achieved by
others, Phillips says, and start thinking "maybe this really will
work for me."</TE>
<TE>   Started With Newsletter About Bodybuilding</TE>
<TE>   Phillips, 37, grew up in Golden, the youngest son of an attorney
and a stay-at-home mom (he has an older brother and sister). "It was
a real small-town lifestyle," Phillips says, recalling days spent
hiking in the Rocky Mountains. He participated in sports
too--football, wrestling, and track and field--but one day realized
he enjoyed training and getting in shape more than competing on the
playing field.</TE>
<TE>   To make tuition money while attending the University of Colorado,
he self-published a newsletter that contained information about
bodybuilding and strength training, basing his tips on research
gleaned from anatomy and physiology books and wisdom he picked up
from fellow devotees of the weight room.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips admits to taking anabolic steroids to pump up his
physique in the 1980s but now publicly condemns the use of
performance-enhancing drugs. However, Phillips says dietary
supplements are one key to a fitter figure--so much that he bought a
company called EAS, for Experimental and Applied Sciences, in 1995.
EAS manufactures and sells a variety of dietary supplements,
including muscle-building pills and powders such as creatine.
Phillips owned EAS until 1999, when he sold it to a group called
North Castle Partners. He retains a minority interest.</TE>
<TE>   The eight-page, photocopied newsletter Phillips produced from his
apartment eventually became Muscle Media magazine, which Phillips
says today has 750,000 regular readers.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips is not a certified fitness trainer and, although he took
premed classes at the University of Colorado, he never earned a
degree. Nonetheless, Bill Phillips has become the man legions of
Americans turn to for health advice.</TE>
<TE>   Phillips doesn't pretend his plan is easy. "Body-for-Life is a
hard program, a rigorous program," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Rosie O'Neill, 22, a publicist from Brentwood, who
dropped from a size 6 to a size 4 in her first five weeks on the
Body-for-Life plan. Three days a week, she spends 20 to 30 minutes on
a treadmill or elliptical trainer. That may not sound like much, but
Phillips' plan calls for Body-for-Lifers to hit four "high points"
during any aerobic workout. This technique is also known as interval
training, that is, alternating stints of moderate exercise with
bursts of all-out hustle.</TE>
<TE>   Every other day, O'Neill lifts weights for about 50 minutes,
pausing only long enough to catch her breath between routines and
pushing her muscles to the point of exhaustion. Her daily diet
consists of six modest meals, each containing equal portions of
protein and "quality" carbohydrates, such as potatoes (no butter or
sour cream) or brown rice. Sugary, high-fat foods? Forget 'em--except
on the seventh day of the week, when Phillips says it's OK to slack
off and eat whatever you like. (O'Neill splurges on chocolate.)</TE>
<TE>   You may wonder how the average person finds time to prepare six
meals a day. Phillips is a step ahead of you. He advises readers to
"save time and money" by drinking Myoplex shakes, which are made by
EAS. In "Body-for-Life," Phillips explains that you don't have to use
Myoplex shakes, which cost about $2.50 per serving, to get lean and
ripped. But he mentions that he drinks them every day, and he points
out that most people who compete in the Body-for-Life Challenge
guzzle the stuff.</TE>
<TE>   One Myoplex shake contains 42 grams of protein--the
tissue-building nutrient Phillips says is in short supply in the
American diet. As a nation, he says in "Body for Life," we are
"overfed on carbohydrates. Underfed on protein."</TE>
<TE>   But he has a solution. Drink three Myoplex shakes a day, as
Phillips suggests in "Body-for-Life," and you'll be downing 126 grams
of protein. That's in addition to the protein found in the lean beef,
poultry and fish that are also part of the meal plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow. That's an awful lot of protein," said Kathleen Zelman, a
registered dietitian in Atlanta and a spokeswoman for the American
Dietetic Assn. For starters, Zelman says, all that protein must be
processed by the kidneys, so anyone who has been diagnosed with a
renal disorder should know that Phillips' diet could further burden
their kidney functioning (which could lead to dehydration).</TE>
<TE>   She's also skeptical of the claim that Americans eat too little
protein. "The typical American has no problem getting enough protein
in their diet," she says.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the
average American consumes about 75 grams of protein each day. Dietary
guidelines set by the National Academy of Sciences call for adult men
to consume 63 grams; women require 50 grams. Most nutritionists agree
that these standards have a large built-in margin of safety. Though
sports nutritionists often counsel competitive bodybuilders and
endurance athletes to load up on protein, the experts contacted for
this article agreed that the average person who adopts the
"Body-for-Life" exercise regimen would probably not require high
doses of the nutrient.</TE>
<TE>   "The protein is there mostly to fill the void of you being
hungry," says exercise physiologist David Pearson, of Ball State
University, in Muncie, Ind., who is an advisor for Men's Health
magazine. The Body-for-Life plan would be very low in calories
without the protein shakes, he points out, so they serve largely to
quiet growling stomachs. "Protein takes a long time to get through
the digestive system, so you feel fuller."</TE>
<TE>   Assuming you don't have kidney disease, the extra protein has
little effect; your body excretes what it doesn't use in the urine
and feces, says Pearson.</TE>
<TE>   Other fitness experts question whether it's wise for couch
potatoes to leap right into a high-intensity workout, such as the
conditioning program in "Body-for-Life."</TE>
<TE>   "That runs against the grain of what we normally recommend for
weight loss," says trainer and physiologist Rudy Dressendorfer, a
spokesman for the American College of Sports Medicine. "Can people
trying to lose weight sustain high-intensity exercise without
overdoing it?" High-intensity exercise often leads to injuries, says
Dressendorfer, which can sabotage a fitness plan.</TE>
<TE>   Pearson says that people lose weight on the Body-for-Life plan
simply because they're expending more calories through exercise than
they're consuming. "There's no magic to it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   'Experts Still Have Some Learning to Do'</TE>
<TE>   Phillips says his critics are blinded by their book learning. "To
be a health expert, you have to be healthy. Having knowledge about
how the body works and what constitutes proper nutrition is one
thing. Being able to apply that information is another," he says. "I
think a lot of experts still have some learning to do."</TE>
<TE>   Phillips insists that his followers need extra protein to
compensate for the wear and tear on their muscles. He also dismisses
fears that his exercise plan is too aggressive. "I don't think the
best way to learn to swim is to go in the shallow end and splash
around," quips Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   He can afford to be brash--literally. Although Phillips, who is
single, won't say how much he earned on the sale of EAS, he now owns
homes in Los Angeles and Hawaii, as well as Colorado. He recently
started a small publishing company called High Point Media to publish
"empowering books" but has plenty of time to surf and scuba dive. And
he has donated all his royalties from sales of "Body-for-Life" to the
Make-A-Wish Foundation--about $3 million so far, according to
Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   And if his method leads to thinner thighs and bigger pecs,
Phillips' fans seem happy to guzzle on. When told that some
nutritionists and exercise experts are dubious of Phillips'
protein-friendly prescription, Rosie O'Neill was philosophical.</TE>
<TE>   "If the high-protein diet works for you, doesn't hurt you and
gives you great results," she said, "then it's the right approach."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Edna, a 68-year-old retired schoolteacher from the Midwest, came to
our hospital a few months back complaining of horrible shoulder pain.
An intern carefully examined her shoulder but had difficulty
performing a complete examination because the patient refused to take
off her clothes and put on a hospital gown.</LD>
<LD>   Just before finishing an otherwise uneventful exam, the intern,
who was exhausted after working a 24-hour shift, decided to feel
Edna's armpit. There, she discovered some large lymph nodes, often an
indication of cancer. The intern told Edna of the enlarged nodes and
explained that she would like to examine her upper arm and chest.
Edna refused.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm fine, I'm fine," Edna insisted.</LD>
<TE>   At this point, the intern called me in, and together with a nurse
we finally convinced Edna to let me examine her upper arm. I gently
lifted her blouse, and found three bandages, with dried blood on
them, wrapped around her body. I asked Edna what was under the
bandages.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that? It's nothing--just a small sore," she said. "I think
it's getting much better."</TE>
<TE>   With further prodding, Edna reluctantly allowed the nurse to undo
the bandages. When they came off, I found myself facing the largest
breast cancer I've ever seen--a huge tumor, larger than a grapefruit,
protruding from her right breast.</TE>
<TE>   The nurse and I looked at each other, then at the tears in our
patient's eyes. Edna spoke first. "Why did you do that? I'm fine. I
didn't want...." Her words trailed off.</TE>
<TE>   I apologized--I suppose for discovering what Edna wanted to keep
secret.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what's happening here?" I asked. After a few moments
she replied, "Sort of." Her eyes lowered and she was silent for a
minute. "It's something bad, isn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I think it is," I replied. It was very bad. A breast cancer
so advanced it had invaded her bone.</TE>
<TE>   That same week, John, a construction worker in his mid-50s, came
to see me. For the first time in the eight years he had been my
patient, John brought along his wife to the appointment.</TE>
<TE>   "So, how are you doing?" I asked as I entered the exam room. No
reply.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, John's wife told me that her husband had found blood in
his stool.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, I learned that John had been experiencing symptoms for
more than four months without telling anyone. He only made a doctor's
appointment after his wife found out. John said he had not sought
care because he did not want to waste my time. His wife clarified the
issue: Her husband, she said, was just too embarrassed to discuss his
stools with a stranger.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most sophisticated diagnostic tools are rendered useless
by denial and embarrassment. Patients in denial about their symptoms
may neglect to even make a doctor's appointment. And those too
embarrassed to ask a personal question may fail to share information
that could alert their doctor to a serious condition. These
behaviors, in turn, can delay treatment and increase the severity and
duration of illness.</TE>
<TE>   There is a host of dangerous but treatable ailments that require
discussing private body parts or conditions. Our reaction is to not
tell anyone, including our doctor, because of our discomfort.
Embarrassment can prevent a domestic violence victim from seeking
help. It can cause a couple to subject themselves to expensive,
invasive infertility treatments rather than admit that they just
aren't having sex. Or result in a mildly forgetful older person not
talking with a doctor because he fears Alzheimer's disease, when in
fact he is just a bit absent-minded.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, patients are not the only ones who get embarrassed.
Many times doctors hesitate to ask patients difficult questions
because we feel uncomfortable talking about sexual behaviors, spousal
relationships, substance abuse or the observed memory loss in a
patient. Most of the time this discomfort derives from our own
personal discomfort with the topic. Discussions of sexual behaviors,
drug use or socially undesirable behaviors often expose our own raw
feelings based on beliefs from our background, our culture or how we
were brought up.</TE>
<TE>   As medical students go through the rigors of training they acquire
new knowledge focusing on diseases or bodily organs; they learn to
perform a myriad of procedures, and they gain social status. But they
often lose their ability to relate to ordinary people. Whether the
embarrassment stems from the doctor or the patient, when it
interferes with honest, open discussion, its consequences can be
deadly.</TE>

<HD>A Reason to Dread Prostate Tests a Bit Less</HD>
<DH>Cancer* Annual screenings are the norm for men over 50, but
a study says once every five years could be fine for those with low
readings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors have long had difficulty convincing men of the need for
annual prostate cancer screenings. After all, one portion of the
exams is extremely uncomfortable, and many experts disagree on their
effectiveness at reducing deaths.</LD>
<LD>   But a new study could make the screenings, which involve a blood
test and a rectal exam, somewhat easier to take. In trying to
determine whether the exams save lives, researchers have found that,
for many men, the screenings may be necessary only every five years.</LD>
<LD>   The results will probably be incorporated into future cancer
screening guidelines, said Dr. Harmon Eyre, research director for the
American Cancer Society.</LD>
<TE>   "I won't say that we will immediately change our guidelines, but
we will take a careful look at it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Current guidelines recommend that men over the age of 50 receive a
yearly rectal exam and PSA test, which measures the level of a
protein, called the prostate-specific antigen, that is released into
the blood by a tumor. A PSA reading of 1 or less is generally taken
to mean that a man does not have prostate cancer. A reading between 4
and 10 indicates a 40% chance that he has a tumor; a reading over 20
indicates virtually a 100% risk.</TE>
<TE>   The new findings suggest that men who score at the lowest levels
on the PSA test could go as long as five years between tests. Men
with intermediate scores could have the test every other year, said
Dr. E. Edward Crawford of the University of Colorado, who headed the
new analysis.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found that the vast majority of men whose initial PSA
levels are very low do not need to worry that [the levels] would
skyrocket within one year," Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   If the new recommendations are adopted, the annual number of PSA
tests could be cut in half, saving the health care system between
$500 million and $1 billion annually, Crawford said. He presented the
results last week at an Orlando meeting of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology.</TE>
<TE>   Prostate cancer is expected to strike 189,000 men in 2002, killing
30,200, according to the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Before the PSA test was widely adopted, about three-quarters of
all prostate tumors were detected in the late stages of the disease
when they were not readily treatable, according to Dr. Richard N.
Atkins, president of the National Prostate Cancer Coalition. Now, he
said, three-quarters of the tumors are caught early, giving men a
fighting chance.</TE>
<TE>   Atkins noted that there has been a 27% decline in prostate cancer
deaths over the last five years, which he attributes primarily to PSA
testing.</TE>
<TE>   But PSA tests are controversial--in part because prostate tumor
screening is itself controversial. Oncologists recognize two
different types of prostate tumors: those that are fast-growing and
generally lethal, and those that are very slow-growing and that
usually do not kill their hosts.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, there is no way to distinguish between the two forms of
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   The slow-growing form is probably more common, however, and
physicians say that large numbers of men die with prostate cancer,
but not from it. That is, they have a tumor, but die of other causes.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of screening charge that treatment of these essentially
benign tumors leaves many men suffering from impotence or
incontinence, whereas not treating them would not adversely affect
their health.</TE>
<TE>   The new study is, in fact, part of a larger analysis to determine
whether prostate cancer screening saves lives. But that larger
analysis has not been completed.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford and his colleagues examined medical records for 27,863
men between the ages of 55 and 74; 55% of the men had an initial PSA
reading less than 2. They found that 98.7% of men whose initial PSA
value was 1 or less had a reading that was still under 4 five years
later. Similarly, 98.8% of those whose initial reading was between 1
and 2 still had a reading under 4 two years later.</TE>
<TE>   They recommended that:</TE>
<TE>   * Men whose initial PSA value was 1 or less do not need another
test for 5 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Those whose PSA value was between 1 and 2 should receive another
test in two years.</TE>

<HD>Summer's a Break From College, Not Problems</HD>
<DH>Mental health* A child's return to home can cause tension
and conflict during a time when psychiatric disorders are more likely
to surface.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every year as college students head for home, many families face a
difficult transition. Abrupt changes in a family's routines can lead
to conflicts as parents try to adjust to their child's desire for
independence and students cope with feelings of resentment over
parental intrusions. Also, college is a period during which mental
illness often surfaces, health experts say, and these disorders can
be exacerbated by the academic and social pressures of collegiate
life.</LD>
<LD>   Most college students are undergoing major developmental changes
as they experiment with different lifestyles and forge a sense of
identity. These changes may come as a shock to parents, especially if
their child has been away all or most of the year and is grappling
with serious issues that are still unknown to their families.</LD>
<LD>   Many serious psychiatric disorders, including major depression,
bipolar disorder or psychosis, first emerge in the late teens or
early 20s. And students' erratic sleep patterns, along with heavy
alcohol or drug use, may instigate depressive episodes. A survey last
year by University of Pittsburgh researchers suggested there was an
increase in the number of college students with severe mental
disorders; 85% of counseling center directors said they were seeing
students with more serious psychological problems.</LD>
<TE>   Health professionals recommend a number of steps students and
parents can take to ease the transition. While most students don't
suffer from severe psychological problems, many are struggling with
significant personal issues, from sexual identity to loneliness and
alienation. And a smaller number may have experienced more traumatic
events, such as the end of a serious relationship or a date rape.</TE>
<TE>   Students should try not to "keep these feelings locked inside,"
says Dennis Heitzmann, director of the Center for Counseling and
Psychological Services at Pennsylvania State University in State
College, Pa. "Talking about these issues will help them cope better,
and strengthen family ties."</TE>
<TE>   Confiding in parents can be tough, though. Ideally, parents are
their child's staunchest allies, but students may feel uncomfortable
telling them "bad" news--about a diagnosed eating disorder, for
example, or treatment for depression.</TE>
<TE>   One way students can avert emotional confrontations is to have a
candid talk with parents over the phone or by e-mail before they
leave school. Hopefully, the dust will have settled by the time they
arrive at home. "People may not react well initially," Heitzmann
says, "but upon more careful reflection their rational powers kick in
and then you can have a more civil conversation."</TE>
<TE>   Some issues may be too sensitive to be easily resolved, especially
if students' desires clash with parental expectations. Telling
parents whose hearts are set on their child becoming a doctor that
the child flunked biology and wants to major in English can often
provoke an argument. "Some parents' identity is inextricably
connected with their kid's achievement and their scrutiny is
unrelenting," says Helen E. Johnson, founder of the Parents' Program
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   If an issue provokes a family crisis, it may be helpful to seek
out a mediator--someone at your church or synagogue, for example, or
a local mental health clinic. College counseling centers may provide
local referrals. Check your school's Web site too. Many universities
offer online pamphlets on various topics, from eating disorders to
sexuality. Even keeping a journal or enlisting the aid of a trusted
older adult can help you sort out your feelings. There are also
Internet support groups and chat rooms, and telephone counseling
hotlines.</TE>
<TE>   For some students, coming home means returning to family problems
they had sought to escape by going away to college--an alcoholic or
abusive parent, for example. "Protect yourself by spending as little
time there as possible," says Harold L. Pruett, director of student
psychological services at UCLA. Do something: get a summer job, take
classes, sign up for an internship program, or volunteer to be a
tutor or work at the local playground. Engaging in activities can
alleviate stress, and help students to make contact with new people
who can be a source of emotional support.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of students are seeking help from their college
counseling centers for more serious psychological problems, such as
severe depression, eating disorders, self mutilation and even
psychosis. Normally, their therapists will refer them to qualified
professionals in their area to ensure continued treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some students don't follow up with counseling or medication
and their conditions may worsen during the summer. "Continuity of
care is crucial," says Robert Gallagher, a psychologist at the
University of Pittsburgh. "Don't expect to just coast through the
summer hoping things will get better next year."</TE>

<HD>E-Mail in a Bottle</HD>
<DH>Tamim Ansary never expected his message last September to
bring him global fame</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's an unlikely figure for a mass-media oracle, a modest,
mild-mannered fellow easing into his 50s. But war often chooses its
spokespersons, like its victims, arbitrarily.</LD>
<LD>   Tamim Ansary's moment came on Sept. 12 when he fired off an
impassioned e-mail to a few close friends--or so he thought. Born in
the Afghan capital of Kabul in 1948, the Bay Area children's book
author and Internet columnist was angry and alarmed by talk-radio
callers urging the U.S. to bomb Kabul "back to the Stone Age" in
retaliation for the previous day's brutal attacks in New York and
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   Why bother, Ansary argued in his e-mail? After the war with the
Soviets, a devastating civil war and several years of the Taliban's
oppressive rule, Kabul was already a wasteland.</LD>
<TE>   Not that Ansary held any sympathy for the Taliban, the Al Qaeda
terrorist network or its putative leader, Osama bin Laden. "When you
think Taliban, think Nazis," he wrote. "When you think Bin Laden,
think Hitler." But in the long run, leveling Afghanistan would only
serve Bin Laden's diabolical end of starting a war between Islam and
the West. "Who has the belly for that?" Ansary's e-mail concluded.
"Bin Laden does. Anyone else?"</TE>
<TE>   Like ripples from a stone tossed in a shallow pond, Ansary's
message radiated into cyberspace, exponentially replicating. Within
days, his electronic in-box was flooded with thousands of responses
from across the globe. Nearly all were supportive, and everyone from
Oprah to ABC's "World News Tonight" was calling, eager to anoint him
the official voice of the long-suffering Afghan people.</TE>
<TE>   From there it was a short, perhaps inevitable step to a book
contract, and the publication of his urbane, accessible, compulsively
readable memoir "West of Kabul, East of New York" (Farrar, Straus &amp;
Giroux), an account of a life split between contrasting cultures:
Islamic Afghanistan and the secular West. An author tour brought him
to Dutton's Brentwood Books last Wednesday night for a reading and
book-signing session.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in a brown suede jacket, black pants and a dress shirt
unbuttoned at the neck, he read a chapter from his book and chatted
casually while taking questions from the seven or eight people who
had come to hear him.</TE>
<TE>   "At first I felt weird about having stumbled into a position where
I speak for other Afghans, and I still think it's weird a little
bit," Ansary said, seating himself among the book stacks in a
Dutton's back room for an interview. "But I feel what I've been able
to do is build a richer picture, so there is more appreciation, more
sympathy for Afghans, and I think that they [Afghans] appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   So does that mean he's having fun in his new role? "'Fun' is a
funny kind of word to use for it," he said, genially but carefully.
"What I say matters. You can't buy that feeling, it's a gift if that
happens. I feel useful in a way that I hadn't been before, and I feel
called upon to rise to this occasion, and I feel good about myself
because I feel I have been able to meet that challenge."</TE>
<TE>   If one senses the faintest aura of the pedagogue about Ansary,
there may be good reason. After moving to the United States when he
was still in his teens and earning a degree from Reed College in
Oregon, Ansary has earned his living by writing textbooks and books
for children. (He and his wife, who live in San Francisco, have two
of their own.)</TE>
<TE>   He also taps out a regular column for Microsoft Encarta, an online
encyclopedia, doing his best to answer such Zen koan-like queries as:
"Why are robins' eggs blue?" And, "If you go outside today and it's
zero degrees, and you go outside tomorrow and it's twice as cold,
what temperature is it?" For the last two years, he said, he has been
working on a series of books in which he has to summarize complex
concepts in 25 words or less.</TE>
<TE>   In his memoir, Ansary likewise steers clear of needlessly
convoluted sentences and concepts. Crafted in straightforward,
unassuming prose, "West of Kabul, East of New York" streamlines
complicated ideas to a form that might make them comprehensible to
any savvy seventh-grader. His brief recounting of Islam's origins,
for example--one of many stories within the story of his own family
history--is as colloquial as it is concise.</TE>
<TE>   His boyhood impression of the prophet Muhammad, he writes in a
typically conversational paragraph, was of "a really great guy" who
was "never tempted to claim any divinity for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Ansary said he didn't have a detailed plan in mind when he mapped
out his memoir. "I feel like the spirit in which I wrote my book is
the same spirit in which I talk to people at the readings," he said.
"To call it a strategy would be to make it seem more thought out. As
a literary person, you go more on intuition and you grope toward an
effect."</TE>
<TE>   What remains slightly ironic is that Ansary is best known for an
electronic missive of a few hundred words, dashed off in a state of
high emotion, while his usual style of discourse is far more
diplomatic and even-tempered. (In his e-mail, he labeled the Taliban
"a cult of ignorant psychotics.")</TE>
<TE>   Still, he believes this unguardedness may have been a boon. "If I
had written with a consciousness that I was going to write for
thousands of people or for a public I didn't know, and if I wrote
with a sensitivity to making myself immune to criticism and judgment,
it probably wouldn't have been as effective a persuasive essay."</TE>
<TE>   The book was "surprisingly easy to write, as a piece of writing,"
Ansary said, because he actually had started writing it two years
ago, well before Sept. 11. "It wasn't a book project, it was a
personal 'digging up my memories' project," he explained. "I think of
it as a literary memoir. It's about love and death, family and
breakup, all that in the context of my life of being bicultural."</TE>
<TE>   Ansary's awareness of his mixed heritage came early in life. Born
into a privileged Kabul clan, his father was an Afghan who met
Ansary's Finnish American mother while pursuing a PhD in education in
Chicago. When the couple married and moved back to Afghanistan in
1945, Ansary's mother was the only American woman in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   Daily life revolved around an extensive network of relatives and
the five-times daily ritual of prayers. While Kabul had barely made
it into the 20th century by 1948, the year of his birth, "most of
Afghanistan might as well have been living in Neolithic times," he
writes.</TE>
<TE>   Ansary's world was cleanly divided between his family's walled
compound and the outside. "Everything that made life worth living was
private, and the splendid secret was there behind every door along
that lane, behind every compound wall," he writes. "Our group self
was just as real as our individual selves, perhaps more so."</TE>
<TE>   But when he moved to the United States in 1964 to attend prep
school, he took to American culture, growing his hair to his waist
and worshipping Bob Dylan "back when his voice still worked."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Plan for a Return Visit to Afghanistan</TE>
<TE>   Later, the family split up. Ansary's father moved back to
Afghanistan, and Ansary's brother turned toward Islamic
fundamentalism during a trip to Pakistan. That prompted Ansary to
embark on his own pilgrimage in the late 1970s. He got as far as
Turkey, though he was blocked from reentering his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to visit there for the first time in years this summer.
"They [the Afghan government] are trying their best to attract back
all the people like me," he said, referring to the thousands of
educated, upper-middle-class citizens who fled the country during the
1970s and '80s.</TE>
<TE>   As far as repairing his battered and bloodied homeland, his
response to a question at Wednesday's reading suggested Ansary's
ambivalence.</TE>
<TE>   "What would you like politicians and Americans to do now?" asked a
man in a red bicycle helmet.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to see, in the immediate sense, the international
peacekeepers must stay to keep fighting from breaking out," Ansary
replied. "The thing that I would want as an Afghan is a tall order: I
would like the international community to help Afghanistan, and keep
their mitts off."</TE>
<TE>   He laughed softly, acknowledging the paradox. "I feel like the
first thing to do is clear land mines out of the field," he went on.
That way, he said, the country could begin to restore agricultural
production and cultivating livestock, so that peasants won't be
tempted to grow poppies for opium instead.</TE>
<TE>   After the reading, as the stragglers dispersed and the bookstore
prepared to close for the night, Ansary got ready to join two friends
for dinner. His next project, he said, will be a historical novel,
details still to come. "It's a personal journey. I'm going to
rediscover my past."</TE>
<TE>   There was time for one last question: If he could put another
message in a bottle and send it to the world, what would he write?</TE>
<TE>   Ansary didn't hesitate. "That was such a meeting of a moment and a
guy," he said, already turning toward his companions. "The moment was
big. I don't want another moment like that."</TE>

<HD>On Tour, an Author Makes a Special Stop for a Young Clan</HD>
<DH>Jean Auel visits middle schoolers in Hancock Park, where
for years a teacher has taught her first book</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY McNAMARA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a black stretch limousine parked in front of John Burroughs
Middle School last week, and even for a gifted magnet school in
Hancock Park, that's a sign that something unusual might be taking
place. And it was. Inside, author Jean Auel was speaking to a group
of sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders, all of whom had studied her
first novel, "The Clan of the Cave Bear" as part of an ancient
history/literature class taught by Phoebe Faulkner.</LD>
<LD>   Faulkner is one of those teachers parents can't say enough about.
In fact, it was a parent who arranged the talk. L.A. Weekly arts
editor Tom Christie's son had taken Faulkner's class last year. So
when Auel's new book, "The Shelters of Stone," crossed his desk, he
thought it might be nice for Faulkner, who  is planning to retire in
June, to meet Auel. She had, after all, been teaching Auel's first
book for almost six years. And it is not a small book. It might be
interesting for her to introduce her kids to the woman who wrote the
words they had pored over for months.</LD>
<TE>   "I needed a source to make pre-history real for the kids,"
Faulkner said. "When I found this book, it just grabbed me," she said
of Auel's first title in the Earth's Children series, which revolves
around Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal characters. "I believe literature
is the best way to teach humanity, to teach what it is we owe each
other. And this book so beautifully illustrates how race and other
differences are negligible. I wanted kids to see that our true
connection is that of spirit."</TE>
<TE>   And so Auel found herself engaged in one of the more unusual book
tour stops of her career. The talk was held in the school's library,
which, with its dim, warm smell of well-read books and enforced hush,
is also instantly familiar to any lifelong reader. Auel stood at a
makeshift podium that was really an atlas stand made, like all of the
low furniture in the room, of the stained-golden pine with a cracked
finish so tantalizing to bored students.</TE>
<TE>   Standing beside Auel, her arm often loosely embracing her,
Faulkner got things off to a great start. She talked a bit about the
importance of the series. One by one, some of the students came up
and read their favorite bits and everyone applauded.</TE>
<TE>   When asked how many had read beyond the first book, most of the
students raised their hands. So Faulkner asked them to tell "Mrs.
Auel" some aspect of the books that had stayed with them. Instantly,
the two adults were facing the collective strained and noisy silence
of 106 suddenly shy boys and girls. The girls dropped their eyes and
rolled their shoulders and the boys shifted in their seats, their
feet in impossibly huge sneakers thumping against the floor as they
crossed and recrossed them.</TE>
<TE>   For several moments, it looked as though this was going to be a
very tough room.</TE>
<TE>   And then it became clear why Faulkner is one of those teachers
students will talk about when they have children of their own. With
the diction and vocabulary of a modern Mr. Chips and the coaxing
empathy of Oprah, Faulkner talked her kids down from the ledge of
self-consciousness and soon it became clear that Auel, left to her
own devices, was not going to be able to get a word in edgewise. The
author, herself not a shy or retiring woman, deferred now to the
teacher who reined in the kids as easily as she had gotten them to
gallop.</TE>
<TE>   Auel, 66, read a bit from "The Shelters of Stone," the
long-awaited fifth book in the series, and then students asked a
series of questions that form the skeleton of almost every author
profile--what are you working on now? (the next book in the series),
how much do you draw on real life for your characters? (bits and
pieces at best), when did you know you wanted to be a writer? (not
until she was 45), and the ever popular, will there be a movie? Her
amusing, but a bit bitter, answer--"There was a movie and I didn't
like it at all and so I got mad and sued my publisher"--was perhaps
the best received information of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden metallic blurt of the school bell startled Auel, who
looked immediately, and a bit fearfully, to Faulkner, proving that
even years on the bestseller list don't undo the training of
childhood. Faulkner nodded encouragingly to continue, but after a few
more questions, she rose, a signal that things were winding down.</TE>
<TE>   Two boys in shorts that dipped below their knees and more of those
tremendous sneakers presented Auel with a huge card signed by all the
students, and Auel, in turn, presented the school with several copies
of her books and promised to autograph any copies the students had.</TE>
<TE>   Faulkner told several of the students to get on to class, she'd be
along in a minute. When they told her the door was locked, she sighed
and drew from somewhere on her person an emperor's necklace of keys.
It glittered and clanked as she sought the correct one. Seeing the
open admiration of its heft, she laughed. "I've been doing this for
40 years," she said. "That's an awful lot of doors to open."</TE>
<TE>   As for Auel, ensconced behind a pile of her books, pen in hand,
she finally looked like an author on a book tour. She looked over at
Faulkner and smiled and shook her head.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is, I certainly wish I had had a teacher like her
when I was a kid."</TE>

<HD>Beware the Poet in the Windstorm</HD>
<DH>When a spouse cheats, the marriage must be a miserable one,
right? Wrong, say the experts.</DH>

<LD>Is it possible to be happily married and stray? Or does such a thing
happen only in the movies?</LD>
<LD>   In "Unfaithful," a beautiful suburban housewife named
Connie Sumner (played by Diane Lane) seems to have a warm and happy
marriage. Her equally good-looking husband (Richard Gere) is not only
a reliable, ample provider, but tells his wife things like, "You
really have no idea how beautiful you are, do you?" She drives a
Range Rover, has a gravity-defying body that is the envy of her
girlfriends, volunteers for her son's school fund-raisers and lives
in a two-story lakefront house that looks like the ultimate
Restoration Hardware fantasy.</LD>
<LD>   And then, one day, she is literally blown into the arms of a sexy,
poetic Frenchman (Olivier Martinez) by a freak windstorm.</LD>
<TE>   The movie's director, Adrian Lyne, has said that in order to show
the arbitrary nature of infidelity, he intentionally made the
Sumners' marriage a loving one. Some viewers, a few of whom have
aired their objections in newspaper essays, have argued that the
movie's premise--a "happily married" wife and mother engaging in an
extramarital dalliance--is implausible. But a happy marriage, say
experts on infidelity, does not necessarily protect against
infidelity.</TE>
<TE>   "The myth is that if you have a happy marriage, it prevents you
from having an affair," said Shirley P. Glass, a clinical
psychologist practicing in Owings Mills, Md., and author of "Not Just
Friends: Protecting Your Marriage From Infidelity and Healing the
Trauma of Betrayal" (Free Press) scheduled for release in January.
"The common perception is that if someone has an affair, something
must be wrong with the marriage. Even many therapists think that."</TE>
<TE>   In a survey of 400 therapists, Glass found that 40% of the
professionals viewed an affair as a symptom of an unhappy marriage,
with female therapists believing it more strongly than males. But a
survey of 300 married individuals conducted by Glass in 1980 (and
divided equally between the genders), found that 56% of men and 34%
of women who had had an extramarital affair reported that they were
happily married, loved their partner and enjoyed sex with their
spouse. Men in long-term marriages who were unfaithful reported high
levels of marital satisfaction. It was the reverse with women. It is
difficult to estimate how prevalent infidelity is, but a 1994
University of Chicago survey, Sex in America, found that 25% of men
reported that they had had an extramarital affair compared to 12% of
women.</TE>
<TE>   "Women generally think that if you love your partner, you wouldn't
even be interested in an affair," said Glass, who added that in her
infidelity survey, women said they had affairs for love, emotional
intimacy and sex, in that order. Men said sex was the primary reason
for infidelity. Many men who have affairs feel entitled to take
advantage of every opportunity for extramarital sex, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom that only someone who is unhappily married
would have an extramarital fling comes from the prevailing cultural
belief that marriage is supposed to make one happy and whole. When
the marriage falls short, the thinking follows, there is a logical
cause to stray or at least to think about it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lots of Factors at Work, Including Opportunity</TE>
<TE>   "People insist that nobody would fool around unless there is
something wrong with their marriage," said Frank Pittman, an
Atlanta-based psychiatrist who is an expert on the issue of
infidelity and author of "Private Lies: Infidelity and the Betrayal
of Intimacy" (Norton, 1989). "In other words, an infidelity has to be
the fault of a wife who made her husband do it, or a husband must be
a brute or loser to make her do it." Vulnerability to infidelity
doesn't have only to do with the quality of one's relationship but
also with opportunity (windstorm, anyone?), personal ethics (whether
infidelity violates one's moral values) and social context (working
or living in an environment where affairs are tolerated).</TE>
<TE>   "Some people don't get invited into an affair, so the fact that
they don't have an affair might not be a reflection of their
character," said Pittman. "Men generally have affairs because they
think they are entitled [due to approving cultural messages] even
though they know it is wrong. Women generally have to work up a fair
amount of anger toward their husband because they know better....
They know what a risk it is, so they can only justify it with a lot
of anger in the marriage." Though we would like to believe that if we
keep our relationships alive and vital, infidelity won't happen, it
is not necessarily true, adds Paul Kovacs, a clinical psychologist in
Santa Monica. "People who are happily married are less likely to go
looking for an affair and most of the people who have affairs are
unsatisfied and hurting. But humans are born with the capacity to be
infatuated with and feel affection toward any number of human
beings." In other words, being happily married and falling into a
pool of lust over a luminous personification of sexiness can coexist.
What determines whether chemistry between two people becomes carnal
knowledge can spring gradually from a series of decisions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Great Passion Is Always Irrational by Definition'</TE>
<TE>   "Affairs might start with two people saying, 'This is only going
to be a friendship,' then, 'Well, we are going to have an affair, but
it won't progress too far and I can keep a secret and keep it from
getting out of control,'" said Kovacs. "Great passion is always
irrational by definition." Naturally, the very qualities that make a
marriage secure, satisfying and fulfilling make it predictable and,
well, boring. Some people have affairs ostensibly to relieve boredom,
for romance, sexual adventure and emotional nourishment. Sometimes,
it's just a case of bad judgment at the office late one night with a
seductive colleague. In the bestseller "The Erotic Silence of the
American Wife" (Turtle Bay Books, 1992), author Dalma Heyn argued
that women who had affairs did so in part because they were unable to
express their whole sexual selves in the context of marriage. The
irony of such affairs is that such sexual daring would often be a
welcome tonic in the marital bed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not universal, but most betrayed partners would be
delighted if their partner behaved in the marriage the way they did
in the affair," said Glass. After Connie Sumner emerges from a cafe
bathroom where she and her lover have had an aerobic, spontaneous
sexual tryst, an unsuspecting friend pronounces that all affairs end
disastrously. The comment foreshadows what happens as the revelations
about the affair play out to the movie's end. Infidelity often leads
to divorce, but affairs don't have to end a marriage, according to
psychologists who specialize in the delicate process of helping
couples rebuild their relationships after an affair.</TE>
<TE>   "For the spouse who is betrayed, there is a loss of innocence and
a feeling that he or she can never trust again in the way they did
before," Glass said. "But one of the things I usually ask the person
who had the affair is, 'What did you learn about yourself in that
other relationship that you would like to bring back to the
marriage?'"</TE>

<LD>THE FATAL ENGLISHMAN</LD>
<LD>   Three Short Lives</LD>
<LD>   By Sebastian Faulks</LD>
<TE>   Vintage</TE>
<TE>   314 pages; $14</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The three doomed and glamorous Englishmen who are the subjects of
Sebastian Faulks' sparklingly written trio of biographies were
fair-haired boys in every sense of the phrase: gifted, charming,
filled with promise, but fated to early deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Wood set off for France in 1921 to become (as he
hoped) the world's greatest painter. He died only nine years later,
at 29, not the world's greatest painter, but an original and
accomplished artist, nonetheless. Dedicated to his art, oblivious to
the political and economic turmoil unfolding around him, Wood
hobnobbed in ultra-sophisticated social circles while retaining a
touching aura of frankness and innocence.</TE>
<TE>   "Christopher Wood," in Faulks' view, "had no historical
self-consciousness and was motivated by complicated and utterly
personal patterns." But in telling his story, the critically
acclaimed novelist-turned-biographer deftly evokes the historical and
cultural background that influenced the young painter's life in ways
he probably never realized.</TE>
<TE>   Paris in the 1920s exposed Wood to artists such as Cezanne,
Matisse and Picasso, not to mention the Ballet Russe, Jean Cocteau
and a bisexual Chilean diplomat named Antonio de Gandarillas, who
became the Englishman's close friend, lover and chief means of
financial support. A "small, exquisite man, who looked like a spider
monkey," Gandarillas "loved food, drink, opium, gambling, travel, art
and young men."</TE>
<TE>   Opium was also Cocteau's drug of choice, and before long, Wood had
acquired the habit. Although Faulks, citing Cocteau, takes pains to
convince us that high-quality opium, properly and sparingly used,
need not have dire effects, he also shows how Wood, in the throes of
the creative excitement that produced his last and most original
paintings, abused the drug until he suffered symptoms of derangement
that drove him to suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Opium, however, is merely part of the fascinating story, and
Faulks' accounts, both of Wood's progress as a painter and of his
love life (with women as well as men) are absorbing. (The tiny,
black-and-white photos illustrating Wood's work, however, are
pitifully inadequate.)</TE>
<TE>   The middle panel of this triptych is World War II fighter pilot
Richard Hillary (1919-1943), who not only enacted the courageous
deeds that made him a legend, but also wrote a stirring account, "The
Last Enemy," of his own story. Hillary was one of that small band of
heroes who managed to defend their country's airfields against the
numerically superior German bombers.</TE>
<TE>   These were the men Churchill was praising when he declared "Never
have so many owed so much to so few." Hillary articulated a pervasive
feeling when he wrote that the war had given his "disillusioned and
spoiled" generation the chance to prove that "undisciplined though we
might be, we were a match for Hitler's dogma-fed youth."</TE>
<TE>   Horribly burned in a crash, the cocky, once-handsome Hillary
underwent massive operations at the hands of pioneering plastic
surgeon A.H. McIndoe, and although not fit enough to fly again,
badgered his way back into the cockpit. This woefully impractical
decision resulted in a second crash that killed him. Yet here, as in
Wood's case, Faulks portrays a man not in love with death, but
engaged in something larger that made him reckless.</TE>
<TE>   The third "fatal Englishman" is Jeremy Wolfenden (1934-1965),
considered by many who knew him to be the most brilliant young mind
of his generation.</TE>
<TE>   Witty, poised and actively homosexual, Jeremy shrugged off a
possible career as an Oxford don to become a foreign correspondent in
Paris, Washington and Moscow. (When the KGB attempted to blackmail
him with photographs they had taken of him in flagrante, he coolly
asked for enlargements.) Ironically, his father, Jack Wolfenden, had
been put in charge of the now-famous British commission charged with
investigating homosexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Father and son were not close. The former was sober, serious,
reliable; the latter hard-drinking, insouciant and all too easily
bored. Yet, they shared a certain forthrightness and clarity of
intellect. Here's Jeremy at 18 assessing his future: "I am a queer;
so much is ... evident ... I may, I suppose, turn to heterosexuality;
but if by a pretty mature ... eighteen I am not attracted by girls
either physically or emotionally or aesthetically it seems unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy's father was not pleased to learn of his son's
inclinations, but when the time came to examine the issue as a matter
of public policy, he remained admirably dispassionate: "Jack
Wolfenden," Faulks reminds us, "personally abhorred homosexuality....
However, he.... could not find any respectable reason for a
government to interfere with the private behaviour of its adult
citizens. His suggestion that homosexuality be decriminalised was a
victory for intellectual process over personal distaste."</TE>
<TE>   Why Jeremy chose the life of a foreign correspondent remains a
mystery; so, too, the extent of his possible involvement in the
espionage dramas of the Cold War. The evidence Faulks presents
strongly indicates that the 31-year-old Wolfenden literally drank
himself to death, a victim of neither homophobia nor Cold War
intrigue, but of alcoholism.</TE>
<TE>   Faulks offers the stories of these three Englishmen as a means of
illuminating English society and culture in their eras. But, although
the pictures he paints are richly suggestive in this regard, he has
accomplished something far more valuable. Faulks brings to these
biographies a novelist's best gift: He has given vivid and sensitive
portraits of men who may or may not sum up the spirit of their eras,
but who certainly emerge in these pages as complex individuals,
compelling in their own right.</TE>

<LD>Have you ever read a Klutz book? Based in Palo Alto, Klutz publishes
activity books, craft kits and other stuff for kids. Designed for
reading and doing, each Klutz book includes most everything you need
to do an activity or learn a skill. Today, Klutz is celebrating its
25th birthday by sharing with you this activity taken from the Klutz
guide, "My Life in Inches: A Growth Chart and Journal."</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Predict Your Height</LD>
<TE>   Try these two math formulas to figure out how tall you'll be when
you grow up. Then impress your family, friends and teachers with your
sharp math skills.</TE>
<TE>   Step 1: Measure your mom's height in inches. If you are a boy, add
5 inches to your mom's height and write down the total number. If
you're a girl, write down your mom's exact height in inches.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Measure your dad's height in inches. If you're a girl,
subtract 5 inches from your father's height and write down the total
number. If you're a boy, write down your dad's exact height in
inches.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Add the two numbers together from Steps 1 and 2 and divide
by two.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Add 3 1/4 inches to determine the upper limit of your
predicted height.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Subtract 3 1/4 inches to determine the lower limit of your
predicted height.</TE>
<TE>   Result: Your final height has a 95% chance of falling within these
limits. Test it out on some adults. Find out how tall their parents
were and do the math.</TE>
<TE>   Here's another method. Take your height at age 2 and double it.
Then knock off about an inch. Your final height should be close to
this figure.</TE>
<TE>   If you like to read and learn how to do things at the same time,
you might be interested in Klutz books. Founder John Cassidy wrote
the first Klutz book in 1977--"Juggling for the Complete Klutz."
Today there are books on more than 150 subjects from the artistic to
the scientific. For other fun activities and to learn more about

<LD>It's impossible to imagine what passes as small talk for a guy like
Wolfgang Ketterle. Then again, almost everything he works on at his
MIT physics lab is small--molecules, electrons, the tiniest
components of matter.</LD>
<LD>   These are things most of us nonscientists don't quite understand.
But a recent ad in the paper invited everyone to at least try to
comprehend recent advances in physics, by attending a talk at which
Ketterle would discuss the work for which he won the 2001 Nobel
Prize.</LD>
<LD>   So we show up at UCLA's Young Hall (along with about 150 others,
mostly students and faculty) for the visiting professor's afternoon
lecture: "Gaseous Bose-Einstein condensates--a nanokelvin laboratory
for quantum physics."</LD>
<TE>   The frisson of Ketterle's brilliance washes over us as he waves
his arms, aims his laser pointer at slides on a screen and explains
the behavior of ultra-cold atoms in a vacuum chamber. Or something.</TE>
<TE>   Tall, wiry and attractively Teutonic, the German-born scientist,
43, has his audience enthralled with tales of how he and his MIT team
won Nobel gold for what the prize committee described as having
"caused atoms to sing in unison," thereby discovering a new state of
matter.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of atoms singing is itself appealing--perhaps a concept
Nickelodeon might work on. Equally appealing are the handwritten
notes Ketterle has projected onto the screen. "It was the night of
Sept. 30, at about 11:30 p.m.," he tells the audience, "and we
observed for the very first time a sudden crispness in the image on
the computer monitors. We got very excited."</TE>
<TE>   At 4 in the morning, his notes show, team members became even more
excited. A single exclamation point emphasizes the fact that
Bose-Einstein condensation has actually taken place.</TE>
<TE>   In the audience, at the mention of that moment, there is a certain
shiver. And Ketterle reminds his listeners that most great science
seems to take place between midnight and 6 a.m.--a fact his wife and
three children are probably all too aware of.</TE>
<TE>   But what does it all mean?</TE>
<TE>   We phoned UCLA physics professor Joseph Rudnick to find out. It
turns out Rudnick was the one who'd placed the ad in the paper,
thinking that science buffs around the city might want to attend this
lecture that "would knock their socks off."</TE>
<TE>   "What he won the prize for is the magic he does with collections
of atoms, electrons, molecules. Up to now we've had only indirect
evidence for how they behaved, we could imagine what things looked
like at that level of very small particles," Rudnick says.</TE>
<TE>   "But he's a magician--a guy who knows how to grab hold of atoms,
play with them, move them individually and in groups from place to
place, jiggle them around like a kid with a handful of marbles. Just
the idea that he can hold an atom in place, then take more atoms and
put them next to it ... it really is like magic."</TE>
<TE>   Bose-Einstein condensation is something every physics graduate
student knows all about, Rudnick adds, even if the rest of us don't.
But for 70 years, scientists had tried to achieve it and couldn't.
Not until 1995, when Ketterle and two others--all working
independently--finally achieved the goal of BEC. The three won the
Nobel Prize for physics last year for their breakthroughs.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know where it will lead," Rudnick says. "This is wild
speculation, but there is a possibility that Ketterle's work will
lead to development of really, really, really small devices, which
would alter the nature of all activity in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Something all of us can think about in the middle of the night.</TE>

<HD>A Head for Bones</HD>
<DH>Animal skulls have long fascinated Ray Bandar, collector
extraordinaire</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>If this were a movie, Ray Bandar would be the villain.</LD>
<LD>   In one scene he might be on a rocky Northern California beach,
happily severing the head of a dead sea lion while tourists recoil,
then packing his gruesome harvest into the back of his car. Next
scene he'd be feeding the head to a pack of flesh-eating beetles,
which would help scour it clean for the vast collection of skulls
that covers nearly every spare inch of his Bay Area home.</LD>
<LD>   But it's not a movie, and Bandar isn't really all that creepy.
Just a gentleman scientist with weathered hands, a great tan and a
shock of white hair who is in love with the artistic forms of animal
skulls and bones. He has collected thousands as a volunteer field
associate for the California Academy of Sciences and now more than a
thousand of them are on display as part of the academy's new "Skulls"
exhibit at its Museum of Natural History in San Francisco's Golden
Gate Park. "Skulls tell you the most information about the animal,"
said Bandar, wearing a hyena vertebra on a necklace. "You can find
out the species, the sex and sometimes you can tell why it died. You
can even get the age of the animal by examining the teeth."</LD>
<TE>   A trained artist and retired high school science teacher, Bandar,
74, cut off his first head in the spring of 1953 while body surfing
at the famed Kelly's Cove in San Francisco. To this day, he's not
sure what compelled him to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's this dead, stinking bloated harbor seal that just washed
up on the beach, so I went to my convertible and got a knife and cut
off its head," Bandar recalls. "I brought it home, and my parents
were away at work. So I boiled it. The flesh came off pretty easy,
but boy did it stink. My parents were not that pleased with me."</TE>
<TE>   This was in the days before a 1972 federal law made it illegal to
tamper with marine mammals, even dead ones. Today Bandar's work is
legal because he does it in conjunction with the academy, which is
part of a program run by the National Marine Fisheries Service to
monitor and collect stranded marine mammals.</TE>
<TE>   From that first harbor seal, his macabre menagerie has grown to
nearly 6,000 skulls. Inspired by the paintings of Georgia O'Keefe and
the African tribal art he was exposed to as an art student, Bandar
developed a passion for the sometimes surprisingly beautiful contours
of the skeletal form.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the thousands of native California sea mammals, his
collection of 50 years includes cows and sheep he gathered on trips
through the American Southwest, rare bird species and exotic mammal
specimens he has culled from zookeepers and veterinarians around the
country.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, his methods for cleaning the skulls he collects are a
bit more sophisticated than boiling them in his parents' kitchen,
although no less gruesome to the uninitiated.</TE>
<TE>   Once the excess flesh has been carved away, fresh bones are frozen
for several days to kill bacteria. Then, depending on the size of the
skull, it is either fed to the carrion beetles or soaked in water so
that bacteria can eat away at what remains, a method called bacterial
maceration.</TE>
<TE>   "The aroma is horrendous when you're changing the water," said
Bandar, though he is unfazed by the smells and sights of his work.
"Occasionally, if I've been working in the beetle cage, I'll come
home and one will crawl out of my hair while I'm eating dinner," he
said matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   On occasion, a bone is so large that neither of the usual cleaning
methods is feasible. Such was the case with the elephant femur, and
the 110-pound whale pelvis Bandar has in his home.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's big stuff I can't handle any other way, I bury the bones
in my backyard. I do it under cover of darkness because I don't want
the neighbors to see what's going on," he confessed.</TE>
<TE>   Bandar leaves the bones underground for weeks, or months, until
bacteria and insects eat away at the meat. Then he unearths the bones
and gives them a good cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   He shares a three-story home with his wife of nearly 50 years,
Alkmene. The two met in art school and were married in 1954. She got
a quick introduction to her new husband's offbeat passion on their
honeymoon, an 11-week, 11,000-mile driving and camping trip. By the
time they returned, the back of his convertible was heaped with bones
they had collected. "I enjoy it as much as he does," said Alkmene, an
artist. "It's made for a very happy, stimulating household."</TE>
<TE>   At first, her only rule was no bones in the bedroom. But rules
were meant to be broken, and the couple's bedroom now includes
several smaller pieces from his collection. The bones become
increasingly dense each level down in the house. The dimly lighted
basement seems something out of an Indiana Jones movie: rows and rows
of heads stare out from shelves and glass cases.</TE>
<TE>   In one case is the fully intact skull of a snake, which was
Bandar's pet until it bit him. A shelf nearby holds the smiling skull
of a bottle-nosed dolphin. Chimpanzee and orangutan and monkey skulls
stare blankly ahead, eerie in their similarities to humans.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the skulls don't technically belong to him though; he
collects them under the auspices of the academy, a private, nonprofit
research institution that is the oldest scientific institution in the
West. His home is actually a semi-official storage facility for the
academy, which otherwise doesn't have nearly enough space to house
Bandar's entire collection.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the idea for the museum exhibit came about when a team of
the academy's architects and designers came to Bandar's home to
measure his collection so they could plan for the academy's eventual
storage needs. Like most first-time visitors, they were overwhelmed
by what they found. The museum's scientists joke about Bandar's
relentless compulsion to add to his collection. "Somebody's just got
to change the locks on him," joked Douglas Long, the collections
manager of the academy's Ornithology and Mammalogy department.</TE>
<TE>   But they know that without him, the museum's valuable research
collection would be measurably smaller. Bandar is responsible for
more than one-sixth of the academy's vertebrate skull collection. And
the larger the collection, Long explained, the better scientists are
able to understand the variety within a species or an ecosystem, and
how it may evolve over time.</TE>
<TE>   After months of preparation, the museum exhibit includes a
dizzying 93-foot display of 860 sea lion heads, a wall full of the
beautiful skulls of antlered animals, and a sweeping array of
examples from snakes to birds to wild boars. Even that first harbor
seal he found in 1953 is on display.</TE>
<TE>   A toucan skull is so small it's almost invisible next to
the bird's long and colorful beak. A squirrel monkey skull, smaller
than a chicken egg, looks hauntingly like a tiny human head.</TE>
<TE>   In one glass case, carrion beetles chew the flesh off a dead
reptile. Surrounded by the relics of so many lives gone by, Bandar is
nevertheless impatient with questions about death. He insisted he
never thinks about it. "I've got too many things to live for. I don't
have time," he said.</TE>

<LD>Everybody at Osgood Conklin Elementary School was talking about the
big game.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you see the game last night on TV?" Sammy asked Jim.</LD>
<LD>   "Game?" Jim asked. "I was watching 'Space Quest.'"</LD>
<TE>   "'Space Quest'!" Sammy cried. "You mean that weird TV show with
the green people and the ship that looks like a big grasshopper?"
Sammy laughed as he walked away.</TE>
<TE>   Jim didn't mind. He'd decided that being different meant being
special, and Jim liked being special.</TE>
<TE>   One evening, Jim and his mother were walking through the mall
looking for cheap socks and underwear. "Look at that!" he exclaimed.
He pointed into the store window at a heap of stuffed creatures, each
about the size of a teddy bear. But they weren't any kind of bear--at
least not any kind from Earth. Each creature was green, and it had
big eyes like a fly's and two mushroom-shaped antennas. They were
alien teddy bears!</TE>
<TE>   "You have that $25 that Grandma gave you," Jim's mother reminded
him. "Do you want one of those stuffed animals bad enough to spend
your own money?"</TE>
<TE>   Jim thought for only a moment. "Yes, I do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So he and his mom went into the store and bought it. "I'll call
you Ignatz," Jim told the creature. The creature did not complain.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they got home with the socks and the underwear and the
bear, it was late and Jim had to go right to bed. He settled Ignatz
on the windowsill of his room so he could look outside, and climbed
into bed.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll play tomorrow," Jim promised before he drifted off to
sleep.</TE>
<TE>   No one except Ignatz saw the ship shaped like a big grasshopper
swoop down over the city and hover outside Jim's window. Suddenly a
bright light struck Ignatz. When the light went out, Ignatz was gone,
and the ship leaped into the starry sky.</TE>

<HD>Repeating C-Section Is Safest Bet</HD>
<DH>Childbirth* For women who have had one, another caesarean
holds the least risk. But risks in a vaginal birth are lower than
previously thought.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Another caesarean section is the safest childbirth method for women
who have already had a surgical delivery, although the risks from a
vaginal delivery after caesarean are lower than previously thought,
British researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   A study of 313,238 births in Scotland found that for women with
previous caesareans, the delivery-related death rate for subsequent
babies was about 11 times higher in vaginal births than in planned
repeat caesareans.</LD>
<LD>   Still, the overall infant death rate for vaginal-after-caesarean
births was about equal to the death rate in first-time vaginal
births--about 1.2 per 1,000 babies, the study found. That compared
with 0.1 per 1,000 for planned repeat caesareans.</LD>
<TE>   Often-cited previous research suggested a death rate of 5.8 per
1,000 births for vaginal-after-caesarean deliveries.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the current study, those figures included many premature
babies, who are born before 37 weeks' gestation and face slimmer
survival chances than full-term infants, said Dr. Gordon C.S. Smith
of Cambridge University in Cambridge, England.</TE>
<TE>   Smith helped conduct the study, which involved babies born between
37 weeks and 43 weeks' gestation. It appeared in last Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said his study should reassure women "that the absolute risk
to the baby from vaginal birth after caesarean is very low."</TE>

<LD>Hang around with 10,000 microbiologists for a spell and you'll learn
a whole bunch of things about bacteria that cause disease--and
bacteria that make cheese, whiffy bacteria that grow in marshes and
clever ones that chomp up pollution and plastics.</LD>
<LD>   Among the reports from the American Society for Microbiology's
annual meet (this year in Salt Lake City): Putting iron in deodorants
might help control body odor, because iron inhibits the microbes that
turn sweat acrid. A bacterium found in a cave in Kentucky might
contain an anti-cancer drug. And garlic and onions might have a role
in the battle against bioterrorism. (Their oils contain
antimicrobials, so some scientists think they could be used as
decontaminants.)</LD>
<LD>   But sooner or later, one needs a break from chatter about genes
involved in sulfur metabolism or the latest in anthrax biology--and
that's when it's time to head to ... the exhibit hall. This is the
space where companies hawk everything from little plastic tubes for
holding DNA to cheery, orange labels proclaiming "Biohazard." It's
the place where you get a sense of the sheer amount of stuff
microbiologists use to discover things: microscopes, cotton swabs,
software for analyzing DNA, you name it.</LD>
<TE>   Madness can overtake one in an exhibit hall. First, there's the
candy at every booth (which seems to snare PhDs as effectively as
anything else). Dishes of peppermint patties and Hershey's Kisses
were momentarily enough to convince me I might be interested in a
nice bottle of buffer or a top-of-the-line safety cabinet for
disease-causing bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Tempting, too, were the many festive petri dishes filled with agar
nutrient--in raspberry red (sheep blood), chocolate brown (sheep
blood processed differently) rich, shiny gold (yeast extract) and
more.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these dishes can even turn different types of bacteria
different colors, which would presumably allow one to do wonderful
artwork. (Simply spread various species onto plates in cool patterns,
pop 'em in an incubator and wait for them to grow.) But that,
explained the sales rep, is not what the plates are for. They are to
facilitate bacterial identification in pathology labs.</TE>
<TE>   More alluring even than candy are those endless, ubiquitous
freebies--the note pads with logos, sundry small clippy things and
dozens of pens inscribed with such things as "Gen-Probe" and
"LabVelocity." How many microbiologists arrived home wondering why on
earth they had just traveled thousands of miles on cramped planes
nursing bags bursting with colored plastic tubes, posters of
Streptococcus gordonii (found in dental plaque), free journals
dedicated to the study of life in outer space, and devices used to
collect parasitic worms from stool samples?</TE>
<TE>   At the booth for the antibiotic Cipro, there were no free drug
samples but plenty of bright-blue tote bags and notepads on offer.
Nearby, an English lady was handing out beer coasters decorated with
information about the United Kingdom's Society for Applied
Microbiology. (Not for beer, she corrected: "This is Utah.")</TE>
<TE>   Another booth was flogging a hand-held "pipetter" (used by
scientists to measure small quantities of liquid). This one was fat
and chunky--like something a cartoon microbiologist would wield.
"It's ergonomic," explained rep Tony. Consider, he said, how many
times a day a scientist moves small volumes of liquid from one tube
to another. (This is 90% of what one does, if my grad school memories
serve me right.) Consider the potential for repetitive stress if the
design isn't right.</TE>
<TE>   There are other ways to draw in customers, of course. "Earlier, a
little kid came over and I told him it was a high-tech squirt gun and
he got really excited," Tony said. "His mother was with him. She's a
researcher. No sale yet, but who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the booth selling nothing but little paper labels.
"We're as important as anything else," insisted Daniel, in a moving
tribute to the role of the little guy in human endeavors. "Every
petri dish, every microscope slide, any container with a specimen in
it--if everything isn't marked, identified and dated, then you're
holding nothing but a petri dish and not knowing what's in it."</TE>

<HD>Americans Are a Bit Fuzzy About Physical Checkups</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The annual physical exam may be history, but many Americans don't
know it. Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force hasn't
recommended that healthy people get checkups since about 1979, a
recent survey in Denver, San Diego and Boston found about two-thirds
of people still believe that an annual head-to-toe exam is necessary.</LD>
<LD>   Not only were those surveyed wrong about checkups, they also
mistakenly believed certain tests that no medical group recommends
were needed; and they ignored others that authorities say are needed.
In short, people seem to be confused about what screening tests they
need and when. It doesn't help, write the researchers, that doctors
still use the words "annual checkup" in conversations with patients.</LD>
<LD>   In Denver, where the first phase of the survey was done, more than
90% of the 603 people questioned expected a blood pressure
measurement, a heart and lung exam, and, for men, a prostate exam
with their physical. But of all those procedures, only a blood
pressure measurement is recommended by the task force. Those surveyed
also felt their blood should be tested for various substances like
thyroid (hormone) and hemoglobin. The task force only recommends
cholesterol testing.</LD>
<TE>   The 600 respondents in the other cities answered slightly
different questionnaires. They didn't want as many tests as the
Denver group, but their expectations were similar regarding the need
for an annual checkup. Dr. Christine Laine, senior deputy editor of
the Annals of Internal Medicine and author of an editorial
accompanying the study, says research has not yet demonstrated that
patients who have annual physicals are more likely to get recommended
tests or adopt healthy behaviors than people who don't get regular
checkups. (Annals of Internal Medicine 2002:136: 652-659)</TE>
<TE>   Unhappy Marriages Can Be Hazardous to One's Health</TE>
<TE>   A bad marriage makes the heart grow thicker, probably because the
stress causes blood pressure to climb. Now researchers have
reanalyzed the data that originally showed unhappy married men have
high blood pressure and zeroed in on some specific attributes of
marriage that make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   Satisfaction and cohesion, which are measures of marital support,
seem to be most important in terms of blood pressure in the 103
patients studied, says Brian Baker, associate professor of psychiatry
at the University of Toronto, who presented his findings last week in
New York at the annual meeting of the American Society of
Hypertension. The size of the left ventricle of the heart increased
6.2% on average in the 72 subjects who had weak scores in marital
support. "Satisfaction means people are satisfied and committed in
their relationship. It's a quality of marriage concept," explains
Baker. "Cohesion is a quantity of life. It's the amount of time the
couple spends together." Job strain was more difficult to measure
because about half the people had changed their jobs over the course
of three years. A larger study of people with stable jobs over a long
period is needed. "We think that double exposure--a bad job and a bad
marriage--will tell us more," says Baker.</TE>
<TE>   With More Nodules Being Detected, Spotlight Falls on Needle Biopsy</TE>
<TE>   Physicians are bracing themselves for an epidemic of small thyroid
growths. Why? Use of imaging technology, such as MRIs and CT scans,
as a diagnostic tool in medicine is growing and these tests are
turning up nodules that otherwise would have gone unnoticed. Once
accidentally detected, the nodules can't be ignored because a small
percentage are malignant.</TE>
<TE>   When tumors are large enough, a needle biopsy is often the next
diagnostic step. Considering the increasing numbers of people with
the nodules and the low likelihood of cancer, however, the cost of
this invasive test could be enormous. This dilemma has doctors
searching for guidelines on who should get a needle biopsy and who
should be reexamined in six to 12 months. Now an Italian study of 402
people with thyroid nodules--31 of whom turned out to have
cancer--has yielded some suggestions.</TE>
<TE>   All the patients in the study had both ultrasound and needle
biopsies, and by comparing the results, the researchers found that
the image of the nodule created by sound waves was useful in
predicting malignancy. They report that features on the
ultrasound--such as irregular or blurred edges or tiny
calcifications--pointed to cancer, indicating that the nodule should
be biopsied. "This is a touch controversial, but it's an interesting
study of a large number of patients in which they found a significant
number of hidden cancers ... by looking at the three characteristics
on ultrasound," says Dr. Leonard Wartofsky, a professor of medicine
at Georgetown University. (The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp;
Metabolism 85 [5]: 1941-1946)</TE>
<TE>   Study Finds Caffeine May Stiffen Artery, Cause Cardiovascular
Disease</TE>
<TE>   Caffeine is the most widely used drug in the world, but studies
focusing on its health effects have been conflicting. Scientists are
now taking a closer look at very specific ways in which the body
responds to caffeine. For the first time, researchers in Athens have
shown in two studies that coffee appears to cause a major artery to
stiffen, which increases risk of cardiovascular disease. The research
was presented last week at the annual meeting of the American Society
of Hypertension in New York.</TE>
<TE>   In one study, 10 people with hypertension that was controlled by
medication abstained from coffee for 12 hours and then took a capsule
containing either the caffeine equivalent of two to three cups of
coffee or a placebo. On another occasion, they were given the placebo
capsule.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers then measured the stiffness of the subjects' aorta,
the main blood vessel that carries blood from within the heart to the
arteries. The measurements showed that aortic stiffness increased 30
minutes after the subjects took the caffeine capsules, peaked one
hour afterward, and began a slow return to its starting point after
three hours. The speed of blood flow through the arteries also
increased, as did blood pressure. A separate but similar study of 10
healthy people who took a capsule with the equivalent of one cup of
coffee also showed an increase in aortic stiffness.</TE>
<TE>   The short-term effects of caffeine were slight but significant.
Researchers note that increasing aortic stiffness and speed of blood
flow repeatedly for months or years could lead to degeneration of the
blood vessels. "We are not saying that everyone should abstain from
coffee, but people with heart failure or hypertension should be more
cautious," says Dr. Charalambos Vlachopoulos, director of
hypertension at the Henry Dunant Hospital in Athens. He also reminds
people that caffeine is not limited to coffee but is in certain sodas
and teas.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking Tea Strengthens Bones and Does a Body Good</TE>
<TE>   People who drink several cups of tea a day may be getting more
caffeine than they should, but other ingredients in the tea may be
strengthening their bones. Of the 4,000 chemical compounds in tea,
researchers suspect that the combination of fluoride and flavonoids,
including phytoestrogen, may prevent bone loss in men and women.</TE>
<TE>   But results of three major studies of tea and bone mass have not
all shown a connection between tea-drinking and prevention of bone
loss. Researchers in Taiwan were troubled by the fact that only white
patients who drank black tea were studied. So the National Cheng Kung
University team designed a study to examine more than 1,000 Chinese
men and women who drank three different types of tea. The researchers
also took into account many different factors that could have an
effect on bone density, including age, sex, obesity, physical
activity, smoking, coffee consumption and calcium supplements. About
half the men and women were tea drinkers, some for as long as 10
years or more, and 91% drank green tea.</TE>
<TE>   The results indicate that many years of tea drinking may be best
for bones. Those who consumed tea habitually for six to 10 years had
greater bone density in the lumbar spine than those who didn't drink
tea regularly for that long a time. There was no significant
difference between the group who drank tea for less than five years
and those who were not tea drinkers. (Archives of Internal Medicine

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: More than 50 years ago, when I was a child, my mother
rubbed Save-the-Baby on our chests when we had a bad cold. In the
early 1960s, I used it on my own children. Do you know if
Save-the-Baby is still made and where I could get some for my
grandchildren?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: We appreciate your nostalgia, but it might not be such a
shame that this old-fashioned remedy has become hard to find. It
contained camphor, which can be toxic if ingested. The directions on
the label suggested giving it internally every half-hour "until
relieved, or until the doctor arrives."</LD>
<LD>   Such instructions aren't relevant today, since house calls are
virtually extinct. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration
warns against internal use of any camphor-containing product.</LD>
<TE>   Q: The coffee at work is served with a cream substitute, which
contains partially hydrogenated soybean oil, corn syrup solids,
sodium caseinate, mono- and diglycerides and carrageenan. Would
several servings daily be harmful?</TE>
<TE>   A: Partially hydrogenated oil contains trans-fatty acids. Although
an occasional serving is probably not a problem, a daily ration is
not good for the heart. Dr. Walter Willett, chairman of nutrition at
the Harvard University School of Public Health, has found that
trans-fatty acids are just as dangerous as saturated fats such as
butter. When possible, choose low-fat milk for your coffee. Even
half-and-half might be better than hydrogenated vegetable oil.</TE>
<TE>   Q: I have recently read that there are health benefits from
drinking several ounces of pomegranate juice daily. I would
appreciate knowing what research on pomegranate juice reveals.</TE>
<TE>   A: Pomegranate juice does offer cardiovascular benefits. In an
article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (May 2000),
Israeli scientists reported that pomegranate juice can help prevent
the development of plaque in arteries. It makes LDL, the "bad
cholesterol," more resistant to oxidation and thus mitigates a step
in the development of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   In mice bred to be susceptible to plaque formation in their
arteries, pomegranate juice reduced atherosclerotic buildup by 44%.
Data also suggests that this juice can reduce the risk of blood
clots.</TE>

<HD>The Waters Deepen in Debate Over Fish's Health Benefits</HD>
<DH>Diet* Warnings about mercury exposure balance reports that
fatty acids contained in some seafood can reduce the risk of sudden
heart attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RIDGELY OCHS</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last month, three studies added to the evidence that omega-3 fatty
acids, primarily found in fish, appeared to lower the risk of dying
from a sudden heart attack--a reason the American Heart Assn.
recommends eating fish twice a week.</LD>
<LD>   Given that fish is low in saturated fat and a good source of
protein, and that 250,000 Americans collapse and die from sudden
heart attacks each year, it seems like a no-brainer that it should be
a regular part of everyone's diet. But as with many things in health,
the issue is more complicated.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning that
pregnant women, women who could become pregnant, nursing mothers,
infants and toddlers should not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel
and tilefish because of the risk of exposure to mercury, which can
affect brain development in fetuses and young children. The FDA said
that these groups can eat about 12 ounces of other cooked fish a
week--that's about two servings a week.</LD>
<TE>   But the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy group
in Washington, D.C.--based on its analysis of mercury test results
from seven government sources--recommended a wider ban on fish for
women of childbearing age and very young children. It included not
only the FDA's list but also: tuna steak, sea bass, oysters from the
Gulf Coast, marlin, halibut, pike walleye, white croaker and
largemouth bass. It said these women and children should eat no more
than one meal per month, if their fish of choice is canned tuna,
mahi-mahi, blue mussel, Eastern oyster, cod, pollock, salmon from the
Great Lakes, blue crab from the Gulf of Mexico, wild channel catfish
and lake whitefish.</TE>
<TE>   So, to eat fish or not to eat fish?</TE>
<TE>   "I eat fish," said Dr. Christine Albert of the division of
preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   That may be in part because Albert was lead author of a study of
278 men published April 11 in the New England Journal of Medicine
that found men with the highest levels of omega-3 fatty acids in
their blood had 81% less chance of dying from a sudden heart attack
than men with the lowest levels.</TE>
<TE>   Albert was also an author of a study published the day before in
the Journal of the American Medical Assn.: In the ongoing Nurses
Health Study of 84,688 women, those who ate the most fish had 44%
less risk of dying from a heart attack than those who ate the least.</TE>
<TE>   An Italian study that appeared the same week in the journal
Circulation followed 11,323 men and women who had had a heart attack
fewer than three months before. Over a year, one-third received usual
care, one-third received 300 milligrams of vitamin E a day and
one-third was given 1 gram of fish oil a day. After three months,
those taking fish oil had a 41% lower risk of dying from a repeat
heart attack compared to the usual care group. Although the mechanism
is not understood, it appears that omega-3 fatty acids protect
against uneven heart rhythms, according to Alice Lichtenstein,
professor of nutrition science and policy at Tufts University in
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   These fatty acids are largely found in fish, especially fatty fish
such as salmon, bluefish, mackerel and swordfish. There is also
evidence that the fatty acids can lower blood triglyceride levels,
help the immune system, play a role in clotting and maintaining good
blood pressure and help develop a baby's central nervous system.</TE>
<TE>   But fish, especially large fatty fish, can absorb methylmercury, a
highly toxic form that can cause learning delays, according to a
National Academy of Sciences report issued in 2000. Dr. Philip
Landrigan, chairman of the department of community and preventive
medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, recommends that women
of childbearing years and young children "be selective about the
species they eat." Younger fish--such as canned tuna rather than
large sushi-style tuna--may be a safer option, he said, because it
has less time to accumulate mercury.</TE>

<HD>Infertility Brings On a Unique Kind of Grief</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Late-Late Motherhood" (April 29), thank you for your excellent
coverage of the often-ignored emotional and physical life crisis of
infertility.</LD>
<LD>   There is one thing that you left out of your discussion, however,
that young women counting on technology to enhance their fertility
need to know. Not only is infertility treatment financially and
emotionally draining, but when you consider the option of egg
donation (which all the mothers in your article must have used to get
pregnant), you must also deal with the grief of knowing that you will
never have a child who is your genetic offspring.</LD>
<LD>   Infertility and infertility treatments are not fun. Do all you can
when you are young to preserve your fertility. Talk to your doctor as
soon as you suspect a problem. For in this case, time is money as
well as something else indefinable that you can never recapture.</LD>

<LD>Re: "It Took a Mountain to Move This Couple" (May 6), it is
interesting that the hikers who were "marching effortlessly" and
seemed to have done "nothing more strenuous than cruise the mall"
were from a country whose predominant way of thinking is Buddhist. It
is also interesting that the section focused on a woman who changed
her life by utilizing the Zen Buddhist concept of achieving awareness
of every single moment through sitting in silence ("A Life of
Accidents, a Quest for Answers").</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for presenting a poignant lesson that it is often better
to sit on the couch and foster concepts like inner-reflection,
observation, focus and awareness than to travel halfway around the
world at great expense to foster concepts like haste,
self-absorption, time-obsession and vanity.</LD>

<DH>ALL ABOUT OSTEOARTHRITIS: The Definitive Resource for
Arthritis Patients and Their Families, By Dr. Nancy E. Lane and Dr.
Daniel J. Wallace, Oxford University Press, 258 pages, $25.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane E. Allen</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>OVERVIEW: Osteoarthritis, the disease involving breakdown of the
cartilage, is a major public health issue, establish the authors,
both rheumatologists (Lane at UC San Francisco, Wallace at UCLA and
Cedars-Sinai). It's the second most common cause of disability in
this country, affecting 23 million Americans; by 2020, 30 million
Americans will have it.</LD>
<LD>   HOW IT WORKS: Lane and Wallace lead readers through the
definitions and anatomy of arthritis and dispel myths about its
causes. It can occur at any age--often a result of obesity, genetics,
old injury or extreme stress on the joints--and can be exacerbated by
some medications. They then move on to how it's diagnosed and how it
affects various parts of the body, before addressing traditional and
alternative therapies. Finally, they tackle disability, prognosis and
hope for a cure.</LD>

<DH>Phenomenon * A Boston psychiatrist is drawing attention to
the 'nocebo' effect, in which people who believe they will become ill
often do.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN REID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, researchers stumbled onto a striking finding: Women
who believed that they were prone to heart disease were nearly four
times as likely to die as women with similar risk factors who didn't
hold such fatalistic views.</LD>
<LD>   The higher risk of death, in other words, had nothing to with the
usual heart disease culprits--age, blood pressure, cholesterol,
weight. Instead, it tracked closely with belief. Think sick, be sick.</LD>
<LD>   That study is a classic in the annals of research on the "nocebo"
phenomenon, the evil twin of the placebo effect. While the placebo
effect refers to health benefits produced by a treatment that should
have no effect, patients experiencing the nocebo effect experience
the opposite. They presume the worst, health-wise, and that's just
what they get.</LD>
<TE>   "They're convinced that something is going to go wrong, and it's a
self-fulfilling prophecy," said Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at
Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital who published an article
earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical Assn.
beseeching his peers to pay closer attention to the nocebo effect.
"From a clinical point of view, this is by no means peripheral or
irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   Barsky's target is drug side effects, which cost the U.S. health
system more than $76 billion a year, according to a 1995 University
of Arizona study. If even a small percentage of those costs are
caused by patient expectations of harm, addressing the nocebo effect
could save a nifty sum.</TE>
<TE>   But convincing doctors that their patients' problems may be more
than biochemical is no simple trick.</TE>
<TE>   The nocebo effect is difficult to study, and medical training
leads doctors to seek a bodily cause for physical ills.</TE>
<TE>   "Nocebos often cause a physical effect, but it's not a physically
produced effect," said Irving Kirsch, a psychologist at the
University of Connecticut in Storrs who studies the ways that
expectations influence what people experience. "What's the cause? In
many cases it's an unanswered question."</TE>
<TE>   The word "nocebo," Latin for "I will harm," doesn't represent a
new idea--just one that hasn't caught on widely among clinicians and
scientists.</TE>
<TE>   More than four decades after researchers coined the term, only a
few medical journal articles mention it. Outside the medical
community, being "scared to death" or "worried sick" are expressions
that have long been part of the popular lexicon, noted epidemiologist
Robert Hahn from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Is such language just hyperbole? Not to those who accept, for
example, the idea of voodoo death--a hex so powerful that the victim
of the curse dies of fright. While many in the scientific community
may regard voodoo with skepticism, the idea that gut reactions may
have biological consequences can't be simply dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   "Surgeons are wary of people who are convinced that they will
die," said Herbert Benson, a Harvard professor and the president
Mind/Body Medical Institute in Boston. "There are examples of studies
done on people undergoing surgery who almost want to die to
re-contact a loved one. Close to 100% of people under those
circumstances die."</TE>
<TE>   But the nocebo effect can lead to more subtle outcomes as well.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen years ago, researchers at three medical centers undertook
a study of aspirin and another blood thinner in heart patients and
came up with an unexpected result that said little about the heart
and much about the brain. At two locations, patients were warned of
possible gastrointestinal problems, one of the most common side
effects of repeated use of aspirin. At the other location, patients
received no such caution.</TE>
<TE>   When researchers reviewed the data, they found a striking result:
Those warned about the gastrointestinal problems were almost three
times as likely to have the side effect. Though the evidence of
actual stomach damage such as ulcers was the same for all three
groups, those with the most information about the prospect of minor
problems were the most likely to experience the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the smattering of doctors' anecdotal reports and a few
modest clinical studies, research on the phenomenon has not been
robust, mostly for ethical reasons: Doctors ought not to induce
illness in patients who are not sick.</TE>
<TE>   Changing ethical standards have made it difficult to even repeat
some of the classic nocebo experiments. In one century-old effort,
conducted long before anyone thought up the word "nocebo," doctors
set an allergy sufferer wheezing by showing an artificial rose,
proving that some aspect of the allergic response is stimulated by
visual cues.</TE>
<TE>   In a study from the early 1980s, 34 college students were told an
electric current would be passed through their heads, and the
researchers warned that the experience could cause a headache. Though
not a single volt of current was used, more than two-thirds of the
students reported headaches.</TE>
<TE>   But resistance to in-depth study of the nocebo effect rests on
more than ethical reservations, said the CDC's Hahn. Belief, he said,
does not have a strong place in the anatomy-centered world of modern
medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is that phenomena that essentially come down to what
people believe are conceptually difficult in our medical system,"
Hahn said. "Health is thought to be a biological phenomenon. More
psychosomatic elements are hard to deal with."</TE>
<TE>   Science is wearing away at the wall between mind and body. With
the aid of high-tech imaging devices, neurologists are getting better
at taking pictures of the brain in action. In one blind study last
year, researchers found that patients with Parkinson's disease given
a placebo released a brain chemical called dopamine, just as the
brain exposed to an active drug would do.</TE>
<TE>   That flood of brain chemicals, it appears, has everything to do
with what the mind expects. In most cases, like the Parkinson's
study, the outcome is positive--the placebo effect in action. But for
some patients--depressed, wary of medication or worried about drug
side effects--getting a prescription filled is an angst-ridden
experience. And such patients appear even more likely to exhibit
those side effects.</TE>
<TE>   Barsky has even sketched out a profile of the kind of patient
likely to experience the nocebo effect--worse side effects and poorer
outcomes--on a given drug. When Barsky sees a patient with a history
of vague, difficult-to-diagnose complaints who is sure that whatever
therapy is prescribed will do little to battle the problem, he says,
those low expectations are inevitably met. The treatments usually
fail.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you trust your doctor or not probably makes a huge
difference in whether you report side effects, but there's almost no
data on that," Barsky said. He hopes to include information about a
person's psychology in an upcoming placebo-controlled clinical trial
to see if patients with a particular outlook on life fare better or
worse than other subjects.</TE>
<TE>   Far more esoteric factors may also shape the placebo and nocebo
response. A Dutch study, for example, found that most people
considered red and orange pills to be stimulating, with blue and
green pills more likely to have a depressant effect.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the most important things about a pill is [its] color,"
said Daniel Moerman, an anthropologist at the University of Michigan
in Dearborn, who has studied the placebo and nocebo effects across
different cultures. "That seems to be fairly widespread."</TE>
<TE>   But the mind is a funny thing, and generic responses to color go
just so far in explaining the placebo or nocebo response. Consider
this: In Italy, Moerman says, blue placebos made excellent sleeping
pills for women but had the opposite effect on men.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent reason? "The Italian national football team's color
is azzurri," he said. "Blue."</TE>

<HD>For Hernias, a Decision About the Incision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most people would assume that an operation performed with smaller
incisions is a good thing, but surgeons aren't so sure--at least when
it comes to hernia repair. As for patients, many don't understand
what a hernia is.</LD>
<LD>   The term "hernia" is used to describe a weakness or abnormal
opening in a body structure that permits another organ to protrude
through. Perhaps the most familiar types of hernias are those that
occur in an anatomically weak spot in the abdominal wall, such as
around the bellybutton (umbilical hernia) or in the groin (inguinal
hernia), and those that develop where the abdominal wall has become
weakened, such as at the site of a surgical incision (incisional
hernia).</LD>
<LD>   Typically, abdominal hernias appear as round bulges in the
abdominal wall when a person is straining (for example, when lifting
a heavy object), and disappear when the muscles are relaxed. In some
cases, however, the bulging--caused by intestines pushing through the
weakened area in the abdominal wall--persists. Many people with
hernias have no symptoms; others experience discomfort or mild pain.</LD>
<TE>   With inguinal hernias, the bulging occurs in the groin area. This
type of hernia affects men much more commonly than women, because men
have an intrinsic weakness where the testes descend into the scrotum
during fetal development. As a result, an inguinal hernia in men can
produce swelling of the scrotum if a loop of intestine follows that
same path through the weakened (and now enlarged) opening.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, people with hernias were advised to use "hernia
supports," trusses that minimize the bulging by applying pressure
over the weakened area. However, the only true cure for a hernia is
an operation that closes up the opening and strengthens the weakened
area around it.</TE>
<TE>   Surgery may not be necessary in all cases of umbilical or
incisional hernias, especially if no symptoms are present and the
bulging disappears whenever the stomach is relaxed. But most surgeons
agree that almost all groin hernias should be repaired surgically,
because serious--even life-threatening--complications can develop
when they are left untreated. With this type of hernia, the
intestines and any other tissue that protrudes through the weakness
can become trapped and its blood supply cut off.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, hernias have been repaired using "open" surgery,
with a very high rate of success. With this technique, an incision is
made in the skin directly over the hernia, and the weakness is
identified and repaired. Sometimes the edges of the defect are simply
pulled together (much like sewing a hole together in a piece of
cloth). More frequently, a small piece of synthetic mesh is used to
bridge the defect. (The mesh is sutured to the edges of the opening,
and serves as a "patch" over the weakened area.)</TE>
<TE>   About 10 years ago, some surgeons began to repair hernias using a
laparoscope. With this technique, the entire procedure is done
through very small incisions in the abdominal wall. The surgical
instruments are inserted through these incisions, along with a
miniature camera that enables the surgeon to see the area being
repaired. Unlike open hernia surgery, all laparoscopic repairs
utilize mesh to cover the weakened area.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of the laparoscopic procedure point out that patients
treated this way have less postoperative pain and return to normal
activities more quickly. They say this approach may be better for
patients with recurrent hernias, because laparoscopy avoids the old
scar tissue. The open procedure, on the other hand, cuts through it.</TE>
<TE>   Critics counter that the procedure presents an increased risk of
rare--but serious--complications, such as injuries to the bladder and
bowel. And, unlike open surgery, which can often be performed using
only local anesthetic, the laparoscopic procedure requires general
anesthesia, which means it may not be advisable for people with
serious cardiac or respiratory problems. (They also point out that
the laparoscopic procedure is more expensive and longer.)</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the biggest question surrounding laparoscopic hernia
repairs relates to its long-term success rate: How does this
procedure compare to the traditional open procedure for preventing
another hernia from recurring at the same site? The laparoscopic
procedure is so new that no one--including the doctors who have been
performing it--could answer definitively.</TE>
<TE>   A recently published study, however, offers some preliminary
results. Researchers in the United Kingdom reported on a group of
almost 400 men and women who underwent hernia repair; slightly more
than half had an open procedure, and the others had their hernias
repaired laparoscopically. Five years after surgery, the recurrence
rate of hernias in the two groups was almost identical.</TE>
<TE>   So what's a person with a hernia to do? Most experts agree that
the single most important step is to find a surgeon who has extensive
experience with hernia operations. As with almost all surgical
procedures, experience counts, and practice makes (almost) perfect.
If there is any question about the necessity for surgery or about
which procedure (open or laparoscopic) is better, get a second
opinion--preferably from a surgeon who has extensive experience with
both procedures.</TE>

<HD>Web Site Tracks the Effect of Drugs on Pregnancy</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Women are generally discouraged from taking prescription drugs while
pregnant, but some must do so to protect their health. Now they can
take comfort in knowing they may be able to help others coming after
them.</LD>
<LD>   The FDA's Office of Women's Health earlier this month launched a
Web site to help women locate studies, called pregnancy registries,
designed to determine the risks posed by various medications to their
unborn babies' health and development.</LD>
<LD>   Pregnant women selected as study participants periodically provide
researchers with details about their health. After delivery, they
also provide information about the health of their children. The more
women these studies can recruit and monitor, the more they'll be able
to help women weigh the potential risk of medications on the fetus.
Although most women try to minimize the number of medications they
take during pregnancy, the reality is that stopping certain medicines
could jeopardize their own health and possibly the health of the
fetus.</LD>
<TE>   Surveillance studies are underway for pregnant women taking
medications for asthma, epilepsy and seizures, herpes, chickenpox,
HIV, genital warts, migraines, pain, depression and arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the pregnancy registries operates differently: Some
require enrollment through a health care provider; others enroll
women directly. Participation typically requires confidential
interviews during the pregnancy and after delivery.</TE>

taking medicines while pregnant, go to:

<HD>Failed Suicides in the ER</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>U.S. health experts reported Thursday that up to 70% of all nonfatal,
self-inflicted injuries treated in hospital emergency rooms were the
result of failed suicide attempts.</LD>
<LD>   A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed
158,466 of the estimated 264,108 people who visited emergency rooms
for self-inflicted poisoning, cuts, gun wounds and other injuries in
2000 had likely tried to kill themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Another 27,294 emergency room cases stemmed from possible suicide
attempts, according to the study, which was based on extrapolated
data collected from 66 hospitals across the nation.</LD>
<TE>   Although comparable data was not available for other years,
officials with the Atlanta-based CDC said the study would help
doctors and other health-care providers better understand the nature
of self-inflicted violence and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the
eighth-leading cause of death in the U.S. and the second-leading
cause of death for those 25 to 34. About 29,000 of the 650,000
Americans who attempt suicide each year die.</TE>
<TE>   In the CDC study, adolescents between 15 and 19 and young adults
20 to 34 accounted for 59% of the nonfatal, self-inflicted injuries
reported by the hospitals. Women made up about 57% of the injuries.</TE>

<HD>'Sisterhood' Track Akin to 'O Brother'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How do you follow a pop phenomenon? That's the question that
producer-musician T Bone Burnett answers this week with the
soundtrack for "Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," his first
soundtrack project since the album for "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
became the out-of-left-field success story of 2001.</LD>
<LD>   The "Sisterhood" album, which hits stores Tuesday, has several
parallels to "O Brother," as well as key differences. Once again
Burnett has assembled a mix of vintage recordings, recent tracks from
contemporary artists and a few numbers commissioned for the Callie
Khouri-directed adaptation of Rebecca Wells' best-selling 1996 novel.
It's scheduled to open June 7. The album is the first release on the
new Columbia Records-affiliated DMZ label created by Burnett and "O
Brother" filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen.</LD>
<LD>   Highlights start with a new Bob Dylan song, the Cajun-country
spiced waltz "Waitin' for You," his first effort for a movie since he
won an Oscar for "Things Have Changed" from "Wonder Boys."</LD>
<TE>   There's also a new Lauryn Hill tune, "Selah," and new recordings
of vintage songs by Tony Bennett, Macy Gray, Taj Mahal and "O
Brother" alumna Alison Krauss.</TE>
<TE>   To evoke the rural Louisiana atmosphere of Wells' book, Burnett
also rounds up old blues tracks from Jimmy Reed, Slim Harpo and Ray
Charles, a Mahalia Jackson gospel number and several Cajun tunes from
Blind Uncle Gaspard and modern-day historian-musician Ann Savoy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is differentiated from a whole bunch of soundtracks that have
come out in the last year to year and a half," says Scott Levin,
director of music marketing for the national Musicland retail chain.
"People are looking for something different--things they can relate
to that are not so manufactured. And that to me is the critical thing
about this soundtrack: It's got great songwriting and doesn't give
you the feeling it's just thrown together."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody in retail is expecting this album to hit the stratospheric
heights of "O Brother"--sales of 5.2 million and counting, plus
Grammy, Country Music Assn. and Academy of Country Music honors as
album of the year--but they are optimistic that the "Sisterhood"
album will appeal to a good chunk of the "O Brother" audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We will definitely associate the two because of the 'O Brother'
success," Levin says. "It could be a Top 10 debut given the
competition, but we also believe it has legs, and that's really what
happened with 'O Brother.' It didn't start out very big, but just
grew and grew and has been a steady seller ever since."</TE>
<TE>   But will the "O Brother" audience make the connection?</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard much of a buzz about it," says Wherehouse chain
buyer Craig Swedin.</TE>
<TE>   "But I'm sure that once the movie hits it should have good sales
because of who all is involved."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Little Films Have Little Chance</TE>
<TE>   If it seems that the only movies showing at the local megaplex
these days are "Spider-Man," "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the
Clones" and a handful of other big studio releases, be forewarned: It
only figures to get worse.</TE>
<TE>   America's movie theaters are facing a glut of summer movies and,
as a result, the screen crunch is worsening.</TE>
<TE>   That's because there are only 32,000 movie screens in the country,
and with wide-release blockbusters filling up all the best sites, the
competition for the rest will only increase. This weekend, "The Sum
of All Fears" is to roll out in about 3,000 theaters, with
"Undercover Brother" taking more than 2,000 sites. Those films enter
a market already glutted with "Star Wars," "Spider-Man" and new
releases like "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron," which opened last
weekend in more than 3,300 theaters, and "Insomnia" and "Enough,"
each of which debuted in more than 2,600 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" actually has increased the number of theaters in
which it's playing to nearly 3,900, and that film has been out four
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievable," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of the box
office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. "It gets tougher and
tougher to get a screen in a theater. This is going to be problematic
this summer, when we have 54 films being released from May through
August, compared to 41 films last summer."</TE>
<TE>   Dergarabedian said the downside to all this is that the logjam
invariably will squeeze out smaller, lower-profile films.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miniseries to Get More Mini in Reruns</TE>
<TE>   Call them the incredible shrinking miniseries, as NBC pumps up the
volume on nostalgia beginning Saturday by bringing back "The '60s"
and later "The '70s," a pair of two-part productions that performed
well for the network ratings-wise despite tepid reviews.</TE>
<TE>   NBC's decision to rerun those projects stems in part from its
desire to pave the way for "American Dreams"--a similarly themed
upcoming weekly dramatic series, set in the 1960s, which uses
"America Bandstand" as a backdrop. "Bandstand" host Dick Clark is
among the producers of the program, which premieres on the network
this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in order to accommodate its three-hour Saturday-night movie
slot, both productions will be whittled down from their original
four-hour presentation, as will the World War II miniseries
"Uprising," which is also planned for an encore telecast in June.</TE>
<TE>   An NBC spokeswoman noted that the network's contract on miniseries
calls for the producers to deliver three-hour and four-hour versions.
In other words, the filmmakers oversaw editing of the condensed form,
so the movie won't abruptly end halfway through 1967.</TE>
<TE>   All the networks are providing a mix of reruns and low-cost
original programming this summer, trying to keep the lights turned on
as they gear up for September. NBC has an advantage in that it will
run the reminder of the NBA playoffs, which traditionally provide a
solid promotional platform for new shows.</TE>

<HD>The Quest for Color on Network TV</HD>
<DH>Diversity* Executives cite progress in minority
representation, but critics say it's too little and coming too
slowly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON and DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than two years after the four major networks promised to
increase minority representation in their prime-time lineups, the
recently unveiled fall TV schedule is sparking fresh debate about
whether the networks have made significant progress.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox last week pointed out how most
of the new dramas and comedies coming this fall feature at least one
minority character, and several new ensemble dramas feature
minorities--primarily African Americans--in key roles.</LD>
<LD>   ABC, which came in for the harshest criticism last season from
advocates pushing for more diversity, also renewed "The George Lopez
Show," a comedy about a Latino family that premiered in the spring to
modest ratings. Several pilots with predominantly minority casts were
developed.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, executives are giving high marks to a series of
minority showcases sponsored by the networks this year that were
designed to increase their exposure to what they said was a
relatively small talent pool of performers. More showcases for
blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and other
minorities are being planned.</TE>
<TE>   Opportunities for actors of color do exist beyond the major
networks. The WB and UPN have scheduled several new series featuring
minorities, with the WB ordering "Greetings From Tucson," a sitcom
about a Latino family, while UPN has scheduled "Half and Half," about
two black half-sisters living in the same apartment building. An
updated version of UPN's "The Twilight Zone" will be hosted by black
actor Forest Whitaker. Several cable series also feature
predominantly minority casts, including Showtime's "Soul Food" and
"Resurrection Blvd."</TE>
<TE>   Yet while the WB and UPN, as well as cable, have developed
minority-themed series, a coalition promoting more minority
representation on television has focused on the four major networks,
which, after a season in which they offered no minority leads in
their new programs, signed agreements with the coalition in 1999
pledging to increase minorities in front of and behind the camera.</TE>
<TE>   From that perspective, only two of the 26 new fall series on the
four major networks feature a minority in a leading role, and both of
those will air back-to-back Wednesdays on Fox ("Cedric the
Entertainer Presents" and "Fastlane"). None of the families at the
center of nine freshman comedies and dramas are minorities. The only
minority-themed family drama on the horizon revolves around a Latino
clan that sells narcotics, which is planned for midseason on NBC.</TE>
<TE>   Although showcase participants auditioned for pilots, none of the
some 300 actors and actresses who took part in the showcases landed
regular roles on any of the new fall shows on ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement of the fall schedule followed a report by
Children Now, a nonprofit child research and action organization,
which concluded that the networks have made minimal progress in
furthering prime-time diversity. The study said that last season's
sitcoms were the least diverse of the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very disappointed," said Karen Narasaki, leader of the
coalition, which includes the NAACP, the National Latino Media
Council, American Indians in Film &amp; Television and the Asian Pacific
Media Coalition, referring to the new fall lineups on the four major
networks. "We were looking for growth, and there isn't any. We have
concerns to the extent that there are no central or lead minority
characters on the new shows. Yes, there are blacks and Latinos on
some of the shows, but the numbers on Asians and Native Americans are
dismal."</TE>
<TE>   Narasaki, executive director of the National Asian Pacific Legal
Consortium, pointed to CBS' "Presidio Med," a new drama about a San
Francisco-based hospital: "There are no Asians on a series that is
based in a city that is one of the main population points for
Asians." (The drama does have two minorities in the main cast--Anna
Deavere Smith and Oded Fehr.)</TE>
<TE>   As for the effectiveness of the showcases, Narasaki said she was
unhappy that no one had been cast from those forums. "The showcases
increased the exposure for a lot of people, but somewhere between the
pilots and the shows that got picked up, something happened," she
said. "The showcases are not reflected in the shows."</TE>
<TE>   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume added that while there has been an
increase in on-air roles for minorities, little or no progress has
been made behind the camera. "There's been no real progress for
putting more minorities on writing staffs, or in the directing
ranks," he said. "And there's no movement on the corporate boards....
While there has been some progress, it's really about who can make
the decisions that a series can go on the air."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Narasaki's concerns over the new schedule, others in the
coalition praised the networks' efforts, particularly the showcases.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Velasco of the Hispanic Media Coalition, which is keeping
the statistics on Latino actors, said, "These showcases are the most
effective way for actors of color to get noticed."</TE>
<TE>   Narasaki said the coalition would release its annual report card
grading the networks on their diversity efforts next month. The NAACP
is also scheduled to issue its own study this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Network officials said they feel confident that the initiatives
are being honored and that the showcases would eventually foster more
diversity. They said that casting of regular, recurring and guest
roles will take place throughout the summer, which could very well
result in more progress.</TE>
<TE>   "We will be filling out casts with minorities as we go forward
into the season," said Josie Thomas, CBS' head of diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Mitsy Wilson, head of diversity initiatives for Fox, pointed to
the strong reception last season to "The Bernie Mac Show" and the
drama "24," which featured a story line revolving around a black
presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Carmen J. Smith, ABC's vice president of talent
development programs, said that the network is "totally committed to
diversity, and we're very excited about what is going on with the
showcases." Out of 88 participants in ABC's events, 59 read for roles
in pilots, she noted.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a slow process, and things are just not going to change
overnight," added Marc Hirschfield, NBC's executive vice president of
casting. "The most exciting part about what we're doing with the
showcases is providing opportunities that simply did not exist
before. Now so many of these performers are in the mainstream, where
they were sitting on the sidelines before."</TE>

<HD>Patriotic PSAs' Goal Is to Spur Public Service</HD>
<DH>Television* Spots aimed at inspiring volunteerism are being
sent to networks in hopes they'll be used through July 4.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One pays silent homage to the freedom Americans enjoy. Another
flashes patriotic scenes from movies. A third has civic and military
heroes answering the question, "Why do you serve?"</LD>
<LD>   In the latest endeavor by media moguls to contribute to the war on
terrorism, three 30-second public service announcements are being
sent to almost every major broadcast and cable television network,
with hopes they will run on the small screen sometime between today
and July 4.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea is to basically instill, hopefully, a sense of loyalty,
a sense of pride, a sense of gratitude for not only the people in the
military, but other people who serve," said Rob Friedman, vice
chairman of Paramount Pictures, who spearheaded the creation and
distribution of the public service ads, along with high-ranking
executives from NBC, CBS and Time Warner.</LD>
<TE>   The spots, made with donated materials and time, are another
result of last fall's meeting here between President Bush's top
political strategist, Karl Rove, and the gatekeepers of every major
studio and television network. When the meeting was first announced,
some members of the Hollywood creative community expressed discomfort
with the executives' chumminess with the White House, fearing it
would result in mandates for propaganda or censorship. But Rove and
the executives publicly insisted that "content was off the table"
during the discussions.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of each brief announcement, viewers will see the name,
number and Web site of USA Freedom Corp., a nonpartisan clearinghouse
for volunteerism, with a Web site that links to other volunteer
organizations, such as AmeriCorps and the Peace Corps.</TE>
<TE>   "The president called on all Americans to dedicate at least two
years of their life, the equivalent of 4,000 hours of their life, to
service to others," said Lindsey Kozberg, communications director for
USA Freedom Corp. "Our mission is to help fulfill that."</TE>
<TE>   While the networks are under no obligation to run the spots,
Friedman and his colleagues are hoping they see the short
announcements as broad-based and universal enough to use for any
audience.</TE>
<TE>   "We're giving it to these operations to use at their own
discretion to be part of the effort," said John Miller, president of
NBC Agency, the network's in-house advertising agency, who helped
coordinate the project. "We've given them three versions, which they
can use depending on their audience. It's all about volunteerism.
There's no mandate or government mandate on that."</TE>
<TE>   While neither Miller nor Friedman expects these public-service
spots to incite the entire nation into volunteering, they do see them
as part of a larger body of pro-America projects launched since Rove
first came to town.</TE>
<TE>   In December, thousands of movie theaters played a trailer of
inspiring moments in film that embody the American spirit, and some
TV personalities taped holiday messages to the armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   The Hollywood coalition also provided programs to the Armed Forces
Radio Network, so the troops could get their fill of American pop
culture.</TE>

<HD>Are Days of Film Numbered?</HD>
<DH>Movies* Digital filmmaking as George Lucas envisioned has
arrived with 'Attack of the Clones.' But forces are aligning against
it too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL DESOWITZ</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now that "Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones" has arrived
with all its digital hype (the first major motion picture shot with
digital cameras and the first to be digitally projected in nearly 100
theaters worldwide, including eight around town), the real battle
begins for cinema supremacy.</LD>
<LD>   But does this really mark the death of film?</LD>
<LD>   It all depends on whom you talk to, of course, but it appears that
we're in for a long coexistence, since most cinematographers are not
about to abandon shooting on film and digital projection is still in
its infancy. (The studios only recently formed a coalition, renamed
NDC, or New Digital Cinema, to standardize the technology.) "It is
just a footnote and not the watershed I had hoped for," remarks
"Clones" producer Rick McCallum, who was counting on a few hundred
digital installments. But he adds: "The great thing now is that the
[antidigital] structure is breaking down and we're on a juggernaut."</LD>
<TE>   If the Force is now with digital cinema, you can thank George
Lucas and his techno Jedi. It's to their credit that the digital
"Clones" looks superior to the film version on the big screen. Colors
are brighter and richer, and the overall image, though not razor
sharp, has a lot more zip. The film version is grainier, not
surprisingly, but offers better contrast. Shadow detail is very
close. Of course, it all depends on your preference, since they
represent two different aesthetics.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one cinematographer found the digital presentation "too
perfect." He prefers the imperfection of film as a more tactile
experience, thank you. And he's not alone.</TE>
<TE>   Yet "Clones" represents the perfect poster child for digital
cinema: a visual effects feast (consisting of 2,200
computer-generated shots) tailor-made for an all-digital pipeline,
which is why the new Sony 24P digital camera--containing special
Panavision film lenses--was developed specifically for the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not the antichrist; we are not advocating the death of
film," adds McCallum. "But for the kinds of films we make, it makes
absolute sense to [go all-digital]. It's part of the evolutionary
change for George, working digitally. A week [before the release], he
was still re-shooting a couple of shots that were too late for film
but will make it into the digital version.</TE>
<TE>   "If the people respond, if the cameramen and directors understand
that they have total control of their work, that it will look exactly
as they shot it, then for the first time we're going to have an
aesthetic choice."</TE>
<TE>   However, unlike editors who eventually responded to the digital
domain that Lucas offered them a decade ago because of its
superiority to film, cinematographers maintain that shooting on film
is still the best way to go.</TE>
<TE>   "I liked shooting with the Sony 24P," says Robert Primes, who won
an Emmy for his work on "Felicity." "It's easy to use, but it's
inferior to a film camera. Digital is getting to the point where it
is pretty good-looking, but the curve is not as sharp as film.
Digital sees about the same in shadows as film, but not as well in
highlights. And it's not as sharp as film. For us, quantity is the
thing, and we're not swayed by this media hype."</TE>
<TE>   For all the advantages of shooting digitally (no film processing,
immediate playback in high-definition, longer takes, it plugs right
into the visual effects), Primes says that the Sony 24P has technical
drawbacks. "Digital is good enough in certain circumstances as a
viable alternative to film, like 'Star Wars.' Believe me, we are open
to every possible new technology. We test it all the time, but don't
tell us that it's better than shooting on film."</TE>
<TE>   Cinematographer Francis Kenny ("How High"), who has also used the
Sony 24P, agrees that it's quick and fast but inferior to the film
camera. "The studios don't even know if they want to shoot in
[digital] high-definition. There are quality and piracy issues."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kenny laments the digital hype for what it's doing to
his craft. "Where to put light and what it means and [creating] great
spatial design are what cinematography is all about. The unfortunate
thing is that the ease is taking away from the discipline for young
cinematographers. You should learn your craft first. Does it give you
the same emotional experience? No. For feature-film storytelling, it
has a long way to go."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Deakins, who was nominated for an Oscar for cinematography
this year for "The Man Who Wasn't There," has never used a digital
camera but is a great believer in coexistence. "I'm all for
intertwining the two, and that seems the best way to go right now. In
'O Brother, Where Art Thou?,' we used digital [manipulation] to get
an old, hand-tinted postcard look. There was a loss of fine
definition and detail, but it helped on that film. We tried a digital
black-and-white test on 'Man,' but the resolution wasn't good enough,
so we passed."</TE>
<TE>   John Bailey, the cinematographer who shot the upcoming "Divine
Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," has limited experience with digital
cameras. But after shooting one feature ("The Anniversary Party") on
digital and a side-by-side comparison of the Sony 24P and a film
camera, he believes film is here to stay for quite a while.</TE>
<TE>   "Celluloid is far superior for the look I need when making a
high-end Hollywood mainstream film or a well-crafted independent
film," he said. "I can't imagine if 'Ya-Ya' were shot on
high-definition and projected digitally that it would look the same
way. The film experience is a different sensation. And this film
relies on an intimacy you can't get digitally."</TE>
<TE>   According to John Fithian, president of the National Assn. of
Theater Owners, the studios have begun reaching out to exhibitors "to
start a dialogue about comprehensive industry-wide planning on all
issues, including financing" of digital projection. But getting
digital projection ready for critical mass could take up to two
years, which McCallum finds absurd. "I don't believe studios and
exhibitors respect their audience enough. "It's appalling how little
is spent on R&amp;D in relation to the pop-cultural impact and the amount
of money that goes into this industry. The studios are scared they
will lose the pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   "But guess what? They're going to lose it anyway."</TE>

<HD>'Military Diaries': In the Words of Young Warriors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With all the journalistic firepower aimed at covering the war on
terrorism, who would have predicted that the best documentary on the
terror, boredom, anger and sadness felt by U.S. sailors and soldiers
in the war zone would come from VH1, the rock music channel?</LD>
<LD>   "Military Diaries," a six-part series that makes its debut
tonight, is an extraordinary achievement based on a simple strategy:
Let the sailors and soldiers speak for themselves, unfiltered by
journalists.</LD>
<LD>   Developed and executive produced by Emmy Award winner R.J. Cutler,
"Military Diaries" provided video cameras to selected sailors aboard
the carrier John C. Stennis in the Arabian Sea and to Army troops on
duty in Kuwait and Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The result is an intimate, compelling look at the young men and
women on the front lines of the U.S. war on terrorism. The talk is
funny, poignant, candid--an F/A-18 pilot talks of going three months
without sex--and very real.</TE>
<TE>   A soldier explains her frustration at seeing hungry Afghan
children amid the rubble that is their country. She is learning that
even a superpower has its limits.</TE>
<TE>   "That's really the hardest part," she says tearfully. "I want
desperately to know at the end of the day we have made this place
better."</TE>
<TE>   The thesis of this VH1 series, hit upon lightly, is that this
generation of American warriors uses music as a morale booster. A
Special Forces captain is a Bob Dylan fan, but while donning his flak
jacket and checking his rifle before landing in an enemy-beset area,
he cranks up Smashing Pumpkins on his boom-box.</TE>
<TE>   The photography is first-rate, of the Stennis, the desert wastes
and snowy peaks of Afghanistan, the U.S. troops, and the Afghan
people, old and young. There is no narration, just straight-talk; the
cuts are quick but not jerky.</TE>
<TE>   "Diaries" shows that service in a war zone is a mix of the mundane
and the terrifying. A major goes into Kabul to buy toilet seats and
haggle for rugs. On the drive back to the base on a narrow road, he
casually explains one facet of life "in-country."</TE>
<TE>   "Beware of mines on the side of the road," he tells the camera.
"Just another hazard of the job."</TE>
<TE>   Some realities not even White Zombie and R.E.M. can change.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The first two episodes of "Military Diaries" can be seen today at
10-11 p.m. on VH1.</TE>

<HD>She Sings From Experience</HD>
<DH>In 'The Full Monty,' Carol Woods recalls hard times and
seedy gigs, things she knows all too well</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ask Carol Woods about the photos of her grandchildren on the table in
her dressing room at the Ahmanson Theatre, and she'll proudly discuss
the family--even though full disclosure involves some tangled
arithmetic. "I have a daughter who's 40 years old and a son who's 30,
which makes me 39 and still holding." She laughs, then booms: "I
dispute anyone who tells me different!"</LD>
<LD>   Nobody's likely to argue with Woods or, for that matter, with her
crowd-pleasing "Full Monty" character, Jeanette Burmeister. As the
seen-it-all, done-it-all, stuck-in-Buffalo, eight-times-divorced
pianist who accompanies six hapless male strippers in "The Full
Monty" (running through June 8 at the Ahmanson Theatre), Woods fires
off one-line zingers with panache.</LD>
<LD>   Her signature tune, "Jeanette's Show Biz Number," recounts hard
times and seedy gigs. Woods can relate. She remembers belting out
three sets a night for $25 at New York steak joints back when she
used to work the now-vanished East Coast Chitlin' Circuit.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah, I have lived a life--some of it is very painful," Woods
says. "I had a battle with drugs, for a minute. I saw it was not for
me, and I got out. I had a marriage for five years and then got
divorced and struggled by myself with a child to raise. But I
persevered, got my money together, tried to keep myself pulled up
and, through all that living, it made me a better person and a better
entertainer. I can sing the song because I know what it's about."</TE>
<TE>   Woods caps each "Number" with a soulful lick that sounds as if it
came straight out of church, so it's not surprising to learn that she
started singing gospel at age 3.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember they used to stand me on a table so people could see
me," Woods recalls. Her grandfather was bishop of the Friendly Church
of the Apostolic Faith in Queens, N.Y. Secular music was frowned upon
as the "devil's music," and Woods never told her grandfather, who
died at 99, that she had become a professional entertainer. "I was
very respectful of him and I didn't want to hurt him, because I knew
how he felt about that sort of thing," she explains. "He was very
strict."</TE>
<TE>   Woods' vocal gifts may have been obvious early on, but the
intimate authority she now brings to the stage took years to develop.
"I had an instrument, I will say, but there's a difference between
knowing how to sing and being able to sing. I used to go and watch
people like Irene Reed and Ella Fitzgerald, and I'd say, 'Gosh, I
wish I could do that,' because they'd perform with such ease and such
experience. To be able to stand in front of the people and to make
them feel like you are in their living room, that's something you
don't learn overnight.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to go through the fire in order to be pure," she
continues. "You have to be compressed like a piece of coal in order
to become a diamond, you know. And so that's what the years bring to
a person who starts out with an ability to sing--it makes you an
artist."</TE>
<TE>   Married at 17, Woods had her first child two years later, in 1963,
and began working as a nurse. "I was making $67 a week, which was not
a lot of money for the responsibilities I had," says Woods, who later
found a better-paying job at the post office. A friend cajoled her
into singing at a postal employees' dance, where she was spotted by
an agent. Woods began moonlighting on weekends, stretching her
repertoire into a full evening of entertainment by improvising
variations on "Sunny," "Summertime" and "Stormy Monday Blues"--the
only three secular songs she knew at the time.</TE>
<TE>   At 35, Woods landed her first Equity production as understudy for
Cissy Houston in the 1979 revue "Taking My Turn." The show's musical
director, Barry Levitt, who now runs the Lyrics and Lyricists Program
at the 92nd Street Y in New York, says, "Carol brought an energy and
vibrancy that was just incredible, and she continues to do that with
every role she touches. Audiences trust her. When she gets out there
and starts singing, she leaves you with no doubt; you believe her,
and that's a rare quality."</TE>
<TE>   Broadway shows followed, including "Smokey Joe's Cafe" and the
Tommy Tune-directed "Steppin' Out." Woods appeared in "One Mo' Time,"
"Taking My Turn" and "First Lady Suite" off-Broadway. She starred in
"Blues in the Night" and "Ma Rainey's Black Bottom" at the Royal
National Theatre in London, where she met her second (now former)
husband. For three years, Woods toured as Momma Morton in the
Kander-Ebb musical "Chicago." Last year, in a complete departure, she
portrayed Stella Deems in the Broadway revival of  Stephen Sondheim's
"Follies."</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to be typecast," says Woods, who won over the famed
composer-lyricist with her rendition of "Hey There" from "The Pajama
Game." "You cannot buy a session of six weeks with Stephen Sondheim.
Everything I've done in this business has been 'earn while you
learn,' and God knows, the experience I attained just being in his
presence opened up my scope and taught me so much. What I was just
talking about as a singer, Stephen Sondheim has that as a musician
and a composer and a lyricist--he has lived a life."</TE>
<TE>   Last winter Woods auditioned for the Jeanette Burmeister role,
which had earned the late Kathleen Freeman a Tony nomination for the
part she originated at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   "Carol did a slam-dunk audition. I just fell over, she was so
funny and so dry and so grounded," says "Full Monty" director Jack
O'Brien, speaking from Seattle, where he's overseeing the new musical
"Hairspray." "Carol has paid her own dues as a musician, so she just
got what the character was about. And when we went into rehearsals,
she'd go anywhere, do anything. I told her, 'I think your hair should
be in hot rollers all evening long until the end.' She had a couple
of prescription vials in her purse, and she immediately started to
wind her hair around them. She was just so playful!"</TE>
<TE>   Her "Monty" moments are memorable but relatively few, and for most
of the first act Woods cools her heels backstage. Is she busy getting
into character? "Oh, please, gimme a break!" Woods says, giggling. "I
wouldn't call myself a theater person. I'm an all-around person
because this is a job. I belong to the union. It's a way to make a
living. I enjoy my job, but I have no illusions that it will take me
anywhere except to the bank. And after you take care of that, you get
to the real challenge, which is life."</TE>
<TE>   And while Woods savors her zippy supporting role in "Monty," she
would have no problem taking on bigger parts. "I held myself back
when I was younger because I was afraid I was gonna get swallowed up
[by show business]--and I would have. But I've come to a point in my
life where I know who I am. You don't need a thousand numbers, that's
true, but I could appreciate a couple more songs. I'm ready now. I
know my time is coming."</TE>

<HD>Guitarist Hunter Attracts Appreciative Younger Crowd</HD>

<LD>Guitarist Charlie Hunter's performance at the Knitting Factory on
Friday night was fascinating in two very distinct ways. It was, first
of all, a consistently engaging musical experience. Equally
important, it took place before an enthusiastic crowd of young
listeners.</LD>
<LD>   The contrast between the audience for Hunter's appearance and the
turnout for the Cool and Crazy West Coast Jazz Festival taking place
over the weekend in North Hollywood couldn't have been more striking.
The latter program was attended primarily by fans with a firsthand
recollection of Southland jazz in the '50s. Hunter, on the other
hand, drew a crowd whose parents were probably toddlers when the
music and the players celebrated at the Cool and Crazy event were at
their peak.</LD>
<TE>   Why the age difference in turnout? That's a question that jazz
must deal with on a continuing basis. But one distinct reason traces
to the fact that Hunter--who has a well-earned reputation as a
virtuosic player of the difficult-to-master eight-string guitar--is
as conversant with rock and funk music as he is with straight-ahead
jazz, playing and blending each style with complete musical fluency.
Add to that Hunter's open-minded willingness to position himself
within a wide array of musical settings. He frequently works within a
quartet setting and, on his most recent album, "Songs From the Analog
Playground," included a number of tracks featuring the vocals of
Norah Jones and the rapping of Mos Def.</TE>
<TE>   At the Knitting Factory, however, he showed up with a gritty,
hard-driving quintet featuring saxophonist John Ellis and trombonist
Josh Roseman (frequent Hunter associates), harmonica player Gregoire
Maret and drummer Terreon Gully. Often taking a relatively reserved
role, Hunter featured the unusual textures produced by the three wind
instrumentalists, who occasionally produced even darker-sounding
tones when Ellis switched to bass clarinet and Roseman played with a
plunger mute.</TE>
<TE>   As responsive as the crowded house was to the other musicians,
however, it was Hunter who was clearly their greatest object of
affection. And he rewarded their warm reactions with several
extraordinary solos, driving out bass lines on his two lowest strings
while simultaneously adding chordal clusters and roving melodies on
the top strings. A remarkable feat of dexterity, it was also a
stunning demonstration of how to combine technical virtuosity with
inventive, briskly swinging improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   Given a few more Charlie Hunters, jazz would have no problem at
all in solving the problem of how to bring new, young listeners to
the music.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't ask me about Fox's coming "Bachelorettes in Alaska." As your
"24" guru, however, I serve at your pleasure.</LD>
<LD>   A friend called the morning after Tuesday's finale of our favorite
Fox series, all upset that she somehow forgot to watch. Talk about
irresponsible. When she pleaded for an update, I decided to have some
fun and feed her something ludicrous.</LD>
<LD>   "It turns out that Kim is Sen. Palmer's illegitimate daughter," I
lied.</LD>
<TE>   "OK," she replied, accepting that as plausible in a series whose
exotic plot perversions became legendary in its turbulent first
season.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who did see Tuesday's episode needed my help, and
e-mails immediately poured in asking for guidance. So I took a few
days to study the tape, stroke my chin and carefully weigh its
nuances and implications.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, yes, I'll get to poor Teri shortly. But first the good news:</TE>
<TE>   * Upstanding David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) went almost berserk,
giving seething comeuppance to his scheming witch of a wife, Sherry
(Penny Johnson Jerald), saying he no longer wanted any part of her.
All right!</TE>
<TE>   Not that we've necessarily seen the last of Sherry. I see her
returning next season as an Irish terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   * The Drazens were history, meaning Dennis Hopper's Serbspeak is
no longer available for comic relief.</TE>
<TE>   * Terrorist hussy Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) was affirmed as the
vicious mole inside CTU, and was finally on ice after blowing away
some of her fellow feds and YOU KNOW WHO.</TE>
<TE>   Jack (Kiefer Sutherland) had to be restrained from executing his
former lover on the spot, relenting only after she blurted out that
she worked for someone other than Victor Drazen (Hopper). If so, her
new boss is surely someone much more insidious than Drazen.</TE>
<TE>   I'm betting on Martha Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Now the bad news...</TE>
<TE>   * Jack Bauer's grating daughter, Kim (Elisha Cuthbert), survived.
She was safely in tow at the government's Counter Terrorist Unit
(CTU) after her underwater Houdini trick liberated her from the
Drazen gang. However, she remains ripe for additional abductions next
season.</TE>
<TE>   As the father of a former teenager, I know the turf. But is Kim a
load or what?</TE>
<TE>   Her multiple abductions this season brought to mind a bit from
Woody Allen's old stand-up act about him being kidnapped as a kid. It
goes roughly like this:</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers send Woody's mother and father a ransom note. But
his parents' habitually read only in bed when they turn in for the
evening. So that's when they read the ransom note, inevitably falling
asleep before reaching the end.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally it takes them several nights to get through the note.
When they finally do read it all, they send the kidnappers the
ransom, but with another note: Here's the money, keep the kid.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the big moment: The season ended with Jack devastated,
cradling his bloody wife, Teri (Leslie Hope), in his arms after
finding her shot dead by Nina, who had taken her prisoner. Yet this
series, after all, found a way for Kim to survive after the car she
was sitting in rolled off a mountain and burst into flames.</TE>
<TE>   So the big question: Is Teri really dead?</TE>
<TE>   "Coma! Definitely a coma!"</TE>
<TE>   That comes from my wife, who (at my urging) watched "24" for the
first time Tuesday and concluded that Teri is barely alive and will
resurface next season, rendered comatose by her critical wounds.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesia followed by a coma. I like it. If Teri is unconscious next
season, abducting her will be that much easier.</TE>
<TE>   Because this is an in-depth analysis, I called Stan Rosenfield,
whose Los Angeles public relations firm represents Hope. We were
fraternity brothers in college. So I planned to shoot him the secret
password and beg him to give me the scoop, for old time's sake, on
whether Hope is returning to "24" next season.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosenfield, possibly fearing terrorist reprisals if he spoke
to me, was said to be out of the office.</TE>
<TE>   It's obvious that, unlike much of prime time, "24" is not a series
you can easily put behind you. I'm now getting e-mails noting the
odds against Hope's Teri and Clarke's Nina both returning to the
series because the actresses look too much alike. Others are saying
that Nina went bad after she stopped using a Mac (I didn't pick up on
that).</TE>
<TE>   As for the future, e-mailer Robert Levinson has a droll thought.
With "Ally McBeal" now history, he suggests casting Calista Flockhart
as an ally of Jack's and renaming the series "24-22-24."</TE>
<TE>   Or ... maybe not. If you really want to know how the second season
will begin, gather around once more, my followers. Here is my
prediction:</TE>
<TE>   Jack awakens in a sweat, shaken and still sobbing about the fate
of his beloved Teri, only to realize that the show's entire first
season has been a terrible dream.</TE>
<TE>   "What is it?" asks the woman beside him in bed. When she turns
toward him, we see her face. It's Nina.</TE>
<TE>   Now get out of here, and don't bother the "24" guru again until
this fall.</TE>

<HD>A View From the Trenches on Bill Maher</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>BILL KELLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, it's official: ABC has canceled "Politically Incorrect With
Bill Maher" after five years on the network. Though I'm not
questioning the decision (particularly during hiring season), I'm a
little surprised that the announcement didn't get more attention, at
least compared with the amount given to David Letterman and Ted
Koppel just a few months ago.</LD>
<LD>   As a former writer for the show, I hate to see "Politically
Incorrect" limp away like an aging guard dog spending its last few
days lying on the porch waiting for the end to come. I was there for
five years--from its first show on ABC until I left last summer for
the CBS sitcom "The Ellen Show."</LD>
<LD>   In that time, I think I saw Bill and his show at their best--and
worst. At its start, "Politically Incorrect" was the first new idea
on late night since, well, Letterman. It offered viewers an
alternative. You wouldn't see celebrities pushing their latest
projects on "Politically Incorrect."</LD>
<TE>   Of course, on many nights that was because the celebrities there
didn't have latest projects to push, outside of an appearance at a
convention or at the opening of a muffler shop.</TE>
<TE>   But that was OK. The show wasn't built around landing Hollywood's
elite; if you wanted Jenny McCarthy's take on acting, you'd have to
tune in elsewhere. Instead, the show was--or is--about Bill
assembling a monologue you'd be unlikely to hear elsewhere and
delivering it the manner of his idol, Johnny Carson. Then he'd
introduce his guests to discuss everything from legalizing gay
marriage ("Why should they be denied the right to have to choose
between losing half their stuff or staying in a loveless
relationship?") and a study linking beer and sexually transmitted
diseases ("which, by the way, was the industry's worst advertising
campaign ever.")</TE>
<TE>   On a good night--and there were many of them--it was very funny,
with no one laughing harder at a guest's remark than Bill. On a bad
night, Bill was just strident. Critics like to take shots at Bill,
especially after his remarks following the World Trade Center
bombing. But in many cases, there seemed to be an element of
opportunism to the criticism.</TE>
<TE>   I wasn't there for his comments about the bombing, nor did I see
the show where he made them--which, I guess, puts me in same position
as many who attacked Bill. But I was there for perhaps its precursor,
a relatively minor dustup when Michael Reagan accused Bill of making
fun of his father's illness.</TE>
<TE>   It was not true. Bill did criticize the former president, saying
something to the effect that Ronald Reagan was out of it in his last
years in office. Bill was careful to say he wasn't talking about
Reagan's current condition or making light of Alzheimer's. He was
making an observation that many people had--although not on
late-night television.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Reagan heard of this and was apparently outraged, saying
he was going to ask guests of his radio show to boycott "Politically
Incorrect." A letter of explanation from Bill to a trade magazine
followed; I'm not sure if Reagan was ever back, but somehow the show
survived, leaving the question of who was exploiting the former
president's condition a mystery, I guess.</TE>
<TE>   There was also "the room"--the much-inflated and intentionally
mysterious place where writers on every show meet. Like any comedy
room, it evolved as different writers came and went. Initially, it
contained some of the smartest and funniest people I've ever met; at
other times, it contained people whose greatest skill was a good
memory for the material of others. Most telling was that a joke in
the room at Bill's expense always brought the biggest laugh from Bill
himself--if it was funny.</TE>
<TE>   Some complain that the show lost its sense of humor. I don't know,
although I was always sorry to see the monologue get cut, first from
eight jokes to five, then to three, and now to a series of clips
shown at commercial breaks. If Bill's passion for an issue
occasionally made him lose sight of the humor, I felt it was the
writers' job to make sure we supplied the comedy too. Maybe we failed
at times--and maybe Bill didn't care as much about the jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, when "Politically Incorrect" goes off the air, it will
rob me of one of my standard lines. People who worked on the show
will tell you they are always asked the same question: "What's Bill
really like?" My answer was: "Watch the show for a week: He'll be
smart, funny, rude, obnoxious, gracious, petty and kind."</TE>
<TE>   I was just hoping I could say it for a few more years.</TE>

<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Plays that may last only a few days or weeks at a fringe theater far
from Broadway may find a wider audience if a former lawyer can find a
market for his video version of stage productions.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Cole, the founder of StageDirect, has been a theater fan
since his college days. Now, he's using digital video cameras to
record some of the best that fringe theater has to offer in hopes of
building demand for fresh, edgy plays that otherwise would quickly
vanish.</LD>
<LD>   "There are lots of great actors and directors and writers out
there that you haven't heard about, and you should," Cole said.</LD>
<TE>   Cole, 42, had been involved in small theater productions in Oregon
for the past seven years, while working in law. He co-founded CoHo
Theatre Productions, the parent to his StageDirect video company. He
teamed up with Jeff Meyers, medical researcher turned artistic
director, to scout for risky, provocative plays that otherwise might
find only a tiny audience before disappearing.</TE>
<TE>   Since the two began looking in the fall of 2001, StageDirect has
produced and released four videos: "The Haint," a one-man show;
"Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious"; "Mass Murder"; and
"Poona the F-dog," a production by Portland's Theatre Vertigo, which
Meyers co-founded. The latest video is "Straight," a critically
acclaimed play that opened last month at Cole's CoHo Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The shows are filmed with multiple cameras over a series of
performances, and then edited to re-create the intimate feel of live
theater on a small stage. So far, the videos or DVDs are being
distributed on the Internet or on pay-per-view channels at hotels
where Cole has negotiated contracts.</TE>
<TE>   But he hopes to build enough interest to persuade chains such as
Hollywood Video or Blockbuster to carry them, and eventually to move
into cable TV.</TE>
<TE>   "It may not be for everybody, and some of it may be too edgy, but
I think TV is starved for content," Cole said.</TE>

<HD>'High Button Shoes' Still Provides Delight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1947, Broadway was taken by surprise when a show with little
advance heat developed into the season's big hit musical.</LD>
<LD>   A retro comedy set in 1913, "High Button Shoes" had the heart of a
vaudeville routine and the fleetness of a Keystone Kops movie. It
tickled audiences to no end.</LD>
<LD>   Time and changing tastes can be cruel, though, and today the show
is all but forgotten. The only encounter that present-day
theatergoers are likely to have had with it is through "Jerome
Robbins' Broadway," which revived a Mack Sennett-style routine that
Robbins choreographed for the show.</LD>
<TE>   Happily, the Rubicon Theatre Company in Ventura decided it was
time we saw more of "High Button Shoes." Through Sunday, it is
presenting a semi-staged concert version that sets toes tapping and
sides splitting with laughter.</TE>
<TE>   Of the original creators, only director George Abbott was well
established on Broadway before the show opened. The production's
success helped root the reputations of the rest of the team. Robbins
won his first Tony Award, and composer Jule Styne, working here with
Sammy Cahn, ended up swapping a career in film for one in theater.</TE>
<TE>   The Rubicon presentation is directed by Bonnie Hellman and
choreographed in period style by Cindy Robinson. Jason Graae and
Susan Egan head the cast.</TE>
<TE>   Because this concert staging received very limited rehearsal (just
23 hours), the actors carry scripts and wear off-the-rack costumes.
The band is limited to two piano players and a percussionist. Yet the
material comes roaring back to life. Graae's penchant for old-style
comic excess is perfect for a role created by Phil Silvers. Playing a
con man so notorious that he needs to return to his small hometown to
lie low for a while, Graae pitches his broad, vaudeville-style laugh
lines with abrupt change-ups in speed and attitude. A one-man Sennett
comedy, he's hysterical whether he's faking his way through a Russian
dance or running, limbs at right angles, from the police.</TE>
<TE>   Egan layers a 21st century knowingness onto her
pure-as-the-driven-snow ingenue, to humorous effect. And as a
wholesome couple taken in by the con man's schemes, Cynthia Ferrer
and Doug Carfrae sing and dance winsomely through two of the score's
best-remembered songs, the ragtime polka "Papa, Won't You Dance With
Me?" and the soft-shoe "I Still Get Jealous."</TE>
<TE>   Originally about 13 minutes long, the Sennett-style
chase--involving bathing beauties, bumbling cops, con men and a bag
of cash--is abbreviated to highlights narrated by character dancer
and choreographer Robinson, who steps into each sequence to
illustrate what she's describing.</TE>

<HD>Clowning Around in the Warhol Spirit</HD>
<DH>Art* An assemblage of clowns, saying they are celebrating
the artist, descends on MOCA.</DH>

<LD>This was definitely not one of the downtown Museum of Contemporary
Art's carefully scripted performances. At 6:15 p.m. Saturday, the
opening day of the Andy Warhol retrospective at the museum, a
benign-looking tour bus with tinted windows pulled to the curb, and a
pile of crazy clowns poured out.</LD>
<LD>   There was Andy himself, with his unkempt, trademark hair in
fluorescent green, a neon pink face and sickly green dots floating
across his countenance like Warhol's hibiscus flowers. Look, an evil
Pippi Longstocking, and there, Marilyn Monroe with a short, sassy
skirt, red, white and blue bloomers and red go-go boots.</LD>
<LD>   Then came cars, pulling up for valet parking, a black BMW, and a
silver Dodge Avenger, with more and more clowns, tumbling out like a
circus illusion. The museum workers rushed to the sidewalk,
walkie-talkies in hand.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't even know this was happening," said Lana Shmulevich, a
museum employee in a MOCA vest who sighted the pranksters first. "I
don't even think the museum knew about it. They probably would have
done something about it."</TE>
<TE>   But the clowns had tickets. So the raucous pranksters and mad
hatters flounced through the entrance behind the neon Andy, a team of
men in suits and walkie-talkies in tow.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you interested in the audio tour?" the deskman chirped out
like a tape-recorder, as the band of clowns swung into the gallery.
They weren't. The security guards swarmed, the clowns fanned out
among the neon Marilyns, Elvises, Jackies and Maos. An S&amp;M clown in a
leather G-string, motorcycle boots and riding whip admired Warhol's
"Do It Yourself (Sailboats)." Earnest museum-goers interrupted their
art appreciation to stare at the spectacle. Some were solemn. Some
confused. Some giggled, quietly, museum-appropriately, at the
delicious outrageousness of it. Some even removed their audio
headsets, as if in a trance. Was this part of the exhibit? Or no?
Would someone please explain?</TE>
<TE>   A child looked frightened. A clown with a pointed neon bra flashed
her coils for some curious spectators. They were operated by a button
under her arm, she explained, batting her false pink eyelashes.</TE>
<TE>   Unannounced, unexpected, and very, very un-MOCA, the clowns
gathered from Los Angeles and San Francisco to celebrate what they
called the true spirit of Andy Warhol. "It's a prank for the Warhol
opening, in the Warhol flavor of getting your 15 minutes of fame," a
member of the Porn Clown Posse (PCP) and a Silicon Valley executive
who identified herself only as iCandy, explained in a mysterious
phone call before her pilgrimage to Los Angeles. "We will dress like
clowns, act like Factory types, strike a pose. It's in a Warholian
vein. If they don't like it they are hypocrites."</TE>
<TE>   The group consisted of a handful of San Franciscans and more than
20 locals, most of whom are actors, actresses, performance artists
and photographers, when they aren't posing as Factory workers.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the clowns had even been hired as performance artists for
the Hollywood-like premiere for the Warhol retrospective at MOCA last
Wednesday, when imitation Warhols in white Warhol wigs served drinks
at the bar, and an imitation Candy Darling wriggled on a platform.
"We were hired to be ambience," said Kari French, of the flashing
neon bra, who dressed as Silvergirl at the premiere. "It was great to
get sloshed and hang with celebrities, but this, tonight, we are
making a statement."</TE>

<HD>'Infinite Ache' Takes a Sardonic Look at Love</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SAN DIEGO--He's needy and nerdy. She's brainy and picky. Their first
date is a dud.</LD>
<LD>   But through an extended dream sequence, we see what their next
five decades would be like if they wooed and wed and suffered
together all those common dilemmas of money, sex, dual careers,
children, family, separation and death.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the easy-access premise of "An Infinite Ache," which
opened Saturday at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage at the Old Globe
Theatres complex.</LD>
<TE>   Written by David Schulner and directed by Brendon Fox, "Ache"
takes place at a rapid-fire pace in the bedroom that is his, then
theirs, then hers, then theirs again--think of a crossbreed between a
Neil Simon apartment-comedy and a harder-edged David Mamet drama.</TE>
<TE>   The lines alternately crackle ("I'm lost without you," says
Charles. "Then you need a map, not a relationship," snaps Hope) and
drag (the explications of "what is love?" get longer and less
engaging).</TE>
<TE>   As Charles, James Waterston has a kind of everyman,
educated-oafishness appeal. His early attempts at seduction fall
flat. "I keep telling myself to be mysterious and aloof, but every
time I look at you, I turn into me," he whines to Hope.</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Quan as Hope is sexy and chipper and far more conflicted
and interesting than Charles. Late in the play, her emotional turmoil
is signified by an interest in the dark queen of pop-lit Joyce Carol
Oates.</TE>
<TE>   Charles sets out as a would-be historian and settles for a job in
a bank. He tells Hope he moved to Los Angeles because "it's as far as
you can go from every other disappointing place."</TE>
<TE>   When Charles and Hope are standing, they can get tedious. "Love
has fully evolved," says Charles. "It has to die like the dinosaurs,
so it can be reinvented."</TE>
<TE>   But when they're horizontal, things are spicier, both physically
and verbally.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you happy?" she asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Define happy," he responds.</TE>
<TE>   And later: "Do you still love me?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   "In what way?" she responds.</TE>
<TE>   The comedy and the pain of "Ache" comes from its commonality.
There is little here that is not part of the basic long-term marriage
package.</TE>
<TE>   Which explains why the biggest laugh line of the night may be when
Hope, exasperated by a rebellious, mouthy college-age daughter (never
seen), suggests: "Let's move and not tell her."</TE>
<TE>   "An Infinite Ache"--the line is from a Pablo Neruda poem--is
fast--90 minutes--and familiar. If what you want is confirmation, not
challenge, then "Ache" will feel good.</TE>
<TE>   As Hope explains, "Love just means you're worth all your
problems."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "An Infinite Ache," at the Cassius Carter Centre Stage at the Old
Globe Theatres complex in Balboa Park, runs through June 30.
Tuesday-Saturday 8 p.m., Sunday 7 p.m., Saturday and Sunday, 2 p.m.
Tickets: $35-$45. (619) 239-2255.</TE>

<HD>A Welcome New Ending</HD>
<DH>Luciano Berio's intriguing new finale and Kent Nagano's
sure hand bring 'Turandot' to exciting life at L.A. Opera.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Puccini's best opera has just gotten better. Saturday night, Los
Angeles Opera became the first company to produce "Turandot," which
was left incomplete at the composer's death, with a new ending by
Luciano Berio. Whether the justly maligned banal ending that
Toscanini commissioned from Franco Alfano will be retired remains to
be seen. But from now on, anyone wanting to mount "Turandot" has a
choice.</LD>
<LD>   It almost seems as though Berio, Italy's greatest composer since
Puccini, was born to compose the final duet with which Puccini
struggled unsuccessfully for two years. After writing some of his
most moving music to underscore the death of the slave girl, Liu,
Puccini could not then find a way to melt a barbaric, icy princess'
heart in a final love duet with her suitor, Calaf. When the
65-year-old chain-smoking composer died of throat cancer in 1924, he
left behind barely legible sketches for that transformation.</LD>
<LD>   The "Turandot" premiere is famous opera lore. After the last music
Puccini wrote, Toscanini laid down his baton. "Here the Maestro put
down his pen," the conductor announced to the audience (or something
like that; reports vary) and rushed off stage, tears rolling down his
face. But that was also a bit of theatrical hokum. Toscanini already
had the Alfano duet in his pocket. He used it at the second
performance of the opera, and it has been standard since.</LD>
<TE>   At the time of that premiere, Berio, born to a musical family on
the Ligurian coast, was a 6-month-old toddler. Avant-gardist that he
has been, Berio did not exactly follow in Puccini's footsteps, but he
is, nonetheless, uniquely qualified to provide the "Turandot" duet.
Berio's layered music is often concerned with the past, with how we
must hear old music in context of the new, and how we inevitably hear
new music with ears conditioned by our knowledge of history.</TE>
<TE>   That preoccupation with context pervades the 16 minutes of music
Berio has provided for "Turandot." Berio is far more faithful to
Puccini's sketches than was Alfano. Yet Berio cannot but hear these
disembodied, far-from-final thoughts of Puccini without trying to
imagine all the other music that was floating around in Puccini's
head at the time, especially Wagner, late Mahler and early
Schoenberg.</TE>
<TE>   Berio also acknowledges that Puccini wrote himself into a dramatic
corner from which there is no solution. Alfano settled for a loud,
happy ending, recycling what he could from the earlier parts of the
score. Berio fades out in mysterious angst that may not make all
singers or audiences happy but that acknowledges the sophistication
of Puccini's score and of modern dramatic needs..</TE>
<TE>   Berio's new ending was first heard in a concert performance of
"Turandot" given by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under Riccardo
Chailly in January. Listening to a recording of that performance, I
initially had my doubts about Berio's tactics. It sounded too much
like Wagner and Mahler and too little like either Puccini or Berio.
But Saturday night, Kent Nagano made it work splendidly in the
theater. In his second outing as Los Angeles Opera's principal
conductor, Nagano rethought "Turandot" from the ground up in an
illuminating performance that had Puccini's orchestral score sounding
startlingly fresh, as if preparing the way for Berio.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh, firm voices were of further benefit to Puccini and Berio.
The most affecting singer of the evening is Hei-Kyung Hong, a lovely
Liu and also an unusually vital one. Audrey Stottler brought
stunning, firm power to Turandot. Franco Farina was a truly heroic
Calaf, his seeming inclination for excess held back by Nagano.
Alfredo Daza, Greg Fedderly and Bruce Sledge--the ministers, Ping,
Pang and Pong--were full of bright character. Rosendo Flores was the
capable Timur, the old blind king and Calaf's father. Joseph Frank as
the Emperor, was amplified to poor effect.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the new production by Gian-Carlo del Monaco is a
mess. He made interesting use of the chorus, moving it as a sea of
fluid bodies, but the director did little with the principal
characters. Stottler is a large woman, and her exaggerated
silent-film gestures did not become her. The absurd staging of the
final duet had Turandot suicidally waving a knife.</TE>
<TE>   The gold and lacquer sets by Michael Scott were also a problem.
Though not unattractive (except for the kitschy use of Buddhas in
this Taoist drama), pillars and a too-high staircase obscured the
view for many in the audience. Halfway through her descent down the
stars, Turandot was applauded. That was the moment she came into
sight for some in the balconies.</TE>
<TE>   Hard, cold, high-contrast lighting hurt the drama as well. Nothing
was easy to see. Calaf sings his most famous aria, "Nessun dorma!,"
completely in the dark until the end. It is worth remaining for the
curtain calls to appreciate how elaborate are the costumes and
striking the masks.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, this is an important occasion for Los Angeles Opera and
the opera world, in general. Alfano-ized, "Turandot" has sometimes
been called the end of the line for Italian opera. Berio's new ending
shows it as a new beginning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Turandot" repeats with the original cast Thursday, June 4, 6, 9,
14 at 7:30 p.m., June 1 and 16 at 2 p.m., and with Nina Warren
(Turandot), Ian DeNolfo (Calaf) and Svetla Vassileva (Liu) on June 7
and 11 at 7:30 p.m., $30-$165, Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, 135 N.
Grand Ave. (213) 365-3500.</TE>

<LD>With the holiday weekend winding down, the Discovery Channel delivers
a jolting three-hour block of programming tonight likely to leave you
a little woozy in the head and even a bit queasy in the stomach.</LD>
<LD>   No, it's not a Tom Green film festival, but back-to-back-to-back
specials on one of America's favorite mindless pleasures: the
amusement park roller coaster. Like the attractions themselves, the
programs have their ups and downs, but coaster fans will get a kick
out of the camera work, armchair travelers will enjoy the scenery,
and everyone will pick up some interesting factoids along the way.</LD>
<LD>   "Top 10 Coasters 2002" gets things rolling at 8 p.m., followed by
"Extreme Rides 2002" at 9, with "Ultimate Guide: Roller Coasters"
bringing up the rear starting at 10.</LD>
<TE>   "Top 10" may be of most interest to the casual rider. The program
takes viewers on an enjoyable coast-to-coast tour of the creme de la
creme of the white-knuckle world, with the rankings--actually a top 5
of wooden coasters and a top 5 of the metal monsters--derived from an
online survey conducted by Discovery Channel during the past year.</TE>
<TE>   I won't reveal the ultimate champions, but a pair of local
attractions, Knott's Berry Farm's GhostRider and Six Flags Magic
Mountain's Goliath, are among contenders.</TE>
<TE>   The you-are-there filming technique is a blessing and a curse. The
visuals are spectacular, but the incessant screaming, along with the
strangled attempts at narration from the rider/host, get old fast.</TE>
<TE>   Six Flags' latest thrill ride, known simply as X, is among four of
the cutting-edge coasters profiled in the "Extreme Rides" program
that follows. The final show, "Ultimate Guide," examines why people
tend to either love coasters or hate them, and also looks at the
safety measures that allow you to live to ride again.</TE>

<HD>'Founding Brothers' Tells Tale of the Founders, Warts and
All</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Founding Brothers," the two-part History Channel documentary that
begins tonight, presents the "clashes and collaborations" of the big
six of the American Revolution: John Adams, Ben Franklin, Alexander
Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and, the superstar of them
all, George Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "In 1776 they stood together against the British," we are told by
way of introduction. "Twenty years later America's founding brothers
were standing against each other in an ideological struggle for the
hearts and minds of America."</LD>
<LD>   They fussed, they feuded, they backstabbed, they leaked, they
skirt-chased, they mixed high principle and low tactics. They were
the original American politicians. And along the way they created the
most marvelous, confounding, contradictory, enduring government the
world has ever seen.</LD>
<TE>   Yes, but can their stirring story be made interesting in an age
that needs visuals and sound bites? Hollywood has flubbed several
times. Maybe it's the wigs and prissy clothing and oracular way of
speaking that is so off-putting.</TE>
<TE>   Judged on a curve against other efforts, "Founding Brothers"--the
title comes from historian Joseph Ellis' Pulitzer Prize-winning
book--is a success.</TE>
<TE>   Moments of great historic drama and conflict are brought alive
with narration by Edward Herrmann, guest shots by intellectuals, a
good mix of period artwork and dramatic re-creations, and celebrity
voices for the writings of the six.</TE>
<TE>   But be prepared: There are snooze-ifying stretches. The debate
over whether the government should pay the Revolutionary War debts of
the states was key to all that followed, but as television it's heavy
sledding.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are moments that should be required viewing for all
of us. Of those, the most compelling is the segment on the early
debate over slavery.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin was deeply ashamed of having owned slaves and his final
act was a rousing campaign against slavery.</TE>
<TE>   But when he died, the others found it politically inexpedient to
risk the fragile union between north and south.</TE>
<TE>   "America's leadership had chosen to stay silent on the great moral
and political dilemma of U.S. history," Herrmann says. Wood-carvings
showing the casual and endemic brutality of slavery drive the point
home with great impact.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stories mix the personal and the political. Washington
donned the airs of aristocracy, but Jefferson answered the door in
slippers and a robe.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton was caught in the nation's first high-profile sex
scandal, tricked by a woman with low morals and a high talent for
extortion. Madison and Jefferson heard about it and leaked the story
to newspaper muckraker James T. Callendar.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton responded with a mea-culpa pamphlet expressing "disgust
and self-condemnation." These days he would have given an interview
to Barbara Walters.</TE>
<TE>   Jefferson was a man of great vision and compassion, but he was
also a gutter-fighter and smear artist and once wrote a phony
letter-to-the-editor praising himself while president.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the early 1790s, character assassination had become a
common tactic in American politics," "Founding Brothers" tells us.
"No one used those tactics to greater effect than Thomas Jefferson."</TE>
<TE>   See, and you thought it all started with Nixon and Gary Hart.</TE>

Channel, 9-11 p.m. Part two is Tuesday, same channel, same time.</TE>

<HD>Polanski's 'Pianist' Wins Palme d'Or</HD>
<DH>In an adventurous field at Cannes, Paul Thomas Anderson and
Im Kwon-Taek share the best director prize, and Michael Moore is
given a special award.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CANNES, France--There's just no figuring the Festival de Cannes.</LD>
<LD>   Headed by the norm-breaking David Lynch and faced with a
competition slate that was nothing if not adventurous, the jury at
the 55th festival gave its top prize, the Palme d'Or, to perhaps the
most conventional film on the docket, Roman Polanski's "The Pianist."</LD>
<LD>   Based on the true story of Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw
Szpilman, "Pianist" stars Adrien Brody as the musician whose good
luck and grit enabled him to survive years in hiding in anarchic
Warsaw during World War II. Though its Holocaust horrors are
familiar, "Pianist" improves as it progresses, and being able to tell
a story with echoes of his own clearly moved the somber director, who
told an excited crowd at Sunday's ceremony that he was "honored and
proud" to receive this award for a film that depicted his native
Poland.</LD>
<TE>   "I always knew that one day I would make a film about this painful
chapter in Polish history, but I didn't want it to be
autobiographical," Polanski wrote in a director's statement. "I
survived the Krakow ghetto and the bombing of Warsaw, and I wanted to
re-create my memories from childhood."</TE>
<TE>   Two American films took home major awards. Paul Thomas Anderson,
whose "Punch-Drunk Love" starring Adam Sandler and Emily Watson
charmed French critics as well as festival audiences, shared the best
director prize with veteran Korean filmmaker Im Kwon-Taek, whose
"Chihwaseon" told the story of a celebrated 19th century Korean
painter.</TE>
<TE>   An elated Anderson told the crowd at the Palais du Festival, "If
you're a young boy growing up loving movies, you always want the
French to love your movies. So thank you very much."</TE>
<TE>   Winning a specially created and unanimously given "55th
Anniversary Prize" was Michael Moore for his provocative documentary
examination of violence in America, "Bowling for Columbine." Looking
not very happy to be in a tuxedo, Moore first noted that President
Bush has just arrived in France and wondered if the festival could
set up a special screening for him. Then, admitting "I forgot most of
my French from high school," Moore launched into an extended thank
you in that language that displayed more fearlessness and nerve than
correct pronunciation and was much commented on by succeeding award
winners.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Laverty, for instance, who won the screenplay prize for Ken
Loach's gritty and immediate "Sweet Sixteen," started with a few
words in French and added, "I'm really glad my French teacher's dead;
this would have finished him off if Michael Moore hadn't finished him
off first."</TE>
<TE>   "Sweet Sixteen" is one of Loach's strongest, most affecting works,
starring a debuting Martin Compston as Liam, determined to find a
place to live for his mother when she's released from prison in time
for his 16th birthday. But though Liam is enormously likable and
clearly capable and ambitious, in a world that lacks both opportunity
and moral anchors, the only avenue he can see open for him is selling
drugs. Equally unreserved was unpredictable Finnish director Aki
Kaurismaki, whose "The Man Without a Past" was the only film to
receive two prizes, the Grand Prix, considered to be the runner-up
award, and the best actress prize for his veteran actress Kati
Outinen. Having done a poker-faced soft shoe up the steps of the
Palais, Kaurismaki ambled up to the podium from his seat like a
grouchy Finnish bear and said, as the rhythmic applause died down,
"First of all, I would thank myself. Second, the jury."</TE>
<TE>   Kaurismaki's film, a riff on traditional 1940s melodramas about an
amnesiac trying to find a new life, is a fine example of both the
director's deadpan humor, familiar to film festival audiences in
films such as "Leningrad Cowboys Go America" and "Drifting Clouds,"
and the amusing I-Walked-With-a-Zombie acting style he prefers.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the jury prize as well as the International Critics Prize
was the Palestinian film "Divine Intervention." Written and directed
by and starring Elia Suleiman and subtitled "A Chronicle of Love and
Pain," the film brings an angry poet's surreal and absurdist touch to
the impossible Middle East situation, the equivalent of Jacque Tati
of "Playtime" joining up with the Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Taking the best actor prize was Olivier Gourmet for "The Son,"
another neo-documentary work by Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne ("The
Promise"), whose "Rosetta" won the Palme d'Or in 1999. Shot in an
intense, almost claustrophobic style (Gourmet thanked the brothers
for doing such a good job photographing his ears and the back of his
neck), this unapologetically demanding film stars the actor as a
taciturn woodworking teacher who turns out to have a terrible secret
connection with one of his new students.</TE>
<TE>   Though its turgid dramatury probably kept it from winning
anything, "Russian Ark" is a visual astonishment. It consists of a
single, uncut steadycam shot lasting 87 minutes that sinuously swoops
through dozens of spaces in St. Petersburg's Hermitage Museum.
Directed by Alexander Sokurov, who says he got the idea because "I'm
sick of editing" and shot by Tilman Buttner, the steadycam operator
on "Run, Lola, Run," "Russian Ark" utilized 867 actors, hundreds of
extras, years of planning and seven months of rehearsal time, all
pointing to a one-take, all-or-nothing shooting day. The film's
dramatic meditation on Russian history is murky and uninvolving, but
given the technical challenges met, it is hard to get overly upset.</TE>
<TE>   Though it also did not win anything, a reluctant word should be
said about Gaspar Noe's "Irreversible," the officially designated
shock item--complete with a warning that "This film may contain
scenes that could disturb some of the spectators" printed on
admission tickets in English as well as French--which no Cannes can
be without. Actually, that warning is rather feeble, given the
meretricious nature of this unrelenting piece of business which stars
Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel and has as its centerpiece a
horrific nine-minute rape scene that demeans and humiliates
spectators and filmmakers alike. "Irreversible" has taken "time
destroys everything" as its motto, and it's nice to know this film
will not be exempted.</TE>
<TE>   As has become something of a tradition at Cannes (think "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon" two years ago), some of the most involving and
entertaining films in the festival are official selections presented,
for reasons difficult to fathom, out of competition. This was the
case with the vivid, engrossing "City of God," a Brazilian film
directed by Fernando Meirelles, one of that country's top commercials
directors, who put his visual dazzle at the service of an epic saga
of social realism set over three decades in one of the ultraviolent
favelas or slums of Rio de Janiero.</TE>
<TE>   A hot-wired marriage of authenticity and style, replete with young
characters with names like the Tender Trio, the Runts and Knockout
Ned, "City of God" is both chilling and exhilarating. Meirelles and
co-director Katia Lund did workshops for months with more than 100
kids to mold performances from their nonprofessional cast. The result
was an immediacy, a sense of place and of danger that few films at
the festival matched.</TE>
<TE>   Equally entertaining, and the complete opposite of realistic, was
the irresistible "Devdas" from India, the first singing-and-dancing
Bollywood-style film ever invited to Cannes and the most expensive
one ever produced. Starring former Miss World Aishwarya Rai and taken
from a 1917 novel that's reportedly been filmed nine times in four
Indian languages, "Devdas" is a soap opera story of true love
thwarted by indecision, scheming women and family pride. With its
opulent production design, gorgeous costumes and elaborate
choreography, this is the kind of spectacular fairy tale musical no
one else is making anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Of the English-language films at Cannes, two of the most involving
were a pair of British films, "Tomorrow La Scala!," in the Un Certain
Regard section, and "Morvern Callar" in the Director's Fortnight
(another Fortnight film, France's "Bord de Mer," won the Camera d'Or
with special mention for the Mexican film "Japon").</TE>
<TE>   The first dramatic film by documentarian Francesa Joseph (who
wrote it as well), "La Scala!" shows what happens when the ambitious
director of an opera troupe (hence the title) mounts a production of
Stephen Sondheim's "Sweeney Todd" in a maximum security prison and
uses lifers in the chorus. Though what transpires is predictable in
broad outline, the film's cheeky verve and tangible edge of dark
reality make it a most pleasant surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "Morvern Callar," the second film by Lynne Ramsay, is a strong
follow-up to her widely admired "Ratcatcher." It stars Samantha
Morton as the 21-year-old title character who has to put her life
back together when her boyfriend commits suicide in their apartment
at the height of the Christmas season. Like "Ratcatcher," "Morvern"
displays Ramsay's ability to use the power of images to take her
characters on emotional and psychological journeys. "Morvern Callar"
did well at Cannes, winning both the Prix CICAE, given to the best
film in the Fortnight, and the Prix de la Jeunesse, voted on by a
group of young French cinephiles, but it's likely the director will
remember this festival for something else entirely.</TE>
<TE>   According to Daily Variety, Ramsay "got hitched at an impromptu
ceremony on an old yacht" that sailed 12 miles into international
waters to give the captain the proper authority. "It was emotional
and surreal," Jim Wilson, the deputy head of production at FilmFour,
who gave the bride away, told Variety. "It was the best production I
saw in Cannes--apart from our own films, of course."</TE>

<HD>A Decade of Good Hair Days for VO5 Maker Alberto-Culver</HD>
<DH>Personal care: Sticking to the tried-and-true, the firm
stays independent and profitable--but perhaps undervalued.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's notable that Alberto-Culver Co., a mid-size player in the
cutthroat consumer products field, is still independent while many of
its rivals have been merged out of existence. More notable is that
Alberto-Culver not only survives, it prospers.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto-Culver has quietly delivered 10 straight years of higher
sales and profit, after excluding one-time gains, and expects to make
it 11 this year. By sticking to its stalwart VO5 hair dressings, St.
Ives lotions and Sally Beauty Supply stores, the company also has
been the perfect defensive play for investors during the recession.</LD>
<LD>   Alberto-Culver's two classes of stock have more than doubled in
price over the last two years while the broader market, as measured
by the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, has tumbled 23%. Yet the shares
"still strike us as a good value," analyst William Steele of Banc of
America Securities said in a recent report.</LD>
<TE>   Though not as big or splashy as Revlon Inc. or Procter &amp; Gamble
Co., Alberto-Culver remains a household name to many, thanks to its
steady TV advertising over the last four decades. Besides producing a
variety of affordably priced V05 and St. Ives products,
Alberto-Culver today also makes TRESemme and Consort shampoos, FDS
deodorant, Static Guard spray, Sugar Twin artificial sweetener and
Molly McButter butter-flavored sprinkles.</TE>
<TE>   The company, based in the Chicago suburb of Melrose Park, also is
now the world's second-largest producer of hair-care products for
African Americans (behind cosmetics giant L'Oreal) after buying
Pro-Line Corp. two years ago. Its brands in that market include TCB,
Soft &amp; Beautiful and Motions.</TE>
<TE>   But Alberto-Culver--with sales of $2.5 billion in its fiscal year
ended Sept. 30 and profit of $110 million--these days is more
retailer than manufacturer. Nearly 60% of its sales and 70% of its
profit come from its Sally Beauty Co. division, "the world's largest
distributor of professional salon products," which has nearly 2,500
stores, Alberto-Culver Chief Executive Howard Bernick told an
investors conference this month.</TE>
<TE>   The stores (including more than 180 in California) mainly sell
other suppliers' goods, are open to the public and have nearly 3
million visitors a week. The division also includes the Beauty
Systems Group, which sells exclusively licensed hair-care goods such
as Paul Mitchell and Redken to professionals through 417 stores and a
900-person sales force. Alberto-Culver "has been growing that [group]
very aggressively," said Sally Wallick, a retail analyst with Legg
Mason Wood Walker Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The stores help Alberto-Culver maintain its growth and avoid
having to rely solely on its personal-care products in the face of
brutal competition from behemoths such as P&amp;G (Head &amp; Shoulders) and
Unilever (Suave, Finesse). Indeed, it's a key reason Alberto-Culver
has avoided the fate of other mid-size players in hair care such as
Helene Curtis Industries, which was acquired by Unilever in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto-Culver cannot battle the enormous marketing clout of those
giants, so it focuses instead on niche sellers in hair- and skin-care
products while expanding Sally Beauty, analysts have observed. Sally
Beauty faces its own competition from mass merchandisers and grocery
chains. But much of the salon supply industry comprises mom-and-pop
outfits, and Alberto-Culver has steadily been buying those small
firms to expand its market leadership.</TE>
<TE>   In its fiscal second quarter ended March 31, Sally Beauty's
same-store sales--those of stores open at least a year, a key gauge
of retail growth--rose a stout 6% from those a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The stores give the company a balance to its consumer products and
thrive regardless of economic cycles or the seasons, Bernick said.
Sally also provides a competitive edge: It tips off Alberto-Culver to
consumers' changing tastes so the company can adjust its own brands.
For example, Sally Beauty noticed growing demand for hot-oil hair
treatments, which led to a hot-oil version of VO5, Bernick said.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto-Culver concentrates on extending its tried-and-true lines
instead of spending a fortune on new brands. The company also keeps a
close eye on costs--it has no choice, because its industry's profit
margins are so slim--and it makes periodic acquisitions to bolster
its market segments.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: In 1996 it paid $120 million for St. Ives
Laboratories, a Chatsworth-based maker of shampoos, lotions and other
skin-care products marketed with the Swiss Formula label. Alberto-
Culver kept St. Ives' plant and manufactures St. Ives, VO5 and other
products at the site.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto-Culver traces its roots to a Los Angeles beauty supply
firm that was bought in 1955 by Leonard and Bernice Lavin, who moved
the company to Chicago and focused on the VO5 line. According to
company lore, the Lavins bought the company from a man named Blain
Culver, whose chemist was named Alberto--so the Lavins combined the
names. (The VO5 label supposedly once stood for its "five vital
oils," and one can find multiple other uses for the product, even
fixing squeaky door hinges, on some Web sites.)</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Lavin, 82, still is chairman. The Lavins' son-in-law
Bernick, 50, is president and CEO, and his wife, Carol Bernick, runs
Alberto-Culver North America. Together the four own about 9% of
Alberto-Culver's Class A stock and more than 40% of its Class B
shares, which have superior voting rights to the Class A stock.</TE>
<TE>   The family's big stake is another reason Alberto-Culver remains
independent. But analysts say that's also why Alberto-Culver's stocks
don't command price-to-earnings multiples as high as those of its
rivals. The Class B stock--which closed Friday at $54.16 a share,
down 43 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange--now trades for 21
times the $2.55 a share that Banc of America's Steele expects the
company to earn in fiscal 2003.</TE>
<TE>   The Class A shares were issued in the 1980s mainly to give the
company another currency for making acquisitions without diluting the
family's voting power. But the two classes turn off some investors
because they don't know which is a better buy, analysts said. The
Class A tend to cost less, but the Class B have the better voting
rights and trade more often.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street too seems divided on Alberto-Culver, which could be
damping its price gains. Legg Mason's Wallick questioned whether
Sally Beauty is getting its full due.</TE>
<TE>   "It very well may be that those people covering the company, most
of whom are consumer products analysts, don't realize that retailers
like this don't come along every day," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Alberto-Culver plans to keep expanding Sally Beauty, especially
its role in supplying salons, by continuing to acquire small
operators in the fragmented industry.</TE>
<TE>   Bernick seeks another skin-care brand to complement St. Ives but
said that "we're not going to buy for the sake of buying"--the
company stumbled in the 1970s and '80s by trying also to sell
handbags and other unrelated goods.</TE>

<HD>Easton Bats Are Big Hits</HD>
<DH>Popularity of expensive alloy equipment is boosting profit
at firm</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a Los Alamitos ball field on a recent Tuesday, fifth-grade pitcher
Nathan Berger of the Mariners reached back and fired a fastball for a
strike to batter AJ Crook of the Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   But armed with an Easton Triple7 alloy bat, AJ won the battle
between the St. Hedwig Pony League players by smacking a hard ground
ball to the shortstop, scoring the runner on third.</LD>
<LD>   AJ and thousands of other youth baseball and softball players are
using similar bats to make a winner out of Easton Sports Inc. of Van
Nuys, which makes about one of every two baseball bats sold in
America.</LD>
<TE>   AJ's Triple 7 bat isn't anything like the $12 wooden bat his
father used a generation earlier. It's lighter, weighing barely 20
ounces, and has a wider barrel, creating a bigger hitting surface. AJ
can whip the 29-inch bat at a faster speed and hit the ball harder
than he would with a wooden bat, or even an earlier aluminum model.</TE>
<TE>   But here's the number Easton really likes. The Triple 7 lists for
$150 at batting cages and specialty retailers such as Sport Chalet
Inc. stores and represents one of the few bright spots for a baseball
equipment business that's suffering from a dearth of players.</TE>
<TE>   Easton has built on the metallurgy skills first developed by a
sister company that makes aluminum archery arrows to become the
nation's leading maker of high-profit, premium bats.</TE>
<TE>   The privately held company, along with the No. 2 player in the bat
business, Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., owner of the Louisville Slugger
brand, is responsible for much of the growth in the baseball
equipment business in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale shipments by U.S. manufacturers of baseball and softball
equipment grew 26% to $440 million from 1995 to 2000, the latest year
reported by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Assn. Bat sales
accounted for the majority of that gain. By 2000, the bat business
accounted for 37% of all baseball equipment sales, up from 25% five
years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   During this period, the cost of a premium bat doubled and in some
cases tripled to $150 to $250--the price of the bats AJ and his
teammates use. His mother, Janet Crook, said she cringed before
paying $150 for a bat for a youngster. But she noticed AJ's hitting
improved after he borrowed a similar bat from a friend last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, she said, it's not unusual to see $1,000 worth of bats
dangling from the dugout racks on the St. Hedwig Catholic School ball
field where the Yankees, Mariners and other youth teams from the area
play.</TE>
<TE>   Although bat sales have increased, the number of players has
declined at both the youth level and at recreational adult softball
leagues.</TE>
<TE>   The 435 players taking the field twice a week at St. Hedwig are
the diamond die-hards of youth sports, those who have not forsaken
the national sport for that import--soccer--or a whole range of more
sedentary activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Sporting goods manufacturers and retailers are all faced with the
same challenge," said Craig Levra, chief executive of 24-store Sport
Chalet. "We have to do a better job getting kids fired up to play.
Our biggest competitor is not another sporting goods manufacturer or
retailer; it's video games and television."</TE>
<TE>   According to an annual study by the Sporting Goods Manufacturing
Assn., the number of Americans age 6 or older playing baseball has
declined 25% since 1987. In the last five years, the Little League
organization has lost 8% of its baseball and softball players.</TE>
<TE>   "With the exception of soccer, just about every team sport is
seeing a decline in participation," said Anthony Palma, Easton's
chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Although he blames video games and television for much of the
drop, Palma also noted that the decline in sports participation
parallels a dip in the number of hours students spend in physical
education classes at school.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a smaller player pool, Easton has focused on developing
new products that allow it to increase profit margins and gain market
share, Palma said.</TE>
<TE>   The Sporting Goods Manufacturing Assn. is looking at programs that
would reverse the slide in sports participation, but most equipment
makers are not expecting big gains. They are worried about continued
declines, especially if there is a strike or work stoppage by the
Major League Players Assn. this year.</TE>
<TE>   Given the static market, any gain by one manufacturer comes at the
expense of another.</TE>
<TE>   "The only way to gain market share is either to have the lowest
price or the most innovations," Palma said.</TE>
<TE>   Easton has chosen the second path, developing bats that allow
players to hit the ball farther and harder. Some have carbon fiber
linings that reinforce the outer walls, helping the bat pop back when
it strikes the ball. Others have a textured surface that helps put
backspin on the ball. Easton's Tri-Shell bat for adult softball has a
rubber lining sandwiched between aluminum alloy walls for more
bounce.</TE>
<TE>   "We have found that consumers are willing to pay more for products
that improve their performance," Palma said.</TE>
<TE>   The company controls 45% of the aluminum bat market, and Palma
believes there's room to grow Easton's share to 60% or higher.</TE>
<TE>   Wood bats are used primarily by professional players and make up
only a small portion of bat sales, and Easton has a small wood bat
factory at its Van Nuys plant, where it makes custom bats for Anaheim
Angels star Darin Erstad, Rafael Palmeiro of the Texas Rangers and
other major league players. (Professional players use only wooden
bats.)</TE>
<TE>   Easton, whose sales reached $160 million last year and have grown
by an average of 9% annually over the last five years, now accounts
for about one of every five dollars spent on baseball equipment at
the wholesale level. It also makes hockey sticks and other equipment,
as well as bicycle frame tubing and parts. Baseball accounts for
slightly more than half of Easton's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings Sporting Goods Co. of Fenton, Mo., famous for its
baseball gloves and baseballs, is the largest publicly traded
baseball and softball supplier. The company, which posted $174.5
million in revenue last year from baseball and other sports, has
suffered from flat sales and marginal profit for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Easton, which has 1,200 employees, including 45 engineers working
on product development, declined to provide specific earnings
figures. But people in the industry outside of the company confirmed
Palma's assertion that Easton's profit margins are among the highest
in the sporting goods business.</TE>
<TE>   As Easton's bats add more exotic metals and alloys, players said
they are hitting the ball farther. But they also are encountering
problems with some equipment.</TE>
<TE>   AJ's Triple 7 bat is his second. Janet Crook returned the first
one after only a month when it became dented from a pitched ball.
Easton sent the family a new bat, but this one also has developed a
dent even though AJ has followed the warranty rules and has not used
it to hit off a pitching machine.</TE>
<TE>   Several Mariners and Yankees at the recent game also reported
dents in expensive, high-tech bats made by Easton and similar models
produced by Hillerich &amp; Bradsby under the Louisville and TPX brand
names.</TE>
<TE>   Palma said he is not aware of "any unusual problems," adding that
the company has about a 3% return rate and puts its products through
rigorous testing.</TE>
<TE>   At the bat factory in Van Nuys, for example, Easton uses an air
cannon to shoot baseballs at 140 mph to test bats four feet away. The
company bathes bats in saltwater to judge their rate of corrosion and
runs durability tests on the handles.</TE>
<TE>   One room of the factory houses a batting cage. Along the wall,
racks hold brightly anodized yellow, orange, blue and green bats--at
least one model of every bat style Easton manufactures. Inside the
cage, two former minor league ball players who are part of Easton's
research-and-development team operate a pitching machine and take
turns hitting baseballs to test production bats and prototypes. It's
not unusual for them to each hit 250 balls in a typical workday.</TE>
<TE>   Easton is building on its success in bats to expand to other
baseball products. Levra, head of the Sport Chalet chain, said Easton
has become a major player in baseball shoes and gloves.</TE>
<TE>   Palma said the company is studying how to use some of the
improvements in lightweight hockey protective equipment to develop a
line of catcher's gear.</TE>
<TE>   "We are now the No. 3 company in baseball cleats after Nike and
Adidas," Palma said. "We are doing well in gloves and mitts. What we
have done is taken a bat company and turned it into a full-line
baseball company."</TE>

<HD>It's a Builder's Market as the Surge in House Hunting
Continues Apace</HD>
<DH>Real estate: With demand outstripping supply, Southland
prices are sharply higher this year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In Southern California, where there are far more house hunters than
houses, builders with homes to sell can virtually pick a number--and
someone will pay it.</LD>
<LD>   For properties that sell for less than $500,000, builders have too
many potential buyers, no matter how high they raise the prices, said
Jeff Meyers, who heads industry consulting firm Meyers Group.</LD>
<LD>   "Builders can't find the top right now," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Prices have spiraled upward so quickly that some analysts believe
if costs go much higher, the percentage of people who can afford new
homes could plunge and break the market's momentum. Builders are
planning less-costly units farther inland to better balance their
risks, even as the markets sizzle in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   At the Meridian, an oceanfront condominium complex in Long Beach,
prices for a popular floor plan grew to $436,000 in March, up from
$316,000 a year ago, a 38% increase.</TE>
<TE>   At Twilight Vistas, a community of single-family homes in the
Santa Clarita Valley, costs surged 37% for some models to $550,000
from $402,000 a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   And at the Rose Maria Condominiums in Placentia, one floor plan
climbed to $189,000 from $149,000 a year earlier, a 27% increase.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see these kinds of year-over-year price increases
anywhere else in the country," said Meyers, whose Irvine-based firm
compiled noteworthy examples of price hikes for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, a 5% to 10% annual increase is considered robust. But
prices across most of Southern California have shot up beyond that
range, rising at a pace analysts haven't seen since the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   'No Risk of Collapse'</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the previous boom, a sudden burst of construction
bloated the housing inventory as the business climate abruptly
crumbled amid mounting job losses that reduced the number of
potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually no chance exists today for a similar surge in
construction. With limited inventory and tightly controlled lending
for new projects, the industry runs "no risk of collapse" even if the
economy stumbles, Economy.com analyst Steven Cochrane wrote in a
recent report on the state.</TE>
<TE>   The tight market is leading to a price surge in Northern
California, a market that is quickly recovering from the dot-com
bust. The turnaround, coupled with soaring demand in the Southland,
is padding bottom lines of builders in the state as orders rise.</TE>
<TE>   A stock index of the nation's biggest home builders posted a
52-week high earlier this month and remains more than 56% ahead of a
year ago.</TE>
<TE>   At Standard Pacific Corp., one of the nation's largest builders,
the company logged record results through the first four months of
the year, largely because of the California market.</TE>
<TE>   In April, statewide orders grew 30% compared with 2001, and the
number of canceled orders was cut nearly in half from a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Industry giant Richmond American Homes reported its strongest
April on record as orders jumped in the Southland by 61%.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last three months, demand has become steadily better each
month," said Gary Reece, chief financial officer at MDC Holdings
Inc., the builder's Denver-based parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Sales Ahead of Projections</TE>
<TE>   Other builders have had similar experiences. The first four phases
of a Mira Loma project by K. Hovnanian Cos. of California Inc. sold
out before consumers even saw a model home. In Irvine, the company
has 10 buyers waiting for each available house.</TE>
<TE>   With such interest, there's no need to advertise, said Maggie
McIntee, the firm's director of marketing in Irvine. Sales are 40% to
50% ahead of projections, she added.</TE>
<TE>   KB Home in recent months fielded hundreds of inquires at an Upland
site weeks before model homes or a sales office had been completed.
Last month, the company equipped a recreational vehicle as a
temporary office to help handle the crowds.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the kinds of things over my 30 years in the business
that have rarely occurred before," said Bruce Karatz, chairman of Los
Angeles-based KB Home, one of the nation's largest builders.</TE>
<TE>   John Laing Homes recently put up about 100 houses for sale in
California, mostly in the Southland, and each one sold within hours.
Price increases averaging 15% to 20% from a year earlier have not
dimmed interest among buyers, said H. Lawrence Webb, president of WL
Homes, the privately held parent company of John Laing.</TE>
<TE>   "Today," he said, "the demand clearly has surpassed our ability to
construct homes."</TE>
<TE>   About a one-month inventory of new single-family homes,
condominiums and townhomes exists at the current selling pace in
Southern California, Meyers Group said. The supply, which includes
finished units as well as those that will be completed within the
next 90 days, is the lowest since figures were first kept in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   In comparison, the nation has a 4 1/2-month supply of new homes,
the latest figures from the federal government show.</TE>
<TE>   The nationwide supply is considered low and remains a key factor
in pushing U.S. housing prices to record highs. Boston, Washington
and New York are among the areas seeing the sharpest price increases.</TE>
<TE>   Housing has been under-built in California for years, said
analysts who estimated that the deficit has been growing by 55,000 to
100,000 units annually. Builders blame scant production on a number
of factors.</TE>
<TE>   They said a lack of suitable lots in Southern California has
limited their ability to produce new housing, and they cited planning
policies that favor development of retail stores over houses. Strict
rules can require years to determine whether housing will adversely
affect wildlife or the environment. And their proposals often face
stiff opposition from homeowners who don't want to see the housing
densities in their areas increase.</TE>
<TE>   But the tight market has allowed builders to boost prices,
especially on model homes and other units with such premium features
as great views or corner lots.</TE>
<TE>   At the Regatta, a condominium high-rise in Marina del Rey, the
base price for a particular floor plan in March was $1.1 million,
escalating 86% from $619,000 a year earlier. In Mulholland Park, a
gated enclave in Calabasas, some models costing about $2.2 million
had been going for about $1.35 million a year ago, the report by
Meyers Group showed.</TE>
<TE>   In the Colony at Bridgeport, certain units at the Valencia
development were marked up to $429,000 from $268,000 a year ago, a
60% increase. And at Skyview, a single-family home development in the
Santa Clarita Valley, prices for some styles were going for $564,000,
a 54% increase from $366,000 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Southern California, which has routinely ranked in
surveys as the most under-built region nationwide for new homes,
registered sharply higher prices in the first quarter compared with
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers Likely to Be Pushed Inland</TE>
<TE>   Median prices on single-family homes in Orange County are the
first in the region to rise above $500,000, according to Meyers
Group. Such steep gains are likely to cause more people to look for
cheaper housing in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, Meyers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some builders are trying to put up more housing in the Inland
Empire and lower-cost attached units in job-rich areas such as Irvine
to limit their exposure to a market that might stall.</TE>
<TE>   Still, analysts see ample reasons for home builders to remain
upbeat for now.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the price run is over by any means, particularly in
Southern California," said Michael Carliner, an economist at the
National Assn. of Homebuilders, a Washington trade group. "There is
still more demand than supply."</TE>

<HD>Laggard Funds Are Trailing Inflation</HD>
<DH>Investing: Local gadfly uses his Web site to list hundreds
that haven't even kept up with the CPI in the last five years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The bear market has been tough on most investors, but some have
suffered what could be called the ultimate insult: The performance of
their stock mutual funds over the last five years now lags the
inflation rate.</LD>
<LD>   Roy Weitz, a self-appointed fund industry gadfly who runs the
FundAlarm.com Web site (www.fundalarm.com), found that 416 stock
funds--about 10% of those in his database--trailed the rate of
inflation for the five years through the end of the first quarter.</LD>
<LD>   "If you don't invest in stocks to beat inflation, then what are
you investing in them for?" Weitz asked rhetorically, noting that
U.S. Treasury securities known as TIPs now offer guaranteed returns
above the inflation rate, without the risk inherent in equities.</LD>
<TE>   While Weitz's list of dubious achievers is littered with niche
investments such as sector funds and foreign funds that focus on
long-suffering areas such as Japan, he said he was shocked to see
many diversified equity funds with annualized returns below 2.25%,
the approximate rise of the consumer price index in the last five
years.</TE>
<TE>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index of blue-chip stocks returned an
annualized 10.2%, roughly its long-term historical average, in the
same span, which included both the bull market of the late 1990s and
the steep slide of the last two years. The average U.S. stock fund
rose 9.2% a year.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, many of the worst-performing funds of the period have
slumped again this year, in some cases posting double-digit losses.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised to see so many laggard funds across the board" in
the five-year screen, said the Tarzana-based Weitz, who manages a
private endowment along with his 6-year-old Web site. "If a so-called
growth fund can't beat inflation over a long stretch, that's
disconcerting."</TE>
<TE>   Although investors pick funds for different reasons and measure
them in various ways, beating inflation is one of the most basic and
easy-to-understand goals, Weitz said.</TE>
<TE>   His list of poor performers includes prominent names such as
Vanguard U.S. Growth, a $7-billion fund that gained an annualized
1.5% in the five years, and Invesco Growth, which lost an annualized
2.4%; onetime media darlings such as Gary Pilgrim's PBHG Growth,
which gained 1.8% a year, and Garrett Van Wagoner's Van Wagoner
Post-Venture, off an annualized 0.7%; and conservative-sounding funds
such as Lindner Growth &amp; Income, up 1%, Monetta Blue Chip, down 5.2%,
and Comstock Capital Value, off 12.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding whether to cut loose a disappointing fund can be a
difficult decision. Selling a stock, or stock fund, at a loss means
admitting you made a mistake, financial planners say, and it cuts
against the logical inclination to buy low and sell high.</TE>
<TE>   As a rule of thumb, Weitz said, he would consider dumping a fund
that has lagged its benchmark index in the trailing 12 months, three
years and five years--his definition of a "three-alarm fund." Many,
but not all, of the inflation laggards on his list are tagged with
three alarms, his worst rating.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point you've given it a fair shot and the numbers speak
for themselves," Weitz said. If the fund is part of an asset
allocation strategy, it could be replaced with a better performer
from the same category, he suggested.</TE>
<TE>   Weitz said highly volatile funds, such as the tech-heavy Van
Wagoner offerings, can leave investors in a big hole because the math
of recovery gets daunting. If a stock or fund loses 50% from the
point of purchase, going from $10 to $5, it has to gain 100% from its
trough just to recover.</TE>
<TE>   Tax issues should be considered before selling if the holding is
in a taxable account. Even with a slumping fund, you could still have
an unrealized capital gain, depending on how long you've owned the
fund. Conversely, you could have a tax loss worth capturing if you
want to cash out for a better investment idea.</TE>
<TE>   Most fund companies, of course, are aware of their
worst-performing portfolios, and many eventually take action--for
example, by merging laggards with other funds or by changing managers
in an effort to revive performance.</TE>
<TE>   At Vanguard U.S. Growth, Vanguard Group hired a new team in June
2001 after the board decided that the previous managers went
overboard with technology stocks.</TE>
<TE>   New managers Christopher Toub and John Blundin of Alliance Capital
so far have struggled to right the ship, with a year-to-date loss of
16%, but analyst Christopher Traulsen at fund tracker Morningstar
Inc. in Chicago said it may be too soon to give up on the experienced
duo.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Invesco Funds handed the reins of Invesco Growth to a
team headed by Timothy Miller. Morningstar analyst Peter Di Teresa
said the new team has softened sector bets and taken other steps to
temper the fund's volatility, although it's "far too soon to tell"
whether performance will improve.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Rinaldi took over the Strong Multi-Cap Value Fund in May
2001. The fund, which gained an annualized 2.2% in the five years
ended March 31, is up 4% year to date. Morningstar analyst Paul
Herbert said Rinaldi, who has posted nifty gains at Strong Advisor
Small Cap Value, may be able to turn things around.</TE>
<TE>   In one of several recent moves aimed at revamping its sluggish
fund lineup, American Express lured Nicholas Thakore from rival
Fidelity Investments in April to take over AXP Growth, which gained
an annualized 1.8% in the five years ended March 31.</TE>
<TE>   Russ Kinnel, Morningstar's director of fund analysis, said the
move should give the large-cap growth fund a "much-needed boost,"
noting that Thakore built a strong record running the Fidelity Fund.
But Kinnel said he would wait for more evidence before cutting a
check.</TE>
<TE>   As with baseball teams, switching managers doesn't always do the
trick.</TE>
<TE>   John Hancock Large Cap Growth, which lost an annualized 3.8% in
the five years ended March 31, has had seven lead managers in the
last eight years, Morningstar said.</TE>
<TE>   Performance has yet to perk up under Paul Berlinquet, who took
over in June 2001. The fund is down 10.4% year to date.</TE>

<TE>Many diversified stock mutual funds returned less than the annualized
inflation rate of 2.25% in the five-year span through  March 31,

<HD>Canadian Firm Bids to Create No. 5 Gold Giant</HD>
<DH>Mining: Placer Dome's $1.11-billion offer for AurionGold of
Australia comes as prices for the commodity pass $320.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gold mining company Placer Dome Inc. on Sunday offered to acquire
rival AurionGold Ltd. for $1.11 billion in stock, aiming to create a
leading worldwide gold producer as prices for the valuable commodity
continue to mount.</LD>
<LD>   The offer, if accepted, would create the world's No. 5 gold mining
company, producing more than 3.8 million ounces a year.</LD>
<LD>   It also would form the second-largest mining company in
AurionGold's home country of Australia, with more than 1.2 million
ounces of gold mined annually, Placer Dome said.</LD>
<TE>   The unsolicited bid comes as gold prices hovered near fresh highs
in recent weeks amid concerns about new attacks on U.S. landmarks,
continued violence in the Middle East and the possibility of violence
between India and Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Those fears have helped boost gold company stocks worldwide,
creating an attractive case for further consolidation in the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Concurrent with the announced bid for AurionGold, Vancouver,
Canada-based Placer Dome said it continued to expect to produce more
than 2.5 million ounces of gold and 420 million pounds of copper this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The bid marks the second offer to acquire a large Australian gold
mining firm in the last year. Late last year, Denver-based Newmont
Mining Corp.'s offer to acquire Normandy Mining Ltd. sparked a heated
bidding war with South Africa's AngloGold Ltd., ultimately won by
Newmont for $2.1 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Placer Dome Chief Executive Jay Taylor told Reuters that he was
not overly concerned about a rival bid arising for AurionGold because
few firms could match the synergies his company offers. Placer Dome
already operates two of AurionGold's major mines under a
joint-venture arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe somebody could make a better synergistic
case than we can," Taylor said. "We know each other, and there's
already a level of comfort between the two companies."</TE>
<TE>   Placer Dome said the unsolicited offer, announced in a public
statement Sunday, would exchange 17.5 of its shares for each 100
AurionGold shares.</TE>
<TE>   Under those terms, the deal would value the Australian firm at
$2.51 a share, a premium of more than 30% to the company's closing
price Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Harmony Gold Mining Ltd., AurionGold's leading shareholder, has
agreed to support the bid and vote its 9.8% stake in favor of the
acquisition, Placer Gold said.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said the negotiations with Harmony and other shareholders
prompted the unsolicited bid.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said he had not yet had a chance to talk with AurionGold
executives but hoped to be able to do so today.</TE>
<TE>   To complete the transaction, Placer Dome would require the support
of at least 50.1% of AurionGold's shares.</TE>
<TE>   Placer Dome said it expected to achieve at least $25 million in
annual post-tax synergies from the transaction, helping push the
combined companies' cash cost of mining down to $175 an ounce.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, gold for June delivery closed at $320.40 Friday in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Australia is the world's third-largest producer of gold, behind
South Africa and the United States, although production there has
fallen steadily since 1997, according to a study, released Sunday, by
Surbiton Associates Ltd. that showed gold production in Australia had
fallen about 10% since peaking in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Placer Dome said it expected that the deal would add to its
earnings by an unspecified amount on the basis of both net asset
value per share and cash flow per share.</TE>

<HD>MetLife to Purchase Aseguradora Hidalgo</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The companies combined in the $962-million
cash deal would become Mexico's No. 2 insurer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>MetLife Inc., the largest U.S. insurer, agreed to buy Mexico's
state-owned Aseguradora Hidalgo for $962 million in cash, outbidding
Spanish and Mexican insurers trying to expand in Latin America's
biggest economy.</LD>
<LD>   The combined company would be Mexico's second-largest insurer.</LD>
<LD>   Mexico also received offers from Spain's Corporacion Mapfre and
Grupo Financiero Inbursa, the banking and insurance company owned by
Latin America's richest man, Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim.</LD>
<TE>   "We are very impressed with Hidalgo and its success in the group
and individual life insurance market, which complements MetLife's
core competencies," MetLife International President William Toppeta
said.</TE>
<TE>   The auction is part of the Mexican government's efforts to raise
as much as $4.04billion from asset sales this year after it failed to
control spending and tax revenue fell short of expectations.</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican government reported a bigger-than-expected
$665-million budget deficit in the first quarter on lower oil income
and a drop in tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the purchase could position New York-based MetLife
to profit as Mexico's $600-billion economy pulls out of a recession
that began in late 2000. MetLife has more than 1.3 million customers
in Mexico and has been selling life insurance in the country for more
than 10 years, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   "The insurance sector is a good play on the expected economic
recovery in Mexico," said Francisco Rivero, head analyst at Santander
Central Hispano Investment.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico's central bank predicts that the economy will pull out of
recession this year and grow as much as 1.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Hidalgo, which mainly provides life insurance to federal
employees, controls 13% of Mexico's $11-billion insurance market and
is the country's largest life insurer, analysts said. Only Seguros
Comercial America is bigger, with 22% of the market.</TE>

<HD>Messier May Yet Cut Water Utility Stake</HD>
<DH>Media: The CEO of Vivendi Universal is expected to present
plan to the board, reversing previous assertions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vivendi Universal Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier faces a pivotal
meeting this week with board members in New York, where he will be
under pressure to map out a clearer vision for the struggling French
entertainment giant and a detailed plan to reduce its debt.</LD>
<LD>   Messier is expected to reverse previous assertions and present a
plan Wednesday to reduce Vivendi Universal's stake in Vivendi
Environnement, its water and sewage services utility, to less than
50% from 63%.</LD>
<LD>   Such a move could help Messier shore up some confidence among
investors, who've pushed the company's stock price down nearly 50%
this year amid concerns about the company's strategy and high debt
load. Those concerns prompted Moody's Investors Service to lower the
company's debt rating to one level above "junk" status this month.</LD>
<TE>   Pressure on Messier has been mounting, and last week Claude
Bebear, an influential French executive who chairs insurance group
Axa, openly criticized Vivendi Universal's management in a radio
interview in France. "There is certainly a problem of strategy and
decision making in this company," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi declined to comment on the statement, noting that Bebear
does not sit on the company's board. The board publicly declared its
support for Messier at the company's tumultuous annual shareholders
meeting last month.</TE>
<TE>   Investors, however, continue to express their impatience with his
leadership and the company's languishing stock price.</TE>
<TE>   "He's running out of friends and running out of time to turn
around the company," said George Nichols, an analyst with Morningstar
Inc. in Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   In its effort to transform from a water utility to a "pure play"
media company, Vivendi has amassed more than $26 billion in debt
through a series of high-profile acquisitions, including that of
Seagram Co.'s Universal Studios and the television and movie business
of USA Networks.</TE>
<TE>   Reducing its stake in the utility business would allow Vivendi to
raise about $1.6 billion in cash and remove $13 billion from its
balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Messier has made conflicting statements on the company's plans for
Vivendi Environnement, a 149-year-old utility that is separately
traded and is among the world's largest water companies. Its holdings
include U.S. Filter of Palm Desert.</TE>
<TE>   Although Messier has said his strategy is to build a global media
company, about half of Vivendi's income and revenue still come from
the water business, creating confusion among analysts and investors
over what the company stands for.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to that concern, Messier told analysts earlier this
year that he intended to lower the company's stake in the utility to
below 50% while increasing the company's stake in Cegetel, the
profitable French telecommunications business.</TE>
<TE>   But at the company's shareholders meeting in April, Messier
emphatically told shareholders that such plans were "not on the
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Messier, badly wounded in a battle with the French establishment
over a controversial overhaul at the pay-TV unit Canal Plus, changed
his tune after French President Jacques Chirac and unions warned him
not to sell to foreign interests.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi reportedly may get around the political problem by selling
part of its stake to French banks.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's shares rose 5% last week amid hopes that the company
would divest itself of part of its utility stake. Vivendi Universal
closed down 80 cents at $30.50 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   At Wednesday's meeting, the board is not expected to reconvene
shareholders for another annual meeting, according to sources close
to the board. After its annual gathering in April, Vivendi discovered
that the electronic voting system had been tampered with and asked
authorities to investigate. The company also won court approval to
schedule another meeting but has since reconsidered because of the
costs involved and reluctance to give Messier's critics another
platform, sources said.</TE>

<LD>   The study, based on a nationwide analysis of U.S. Census data,
found that the fastest-growing segment of home buyers nationwide is
the baby boom generation--Americans born from 1946 through 1964--and
those in their 60s.</LD>
<LD>   These buyers will boost growth for both upscale and vacation
homes, said John Burns, an Irvine real estate consultant who
completed the report released Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Increasingly, buyers will be grayer as the number of younger
consumers shrinks because of lower birth rates.</TE>
<TE>   "Older buyers will dominate the new-home market for years to
come," Burns said.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, he said, resort areas such as Palm
Springs, Big Bear, Santa Barbara and San Diego should thrive in the
next decade.</TE>
<TE>   So-called move-up buyers, a lucrative part of the Southland
market, will plateau in 2004, Burns said; their numbers will record
little change over the rest of the decade.</TE>
<TE>   He said the market for traditional entry-level buyers--married
couples in their early 30s--is declining nationwide, causing less
need to build housing for that group.</TE>
<TE>   Lower-cost or affordable housing will remain in high demand, Burns
said, but buyers will come from a wide range of ages and family
compositions.</TE>

<HD>Pharmacy Grads Have Pick of Offers as Drugstores, Clinics
Fill Vacancies</HD>
<DH>Labor: Employers are using incentives to lure applicants as
Americans live longer and use more prescription drugs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBRE BROWN MORLEY</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Dawn Hoeft had her pick of job offers before she graduated Saturday
from the University of Minnesota's pharmacy school.</LD>
<LD>   Hoeft was wooed by half a dozen recruiters from drugstore chains
and hospitals and considered four positions.</LD>
<LD>   "My first job out of college was pretty hard to find," said Hoeft,
41, who went back to pharmacy school after 13 years in technology
jobs. "Now the shoe is on the other foot, and it feels pretty good."</LD>
<TE>   While many industries are letting workers go, this year's more
than 8,000 pharmacy school graduates are just about guaranteed jobs,
said Will Lang of the American Assn. of Colleges of Pharmacies.</TE>
<TE>   As of January, chain drugstores had 6,503 vacant pharmacy
positions, offering starting salaries averaging around $79,000.
Thousands more positions are available at hospitals, clinics and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   "There still is a pharmacist shortage and will be for years to
come," said Mike DeAngelis, a spokesman for CVS Corp. CVS and
competitors such as Walgreen Co. are using incentives such as stock
options, signing bonuses and relocation packages to lure pharmacy
students to new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Americans are living longer and using more prescription drugs.
Consumer advertising, increased prescription coverage and new drug
therapies have added to pharmacists' workloads.</TE>
<TE>   The number of prescriptions dispensed is expected to increase 26%
to almost 4 billion in 2005 from 3.01billion in 2001, according to
the National Assn. of Chain Drug Stores.</TE>
<TE>   The number of new pharmacists is expected to increase 3.9% by
2005, the association said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for the shortage of pharmacists is that pharmacy
students are spending more time in school.</TE>
<TE>   A committee of pharmacy schools and professional organizations
decided in the mid-1990s that for pharmacists to work in more diverse
areas, such as clinical sites, they needed more education, said Lang
of the pharmacy college association.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of spending five years earning a bachelor's degree,
students now study six years for a doctor of pharmacy degree.
Students can still get a bachelor's degree, but starting in 2004 they
won't be able to take a state-licensing exam without the doctorate.
"They have to be licensed to dispense drugs," Lang said. Current
pharmacists don't need a doctorate.</TE>
<TE>   According to a report from the American Hospital Assn. in April,
46% of hospitals have a shortage of pharmacists.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of all graduates choose to work at chain drugstores
instead of taking jobs with clinics, hospital pharmacies or state
governments because the starting pay is higher, Lang said.</TE>
<TE>   "Students can easily come out of school with $80,000 in debt,"
Lang said. "Somebody that's offering you a $70,000-to-$80,000 job is
a lot more attractive than a $40,000-to-$50,000 job with more patient
contact."</TE>
<TE>   The nation's pharmacy schools also haven't been able to
accommodate the interest in the profession. Of the 26,256 applicants
for first-year pharmacy spots in 2001, only 8,922 were accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is our schools are having a difficult time trying to
figure out how to expand their class size, especially if they're
going to ask people to stay a year longer," Lang said.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacists are in such high demand that graduates are being
offered perks that include signing bonuses, matching 401(k) programs
and relocation packages.</TE>
<TE>   In the first year, a graduate can earn an average of $79,100 at a
retail pharmacy, according to a survey commissioned by trade
publication Pharmacy Week. A seasoned pharmacist "doesn't make a lot
more than that, and that's part of the problem," said Lucinda Maine,
senior vice president of the American Pharmaceutical Assn. "People
start off high but don't necessarily grow fast."</TE>
<TE>   Hoeft, the graduate, said her offers ranged from $40 to $45 an
hour, in addition to signing bonuses and a company car. Companies
recruited by sponsoring dinners and calling students, and one even
sent care packages during finals, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She accepted a position with Fairview Pharmacy Services in
Minneapolis, where she'll be able to talk to patients about their
therapy goals. "I did have higher incentive offers," she said. "But I
got a $5,000 signing bonus and a good hourly rate. Pharmaceutical
care was the selling point."</TE>

<LD>Positive Confidence Report Expected</LD>
<LD>   The four-day week will bring a raft of economic data, including
consumer confidence figures, expected Tuesday, and productivity
statistics, expected Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Confidence is key because two-thirds of the U.S. economy is
propped up by consumer spending, and productivity is important
because efficient companies can cut costs and improve earnings
growth.</LD>
<TE>   "Confidence numbers will be pretty good, and I don't expect it to
go down a lot," said James Luke, director of growth equity management
at BB&amp;T Asset Management, which oversees $10 billion. "I feel the
market is poised to rally here, though I think we'll get away from
explosive moves. It's a three-steps-forward, two-steps-back kind of
market."</TE>
<TE>   Other economic reports this week:</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Commerce Department will report on personal incomes
in April.</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. of Realtors will report on sales of previously
owned homes in April.</TE>
<TE>   Friday, the Commerce Department will report on orders placed with
the nation's factories for automobiles and other goods in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Labor Department will report on first-quarter productivity.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago purchasing managers will issue the regional manufacturing
index for May.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Michigan will issue the final May reading of its
index of consumer sentiment.</TE>

<TE>   Andersen Defense May Start Presenting Case</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Andersen, plagued with client losses, bolting partners and
the possibility of losing its accounting license in Texas, probably
will begin presenting its defense in its obstruction-of-justice trial
today in federal court in Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors expect to rest their case with their last witness, FBI
agent Paula Schanzle. Andersen's lead lawyer, Rusty Hardin, then
expects to start presenting the defense.</TE>
<TE>   David Duncan, Andersen's former top Enron Corp. auditor, who
pleaded guilty to illegally shredding documents, testified for the
prosecution that he decided months later he committed a crime. He
said he initially believed he hadn't broken any laws when he ordered
the destruction of "extraneous" Enron documents last autumn.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said Andersen is basically dead as a business, even if
jurors acquit the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost more than 500 publicly traded clients, or nearly
a quarter of the 2,300 companies whose books it audited last year.
And last week, the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy said it
has recommended revoking the company's accounting license.</TE>
<TE>   So the defense will focus on showing jurors the people behind the
firm, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said he expected Richard Corgel, Andersen's U.S. audit
practice director in Chicago and one of 62 potential witnesses, to be
the first to testify for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon told jurors last week that
court would be in session today despite the federal Memorial Day
holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   ICN Shareholders to Select Board of Directors</TE>
<TE>   Shareholders of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. will vote Wednesday on a
slate of director candidates, and they are being encouraged to back
dissident nominees.</TE>
<TE>   Institutional Shareholder Services is supporting three independent
candidates nominated by Franklin Mutual Advisers and Iridian Asset
Management. The two investor groups together hold more than 10% of
the Costa Mesa drug maker's stock and are trying to wrest control
from Chairman and Chief Executive Milan Panic, who founded the
company 42 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Three other outside directors elected last year in a previous
proxy battle have pledged to support the new slate on a nine-member
board.</TE>
<TE>   Like the dissidents of last year, the disgruntled shareholders
charge that the presence of Panic at the helm has punished investors
and kept well-qualified executives from working at ICN. They also
charge that Panic has dragged his feet for several years in splitting
the company into three independent firms to enhance shareholder
value.</TE>

<TE>   Study to Report Success</TE>
<TE>   of New Impotence Drug</TE>
<TE>   A yet-to-be-approved impotence drug developed by Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
and Icos Corp. appears to be longer-lasting than Viagra, the
companies said, citing a study to be released at a medical conference
today.</TE>
<TE>   Patients in the study reported success in achieving erections from
24 hours to as long as 36 hours after taking a 20-milligram pill of
Cialis (pronounced see-ALL-iss), Lilly and Icos said.</TE>
<TE>   The study did not compare Cialis' effects directly with those of
Viagra, the $1.2-billion-a-year drug for erectile dysfunction that
Pfizer Inc. introduced in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the peer-reviewed, final-phase study will be released
today at the American Urological Assn. conference in Orlando, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The study, funded by Lilly and Icos, involved 348 men with mild to
severe erectile dysfunction who were given either a placebo or Cialis
over eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   About 59% of the patients reported positive effects 36 hours after
taking the drug.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Gerald Brock, an associate professor of urology at the
University of West Ontario, said the findings that Cialis' effects
are longer-lasting than Viagra's are significant because many
patients report that the window during which Viagra is effective
hinders their sex lives.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly and Icos developed Cialis in a joint venture. The companies
had hoped to win marketing approval this year. But that has been
delayed to next year after the Food and Drug Administration said last
month that it would require additional studies.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer spokesman Geoff Cook said in March that the company expects
that the emergence of competing erectile-dysfunction drugs will only
boost its fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   Bayer Corp. also is awaiting FDA approval for another impotence
treatment, vardenafil.</TE>

<TE>   Alabama Officials to Train Hyundai Suppliers</TE>
<TE>   Economic developers from Alabama head for South Korea this week
for two days of training sessions with Hyundai Motor Co. suppliers on
doing business in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Officials expect that 90 representatives of more than 40 potential
suppliers will attend the sessions, which begin Wednesday in Seoul.
Hyundai, which will build its first U.S. plant near Montgomery, will
hold a similar session in Alabama in July to give U.S. auto suppliers
a chance to win contracts from the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai has not selected suppliers for its $1-billion Alabama
plant, which in 2005 will produce the next-generation Santa Fe sport
utility vehicle and the Sonata sedan. Representatives from Georgia
and Mississippi have traveled to South Korea in recent weeks, hoping
to steer suppliers their way.</TE>
<TE>   Anita Archie, general counsel for the Alabama Development Office,
said the trip is designed to give potential suppliers an overview of
Alabama's economy, taxes, incentives, work force, training and other
aspects.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai has indicated that the assembly plant, expected to begin
production in 2005, will require as many as 24 suppliers of major
components.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean as many as a dozen such suppliers will be needed
in addition to U.S.-based support companies.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press</TE>

<TE>   * Friday is the deadline for energy firms to report to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission on any "round-trip" trading activity
they have engaged in since 2000.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The four-day week will bring a raft of economic data, including
consumer confidence figures, expected Tuesday, and productivity
statistics, expected Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Confidence is key because two-thirds of the U.S. economy is
propped up by consumer spending, and productivity is important
because efficient companies can cut costs and improve earnings
growth.</LD>
<LD>   "Confidence numbers will be pretty good, and I don't expect it to
go down a lot," said James Luke, director of growth equity management
at BB&amp;T Asset Management, which oversees $10 billion. "I feel the
market is poised to rally here, though I think we'll get away from
explosive moves. It's a three-steps-forward, two-steps-back kind of
market."</LD>

<HD>Alabama Officials to Train Hyundai Suppliers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Economic developers from Alabama head for South Korea this week for
two days of training sessions with Hyundai Motor Co. suppliers on
doing business in the state.</LD>
<LD>   Officials expect that 90 representatives of more than 40 potential
suppliers will attend the sessions, which begin Wednesday in Seoul.
Hyundai, which will build its first U.S. plant near Montgomery, will
hold a similar session in Alabama in July to give U.S. auto suppliers
a chance to win contracts from the plant.</LD>
<LD>   Hyundai has not selected suppliers for its $1-billion Alabama
plant, which in 2005 will produce the next-generation Santa Fe sport
utility vehicle and the Sonata sedan. Representatives from Georgia
and Mississippi have traveled to South Korea in recent weeks, hoping
to steer suppliers their way.</LD>
<TE>   Anita Archie, general counsel for the Alabama Development Office,
said the trip is designed to give potential suppliers an overview of
Alabama's economy, taxes, incentives, work force, training and other
aspects.</TE>
<TE>   Hyundai has indicated that the assembly plant, expected to begin
production in 2005, will require as many as 24 suppliers of major
components.</TE>
<TE>   That could mean as many as a dozen such suppliers will be needed
in addition to U.S.-based support companies.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Defense May Start Presenting Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arthur Andersen, plagued with client losses, bolting partners and the
possibility of losing its accounting license in Texas, probably will
begin presenting its defense in its obstruction-of-justice trial
today in federal court in Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors expect to rest their case with their last witness, FBI
agent Paula Schanzle. Andersen's lead lawyer, Rusty Hardin, then
expects to start presenting the defense.</LD>
<LD>   David Duncan, Andersen's former top Enron Corp. auditor, who
pleaded guilty to illegally shredding documents, testified for the
prosecution that he decided months later he committed a crime. He
said he initially believed he hadn't broken any laws when he ordered
the destruction of "extraneous" Enron documents last autumn.</LD>
<TE>   Hardin said Andersen is basically dead as a business, even if
jurors acquit the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost more than 500 publicly traded clients, or nearly
a quarter of the 2,300 companies whose books it audited last year.
And last week, the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy said it
has recommended revoking the company's accounting license.</TE>
<TE>   So the defense will focus on showing jurors the people behind the
firm, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said he expected Richard Corgel, Andersen's U.S. audit
practice director in Chicago and one of 62 potential witnesses, to be
the first to testify for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon told jurors last week that
court would be in session today despite the federal Memorial Day
holiday.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Shareholders of ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. will vote Wednesday on a
slate of director candidates, and they are being encouraged to back
dissident nominees.</LD>
<LD>   Institutional Shareholder Services is supporting three independent
candidates nominated by Franklin Mutual Advisers and Iridian Asset
Management. The two investor groups together hold more than 10% of
the Costa Mesa drug maker's stock and are trying to wrest control
from Chairman and Chief Executive Milan Panic, who founded the
company 42 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Three other outside directors elected last year in a previous
proxy battle have pledged to support the new slate on a nine-member
board.</LD>
<TE>   Like the dissidents of last year, the disgruntled shareholders
charge that the presence of Panic at the helm has punished investors
and kept well-qualified executives from working at ICN. They also
charge that Panic has dragged his feet for several years in splitting
the company into three independent firms to enhance shareholder
value.</TE>

<HD>Reliant Resources Confirms It Was Subpoenaed</HD>
<DH>Energy: The trader says it will cooperate with the requests
from the U.S. attorney's office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Energy trader Reliant Resources Inc. said U.S. prosecutors have
subpoenaed the company for documents pertaining to certain "trading
activities that have been the subject of recent publicity," as the
investigation into sham energy trades deepens.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant Resources, based in Houston, on Saturday confirmed it had
received the subpoenas, shortly after Dynegy Inc. said it also had
received subpoenas for documents relating to certain trades. Reliant
Resources, Dynegy and CMS Energy Corp. have admitted to conducting
profitless bogus trades designed to boost trading volumes and pump up
business.</LD>
<LD>   Reliant said it was cooperating fully with the requests.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Reliant Energy Inc., which owns 83% of Reliant
Resources, said both companies have restated revenue for the first
quarter of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   They also plan to reissue consolidated financial statements for
1999, 2000 and 2001 to correct for the sham trades.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant Resources has admitted that it was the subject of a probe
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Reliant represents the newest chapter in the saga of scandals,
beginning with the collapse of Enron Corp., that continue to riddle
the energy sector, sending prices of utilities shares lower.</TE>
<TE>   Although Reliant did not disclose which U.S. attorney's office
issued the subpoenas, Houston-based Dynegy on Friday announced that
the U.S. attorney's office in Houston subpoenaed documents concerning
trades with Dearborn, Mich.-based CMS.</TE>
<TE>   A representative from Reliant Resources could not be reached
immediately for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The company has said the sham, or "wash," trades boosted revenue
by 10% during a three-year period as the companies bought and sold
power at the same price with the same counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   The admission has led to the resignations of high-level executives
at Reliant Resources and CMS.</TE>
<TE>   Since the scandal began unfolding, analysts have downgraded shares
of Reliant Energy and Reliant Resources, their credit ratings have
been cut, and shareholder lawsuits have mushroomed.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Reliant Resources closed Friday at $10.25, up 98 cents
on the New York Stock Exchange. Its 52-week high was $37.50; its low
was $7.28.</TE>

<HD>Rounding Rule May Determine Calculation of Overtime Pay</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Hourly employees at my company are marked late after
clocking in one minute past their scheduled start time. However, we
are not paid for working past our scheduled stop time, unless we have
worked at least 15 minutes of overtime.</LD>
<LD>   We think this is illegal.</LD>
<LD>   --S.K., Lomita</LD>
<TE>   Answer: It is perfectly legal to discipline employees if they
clock in after the start of a scheduled shift. Similarly, if you are
unrepresented or if your union contract permits, an employer can
round an employee's starting and stopping times to the nearest
quarter-hour.</TE>
<TE>   But this practice is unlawful if the employer rounds beyond the
nearest quarter-hour or if the rounding results, on average and over
a period of time, in a failure to compensate employees properly for
all time they have worked.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an employer is allowed to dock employees 15 minutes'
pay if they arrive for work eight minutes after the start of their
shifts.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, an employee working eight minutes overtime
would be entitled to a full 15 minutes of overtime pay.</TE>
<TE>   Under this rounding practice, an employer would not be allowed to
dock employees who arrive seven minutes late and could lawfully
refuse to pay overtime when an employee works seven minutes beyond
the end of a shift.</TE>
<TE>   It does not appear that your employer is following legal rounding
practices, however, since it fails to pay wages to employees who work
eight to 15 minutes past their scheduled shifts.</TE>
<TE>   If you are represented, you should notify your union. If you are
unrepresented and your employer will not change its practice, you may
wish to consult an employment attorney or file a complaint with the
nearest office of the state labor commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   If you are successful, you may be entitled to recover back pay,
including retroactive overtime premiums at time and a half, as well
as interest, attorneys fees and statutory penalties.</TE>

<TE>   Fingerprinting of Employees Is Legal</TE>
<TE>   Q: I work for a small wholesale company in Southern California.
Recently all the employees were required to give their fingerprints
and have photos taken. The company said it was just updating its
personnel files.</TE>
<TE>   I'd like to know if an employer in California can legally do this.
It seemed to be an invasion of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   --D.A., Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   A: Under California law, an employer may require employees to
furnish fingerprints and photographs for its own use.</TE>

<TE>   Temp Worker's Recourse on Unemployment Claim</TE>
<TE>   Q: I worked as a temporary municipal employee for seven years. One
day, I was called in and told that my position had been eliminated
and that my services were no longer needed.</TE>
<TE>   When I applied for unemployment benefits, my request was denied
because my employer stated I was terminated for criminal activity. I
know nothing of this activity.</TE>
<TE>   What is my recourse? Attorneys have told me that I cannot do
anything because I was a temporary employee.</TE>
<TE>   --D.C., Alhambra</TE>
<TE>   A: You are certainly entitled to examine your personnel file to
see if it includes any reasons for your termination.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, you can appeal the decision of the Employment
Development Department to the California Unemployment Insurance
Appeals Board, which would hold a hearing to decide whether the
reasons for denying your benefits are legitimate.</TE>
<TE>   In determining eligibility for unemployment benefits, the EDD and
the appeals board apply the same standards to temporary and permanent
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The basic rule is that if you are terminated for reasons other
than misconduct in connection with your work, you are entitled to
benefits.</TE>

<TE>   Effect of Change in Pension Vesting Rules</TE>
<TE>   Q: From September 1979 to March 1986, I worked as a nonunion
employee for a large national company. At the time I joined the
company, all nonunion employees were eligible for a company-paid
pension upon retirement at age 65. Employees became vested after 10
years of service.</TE>
<TE>   Since the pension reform act in 1986 reduced the vesting period to
five years from 10 years, would I be considered vested since I did
not quit until after the law changed?</TE>
<TE>   --K.R., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: Although the Tax Reform Act of 1986 did change the vesting
standards for tax-qualified pension plans, the law did not take
effect until Jan. 1, 1988, and applied only to individuals employed
on that date. Thus the new vesting rules do not apply to you.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Wireless Inc. and other U.S. mobile phone companies won seven
more months to prepare for an airwaves auction previously scheduled
for June 19. Officials refused to delay a second sale set for the
same day.</LD>
<LD>   Large mobile phone companies had asked the Federal Communications
Commission to delay both auctions indefinitely as they resolve
ownership disputes with television broadcasters.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said postponement until Jan. 14 for one sale would be
appropriate as Congress weighs whether to grant a further delay.
Smaller carriers wanted the second sale to go forward as planned.</LD>
<TE>   TV stations are using the airwaves until at least 2006 as they
upgrade to digital signals. Federal law, though, requires that the
government resell the frequencies to mobile phone companies before
the transition is complete.</TE>

<HD>DirecTV to Test Version of Video on Demand</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Trying to keep pace with a popular new cable TV service, satellite TV
provider DirecTV plans a six-month experiment this year with a new
version of video on demand.</LD>
<LD>   With video on demand, consumers can choose from a digital library
of programs, then play, pause, rewind and fast-forward the video as
if it were on tape.</LD>
<LD>   Cable operators use a central computer to store their
video-on-demand libraries, and viewers draw programs from the library
through a two-way cable connection. Satellite operators don't have
the capacity or two-way connections needed to duplicate that
approach, so they need to store their video-on- demand libraries on
digital recorders in subscribers' homes.</LD>
<TE>   Working with Starz Encore Group, DirecTV, a subsidiary of General
Motors Corp. unit Hughes Electronics Corp., plans to beam as many as
five movies a week to subscribers who have satellite receivers with
built-in digital recorders from TiVo Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The movies will be transmitted at the beginning of the week,
starting in mid-summer, and subscribers will be able to watch them as
often as they wish until the next crop of films arrives.</TE>
<TE>   The main shortcoming is the recorders' limited storage capacity,
which prevents DirecTV from putting many of Starz's movies into the
service. Although the capacity is expected to increase quickly in
future models, today's receivers have room for only 25 hours of
programming.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to first test the experience, the navigation, the
interaction, and to see the operational part of it," said John Sie,
chief executive of Starz Encore.</TE>
<TE>   The company's ultimate goal is to make the films in Starz Encore's
premium movie package available on demand, whether it's on cable or
on satellite, Sie said.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates said he expected tablet-size
personal computers using the Windows operating system to begin
selling in October as the company promotes new types of computers to
boost slumping PC sales.</LD>
<LD>   Tablet PCs are designed with a screen the size of a pad of paper
that users can write on with a stylus.</LD>
<LD>   Microsoft is focusing on versions of Windows, which runs more than
90% of the world's PCs, for new forms of computers such as tablets,
phones and home entertainment devices as sales of PCs recover slowly
from a decline in 2001, the first since 1985. Global PC shipments
fell 2.7% in the first quarter, according to market researcher IDC.</LD>
<TE>   Microsoft has declined to comment on specific prices for the
tablet PCs, which will be set by the computer makers producing them.
The company has said prices will equal those of the more costly
laptop, or about $2,000 to $3,000.</TE>

<HD>Net Helping Search for Missing Kids</HD>
<DH>Crime: Fast, widespread dissemination of photos and
information online credited in discovery of 48 children since 2000.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICK JESDANUN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Elizabeth Norton immediately suspected an abduction when her
ex-husband failed to return on time with their two children. So she
quickly contacted authorities and began circulating photos.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, it was the Internet that reunited her with her two
sons nine months later. A woman who became suspicious about her new
neighbors searched a Web site on missing children, where she found a
photo of one of the boys.</LD>
<LD>   "The Internet absolutely provided a convenient vehicle that very
moment she wanted to confirm her suspicions," Norton said. "Without
that, I don't know what would have happened."</LD>
<TE>   Organizations that help locate missing children praise the
Internet and other new technologies for speeding and increasing
recoveries.</TE>
<TE>   Without the Net, the neighbor would have had to call a hotline and
try to make a match using verbal descriptions. Or she would have had
to spot a flier at a store or on a telephone pole.</TE>
<TE>   Jenni Thompson of the Polly Klaas Foundation in Petaluma, Calif.,
which assists in locating missing children, said that although
parents often worry about molesters making contact with kids online,
"we need to remember that the Internet can be used for good things as
well."</TE>
<TE>   The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children credits the
Internet for leading directly to the discovery of 48 children since
2000. That's greater than two other primary methods--44 through
posters at Wal-Mart stores and 19 through postcards sent with bulk
mailings.</TE>
<TE>   The Internet and other technologies play a contributing role in
thousands of other missing-child cases each year.</TE>
<TE>   "In one way or another, we use the Internet in every case," said
Mike Gibson, president of Operation Lookout in Everett, Wash. "It's
just too valuable a tool to not use whenever possible."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators use online resources such as reverse phone
directories--where entering a phone number gets you a name and
address--to track down family members suspected of abducting a child.
Law enforcement also has its own network for sharing confidential
details on suspects.</TE>
<TE>   At the national missing children center, forensics imaging
specialist Steve Loftin uses Adobe Systems Inc.'s Photoshop software
to show what children might look like years after they were last
seen. The age-progression photos are credited in 111 recoveries since
2000.</TE>
<TE>   In Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Sherry Friedlander runs an automated
dialing service whose computers can place 1,000 calls in five minutes
asking neighbors to be on the lookout for a missing child.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had to go to 500 doors and knock on them, that would take
you more than two hours," Friedlander said.</TE>
<TE>   E-mail allows groups to send thousands of alerts instantly, and it
lets people submit tips from their homes.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are just intimidated talking to police," said Rod
Hegman, manager of the Delaware State Police's Missing Children
Information Clearinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   Using the Internet won't guarantee success, nor will it completely
replace milk cartons, grocery bags, fliers and bulk-mail inserts.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike posters in neighborhoods, a Web site needs to be
visited to be seen. Web sites for the FBI, the U.S. Postal Service
and other organizations link to a searchable database at
www.missingkids.org, but they aren't always prominent.</TE>
<TE>   E-mail can get a photo out quickly, but photos can linger for
years, continually forwarded by well-intended Internet users long
after the child is found. And hoaxes have circulated online. Still,
the Internet can spread information farther and faster.</TE>
<TE>   Though Norton had posted pictures of her two sons in her and her
ex-husband's neighborhoods in New York, he had left the area with the
kids and eventually ended up in a trailer park near San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The neighbor who spotted them contacted the sheriff's office in
Dutchess County, N.Y., using a number listed with an online photo of
one of the boys.</TE>

<DH>Alpha's CEO sees promise in the mobile phone market</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The industry may be struggling, but two communications chip makers
are forging ahead with plans to create the largest provider of
semiconductors for cellular and other mobile telephones.</LD>
<LD>   The merger of the wireless division of Conexant Systems Inc. in
Newport Beach, already the leading maker of power amplifier chips,
and Alpha Industries Inc. in Woburn, Mass., is expected to close in
mid-June.</LD>
<LD>   The new company, named Skyworks Solutions Inc., will be pushing
hard in what it sees as its biggest area for growth: providing all
the silicon content and software needed in cellular telephone
handsets.</LD>
<TE>   Few companies worldwide can put the whole package together, said
David J. Aldrich, who will become Skyworks' chief executive. The
ability to provide that package will become more important,
especially for low-end and entry-level phones, as manufacturers
concentrate on putting more functions, such as video, onto cell
phones.</TE>
<TE>   Those new functions are going to require speedier communications,
which is the promise of the so-called 3G phones--the third generation
of wireless cellular mobile devices.</TE>
<TE>   But when that happens depends on how soon demand picks up, said
Aldrich, now Alpha's president and CEO. He said he will run the
company from Massachusetts but might move the headquarters to Newport
Beach at some point.</TE>
<TE>   Aldrich talked about the future of the industry--and Skyworks--now
that chip and cell phone makers are digging themselves out of the
backlog of products that has plagued them for the last year or so.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Reports about the industry's health and prospects have
been all over the map the last few months. What is your take on it?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: In the post-Sept. 11 period, the past two quarters,
there's always been the sense that there's a rebound that's about to
occur, and that the rebound is going to reflect in the equity markets
and in the capital markets. That's been a sort of around-the-corner
situation that's created a lot of confusion.</TE>
<TE>   The people who provide the services need to get very proactive
about promoting new services, selling cheap and convenient cellular
phones to consumers. Recently, they've been a little bit less willing
to do that because they're concerned about their own cash flow and
operating model. So that's moderating the growth rate. That's where
we are today.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And where are we heading?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you move forward, the inventory's flushed out almost
entirely. So now we're going to have equilibrium throughout, and
that's a really good thing. Now you can predict. And you're starting
to see the emergence of some of the newer services being promoted,
like the new stuff that Verizon's rolling out.</TE>
<TE>   So consumer appetite for wireless remains strong. The worst of the
correction is behind us, and now we're going to go back to a growth
rate that's going to be less than the 40% compounded that we had, but
will be growth nonetheless over the next 1 to 1 1/2 years, while the
whole capital market sorts out the degree to which there's going to
be a big push for 2 1/2G and 3G.</TE>
<TE>   Q: The promise of 3G is gadgetry, such as color video, TV clips,
digital camera functions. Are consumers going to want to pay the
price? Will they want a telephone to be so much more than just a
phone?</TE>
<TE>   A: That's the dilemma around 3G. There's no doubt in my mind, and
I don't think there's any doubt from an industry perspective, that
voice has been the killer application--voice in combination with
data, some ability to check e-mail, messaging, some access to the
Web, scheduling, all integrated with a wireless widget, whether it's
a cellular telephone or a laptop with cellular phone or voice
technology. That's the sort of 2 1/2G play.</TE>
<TE>   The real question is: What's the killer application for 3G? What
do you want for 1 megabit per second of throughput [amount of data
that can be moved] to your cellular telephone? Do you want to stream
video while you're driving your car and talking on the telephone?
What is it you want to do?</TE>
<TE>   That very debate is what has caused a delay in rolling out 3G.
Most people believe now that 3G will come in 2004, 2005 in some
markets, where we hoped it would be late this year and next year.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What are manufacturers and suppliers like Skyworks doing to
generate demand?</TE>
<TE>   A: The industry's going through quite a radical transformation,
and it's really the maturation of the cellular handset market. It's
become much more a consumer electronics business with shorter product
life cycles.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers have a lot of expectations for what their next cellular
telephone's going to do, and the prices are dropping substantially.
That's forcing our customers to do a couple of things. One is they're
trying to figure out with whom to partner to produce that phone much
more inexpensively than they can today. They're doing things like
moving much of the production offshore.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest element of growth in the handset market is what we
call ODM, original design manufacturer--the design manufacturing
houses in places like Taiwan and China. That business is growing 50%
to 60% a year. Companies in Taiwan, for example, are designing and
building entire [lower-end] phones for Motorola.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does that affect a company like Skyworks?</TE>
<TE>   A: Those folks [in Asia] want to have a complete semiconductor
solution. They want a supplier to come in and say, "We'll give you a
reference design and all the chips that it takes to manufacture a
cellular telephone. You know how to manufacture electronic products,
and we know how to help you make a cellular phone." Now, we can get
$20 a phone in that arrangement. So that's the biggest push for us.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Skyworks will have 4,000 employees, half in a Mexicali assembly
plant and most of the rest in U.S. plants. Many companies go offshore
for cheaper labor and resources. How are you going to compete?</TE>
<TE>   A: First of all, ODM customers truly need somebody with the height
and breadth of technology and systems and solutions to provide the
reference design, if you will. And there are only a handful in the
world that can do that, and we're one of them.</TE>
<TE>   The way we compete on a cost structure is that we're vertically
integrated only in those processes that we need to be.</TE>
<TE>   So we need to be vertically integrated in gallium arsenite HBT [a
compound semiconductor] today because the process we use is
proprietary and the cost of having that in-house is far more
advantageous than outsourcing. And the outsourcing people aren't
where they need to be yet. When you're in [basic, standard chips],
it's really a different play. [Fabrication plants] are huge,
billion-dollar investments in some cases, and you simply use an
outsourcing fab.</TE>

<HD>Energy Trading Losing Luster With New MBAs</HD>
<DH>Recruiting: The collapse of Enron, other industry woes have
some Houston- area graduates seeking jobs in other sectors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN KOO</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Riding the boom in power trading, almost 8% of business school
graduates at Rice University last year took jobs with Enron Corp.,
lured by first-year compensation of more than $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few months later, the graduates of the Houston-based school
were out of work and the luster of the once-highflying industry,
still reeling from Enron's collapse into Chapter 11 proceedings late
last year, was tarnished.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, there is a revival of interest in old-line oil
companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP
among graduates of Rice's top-tier master of business administration
program.</LD>
<TE>   "This has been a year when the Shells and Exxons and BPs of the
world have been interesting to our students because they have
stronger balance sheets and are here for the long run," said John
Miller, associate director of career planning at Rice's Jones School
of Management.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have said that two years ago," said Miller, who also
lectures on risk management at the Jones School.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring in general has fallen because of the economy and local
mergers, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   This year, slightly fewer than 70% of Rice graduates were placed,
compared with 90% last year.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of Enron, Duke Energy Corp., another top trading
company, has become the leading recruiter this year at Rice, hiring
11 students. It's no coincidence that Duke is an investment-grade
company and is perceived to have a strong balance sheet.</TE>
<TE>   More students are taking sales and trading jobs at Wall Street
firms than at energy companies, Miller said, noting, "That's been a
little bit of a twist."</TE>
<TE>   With the collapse of Enron, once the world's No. 1 power trader,
business school graduates are scrutinizing potential employers more
closely. Some at Rice are looking at industries outside Houston's
lifeblood energy sector.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some concerns about whether a company is solid or not,"
said Stephen Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal
Reserve Bank of Dallas. "It's an issue of reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Houston is famous for its boom-and-bust energy cycles. During the
most recent uptick, record profits pumped up the prospects of such
energy traders as Enron, Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp., prompting a
surge in jobs beginning about 1997.</TE>
<TE>   New graduates and traders with more traditional Wall Street
backgrounds alike were attracted by the challenge of working in the
volatile power industry and by the competitive salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Starting salaries at energy trading companies are as competitive
as those at investment banks. Base salaries are in the
$80,000-to-$85,000 range and are boosted by signing bonuses in the
tens of thousands along with guaranteed first-year bonuses and stock
options of $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   But things have changed. In the fallout from Enron's collapse,
other energy traders--including Dynegy, Mirant, Aquila Inc., NRG
Energy Inc. and Reliant Resources Inc.--have faced questions about
their financial strength.</TE>
<TE>   The major credit raters also have downgraded, or threatened to
downgrade, the debt of some of the companies to "junk" status, making
it more difficult for them to borrow money, raise cash and operate
their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, many energy traders have been less aggressive
about recruiting students, often because of restructuring programs
that put a premium on cutting expenses, including jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not hiring as much as we were in the past," a Mirant
spokesman said, acknowledging that hiring is not a priority after the
company cut 7% of its global work force this year.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, jobs in risk management are on the rise--no surprise,
given the problems that have hit the industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen a pretty significant increase in hiring in the
risk-management field," said Ron Lumbra of recruitment firm Russell
Reynolds, noting that there are more jobs for people to assess the
risk of trading with certain counterparties and the risk of having
surplus power generation in certain markets.</TE>
<TE>   But Brown said interest in energy trading won't go away any time
soon.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the alternative careers that were real strong a couple of
years ago, like telecom or high tech, aren't quite as strong," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "So energy trading might be relatively more attractive among the
careers that have developed over the last 10 years."</TE>

<HD>Ominous Game on India-Pakistan Border</HD>

<AU>RANAN R. LURIE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When I met with Gen. Pervez Musharraf, now the
president-by-referendum of Pakistan, I asked him whether he would
agree to his daughter marrying a Hindu. His answer was uttered in one
single word: ''Never.'' Why not? ''Because he's not a Muslim.''</LD>
<LD>   Years ago, when I asked Rajiv Gandhi, then India's prime minister,
a similar question about his child marrying a Pakistani Muslim, he
looked me straight in the eye and declared: ''He'd better be very
rich.''</LD>
<LD>   India and Pakistan carry mutual antipathy that I doubt can be
resolved by shuttle diplomacy handled by the new Henry Kissingers of
the world. Talk is cheap, and it won't be enough.</LD>
<TE>   There are about 600,000 Indian soldiers poised to attack as they
protect their 1,800-mile border with Pakistan. While the Indian army
may not be one of the most efficient forces in the world, there are
still millions of fingers on a million rifles; 400,000 men are spread
elsewhere, including along the Chinese border.</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani army is much smaller and has deployed about 250,000
troops on the border with India.</TE>
<TE>   India has kept its huge army on full alert for five months and
provided fuel to the flames of terror attacks through an overdose of
warnings and crescendos of threats.</TE>
<TE>   Now India has to deliver. It can do so in one of four ways: by
cutting diplomatic relations with Pakistan; by carrying out, with
small special forces units, punitive attacks on selected Pakistani
targets; by moving its army into Pakistan with the intent of
''cleaning up'' big areas of terrorists; or by launching a nuclear
tactical attack.</TE>
<TE>   Of these options, the nuclear attack is an absurdity, unless
someone really runs amok; an invasion is almost not feasible; and
cutting off diplomatic ties is an option that India itself would see
as losing any chance to reduce the threat.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the only way that India can react would be to use elite
forces to attack a couple of targets inside Pakistan that would lead,
basically, to nothing but the satisfaction of its public for a short
time. It also runs the risk that members of Indian special forces
might be killed, get lost or be taken prisoners of war and the whole
event would turn into a face-losing fiasco.</TE>
<TE>   Since Pakistan is not a democracy, it has less to risk than India.
Ambassador Munir Akram, Pakistan's representative to the United
Nations, has said: ''I can guarantee that we will not attack first.
Why should we attack? We're in a good situation, versus India, which
held so many mobilized troops for five months and created a big
credibility gap between declarations and deeds.''</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan enjoys two advantages. It is an ally in the U.S. war on
terrorism, and every U.S. Air Force plane based in a Pakistani
airport serves as an insurance policy against an Indian airstrike on
that runway.</TE>
<TE>   While Pakistan considers India the ''big bully'' that occupies
Kashmir, India considers Pakistan a terrorist haven where illegal
forces mingle and interlock with a sympathetic government.</TE>
<TE>   India is convinced that Pakistan is behind the terrorist acts,
while Pakistan accuses India of no less than staging these attacks on
itself for the purpose of gaining Western sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   To an outsider, India looks like a giant that has to
simultaneously protect its long border with Pakistan, defend itself
from the onslaught of Muslim terror attacks and satisfy the cry of
its masses for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The problem is that the giant with three tasks has only two hands.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I was growing up in northern New Jersey in the 1950s, my family
never missed the parades on Memorial Day and July 4, which always
included the Gold Star mothers, who had lost sons or daughters in
war.</LD>
<LD>   When World War II ended, these women--and perhaps most other
Americans--believed that Gold Star motherhood would end with them. Of
course it did not.</LD>
<LD>   Fast-forward to July 1969: I stop in to visit my folks the
afternoon before flying to Ft. Lewis in Washington state. My mother
says, "I didn't raise my boy to be a soldier." She wishes me luck,
and the image fades. My father is not in it.</LD>
<TE>   A year later, my part of the war in Vietnam is over. I am
unscratched and whole, the second son to return from the war unhurt,
though not unmarked. I walk into the living room of the house in
Teaneck, having come directly from the airport. My uniform is new,
the only time I will wear it. My father is upstairs, but I hear him
moving. He starts slowly down, and I am shocked.</TE>
<TE>   This once athletic man, still slim and wiry, grips the banister
and guides himself down the staircase one slow step at a time. His
body is broken by a stroke suffered months before, and a cruel palsy
distorts his face. He is close to tears. For the first time I can
recall, he hugs me. If he said anything, I don't remember it, but he
conveyed his message: "My boy is home." Thirty-six days later, he was
dead.</TE>
<TE>   My father was 59 when he died, retired after 42 years with
Standard Oil. I was 27. Now, at age 59 myself, I still ponder the
cost of the war on him and on the other fathers whose sons went to
Vietnam. Especially, I think of those whose sons came back in caskets
or wounded in body and spirit and who still fight the demons that
came home with them. Although my point of reference is Vietnam, the
principle applies to all wars.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose the way mothers and fathers respond has much to do with
the psyches of women and men. Gold Star mothers share their loss and
somehow gain solace from their common grief. For the fathers, who
perhaps know firsthand what their child has gone through, the force
of grief may be too powerful to risk releasing it, even if sharing
the pain might help. The wound never heals, and it will not bear
reopening by talk of war and loss. Public grief is not an option for
most, and their private grief is wrapped up in the unfulfilled life
that had once held so much promise. Whether the war is popular or
reviled makes no difference. The costs are identical.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial Day, 2002: We have almost forgotten the meaning of this
holiday, which began as a day for decorating the graves and recalling
the sacrifice of the Civil War dead. Many of us will go to the
beaches, mountains and malls. Other Americans, however, will march in
or watch parades and attend commemorations at the village green or at
national cemeteries.</TE>
<TE>   But all of us will recall the terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001,
the most recent reminder that all we have in this land comes at a
cost, and we never know who will pay it.</TE>

<HD>There's a Bone to Pick With Meat Eaters</HD>
<DH>Growing grain for feed instead of food may be humanity's
greatest evil yet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEREMY RIFKIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of millions of people are going hungry every day all over
the world because much of the arable land now is being used to grow
feed grain for animals rather than food grain for people. Grain-fed
cattle, pigs, chicken and other livestock, in turn, are being
consumed by the wealthiest people on the planet while the poor go
hungry.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, when agricultural ministers from around the world
gather at the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization's World Food
Summit in Rome on June 10 to discuss how to feed a burgeoning human
population, the issue of feed grain versus food grain will not be on
the official agenda. It should be.</LD>
<LD>   In the past half a century, we have erected an artificial,
worldwide protein ladder, with grain-fed beef and other meats on the
top rung. Affluent populations, especially in Europe, North America
and Japan, devour the bounty of the planet. The transition of world
agriculture from food grain to feed grain represents a new form of
human evil, with consequences possibly far greater and longer lasting
than any past wrongdoing inflicted by men against their fellow human
beings.</LD>
<TE>   Today, more than 70% of the grain produced in the United States is
fed to livestock, much of it to cattle. Unfortunately, cattle are
energy guzzlers, considered by some to be the Cadillacs of farm
animals. In the U.S., 157 million metric tons of cereal, legumes and
vegetable protein suitable for human use are fed to livestock to
produce 28 million metric tons of animal protein that humans consume
annually.</TE>
<TE>   Cattle and other livestock are devouring much of the grain
produced on the planet. This is a new agricultural phenomenon, one
that began in the U.S. at the start of the 20th century and spread to
other countries after World War II. The transition from forage to
feed has taken place with little debate despite the fact that it has
had a more pronounced impact on the politics of land use and food
distribution than any other single factor in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   In the developing countries, land reform periodically has spawned
populist political uprisings. Still, while ownership and control of
land have been issues of great public debate, how the land is used
has been of less interest. Yet the decision to use the land to create
an artificial food chain has resulted in misery for hundreds of
millions of people around the world. Bear in mind that an acre of
cereal produces five times more protein than an acre devoted to meat
production; legumes (beans, peas, lentils) can produce 10 times more
protein; leafy vegetables 15 times more protein.</TE>
<TE>   The global corporations that produce the seeds, farm chemicals and
cattle and that control the slaughterhouses and the marketing and
distribution channels for beef are eager to tout the advantage of
grain-fed livestock.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, many nations followed the advice of the U.N. Food
and Agricultural Organization, which suggested switching to coarse
grains that could be more easily consumed by livestock. World meat
production has risen fivefold.</TE>
<TE>   The shift from food to feed continues apace despite the growing
hunger of an increasingly desperate humanity. The human consequences
of the transition from food to feed were dramatically illustrated in
1984 in Ethiopia, when thousands were dying each day from famine. The
public was unaware that, at the same time, Ethiopia was using some of
its agricultural land to produce linseed cake, cottonseed cake and
rapeseed meal for export to Britain and other European nations to be
used as feed for livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Tragically, 80% of the world's hungry children live in countries
with food surpluses, much of which is in the form of feed fed to
animals that will be eaten by well-to-do consumers. Thirty-six
percent of the world's grain is fed to livestock. In the developing
world, the share of grain fed to livestock has tripled since 1950 and
now exceeds 21% of the total grain produced. In China, the share of
grain fed to livestock has gone from 8% to 26% since 1960. In Mexico,
the share rose from 5% to 45%, in Egypt from 3% to 31% and in
Thailand from 1% to 30% in the same period.</TE>
<TE>   The irony of the food production system is that millions of
wealthy consumers in developed countries increasingly are dying from
diseases of affluence--heart attacks, strokes, diabetes and
cancer--brought on by gorging on fatty grain-fed beef and other
meats, while the poor in the Third World are dying of diseases of
poverty brought on by being denied access to land to grow food grain
for their families.</TE>
<TE>   Consuming large quantities of grain-fed beef and other meats is
viewed by many as a basic right and a way of life. The underside of
the beef culture, in which displaced people search desperately for
their next meal, is rarely considered. There is likely to be plenty
of talk at the World Food Summit about how to increase food
production. No doubt the biotech companies will be there, touting
their genetically modified "wonder seeds." Developed countries and
nongovernmental organizations will talk about extending food aid.
Other countries will talk about more equitable global trade
agreements and securing higher prices for their commodities. There
may even be some discussion about the need for agricultural land
reform in poor countries.</TE>
<TE>   What is likely to be virtually absent from the debate is talk
about the food preferences of the world's wealthier consumers, who
favor eating at the highest point on the global food chain while
their fellow human beings starve. We are long overdue for a global
discussion on how best to promote a diversified, high-protein
vegetarian diet for the human race.</TE>

stopped and people die young.</LD>
<LD>   The dismal statistics are all true. But a slightly closer look, at
least in Ghana, will show something else: an extraordinary technology
boom. It's not quite San Francisco in 1998, but there's something
similar going on.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, for every child like Zakaria Turay, a 14-year-old war
veteran in Sierra Leone recently profiled in Newsweek, there's a
young man like Robin Kwakofi, a 24-year- old Ghanaian Web programmer
with his own aspiring dot-com.</TE>
<TE>   When Turay was abducted by guerrillas five years ago, Kwakofi was
taking the bus to Accra's one Internet cafe and teaching himself to
program. When Turay was running drugs and drinking blood, Kwakofi was
redesigning the Web site for Ghana's Joy FM radio station. As Turay
tries to reassemble a life, Kwakofi plans for what he calls an
African technological revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Young men and women like Kwakofi fill Accra. And although the whiz
kids of Ghana don't have nearly the technological or educational
infrastructure of their San Francisco role models, they do have the
same ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Kofi Dadzie, a 25-year-old programmer, runs a software company
called Rancard in Accra. He has seven employees now, but he talks
about having 10,000 in just a few years. Up the street, Ghanaians
pack the downstairs of the Busy Internet cafe day and night, using
the cafe's 100 flat-screen monitors and fast satellite connection.
Upstairs, 10 companies use the connection for everything from
e-commerce to typing up handwritten street violations for the New
York City Police Department. Directly across the street, students at
the NIIT computer school gather and talk of their dreams of starting
software companies.</TE>
<TE>   The story that Americans hear from Ghana during Bono and O'Neill's
travels matters more than one might think. Africa has lagged in
development for many reasons, ranging from poor geographic luck (lots
of malaria; not many good shipping routes) to horrendous political
leadership. But the continent also suffers because of the perception
of Africa as a monolithic sinkhole, and thus a place unworthy of
investment or attention.</TE>
<TE>   To many Americans, Africa is just Africa--even if Ghana no more
resembles Sierra Leone than the United States resembles Mexico. Ghana
has a truly democratically elected government, has been stable for 20
years with virtually no ethnic conflict and there probably isn't a
single child with a Kalashnikov hiding in the bush.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, as Asian nations showed in the 1990s, nothing spurs
development in one country more than development in a neighboring
one. People learn new skills, access new markets and are competitive.
Africa hasn't had a real success story yet. But if just a few of the
Internet pioneers' dreams come true, Ghana could be it.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he hopes for, one of Turay's fellow fighters told
Newsweek that he wanted pens and books. That's the classic desperate
message from Africa. It's real, and it's not that far from what Bono
wants. But Kwakofi may have a more important African message. Asked
what he would say to O'Neill, Kwakofi says, ''I would tell him to say
to American technology companies that they can invest in Ghana....
Conditions are right for a boom.''</TE>

<LD>Yosemite Falls, the global icon of California's most spectacular
national park, plunges 2,425 feet in three leaps that naturalist John
Muir described as "a throng of comets." More than a million visitors
a year hike the quarter-mile trail to the foot of the lower falls to
wonder at the beauty and power of the water dashing onto granite.</LD>
<LD>   But walking the trail to the falls today is hardly the
bushwhacking that Muir did. It's more like negotiating a busy street
in a blighted city--from a fume-filled parking lot choked with tour
buses and trash dumpsters, past the blockhouse restrooms and down a
cracked asphalt pathway bordered by denuded earth.</LD>
<LD>   Happily, all that will change over the next two years as the
56-acre access area is rebuilt and landscaped as part of a
$12.5-million project financed primarily by the Yosemite Fund, a
private nonprofit organization that has raised more than $18 million
since 1985 for Yosemite projects.</LD>
<TE>   Crews will raze the parking lot and put in picnic tables. They'll
build restrooms in a less conspicuous spot, restore stream banks,
replace bridges and make viewing sites more hospitable, providing
access for the disabled. The area will remain open while the work is
underway.</TE>
<TE>   The revitalized falls access is of particular significance as the
first major project of the valley restoration plan adopted by the
National Park Service in 2000 to provide a more natural, less
congested Yosemite Valley. The 1-by-7-mile valley is the heart of the
park, a natural cathedral ringed by massive rock temples such as Half
Dome and El Capitan and waterfalls including Nevada, Vernal and
Bridalveil.</TE>
<TE>   The Yosemite Fund already has raised $8.5 million for Yosemite
Falls access. The park is putting up $1.5 million and the fund must
raise an additional $2.5 million. Why doesn't the federal government
foot the full bill for this project, a Park Service priority for a
dozen years? Primarily because Congress has been shamefully
tightfisted for years despite every administration's promise to fix
or replace deteriorating national park facilities.</TE>
<TE>   So nearly 70,000 donors have dug into their pockets to improve the
park. Fund President Bob Hansen says many people develop a close
connection to Yosemite, just as they might to their college or
university. They treasure their Yosemite experiences, and they give
back. Because of this generosity, future visitors will have a more
natural and richer experience as, at the roaring base of the falls,
they are mesmerized by the throng of comets.</TE>

<LD>Alas, Americans have more to memorialize on this first Memorial Day
since Sept. 11 and the start of the war against terrorism. Founded
spontaneously by soldiers' mothers wandering empty Civil War
battlefields to mark their departed loved ones, Memorial Day has
taken on varied forms and activities over many Mays. It usually has
been associated with the military, though Memorial Day has been
celebrated more often in peacetime. It's become a day to honor those
who fell in battle, those veterans who died later and even some
individuals who had nothing to do with the armed forces.</LD>
<LD>   Memorial Day also quickly became the unofficial annual harbinger
of the summer that Labor Day would close. During long periods of
peace, Memorial Day was closely associated with the Indianapolis 500.
Even in the homes and garages of those more concerned about mowing
grass with tiny motors, radios blared urgent live reports on the
heartland's circular chase of cars with large motors until the
exhausted, exhaust-smudged winner drank milk in Victory Lane. Once
called Decoration Day, Memorial Day also was a day for peacetime
parades of veterans decorated with ribbons and medals, local fire
trucks decorated with cheerleaders and enthusiastic children on
bicycles decorated with crepe paper and flags. It was very exciting,
especially when the sirens sounded.</LD>
<TE>   But Memorial Day 2002 is different, less innocent perhaps, more
relevant for certain. This Memorial Day we have painful fresh images,
memories of deaths and losses. The shock has waned some. We still
feel sad, at times quite apprehensive. On one day, maybe even two or
three, we're obviously at war, and we follow and digest that news.
Then come days of puzzling peace apparently, when sports playoffs,
school concerts, partisan politics and celebrity sightings push the
immediate fear of terrorism out of the mind for a spell.</TE>
<TE>   Lurking beneath it all, however, is a simmering unease, a kind of
misleading calm before an uncertain storm whose shape and power we
can only imagine. The unknown or invisible is always scariest.
Officials issue vague warnings and candid admissions that all
terrorist attacks cannot be stopped and suicide bombers will someday
successfully stalk the same American streets that convey the
decorated bikes.</TE>
<TE>   Over thousands of years, many nations and cultures have succumbed
to internal and external threats. Americans have proved to be a
resilient people, taking body blows like Pearl Harbor and returning
eventually to subdue foreign military enemies.</TE>
<TE>   This Memorial Day may be less about memorializing the certain
past, its heroes and victims, as honorable and memorable as they
were, and more about conjecture on the faceless foes and the
uncertain, undefined battlefields ahead. Makes us wonder, then, how
future Memorial Days will look back on and memorialize what we do
here and now.</TE>

<LD>People who can do without more choices are going to view competition
for their local telephone service as a mixed blessing. But there's a
plus to having a choice. Long-distance service was deregulated in
1982, igniting competition that forced prices down. A call from Los
Angeles to New York often is cheaper than a call to San Francisco.
Why? Because local phone service remains a monopoly.</LD>
<LD>   That was supposed to change after 1996, when Congress passed a
telecommunications act intended to break the monopolies' hold. A
small number of states have competition. But Californians are still
waiting for lower rates and better service, largely because SBC
Pacific Bell, the state's dominant local phone company, has used its
monopoly to keep rivals out. In fact, regional monopolies across the
country are waging fierce courtroom battles to stop deregulation in
its tracks. The delaying tactics, unfortunately, are working.</LD>
<LD>   The state Public Utilities Commission did manage to take a
long-overdue step May 16 to force the market open by reducing the
fees SBC PacBell may charge competitors. Competitors must use SBC
PacBell's existing lines and switches because building new systems is
prohibitively expensive. Think of Metrolink operating passenger
trains on Burlington Northern Santa Fe tracks.</LD>
<TE>   But, a week later, a federal appeals court in Washington ordered
the Federal Communications Commission to reconsider how much access
the regional monopolies must provide to potential competitors.</TE>
<TE>   Once the path to access is smoothed, other barriers loom.
Deregulation could stress computerized processes and billing systems
as large numbers of customers begin switching providers and bitter
telecom rivals are forced to work together. But the weight of history
is with telephone deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   After the federal regulations have passed judicial muster, it will
be up to the PUC to ensure that abusive sales tactics--such as
lumping costly options packages into basic service--don't creep into
the market, consumers are switched quickly to chosen providers and
bills are accurate. After that, consumers will have to do their
homework to find bargains, just as they do with long-distance.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Terror Warnings Offer Cautionary Tale," May 23: What is behind
the recent terrorism warnings by Vice President Dick Cheney, Defense
Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and FBI Director Robert Mueller? Following
Sept. 11, any half-intelligent person had to assume that further
terrorist attacks could be expected. Absent specifics regarding time,
place and method, how are we supposed to react to the latest
warnings? They can produce no beneficial response and, in fact, have
merely served to heighten the general level of anxiety, especially in
New York City.</LD>
<LD>   It would appear that these warnings are a response to criticism of
the Bush administration for having failed to coordinate the various
pieces of information gathered by its agencies and warn the public
about impending terrorist acts. Now, in addition to being warned
about everything and anything, we are told that the terrorists will
no doubt succeed, thereby taking President Bush and company off the
hook. Whatever happened to the admonition that if we run scared, the
terrorists win?</LD>
<LD>   Michael Horstein</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's talking heads--Cheney, Rumsfeld,
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice and Mueller--have now
warned Americans of impending terrorist attacks. They have told us
who the perpetrators will be and what types of attacks we might
expect. Bush may not have had enough coordinated information to
prevent the Sept. 11 attacks, but the administration has loads more
now.</TE>
<TE>   Americans hope the Bush team is not just talking the talk but is
taking responsibility and fixing the situation. The members of the
Bush administration will have no one else to blame in the future but
themselves.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The latest line out of the White House says the FBI memo made no
difference with regard to its anti-terrorist response ("Terrorist
Ties Cited in Memo," May 23). Oh, really? After learning of the World
Trade Center attacks, didn't the passengers in the last remaining
hijacked plane turn on their hijackers because they had real
information that they were doomed unless they attempted to fight
back?</TE>
<TE>   Why wasn't airport security notched up? Were the White House and
the FAA worried about ticket sales? Upsetting powerful Arab nations?
After the first plane hit the first tower, why did they fail to
notice that other planes were being diverted off course? For some of
us this is our greatest fear--an incompetent leader when we most need
a competent one.</TE>

<TE>   I see it is dangerous to arm pilots with pistols to prevent
hijacking (May 22) but OK to have the Air Force shoot the planes down
if they are hijacked. The cure is better than prevention?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'd like to know who the sources were for your statements about
Afghanistan before the Communist takeover ("A House, a Nation
Rebuilt," May 20). There seems to be a concerted effort by the Bush
White House and its shills in the media to paint Afghanistan as some
kind of "Paris of Central Asia," as your article calls Kabul, before
the commies ruined it. I spent several years in Central Asia in the
'60s, and Kabul was not anything like Paris.</LD>
<LD>   Women were not treated the way we in the West think human beings
should be treated. They were not "dressed smartly in heels and
pillbox hats," unless you're talking about the richest 1%. I'll never
forget seeing two women get out of a car in the middle of Kabul only
to be immediately attacked and spat upon by two mullahs who looked as
if they'd stepped right out of the 14th century. And the women were
covered head to toe. These guys didn't want them out of the house. It
wasn't until the Communist takeover that this changed and women
experienced some degree of personal freedom--which was, of course,
immediately taken away when the Communists were driven from power.</LD>

<LD>"Army's New Message to Attract Recruits: Uncle 'Sim' Wants You" (May
22) states that "although interest in military careers rose after the
Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, enlistments have changed little in recent
years. And it's getting tougher to attract and retain soldiers, in
part because there are fewer veterans to regale potential recruits
with tales of their military exploits." That is an extraordinarily
naive statement.</LD>
<LD>   As one man who served in the 1960s said to me: "We should declare
the Army a subversive organization because it has made so many men
hate their own country." Thanks to the elimination of conscription,
the armed forces have had to reform, and recruits now seem to be
spared the emasculating abuse that was too common when an unlimited
supply of bodies could be enslaved. However, there are millions of
men who are determined their children will never have to endure what
they did, and for a considerable percentage of the population the
military is simply out of the question.</LD>
<LD>   The best recruiting tool would be for the government to openly
acknowledge the mistakes of the past, apologize to the men who paid
the price for them and make it clear that today's recruits are
allowed to keep their dignity and self-respect. The necessary
challenges and rigors should be presented as a means of enhancing
self-esteem, absent the brutal hazing that destroyed it.</LD>
<TE>   Every recruit needs to understand that he or she maintains
essential rights as a citizen of this nation and that the military,
in fact, enforces rules designed to maintain those rights.</TE>

<LD>Re "Exhaust Legislation May Hit a Red Light," May 21:</LD>
<LD>   If the California Assembly caves in to the automobile industry it
would be a real shame. The issue is not that the precious soccer moms
would have to drive smaller cars that are less safe; the issue is
that the automobile industry has the technology to increase fuel
efficiency even in SUVs and trucks but is unwilling to make that
investment.</LD>
<LD>   Greater fuel efficiency not only reduces greenhouse gases, it
reduces air pollution, which is unhealthy for all of us, and
depletion of limited global resources. It also reduces our dependency
on foreign oil, thus increasing our national independence and
improving our very negative trade balance.</LD>
<TE>   Elke Heitmeyer</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   To say that "greenhouse gases ... are some of the basic building
blocks of life" is like saying people need oxygen to survive. The
most important greenhouse gas is carbon dioxide. Without carbon
dioxide plants die. Without plants, animals and people die.</TE>
<TE>   Also, presumed global warming (which some data do not support)
should increase atmospheric water vapor and therefore global rain and
snow. Declining snowpacks would seem an inconsistent result. The
proposed bill is not only bad, it's stupid.</TE>

<LD>Re "Teachers Union Bosses Have Forgotten Civics Lessons," May 23:
George Skelton must be feeling good today after taking on the big and
powerful teachers union. Imagine the big union wanting teachers to
have something to say about the selection of textbooks for their
students. As if they know something about kids and how they learn.
Scandalous!</LD>
<LD>   Imagine the big union wanting a decent, barely
out-of-poverty-level salary for beginning teachers. Outrageous!
Imagine the big union wanting a decent retirement system for
teachers, when many elderly retired teachers today barely make ends
meet. What nerve!</LD>
<LD>   Finally, imagine teachers not wanting to be held accountable for
students whose parents do not much care to be involved in their kids'
education. Unbelievable!</LD>

<HD>Cathy Isford's Needless Death</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Prom-Night High Ends in Death," May 22: It was with tears and
anger that I read of the death of Cathy Isford. During my 50 years of
being a pastor, too often have I stood with my hand on the casket of
an outstanding, talented and very gifted teen and said the words of
committal. Each was lawfully and jealously protected from such
judgmental words as: "Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not lie about
others. Thou shalt not cheapen the holy gift of being co-creators
with God."</LD>
<LD>   May teens look at the beautiful picture of Isford and have the
intelligence to determine that they do not want to do as she did,
throw their lives away; the intelligence to reject a culture that
says you have to find happiness in a bottle or a pill. May her
memory, painful in the loss to her family, be also in the minds of
those intelligent enough to be tomorrow's parents, leaders and
heroes, so that they choose a different path and have the courage to
walk that path, as unpopular as it seems to be.</LD>
<LD>   W. Lee Truman</LD>
<TE>   Camarillo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another teenage tragedy, but will anyone recognize the real cause
of death, or will it just be marked as another drug overdose? Would
it have happened if she knew that alcohol and Ecstasy don't mix? Did
she ask someone and get "just say no" for an answer? Was she afraid
to seek treatment at the first sign of trouble for fear of getting
caught?</TE>
<TE>   Would Isford be here today if drug education included factual,
honest information rather than zero tolerance, zero intelligence,
zero responsibility and do-nothing, feel-good propaganda? If we had a
second chance, would we tell her something else, something that might
have saved her life, even if she didn't "just say no"?</TE>
<TE>   Jim White</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, Ohio</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My heart goes out to Isford's family and friends. It is a horrible
tragedy to lose a young woman like her. But the acceptance of using
Ecstasy by some among her family and friends, in order to "have the
best possible time she could have," and the general acceptance of the
attitude that you need some form of mood-altering drug or alcohol in
order to have a good time, contributed to her death.</TE>
<TE>   I propose a different outcome: Sister confides in sister that she
will be using Ecstasy on prom night. Sister tells mother what is
planned. Mother says no, you are not going to the prom. Everyone
involved has a really bad night that probably continues for several
weeks. Unpleasant? Yes, but where does it say in the parent manual
that came with your child that there would not be some unpleasant and
hated things you would have to do? Isford would be sitting in class
today.</TE>

<HD>Richard Mudd, 101; His Grandfather Treated John Booth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Richard D. Mudd, the patriarch who led a family crusade to
overturn the conviction of his grandfather, Dr. Samuel A. Mudd, for
aiding Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth, has died at 101. Mudd, who
took his cause to presidents, senators and the public and never gave
up, died May 21 in his Saginaw, Mich., home of causes associated with
old age.</LD>
<LD>   Even without its quixotic champion, the cause continues. In
September, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia is scheduled to hear a case Mudd filed a decade ago
contesting jurisdiction of military tribunals.</LD>
<LD>   Although Mudd and 20 other members of the more than 400
descendants of Samuel Mudd based their case on events that occurred
137 years ago, the outcome of the pending litigation has relevance in
light of President Bush's decision to hold military tribunals for
those accused of involvement in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   The Mudd family saga began at the end of the Civil War, on April
14, 1865, a Good Friday, when President Lincoln went to the Ford
Theater in Washington, D.C., and was shot at close range by actor
Booth, who then leaped from the president's box to the stage,
breaking his leg.</TE>
<TE>   About 4 a.m. the next morning, Booth and accomplice David Herold
rode up to the Bryantown, Md., farmhouse of Dr. Samuel Mudd. Although
he was a Confederate sympathizer and knew Booth, Mudd failed to
recognize him, descendants claim, because the young actor wore a
stage beard. Mudd set the broken leg, fed the two men and put them to
bed while he had his handyman make crutches. In the afternoon, he
sent them on their way.</TE>
<TE>   Mudd, his grandson always insisted, learned of the assassination
only while making rounds that Saturday. He told a relative the next
day at church that he had aided two strangers and to report the
encounter. He answered Army officials' questions over the next two
weeks and gave them Booth's discarded boot with "J. Wilkes" written
inside. Hunted down, Booth was shot to death in a tobacco barn near
Port Royal, Va., on April 26.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested for conspiracy, Mudd was tried by the Hunter Commission,
a military body created by President Andrew Johnson to address the
Lincoln assassination. On June 29, 1865, the commission found the
doctor guilty of "receiving, entertaining, harboring and concealing"
Booth and another man "with the intent to aid, abet and assist them
in escaping from justice after the assassination."</TE>
<TE>   Three men and a woman were hanged in the conspiracy case, but Mudd
escaped death by one vote. He and three others were sentenced to life
in prison. Mudd was sent to a federal prison in the Dry Tortugas, 65
miles off the tip of Key West, Fla. After he thwarted an 1867 yellow
fever epidemic on the island, all 299 surviving prisoners and guards
petitioned Johnson to pardon Mudd, a pardon and commutation of
sentence granted Feb. 8, 1869.</TE>
<TE>   Weakened by the disease himself, Mudd returned to his farm and his
medical practice but died of pneumonia in 1883 at the age of 50.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Mudd, born Jan. 24, 1901, in a Washington, D.C., that was
still skittish about Civil War memories, took up his quest at 17.
Curious because neither his physician father nor other close
relatives ever mentioned his grandfather, the youth one day
discovered in the family library a book his Aunt Nettie had written
about "Dr. Sam."</TE>
<TE>   As he pursued degrees in history and medicine at Georgetown
University, Richard Mudd became determined to clear the name of the
famous skeleton in his family closet. Presidential pardon wasn't good
enough; he wanted the conviction overturned and the record corrected.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I was going to be a doctor, and here was a doctor setting
a man's broken leg and getting put in prison for it," he told The
Times in 1991. "I just couldn't get away from it."</TE>
<TE>   Mudd was a flight surgeon in the Army Air Corps, later the Air
Force, in both World War II and Korea and worked as an industrial
physician at several General Motors automobile plants.</TE>
<TE>   When he was 50, he published a 22-year effort, the two-volume,
1,465-page "Mudd Family of the United States." Continuing to update
the work, he found in his extensive genealogical research that the
family, which was of English origin, with roots in America going back
to 1665, tallied 21 Mudds who fought in the American Revolution, and,
uncannily, another 21 who fought for the Union and 21 who fought for
the Confederacy in the Civil War. He also found 50 doctors, including
his grandfather, his father and himself, and such well-known
relatives as television newsman Roger Mudd.</TE>
<TE>   As he studied the family, Richard inspired other members to join
him in his quest to overturn the conviction of Samuel Mudd. His first
cousin, Louise Mudd Arehart, who died March 11 at age 84, succeeded
in having "Dr. Sam's" Maryland home added to the National Register of
Historic Places in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Richard devoted himself to the grandfather's reputation. He
distributed thousands of "Save Dr. Mudd" bumper stickers and
T-shirts, petitioned the Postal Service for a Dr. Mudd stamp and
appeared on the TV quiz show "To Tell the Truth."</TE>
<TE>   With somewhat more success, he wrote legislators and top
politicians. His efforts persuaded the state legislatures of
Maryland, Michigan, Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Florida to declare
Samuel Mudd innocent of conspiracy.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, President Carter wrote him a two-page letter supporting
his position about Samuel Mudd's innocence but adding that
regrettably he "had been advised [that] the findings of guilt and the
sentence of a military commission that tried Dr. Samuel Mudd are
binding and conclusive judgments and there is no authority under the
law, by which, I, as president, could set aside his conviction."</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, President Reagan in his own note echoed a president's
legal inability to change a military court ruling, and commented: "In
my efforts to help, I came to believe as you do that Dr. Samuel Mudd
was indeed innocent of any wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, in 1992, Mudd applied to the Army Board for Correction of
Military Records, arguing that his grandfather was innocent and that
the military Hunter Commission had lacked jurisdiction over the
civilian doctor.</TE>
<TE>   The board said it had no authority to decide guilt, but agreed
that the 1865 commission had lacked jurisdiction and urged the Army
to set aside Samuel Mudd's conviction. The Army refused, and Richard
Mudd and his relatives sued. After a couple more setbacks in the
trial court and with the Army, the case is now before the federal
appellate court--without its instigator.</TE>
<TE>   The crusading Richard Mudd, who abandoned handball at age 90 but
continued daily exercise sessions for years after that, regularly led
history tours to the Dry Tortugas, where a plaque has honored his
grandfather since 1961.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote a dozen scientific papers and books.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by six of his seven children, 35 grandchildren and
more than two dozen great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Philip Newman, 85; Judge, Legal Advocate for the Poor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip M. Newman, a former Los Angeles County Municipal and Superior
Court judge who worked to provide legal services to the poor and to
foster good relations with his native Mexico, has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Newman died Wednesday in Los Angeles of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   In 1981, after nearly 18 years on the bench, Newman surprised the
judiciary by announcing that he would not seek reelection because of
what he called the "politicizing and demeaning of the judiciary by
pressure groups, politicians and some of the media."</LD>
<TE>   He made the decision to return to the practice of law when his
term ended the following year, even though he was two years short of
the minimum 20-years service and five years short of the 70-year age
line to receive the maximum judicial pension.</TE>
<TE>   That was an era when various factions began challenging the
tradition of reelecting judges without any campaign opposition. Once
appointed--as most are to fill terms left vacant by
retirement--judges had previously enjoyed serving until they chose to
leave, with little need to raise campaign funds or curry voter
attention.</TE>
<TE>   But increasing unrest over courts in the late 1970s and early
1980s prompted a spate of candidates challenging judicial incumbents
for their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Denying that he had any personal complaints, Newman quoted former
state appellate Justice Robert Thompson, who warned that typical
political fund-raising and campaigning could compromise a judge's
decisions. "A judge should be accountable to decisions of higher
courts, mandates of the Legislature and, most importantly, to his own
conscience," Thompson had said, "and not to public opinion or
popularity polls."</TE>
<TE>   Newman returned to the practice of law in 1982 and later became a
private judge, a procedure in which litigants pay a qualified arbiter
to decide a case quickly and behind closed doors.</TE>
<TE>   He responded to the criticism that the "rent-a-judge" method
excludes poorer litigants by telling the Christian Science Monitor in
1988: "I can't think of any party having anything to lose by becoming
involved in this court system."</TE>
<TE>   Named to the Municipal Court in 1964 by Gov. Pat Brown, Newman
handled traffic cases, small claims, and minor civil and criminal
cases, including several arrests for anti-Vietnam War demonstrations.</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues on the then 64-judge court elected him presiding judge
in 1975, and in August of that year, he was elevated to the Superior
Court by Gov. Jerry Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Newman was considered an even-handed, get-it-right judge, often
commenting: "There are three sides to every story--the plaintiff's
side, the defendant's side, and the truth."</TE>
<TE>   Newman was born in Mexico City, and at the age of 10 moved with
his family to Los Angeles. He graduated from Santa Monica College,
USC and Pacific Coast University School of Law before serving in the
Coast Guard in World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Joining the law practice of his father and brother in 1945, he
served as consulting attorney to the consul general of Mexico in Los
Angeles until he took the bench. Mayor Tom Bradley named him chairman
of the Los Angeles-Mexico City Sister City Committee in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   Interested in promoting legal services for the poor and relations
with Mexico, Newman served as president of the Immigration and
Naturalization Lawyers Assn. and as president of the Mexican-American
Scholarship Foundation for Careers in Law. He earned a judicial
service award from the Council of Mexican-American Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   In 1966, Newman was named by President Lyndon B. Johnson to the
National Advisory Committee of the Neighborhood Legal Services
program in the Office of Economic Opportunity, and served for six
years. He was a founding member and legal counsel of the Community
Service Organization and vice president, secretary and director of
the Youth Opportunities Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   Newman frequently spoke on Latino problems in conferences at the
White House and before Cabinet committees. In 1974, he was chosen one
of 52 outstanding Spanish-speaking Americans by a publication
sponsored by Carnation and Times-Mirror (former parent company of The
Times).</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1998 by the death of his wife of 54 years, Antoinette,
Newman is survived by three children, Kathryn, John and Paul; a
sister, Ana Maria Perez; and three grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to Jobs
for the Future at Dolores Mission Parish, 171 S. Gless St., Los
Angeles, CA 90033.</TE>

<HD>Taco Bell Heir Serves Up More Convenient, Easier Way to
Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Skelton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Rob McKay could have used his Taco Bell zillions to travel the globe,
dining on the finest cuisines. Instead, he went to places like Watts
to nourish struggling communities. Now he's taking the next logical
step by making it easier for people to vote.</LD>
<LD>   That's a logical progression, the philanthropist says, because
charity and volunteerism often can carry a cause only so far. Real,
substantive change usually comes from the ballot box. People help
themselves by voting.</LD>
<LD>   "As I came to better understand the political landscape in
California, I was dismayed by the lack of voter participation," says
the son of the man who built the Taco Bell chain.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot of people say we just have to live with low voter turnout.
I disagree."</TE>
<TE>   McKay is financing a November ballot initiative that would allow
people to register to vote at their polling place on election day.
Six states currently have election-day registration: Idaho, Maine,
Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   A study by political scientists R. Michael Alvarez of Caltech and
Stephen Ansolabehere of MIT found that election-day registration
increases voter turnouts by 3 to 6 percentage points. In California,
they concluded, turnouts could rise by perhaps 9 points because
people here tend to be younger and move more--and don't get around to
registering.</TE>
<TE>   California's turnout in the March primary was embarrassing for a
supposed enlightened state: only 24.6% of voting-age citizens, and a
historically low 34.6% of those registered.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, the primary was too early. Republican candidates for
governor were uninspiring, and there was no Democratic contest. But
low turnouts have been the trend in recent elections.</TE>
<TE>   So up steps McKay, 37, of San Francisco, who manages his family's
philanthropic foundation and venture capital investments. Now he
wants also to be an election reformer.</TE>
<TE>   McKay spent $1.5 million gathering signatures to qualify his
measure for the ballot. (The signatures have been submitted, but not
yet verified.) He plans on kicking in up to $8 million for the
campaign. "There'll be serious funding."</TE>
<TE>   The family fortune comes from his father, Robert McKay, who as a
Sherman Oaks architect was hired to design a fast-food restaurant for
Glen Bell. McKay Sr. created those distinctive arches and the
roof-top bell. In 1964, he was brought in to run Taco Bell and
ultimately expanded the company from one restaurant in Torrance to
roughly 1,400 nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Taco Bell was sold to PepsiCo in 1978, and the McKays became very
rich.</TE>
<TE>   Skip ahead to 1992. The McKays established their foundation aimed
at helping community groups committed to economic development,
faith-based organizing, a "living wage" and the like. Then
South-Central L.A. erupted in riot.</TE>
<TE>   "My rude awakening to philanthropy was walking the streets around
Florence and Normandie with National Guard escorts," he recalls. His
foundation soon donated to several local organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "But there's a limit to what charities can do," he says. "You also
have to think about political strategy."</TE>
<TE>   A successful political strategy requires voter participation.</TE>
<TE>   McKay insists this is not a Democratic Trojan horse. It's
bipartisan. He's a Democrat, but "not in the sense of being a rah-rah
partisan."</TE>
<TE>   The co-drafters of the initiative are two prominent political
lawyers: Republican Vigo G. "Chip" Nielsen and Democrat Lance Olson.
The lead consultants are Republican Donna Lucas and Democrat Gale
Kaufman.</TE>
<TE>   But, in reality, this is bound to benefit Democratic causes,
because people who don't vote tend to side with Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Many political pros will moan, because they like to identify
probable voters long before the election and inundate them with
misleading mail and nuisance calls. This would keep the electorate a
mystery until polls closed.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, the registration deadline was 29 days before the
election. It got shortened to 15 days, which county registrars hate.
McKay's proposal would return the mail registration deadline to 29
days, but allow walk-in sign-ups on election day.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents will squawk about potential fraud. But this measure
strengthens current fraud protections and requires proof of residence
for election-day registrants.</TE>
<TE>   Walk-in registration is logical. People should not be denied their
democratic right just because they didn't sign up early to vote. They
should be allowed to get inspired at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   And no, he insists, "this is not a gambit to introduce Rod McKay
to California politics. This is not a springboard."</TE>
<TE>   We'll see. For now, this is the son of a fast-food pioneer trying
to market one-stop, fast-voting in a state that can really use it.</TE>

<HD>Ban on Coyote Trapping Under Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a surge in complaints about coyotes prowling residential
neighborhoods, the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission is
expected to decide Tuesday whether to drop or modify the city's ban
on trapping the animals.</LD>
<LD>   A city staff report recommends that the commission continue the
trapping ban and hire two additional animal control officers to teach
homeowners how to discourage coyotes from coming into yards and
neighborhoods.</LD>
<LD>   "The emphasis is going to be to go out in the community and help
people help themselves," said Jerry Greenwalt, general manager of the
Department of Animal Regulation. "Trapping coyotes is going to be the
very last resort."</LD>
<TE>   The new animal control officers would boost an education program
that is already part of city policy but is difficult to carry out
because the department is short-handed, Greenwalt said. The policy
calls for officers to visit homes to see if anything might be
attracting coyotes--outdoor pet dishes, uncovered garbage cans, dense
brush, fruit fallen from trees--and suggest removal.</TE>
<TE>   That approach doesn't sit well with Patrick Kennedy, a West Hills
resident whose dog survived a nighttime mauling last winter only
because Kennedy charged into his backyard and wrestled the miniature
pinscher away from the coyote. He wants the animals trapped.</TE>
<TE>   "They tell you it's a wild animal and they don't go after wild
animals," said Kennedy, a grounds supervisor for the city Recreation
and Parks Department. "Coyotes in a residential neighborhood should
be trapped and removed, just like they do for any other wild dog."</TE>
<TE>   A coyote with a dead cat in its mouth recently acted aggressively
toward his son, who is 6 feet tall, he said.</TE>
<TE>   City and state officials say months of dry weather have driven
food sources--rodents and other small mammals--out of the foothills
to find water, and the coyotes have followed. The hungry animals see
pets as easy meals.</TE>
<TE>   Although attacks on humans are rare, the California Department of
Fish and Game says the number reported in Southern California
increased from three in 2000 to 17 in 2001. Fatal attacks are nearly
unheard of, and officials believe the last one in the Los Angeles
area occurred in about 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Defenders of coyotes, including a group called Citizens for a
Humane Los Angeles, say trapping is ineffective and people must learn
to coexist with the animals. They also say the additional $75,000
requested for two new animal control officers would be better spent
on programs to prevent animal cruelty or spay and neuter pets. About
70,000 unwanted dogs and cats are euthanized yearly by Los Angeles
shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "I can certainly understand the concern of homeowners," said
Sherrie Woodbury, a member of the group. But many of the people
complaining about the animals live very close to wilderness areas and
can't realistically expect wildlife to disappear, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Bell, an Encino resident, said the burden should be on
homeowners to protect their pets. "Pets are personal property. I
don't see why my tax money should go to protecting someone else's
property. They should properly fence their properties and cover their
garbage" to deter coyotes, he said.</TE>
<TE>   City policy bars animal control officers from trapping coyotes
unless the animals are sick, injured or have bitten someone and must
be tested for rabies. A "really aggressive" coyote can be trapped by
animal control officers, Greenwalt said, but an animal roaming around
is not considered aggressive. Captured animals are euthanized.</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Animal Regulation agrees with coyote defenders
that trapping does no good. "There are places all over the country
where these programs have been tried, and they've killed off hundreds
of them, and the next year they're back in the same numbers,"
Greenwalt said.</TE>
<TE>   He sympathizes with people who fear for the safety of kids.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had small children, I'd be concerned about leaving them in
my backyard. But if they're that small, maybe they shouldn't be left
unsupervised," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Attacks on people by domesticated dogs are far more common than
coyote attacks, officials say. In Los Angeles, about 70,000 dog bites
are reported annually, an average of about 190 a day, according to
Department of Animal Regulation spokeswoman Jackie David. Of those,
55,000 are attacks on children under age 12.</TE>
<TE>   OnWednesday, David said, a 4-year-old girl was badly mauled by a
loose dog while crossing a street in the North Hills area with a
caregiver.</TE>

<HD>Developers Are Putting Southland's Last Dairy Farmers Out

<DH>Real estate: In 20 years, area's 350,000 Holsteins will be

<LD>For now, the cows still vastly outnumber the newcomers in the Chino
basin. They recline on 20-foot piles of manure, gazing placidly at
billboards touting "25 New Neighborhoods."</LD>
<LD>   But as developers scan the region for space, they are rapidly
discovering the 50 square miles of dairy lands situated among four
freeways straddling San Bernardino and Riverside counties. Home to
350,000 Holsteins--which the Milk Producers Council in Ontario touts
as the densest such population on Earth--the dairy farms are
surrounded by urban development.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the hole in the doughnut," said Otto Kroutil, Ontario's
director of development. "This area is very strategically placed,
with access to a lot of urban centers."</LD>
<TE>   The largest home-building companies in Southern California agree
and are rapidly moving to buy up land. Over the next two decades,
dairy and development industry experts say, the region's dairy lands
will replaced by 200,000 new residents living in as many as 71,000
new homes.</TE>
<TE>   "What do they say about real estate? Location, location,
location," said Jerry Gates, regional president of Beazer Homes, the
nation's sixth-largest home builder, which built the first
subdivision here two years ago. "This is a great location to live in.
It has good freeway access, it's a relatively affordable area where
we can ... develop in a price range that is desirable to the many,
many people who need housing in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Ontario alone has annexed more than 8,000 acres of the dairy lands
for 31,000 homes and 10 million square feet of industrial and
commercial space for a huge planned community to be called New Model
Colony. Riverside County's Eastvale section will see an additional
30,000 homes and Chino will gain 10,000, all on sites of current
dairy operations, according to Craig Atkins of O'Donnell Atkins,
which describes itself as the state's largest land broker.</TE>
<TE>   It will take time to piece together parcels large enough for
master-planned housing tracts because there is no single,
large-property owner. Instead, hundreds of lifelong farmers, most of
them third-generation Dutch, Portuguese and Basque immigrant
families, said they are considering selling because of rising land
values and environmental crackdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the farmland lacks roads, sewers and other costly
infrastructure. There are also problems buried beneath new home lots,
like the cow carcasses and potentially explosive pockets of methane
created by manure.</TE>
<TE>   But signs of change are evident. Bulldozers and soccer moms in
SUVs mingle with tractors and milk trucks on Eastvale area streets.</TE>
<TE>   New residents rely on fluorescent bug zappers discreetly installed
in designer kitchens to kill persistent flies and keep their windows
closed when the stench is too strong.</TE>
<TE>   Some Don't Appreciate All Parts of Country Life</TE>
<TE>   "Cows stink," said Brian Shaffer, who bought a 3,000-square-foot
home for about $257,000 two years ago in Corona Valley, the first
planned community in Eastvale. "I know they were here first, but I
can't wait till they're gone."</TE>
<TE>   Three blocks away, dairyman Ben Goedhart Jr., 23, has always loved
to gaze at the far-off twinkling lights of city life while doing the
predawn milking of his family's 2,300 cows. Those lights are around
the corner now. Already his parents have sold off 40 of their 160
acres, land which has been in the family for three generations.
Within a year, they will move north to 1,000 acres in Bakersfield,
where they are building a state-of-the-art dairy farm.</TE>
<TE>   The Goedharts have seen traffic in front of their driveway thicken
from a trickle to a rush-hour snarl. They watch, amused, as new
neighbors in minivans pull up to snap pictures of the cows.</TE>
<TE>   A more serious issue has been the $35,000 in fines they have had
to pay in the last few years to the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality
Control Board. Farmers said they are wrongly being blamed for
polluted urban runoff entering the area's waterways; they blame
earlier housing and commercial development to the north and east.</TE>
<TE>   "Pavement, roofs and sidewalks in [Rancho] Cucamonga have flooded
out our farmers," said Bob Feenstra of the Milk Producers' Council.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Thibeault, executive officer of the water board, said both
the older development and the dairies contribute to the runoff, which
flows down the Santa Ana River into the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   Feenstra is fighting on half a dozen fronts to keep some dairy
farms: protesting fines levied by regional water boards and hooking
up cattle operations to sewer lines, for instance. Although most of
the farms will eventually sell out, some will hang on for a while
longer, he said, if only because environmentalists in Kern, Tulare
and King counties have filed lawsuits to stop the expansion of dairy
operations, which they claim cause pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't build new dairies, so where do we move?" asked Feenstra.
But with developers willing to pay $60,000 to $120,000 an acre,
dozens of local farmers are selling out and heading to Oregon,
Illinois, Iowa and even to Mexico--anywhere there is still land for
cattle. Milk prices should not be affected, Feenstra said.</TE>
<TE>   This is the third time the region's dairy farmers will be on the
move. After World War II, they were pushed out of Paramount and
Bellflower by demand for housing. They relocated to Cerritos, then
called Dairy Valley, and to La Palma, known as the Dairyland. In the
1970s, farmers were pushed into the Chino basin.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as the region's last dairy center dwindles, potentially
dangerous reminders of its heyday grow.</TE>
<TE>   One new home buyer relocated to a hotel for a while last August
after a contractor unearthed several cow carcasses in her backyard.
Elsewhere, decades' worth of manure has created underground pockets
of flammable, potentially explosive methane gas. Some early buyers
were not allowed to move into their new homes because of the methane
problem.</TE>
<TE>   Open Land Comes With Unique Problems</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, there's this huge open space that is dairy land.
If you're a developer, you see an opportunity to build, to make
money," said Thomas Ingram, director of building and safety for
Riverside County. "But it's all full of cows. Well, cows eat and
poop, that's what they do.... It created a [methane] problem we never
realized was there."</TE>
<TE>   Ingram halted home construction on former dairy farms in mid-2000
until new rules could be written for testing and alleviating the
problem.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium was lifted a few months later, after developers
agreed to test land where there had previously been feedlots and to
pay for pumping, venting and other removal of methane.</TE>
<TE>   According to state standards, methane becomes flammable at 55,000
parts per million. If it has no place to vent, it can build up and
explode if ignited. Inspectors have found "hot spots" as high as
700,000 ppm under or near the new Eastvale homes. Elaborate leaching,
pumping and venting systems have been installed on the dozen or so
homes that had already been sold, and placed underground at future
home sites.</TE>
<TE>   Tom and Janice Dufloth were among the first to put down a $100,000
deposit on a new "executive-style" home in early 2000. But the night
before the moving van was to arrive, their sales agent called to tell
them they could only unload in the garage, not move in, the couple
said. The Dufloths and their five cats camped out with a relative in
a rented apartment.</TE>
<TE>   After three months, they said, they learned there was methane
under their home. Beazer Homes ultimately returned their money, but
not the 6% interest the Dufloths said they had been promised, or
$10,000 reimbursement for their moving, custom painting and other
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Gates, the Beazer regional president, said the company was caught
off guard by the discovery of methane, and that his staff had done
its best to keep the affected families informed. He said the company
had also incurred unexpected additional costs of up to $6,000 per
home to deal with the methane problem, and that the Dufloths' and
other families' purchase agreements stated that the company could not
cover costs for such unexpected delays.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a hard-working, honest organization," Gates said. "In that
situation we were hamstrung. We did the best we could."</TE>
<TE>   Since the methane-control program was put in place, hundreds more
new homes have sprung up.</TE>
<TE>   Roddie Lee, who bought a 3,000-square-foot home for $250,000 two
years ago from Beazer Homes, said he is not bothered by the methane
pumps and vents poking out of his backyard and roof. He said they are
regularly inspected, and he is not worried. "In Anaheim Hills, a
house like this would cost half-a-million dollars," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lee has mixed feelings about the farms leaving. "It's sad to see
one industry go and another one taking over," he said, "but that's
the story of Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   Dairyman Goedhart is fatalistic about the need for cows to give
way to houses: "Thirty years from now, I expect I'll be selling the
land in Bakersfield for houses and moving the cows somewhere else."</TE>

<HD>Man Dies of Injuries in Encino Explosion</HD>
<DH>Fire: Tenant believed to have sparked gas blast in
apartment complex had burns to 60% of his body.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Encino man died Sunday of burn-related injuries suffered in a
fiery explosion that tore through his apartment building after he
apparently disconnected a gas line to fix a stove and then ignited
the gas by lighting a cigarette.</LD>
<LD>   Dennis Cohen, 47, died about 11:15 a.m. at Grossman Burn Center in
Sherman Oaks from injuries suffered in Friday's accident, said Lysa
Barry, a hospital spokeswoman.</LD>
<LD>   "According to Dr. Peter Grossman, the patient passed away ...
despite all efforts, due to burn shock and sepsis," Barry said.</LD>
<TE>   Sepsis, a bacterial infection of the bloodstream that burn victims
are susceptible to, strikes about 750,000 Americans each year,
killing 225,000 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen suffered second- and third-degree burns to about 60% of his
body in the blast that ripped through the 130-unit complex, Barry
said. "Any time you suffer 50% burns, it is really tough to pull
through," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen was described by hospital officials as unmarried and
childless. A man who identified himself at the hospital as Cohen's
best friend said Cohen was born in New York and moved to Los Angeles
in the early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The man, who spoke to a reporter Saturday, said Cohen was home on
disability leave and had few family members in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Before Cohen's death, Los Angeles City Fire Chief William Bamattre
said the apartment tenant told investigators Friday and Saturday that
he may have sparked the explosion while working on a stove.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen told investigators he disconnected the gas pipe, went to the
bathroom and then lighted a cigarette when he returned.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion turned 10 apartments to rubble and damaged dozens of
others.</TE>
<TE>   None of the apartment building's 300 other residents suffered
serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators had planned to further interview Cohen, who before
his death was described as in extreme pain, heavily sedated and in
need of major surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Bamattre said there was nothing to suggest the fire was caused by
anything other than a gas line explosion. Accelerant-sniffing dogs
did not detect anything unusual.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles police investigators said the gas pipe was found
disconnected in Cohen's second-story, one-bedroom apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Collis, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman, said the
investigation will continue.</TE>
<TE>   None of the tenants will be allowed to occupy their apartments for
at least a week.</TE>
<TE>   The city Department of Building and Safety is expected in the next
few days to determine whether the building is safe to enter.</TE>

<HD>County Agrees to More Foster Care Visits</HD>
<DH>Children: Department will comply with court order, making
it harder for social workers to obtain waivers on the face-to-face
checks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After resisting for years, Los Angeles County officials are gearing up to
ensure that social workers visit children in foster care at least once a
month.</LD>
<LD>   County Department of Children and Family Services officials said
they will comply with a court order mandating the frequent visits
that was recently upheld by the state Supreme Court after two years
of legal battles with child-safety advocates.</LD>
<LD>   About 50,000 abused and neglected children in the care of the
county are covered by the order. Anita Bock, director of the
department, said the change will be a "major reform journey."</LD>
<TE>   In the past, when social workers felt visits were unnecessary,
they could get a waiver from a supervisor. The new rules mean that no
waivers can be granted unless social workers submit a detailed report
supporting the conclusion that the child is in a stable, safe
environment, and a judge agrees.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit, filed by the Alliance for Children's Rights two years
ago, maintained that social workers weren't visiting foster children
enough--as infrequently as every two years--and that waiver records
were not kept, said Amy Pellman, executive director of the alliance.</TE>
<TE>   County lawyers argued that filing reports would be a burden
on 1,800 social workers. They said individual hearings could be
scheduled if needed.</TE>
<TE>   The department oversees more foster children than in any other
county in the nation, followed by New York County (Manhattan) with
about 32,000, according to the National Assn. of Counties.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting children in foster care has become more of a concern
nationwide, especially since 5-year-old Rilya Wilson of Miami was
discovered missing a few weeks ago. She was last seen more than 15
months ago and is still missing. Her caseworker resigned after
allegedly falsifying records to make it appear that she had been
visiting the child regularly.</TE>
<TE>   "The more eyes on these kids ... there's a better chance abuse
will not take place," said Daniel Grunfeld, president of Public
Counsel, which provides free legal assistance to children. "We're
dealing with the most vulnerable children of our community."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County used to employ waivers to avoid visits more
than any other county in the state, according to Alice Bussiere, a
staff attorney with the Youth Law Center in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Two other counties, Alameda and San Francisco, were forced to
reform after state audits showed that they too were lagging in the
frequency of home visits, according to Larry Bolton, general counsel
for the state Department of Social Services.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, restrictions on the use of waivers were
recommended in 1998 by a blue-ribbon task force on foster care that
was created after a spate of deaths of foster children. A county
grand jury also criticized the practice, urging improvements in the
way the agency tracked the well-being of children in its care.</TE>
<TE>   Since the criticism and the lawsuit, Bock said, she has instituted
sweeping changes in record keeping. Now quarterly reports are
compiled. Waiver requests are reviewed by committees in each of the
department's eight regions and then considered by another panel after
interviews with the child and foster family are conducted, Bock said.
"The new process is a little labor intensive," she said. "We had to
go a little above and beyond what was necessary."</TE>
<TE>   Those changes have added a substantial amount of time to the
process of reviewing waiver applications, Bock said. According to
department records from October to December 2001, 69 waivers were in
effect, a marked decline from before the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   On May 15, the state Supreme Court rebuffed the county's
last appeal and declined to interfere with Los Angeles County Superior
Court Judge Terry B. Friedman's order that every waiver granted must
go through a hearing process--the first time such an order has been
made in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit has made it extremely hard for social workers to get
waivers, said Harold Walker, administrator for the county chapter of
Service Employees International Union Local 535, which includes
county social workers. Walker said one social worker was unable to
get a waiver for a student who excelled in school and was bound for
Stanford University.</TE>
<TE>   Pellman of the Alliance for Children's Rights said that if the
department had only 69 waivers late last year, then taking all cases
to court should not be a tremendous burden. "The best approach is to
follow the court's order and see how onerous it is on the department
and see how helpful it is for the children," she said. "To change an
order that hasn't been implemented makes no sense to me."</TE>
<TE>   The alliance said social workers were using the waivers as a
work-reduction mechanism, which Bock denies.</TE>
<TE>   "The social worker is supposed to develop a relationship with the
child," Pellman said. "If they see that person only so often, they're
not going to feel comfortable disclosing the abuse they've endured."</TE>
<TE>   That's exactly what 16-year-old Alan says happened to him. For
nine years Alan, whose last name is being withheld because he is a
minor, lived with a physically abusive foster mother, his biological
brother and four other children. Alan remembers watching the woman
dunk his brother's head in the toilet when he asked for a drink of
water. The children were allowed only three-minute showers.</TE>
<TE>   "If we were there any longer, she would turn off the main
valve and open the door," Alan said. "I just couldn't take it anymore;
I just started running away."</TE>
<TE>   A social worker came to visit once a year, but mostly talked to
the foster mother, Alan said. "I thought it was normal to not get
visits from the social worker," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bock said she knows of no cases in which children were harmed
because of infrequent social worker visits. "Since the day this suit
was filed, I repeatedly extended an invitation to anybody who knew of
a case where children have been harmed," she said. "No one came
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Pellman said there are countless instances in which children are
in danger. "So should we wait until a child is hurt before we start
instituting regular visits?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Alan no longer lives with the abusive foster mother. These days
his social worker visits once a month, but he would like to see her
more often. "She just asks if I'm doing all right," he said. "I just
don't feel safe talking to her."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Is Fined for Conduct in Bias Lawsuit</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge orders the EEOC to pay $386,000 to a Pasadena
law firm that the federal agency unsuccessfully sued for sex
discrimination.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accusing the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission of
"unreasonable and just plain mean-spirited" conduct, a judge has
ordered the agency to pay $386,000 to a law firm that it sued
unsuccessfully for sexual harassment and discrimination.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian issued the order earlier
this month after dismissing the EEOC's class-action suit against
Robert L. Reeves &amp; Associates, an immigration law firm in Pasadena
with about 40 employees. In awarding attorney fees and court costs to
the firm--the largest ever assessed against the EEOC--Tevrizian
invoked a rarely used sanction in civil rights law that allows judges
to compensate defendants who are targeted by lawsuits that are
"frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation."</LD>
<LD>   Anna Y. Park, EEOC regional attorney in Los Angeles, disputed
Tevrizian's characterization of the case, saying the allegations
against Reeves were corroborated by numerous witnesses. She said an
appeal is being considered.</LD>
<TE>   The EEOC is charged with enforcing federal law prohibiting
employers from discriminating on the basis of race, color, religion,
sex or national origin.</TE>
<TE>   The agency, which files 300 to 400 workplace discrimination suits
a year, has been assessed attorney fees and court costs only four
times since 1999, according to the agency's public affairs office in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   This case involved allegations that 12 female employees, including
attorneys and secretaries, were sexually harassed by Reeves or were
fired because they were pregnant. Several women complained that they
were subjected to inappropriate touching, leering and sexual remarks.
Reeves denied the allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Tevrizian wrote in his May 6 order that the EEOC could have
pursued three of those claims as potentially valid. Instead, he said,
the agency brought a class action on behalf of a dozen women, "four
of whose claims it knew had absolutely no foundation, and five others
which it knew or should have known were groundless."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, he dismissed all of the claims, saying they did not
rise to the level of misconduct under the law. In sexual harassment
suits, a plaintiff must show that the wrongdoing was so severe or
pervasive that it gave rise to a hostile work environment.</TE>
<TE>   While dismissing the case on legal grounds, Tevrizian wrote that
he wanted it understood that he did not condone any of the acts of
sexual harassment alleged in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Tevrizian also criticized the agency for its tactics in the case,
which he described as "heavy-handed and out of bounds."</TE>
<TE>   By law, the commission is required to make a good-faith effort to
resolve cases through conciliation. But Tevrizian said the EEOC laid
down conditions that doomed the conciliation process from the start.</TE>
<TE>   The commission, he said, demanded $1 million in compensatory and
punitive damages to settle the case, but at the same time it refused
to disclose the names of the alleged victims or details of their
complaints.</TE>
<TE>   When the law firm balked, the judge said, the EEOC pronounced the
conciliation a failure and took the case to court.</TE>
<TE>   Tevrizian found that the agency continued to withhold information
about its case even after being ordered to disclose by a federal
magistrate. Tevrizian also accused the EEOC of filing a claim on
behalf of a law firm employee who had never complained of being
mistreated.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Park maintained that the allegations against
Reeves were thoroughly investigated. She said Tevrizian failed to
look at the case in its entirety.</TE>
<TE>   "In sexual harassment cases, you have to look at the totality of
the circumstances," she said. "Instead, the judge piecemealed them
out. That goes against U.S. Supreme Court precedent."</TE>
<TE>   The EEOC attorney said Tevrizian also failed to take into account
that all of the complaints were directed against Reeves, the owner
and most powerful person in the law firm.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the theory of our case, and it was completely
disregarded by the court," Park said.</TE>
<TE>   The EEOC began an investigation in 1997 after receiving a
complaint from a former receptionist who said she was fired because
she became pregnant. Reeves' firm said she was terminated because of
poor performance.</TE>
<TE>   The case remained dormant until 1999, when two other female
employees filed harassment complaints. Both were close friends of two
lawyers who had left the firm in a bitter dispute with Reeves.</TE>
<TE>   In court papers, Reeves accused his former associates, Daniel P.
Hanlon and Colin T. Greene, of getting the women to make the sexual
harassment claims in an effort to ruin his reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Hanlon, who was interviewed by the EEOC, called Reeves' charge
ludicrous. Tevrizian gave credence to Reeves' account, however.</TE>
<TE>   "See, I look at this case as one where the EEOC was used by
departing partners of the law firm," the judge said, according to a
court transcript.</TE>
<TE>   "Duped? that's absurd," Park said. She said the EEOC received
complaints about Reeves' conduct from women who had nothing to do
with his former partners.</TE>

<HD>Alatorre Looks Forward to End of House Detention</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the peak of his Los Angeles City Council career, Richard Alatorre
could be found on any given night at political events and social
soirees all over the city.</LD>
<LD>   So it has been a humbling experience these last eight months.
Alatorre has been under house detention for evading income tax in
1996 on $42,000 in payments from people who sought political
influence.</LD>
<LD>   Alatorre's sentence ends Friday, and he is looking forward to
having more freedom to go about his life.</LD>
<TE>   "It was very difficult, because you are really limited in what you
can do," he said. "I accepted responsibility when I was put under
house detention, and I'm glad it's over."</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of his sentence, Alatorre was required to wear an
electronic monitoring device 24 hours a day and was permitted to
leave his home only to go to work or buy groceries--as well as
getting special permission for a few other forays. Other than that,
he's been home, working from there.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working and I'm going to continue to do some consulting
work," Alatorre said. He declined to identify clients, saying only
that he provides advice to businesses.</TE>
<TE>   Alatorre served in the state Assembly from 1973 to 1985, and on
the City Council from 1985 until 1999.</TE>
<TE>   He is still angry over losing two consulting contracts--one with
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and the other with
Compton College--which he blames partly on publicity in The Times. "I
just want to stay below the fray," Alatorre said.</TE>
<TE>   Former Foes Join Simon Campaign</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan tanked at the polls in
the gubernatorial primary, but his fund-raising ability apparently
impressed Republican winner Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Simon last week hired a bunch of former top Riordan aides to get
his campaign into second gear.</TE>
<TE>   Among those appointed to his campaign team were Charissa Abbay,
who was deputy finance director for Riordan's gubernatorial campaign;
Kristen Hueter, who also did fund-raising for Riordan's primary
campaign; and Alice Borden, Riordan's finance chief for his city
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Simon also appointed former Riordan aide Fred Beteta as deputy
campaign manager.</TE>
<TE>   The appointments appear to be paying dividends already. Hueter and
Borden coordinated Simon's recent Los Angeles and Silicon Valley
fund-raisers featuring President Bush. The events raised a combined
$4.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Surfing Into Some Cyber Surprises</TE>
<TE>   Internet surfers who think they are going to get the party line
when they type in voteforgray davis.com are in for a surprise. What
they find is a picture of Davis next to a corporate logo for Enron.</TE>
<TE>   The site goes on to criticize Davis for accepting campaign
contributions from Enron before the firm filed for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' Republican challenger in the November election does no
better on the Web site votebill simon.com.</TE>
<TE>   The site criticizes Simon, saying he has hired "radical right-wing
activists" from the Traditional Values Coalition.</TE>
<TE>   So who is behind the Web sites? Manhattan Beach Internet
entrepreneur Ben Padnos, who snatched up the domain names for 10
bucks apiece before the candidates could act.</TE>
<TE>   Padnos said he has made it clear to the campaigns that he is
willing to sell the sites, but denies that is the main reason he put
them on the Web. The registered Republican, who plans to vote for
Simon, said he also wanted to make a point to the campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   "In the spirit of 'equal time,' I set up the sites to show
campaigns what happens when they disregard the Internet as a vehicle
to mobilize voters, raise money and efficiently distribute their
campaign messages, opposition research, etc.," Padnos said.</TE>
<TE>   Both campaigns have Web sites already and have not expressed any
interest in Padnos' domain names.</TE>
<TE>   Basketball Mania Invades the Capitol</TE>
<TE>   No matter which team takes the NBA Western Conference finals,
members of the state Legislature will be in for a show.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the tradition of good-natured political betting on
sports, Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) agreed to wear a
Sacramento Kings jersey on the Assembly floor and ring a cowbell to
start the day if the Kings win.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Lakers take the series, Assembly Republican Leader Dave
Cox of Fair Oaks, a Sacramento suburb, will have to wear a Laker
jersey on the Assembly floor and lead the house in singing "I Love
L.A."</TE>
<TE>   "We already know that Dave Cox looks good in a Lakers jersey--and
I can't wait to hear him sing," Wesson said.</TE>
<TE>   Countered Cox, "You know my good friend Herb Wesson spends so much
time in Sacramento I could have sworn he was a Kings fan. I'm looking
forward to seeing him in purple."</TE>
<TE>   Preemptive Strikes Against Villaraigosa</TE>
<TE>   Seems no one wants Antonio Villaraigosa, the former state
assemblyman and Los Angeles mayoral candidate, in their political
domain.</TE>
<TE>   During last year's state redistricting, legislators redrew
Villaraigosa's Mount Washington district to make it harder for him to
run for state Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Then last week, Los Angeles Councilman Nick Pacheco and other
members of a council committee ratified plans to exclude
Villaraigosa's block from Pacheco's 14th Council District. Pacheco
has worried for months that Villaraigosa intended to run against him
for council next year. Villaraigosa has yet to decide whether he will
enter the race.</TE>
<TE>   Ouch! A Logical, and Biting, Play on Words</TE>
<TE>   There was a rare moment of laughter last week during the Joint
Legislative Audit Committee meeting on the controversial $95-million
Oracle software contract that was pushed by a Northrop Grumman
subsidiary called Logicon.</TE>
<TE>   Barry Keene, who was director of the Department of General
Services until he resigned April 26, was asked by state Sen. Chuck
Poochigian (R-Fresno) why the agency felt forced to sign a deal by
May 31, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Keene started to answer: "The logic was...." He paused and said,
"I hate to use the word 'logic' anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Poochigian hardly missed a beat: "Because of the 'con' part?"</TE>
<TE>   It Seems Just Like Old Times in Downtown</TE>
<TE>   The proposal to build a pro football stadium in Los Angeles may
bring some old foes together again at the bargaining table.</TE>
<TE>   When Philip Anschutz and Ed Roski Jr. were trying to get millions
in public subsidies to build Staples Center, the city hired
hard-nosed real estate attorney David Farrar, who played a role in
getting them to reduce their demands significantly. Farrar sat across
the table from Anschutz's attorneys, including William Delvac. Now
Anschutz and Roski are back, and with Delvac's help are asking the
city redevelopment agency to help finance the football stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, Farrar was appointed by Mayor James K. Hahn in
February to head the city redevelopment board. Farrar said his
experience with the Staples negotiations prepared him well for
dealing with any new proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say they are tough but fair," Farrar said of Anschutz and
Co. "They had an astute understanding of the economics of arenas,
which allowed them to conclude the deal without significant public
subsidies."</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Police officers love action-oriented acronyms. Just think of
SWAT, DARE, CRASH and CLEAR. Such was the case when Los Angeles City
Councilman Dennis Zine, a former LAPD sergeant, decided to line up
west San Fernando Valley residents to canvas neighborhoods to report
graffiti and illegal signs. The name: People Organizing Safe and
Secure Environments--POSSE.</TE>
<TE>   * Leslie Townes Hope, known to the rest of us as Bob, was honored
by Congress last week when the chapel at the National Cemetery on
Sepulveda Boulevard was officially renamed the Bob Hope Veterans
Chapel. Renaming the church--located at the "Arlington of the West,"
where 85,000 veterans are buried--is a fitting tribute for Hope's 60
years of service entertaining American GIs and veterans, said Rep.
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who co-sponsored the House
resolution with Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) that passed
unanimously.</TE>
<TE>   * There is a move afoot to expand the Los Angeles Unified School
District board from seven to as many as 15 seats. Councilman Ed
Reyes, who is behind a motion to study the idea, said many people
feel "not adequately represented by their board member due to the
size of each district." The current board members each represent
635,000 people. If there were 15 members, each would represent
293,334 people, Reyes said.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to spin the story as best as I can."</TE>
<TE>   --Jeff Flint, a campaign strategist for gubernatorial candidate
Bill Simon, overheard at the Disneyland Hotel, where Simon was
questioned about a $10,000 fine against his family's now-defunct
municipal bond firm.</TE>

<HD>Slain Couple Were Talented Jewelers, Friends Say</HD>
<DH>Crime: Garbis and Mayda Tarakjian were found shot to death
in their Toluca Lake store.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The couple shot to death during an apparent robbery Saturday at their
Toluca Lake jewelry store were stylish, talented jewelers whose
creations and kindness drew loyal shoppers, said friends and
customers who stopped by the inconspicuous shop Sunday to peer
through the shattered door.</LD>
<LD>   Garbis Tarakjian, 52, and his 45-year-old wife, Mayda, were found
dead Saturday afternoon, shot multiple times and lying nearly feet to
feet beside the front door of Elegant Creations in Fine Jewelry at
4219 Lankershim Blvd.</LD>
<LD>   No arrests had been made in the robbery-homicide as of Sunday
evening, and investigators said they had no suspects and no
witnesses.</LD>
<TE>   Elegant Creations was closed Sunday, but women wearing necklaces
and rings bought from the Tarakjians dropped flowers at the door and
looked through the blinds. The glass display cases were intact,
topped with vases of orange gladioluses and a bowl of candy.</TE>
<TE>   A jewelry designer who met with the Tarakjians on Saturday
afternoon speculated that they were killed sometime after she left
the store at 2:45 p.m. and before the crime was reported by passersby
at 5:15 p.m. The couple told J.M. Stewart they planned to close an
hour early, at 4 p.m., because they were tired after a Friday night
dinner party and airport send-off for Mayda's niece, who was
graduating from high school. Stewart speculated that the Tarakjians
were transferring their inventory from the store's display cases to
its safe when they were robbed.</TE>
<TE>   Garbis, a jeweler, used to own another shop in the San Fernando
Valley, and Mayda, a gemologist, had worked in two other jewelry
stores in Studio City, customers said. They had been married about
seven years and were "like soul mates," Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Mayda's brother said the Tarakjians were Armenian and had lived in
Beirut. They had no children together, customers said, but he had a
daughter and twin sons from a previous marriage.</TE>
<TE>   The Tarakjians had owned Elegant Creations for about five years
and lived in a Sherman Oaks apartment. Doing business next to a car
rental company, they were planning to move the store to somewhere
with more pedestrian traffic, customers said. The store was
burglarized in February.</TE>
<TE>   Like their store's name, the Tarakjians were elegant, customers
said. Both dressed smartly. Mayda, who had done some modeling, wore
jewelry that her husband designed, and greeted customers when they
rang the store's doorbell. Garbis worked mostly in the back room,
creating and repairing jewelry. He had been frustrated since a stroke
within the last year affected his motor skills, but he was regaining
them, Stewart said.</TE>
<TE>   Next to Garbis' workbench in the back was the store's safe. Police
said that its door was open when the couple's bodies were discovered
and that boxes of jewelry had been dumped on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   The couple did not employ a security guard but kept the front door
locked during business hours, customers said. There was a
surveillance camera in the store, they said, but they were not sure
whether it was functional.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart said that she was the only customer in the store Saturday
afternoon and that the Tarakjians' white Mercedes was the only car
parked in the small lot outside. As she left, she said, Garbis
Tarakjian shared a saying to encourage her to be optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   "Yesterday's history," he told her. "Tomorrow's a mystery."</TE>

<HD>It's Comedy's Odd Coupling: Arab and Jew</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The touring stand-up duo are on the same
side, and now there's a smile-shaped crack in the wall between their
long-warring peoples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tell me if you've heard this one before. Two guys, a rabbi and an
Arab, are on the phone. Both are professional comedians, who get
laughs by poking fun at their heritage.</LD>
<LD>   So the rabbi says to the Arab, "Maybe we can defuse a little of
the tension between our people if we developed an act together. We
can bill it as 'One Arab, One Jew, One Stage.'"</LD>
<LD>   The punch line: Rabbi Bob Alper and Egyptian-born Ahmed Ahmed will
perform together twice in Southern California early next month at
synagogues in the San Fernando Valley and Orange County. They hope
laughter can bridge the gap between the historically warring
religious and ethnic factions--at least for a night.</LD>
<TE>   Ahmed's opening line to his Jewish audiences: "Don't worry. They
patted me down before they let me in."</TE>
<TE>   Alper said the idea takes some getting used to.</TE>
<TE>   "An Arab in a synagogue?" he said. "People think we're crazy.
There's a war going on."</TE>
<TE>   But that's the point, says Rabbi Allen Krause, who agreed to hold
the pair's show June 10 at Temple Beth El in Aliso Viejo. (The other
performance will be June 8 at Temple Beth Hillel in Valley Village.)</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will not appreciate it," Krause said. "But to me,
religion is about reconciliation and recognizing that we're all
children of God. The other side, whoever it is, is not the devil."</TE>
<TE>   This unlikely match wasn't made in heaven but in Los Angeles by a
publicist looking for ways to increase bookings for Alper.</TE>
<TE>   The 57-year-old Reform rabbi, who lives in the tiny Vermont town
of East Dorset, liked the concept and in February hooked up with
Ahmed after searching the Internet for an Arab comic and watching his
videotape. Alper become a comic in 1986 after practicing for 14 years
with joke-laced sermons "before a hostile audience."</TE>
<TE>   Both comedians say that in the nearly two months since they
started working together, the idea has grown from a novelty act to
something more weighty, especially as violence has escalated in the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "It became a calling," said Ahmed, who grew up in Riverside and is
based in Los Angeles. "It's a gesture of peace, a gesture of
healing."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmed's name and looks--dark skin, thick brown hair--led to a lot
of stereotyping, especially after the 31-year-old let his beard grow
after Sept. 11 to enhance his comedy act and chances for landing
movie roles.</TE>
<TE>   "I've decided to go for the whole Taliban look," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A featured act at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles, Ahmed turned to
stand-up nine years ago after becoming dissatisfied with the same
three parts he was being offered as an actor: terrorist, sleazy Arab
prince and taxi driver. (He played Terrorist No. 4 in "Executive
Decision.")</TE>
<TE>   Nearly a decade in the business, he was still "scared to death"
last month before his first performance with Alper in a Philadelphia
synagogue.</TE>
<TE>   He faced more than 300 Jews packed into the temple, many of them
elderly with hearing aids. And, worse, no cocktail waitresses
circulated through the crowd to provide fuel for the laughs.</TE>
<TE>   But Ahmed soon won them over with his material, much of it
retooled since Sept. 11. He now makes jokes about the difficulties of
being an Arab American during the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   He reports showing up at the airport "a month and a half early" to
get through the screenings.</TE>
<TE>   And he says he told a woman working the door of a nightclub not to
worry about him. He only wanted a celebratory drink: "I just
graduated from flight school!"</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise that the rabbi "works clean." His laughs often
come from gently poking fun at himself and his fellow Jews.</TE>
<TE>   "I had dreams of having my own television show, making lots and
lots of money, being surrounded by all kinds of beautiful, adoring
women," he says. "Then I realized that it would never work for me
because, you know, I'm Jewish and I could never be a TV evangelist."</TE>
<TE>   The Alper-Ahmed act (the rabbi opens and closes; Ahmed takes the
middle) has only one rule: no political jokes. Both comedians stay
away from each other's religion, though Ahmed does venture
comparisons:</TE>
<TE>   "We don't eat pork, we don't celebrate Christmas, we both say
'Khhh' a lot, and we're both hairy creatures of God."</TE>

<HD>Cal Poly's Letter P Target of Backlash</HD>
<DH>Landmark: Gay activists get OK to coat symbol in colors of
rainbow, but paint-overs spur concern of student intolerance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLY ANN CONNELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN LUIS OBISPO</DL>
<LD>The landmark letter P on the hill above Cal Poly here has long been a
focal point for school and community pride. In recent days, it also
was supposed to be transformed into a symbol of gay pride--painted a
rainbow of colors to symbolize diversity and gay solidarity.</LD>
<LD>   But no sooner had the rainbow palate been applied than others on
campus--including a group of 15 to 20 students caught one night with
"John Deere green" paint on their hands--began to cover over the gay
pride symbol. Again and again.</LD>
<LD>   The painting by gay activists was authorized by the campus booster
group. The subsequent paint-overs were not.</LD>
<TE>   That has many gay and minority students concerned about a campus
they increasingly describe as intolerant. The case is being
investigated by campus police, with officers exploring charges
ranging from simple vandalism to a possible hate crime.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so much more than a prank," said Mike Sullivan, a computer
engineering major who is the president of Gays, Lesbians and
Bisexuals United. "They want to shut us up."</TE>
<TE>   Sullivan said club members often report being shocked upon arrival
at conservative Cal Poly to find so much anger directed against gays
and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   That's why his 80-member club sought and received permission to
paint the 50-foot-tall P in the colors of the rainbow to promote
Community Pride, a 10-day series of events for and about gay students
that concluded Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   As the rainbow controversy reached a peak last week, a group of
minority students and professors held a march from the college to the
city's popular downtown farmer's market to protest Cal Poly's lack of
ethnic diversity and tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "This certainly has touched a nerve with all individuals and
groups who are concerned about respect and diversity on campus," said
Paul Zingg, provost and vice president of academic affairs. Cal Poly
is 72% white, in a county that is 76% white. That compares to Cal
State campuses that, as a whole, are 47% white.</TE>
<TE>   Zingg admits that minorities come to the campus and San Luis
Obispo "and they don't feel a strong comfort level.... There is a
possible flip side to that," he said, "where other students feel
empowered to object to any diversity agenda for the university. But a
university should be an open marketplace for people and ideas."</TE>
<TE>   He said the university will do its own investigation, which could
lead to anything from suspension to expulsion for the unauthorized P
painters.</TE>
<TE>   The series of events started May12, after Running Thunder, the Cal
Poly Mustang booster club and keepers of the concrete letter P, gave
permission for the rainbow paint job. Typically the letter is white.</TE>
<TE>   In the four days after the initial painting was completed, the P
was painted white with the word "HOMO" spelled out nearby in sheets,
then painted rainbow again, then green, rainbow again, then white,
and finally rainbow again.</TE>
<TE>   The tit-for-tat paint jobs stopped with increased campus police
patrol of the hillside trail to the P. The letter was expected to
remain rainbow-colored until the gay club repainted it white, which
it was set to do over the past weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Located on the Central Coast at a midway point between Los Angeles
and San Francisco, Cal Poly is the most selective of the public
universities that make up the California State University system.</TE>
<TE>   As a California State Polytechnic University, where engineering
and agriculture are the two largest majors, it defies trends seen at
many other college campuses. Men outnumber women among the 17,000
undergraduates, and campus polls find the student population skews
more conservative and affluent than the state as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm used to it really because I came from a white community,"
said Nikki Manalo, an 18-year-old freshman who is African American
and Filipino. "But it would be really hard for somebody coming in
from a multicultural inner-city area."</TE>
<TE>   She sympathizes with the message the gay students were sending.
"Most minority groups here don't get criticized as badly as gays do,"
Manalo said.</TE>
<TE>   Other students describe a wellspring of resentment about painting
the P rainbow colors in the first place. "I don't care, but I'm on
the football team, so a lot of those guys are complaining about it,"
said Joey Warren, 19, a freshman from Los Gatos.</TE>
<TE>   A number of students agreed to be interviewed but feared having
their names tied to negative comments, for fear of being called
homophobic.</TE>
<TE>   "The P represents me too up there. And everyone else, so I don't
really appreciate the rainbow," said Monte Soto, 20, an agricultural
engineering major.</TE>
<TE>   Campus police are continuing their investigation to determine
whether the paintings constitute a hate crime or something else.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no violence, but we do have something here which was
targeted against a particular protected group," said campus police
Cmdr. Bill Watton.  His department would not identify the students
involved, because no charges have been filed.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the school booster club caught the students at the P on
the second night. "They were caught with what looked like John Deere
green paint on their hands, literally," Running Thunder President
Travis Ervin said, referring to the familiar shade of farm equipment
used in and around the agricultural school. The paint-covered
students returned to their dorm, where they were turned in to police
by the resident advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The brouhaha surrounds a symbol that has seen its share of
irreverent incarnations in the past, often with the help of sheets
and props.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as the April 20 campus open house, for example, the
school initial had been used to form "420," a street term for
marijuana. The booster club quickly restored the standard white P.</TE>
<TE>   At various times, it has been used to spell out "GOP," "POT,"
"SPRINGSTEEN," "BUSH" and even "MARRY ME."</TE>
<TE>   Ervin said it had never been used in a mean-spirited manner. He
added: "It definitely says something sad about the amount of fear and
hate that is still on our campus."</TE>

<HD>O.C. City Beaches Are at Full Staff</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's six state beaches will have fewer lifeguards this
summer because of the state's multibillion-dollar budget deficit. But
the five city beaches are fully staffed and, in some cases,
overstaffed for the first big beach weekend of summer. Newport Beach,
Seal Beach, Laguna Beach and Huntington Beach all have full staffs,
officials said. San Clemente had an abundance of young, eager and
qualified lifeguard candidates but decided to keep them all, rather
than lose some to other cities or other summer jobs.</LD>
<LD>   "The quality of people is absolutely the cream of the crop," said
Steve Lashbrook, San Clemente's Marine Safety Lieutenant. "These are
kids who are outstanding athletes, honor students and leaders in
their church groups. It's staggering to sit across from them in an
interview. We're getting the best of the best. I feel sorry for other
employers."</LD>
<LD>   Not all of the city's 50 lifeguards will get full-time work,
Lashbrook said, but he will try to keep his troops busy.</LD>
<TE>   "We want to keep them fresh," he said. "And when some of the kids
leave for college or water-polo practice, we'll move the others into
40-hour-a-week jobs."</TE>
<TE>   State beaches will not have such a pool of talent. Two weeks ago,
officials at the Department of Parks and Recreation said California's
state beaches will suffer a 20% cut in lifeguard staffing--meaning
120 fewer on duty statewide during the peak season. In Orange County,
officials still have not determined how many lifeguards they will be
hiring but say there will be more than 100 on duty through the
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Lashbrook isn't quite sure why he is seeing so many highly
qualified youths who want to be lifeguards.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be that boom with the high-tech companies is over and
kids are looking elsewhere for summer employment," he said. "In
interviews, kids are talking about the computer companies they've
started."</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach officials said its lifeguard towers are not fully
staffed but will be shortly.</TE>
<TE>   "With reports of a possible El Nino and reports from the travel
industry that people are staying closer to home, we're anticipating
large crowds," said Mark Klosterman, chief of marine safety for
Laguna Beach. "With the warmer water, there's usually more swell
activity and more surf."</TE>

<HD>2 Police Chiefs Belong to a Select Fraternity</HD>
<DH>Family: Gary Pentis, in Ojai, and Randy Pentis, in

They are brothers in law enforcement.</DH>

<LD>The saga of the tall, dark-haired lawmen sounds custom-made for the
movies: two towns ... two badges ... two brothers.</LD>
<LD>   Gary Pentis, 47, is Ojai's police chief. His kid brother, Randy,
44, does the honors in Fillmore. They are the only brother act among
California police chiefs, according to the California Peace Officers
Assn. Between the two, they supervise more than 60 deputies who range
over a 100-square-mile swath of rural Ventura County.</LD>
<LD>   Jokingly known in the Sheriff's Department as "the northern
alliance" for the territory they control, the Pentis brothers are
veteran sheriff's deputies. At times, both have done undercover work;
now they're highly visible in the time-tested manner of small-town
police chiefs, visiting schools and working the room at civic club
lunches.</LD>
<TE>   In Ojai, Gary Pentis walks from his office on Ventura Street to
Java Joe's, where he sips coffee and talks with locals about the
never-ending traffic snarls and occasional crusades to save old oak
trees.</TE>
<TE>   One recent afternoon, he drove to a local middle school and
sternly lectured 11 delinquent seventh-graders--all verging on gang
membership--on the perils of a life of crime.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's planning an operation to target drivers who speed down
the Ojai Valley's narrow, tree-lined roads.</TE>
<TE>   About 20 miles away in Fillmore, Randy also does the sort of
police public relations that in larger cities is as quaint a
throwback as an officer twirling a nightstick and walking a beat.</TE>
<TE>   Named Fillmore's chief in November, Randy Pentis puts on a patrol
uniform weekly and cruises the city's older neighborhoods, where he
chats with third- and fourth-generation residents.</TE>
<TE>   At community meetings, he rattles off crime statistics and listens
to ideas from the crowd. Recently, he helped the city buy a
surveillance camera to spot vandals in high-crime areas.</TE>
<TE>   Each week, the two brothers meet for lunch, often at a Ventura
sushi restaurant. They talk about the big-city problems that invade
even the smallest of towns: gangs and drugs. More of their
conversation, though, focuses on family. Gary Pentis has five
children and his brother has three.</TE>
<TE>   Once a year, the Fillmore chief surprises his two young sons with
a trip to an NBA game in a distant city. Meanwhile, the Ojai chief
races a souped-up Chevy truck off-road and raises money for Russian
orphans.</TE>
<TE>   As teenagers the Pentis brothers palled around, despite their age
difference. After classes at Newbury Park High School, they would
ride motorcycles together or shoot at tree stumps with a rifle. There
were the usual sibling rivalries, but Randy looked up to his brother.</TE>
<TE>   "Gary always talked to me about things," he said. "If I had a
problem with school or family or whatever, I could go to him. He was
a voice of reason and he always took care of me."</TE>
<TE>   After high school, Gary went to San Diego State, where he earned a
degree in public health. Unsure of his career path, he became a
counselor for troubled children at group homes. Police officers he
met on the job urged him to think about a career in law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   In 1978, he returned to Newbury Park and became a Ventura County
deputy sheriff--a move that eventually inspired his younger brother
to do the same.</TE>
<TE>   Like Gary, Randy Pentis thought he would enjoy working with
children. But while he was home on a Christmas break from Utah State,
his brother told him the Sheriff's Department was conducting an
entrance exam. In 1982, with a degree in sociology, he became a
deputy.</TE>
<TE>   The pair ascended the ranks steadily, spending time at various
assignments in the jail, patrol services and the detective division.</TE>
<TE>   Working undercover for three years, Gary Pentis was instrumental
in the county's biggest drug bust--a 1993 seizure of $5.8 million in
cash and $40 million worth of cocaine. A dozen reputed members of the
Cali and Medellin drug cartels were arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Pentis, too, did the kind of police work that seems a world
away from giving a noontime talk to the Rotary Club. For years, he
worked on a special enforcement detail in Thousand Oaks that did
everything from busting sex offenders in seedy bathrooms to solving
gang murders.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the 1990s, both earned their present rank. Although
officially sheriff's captains, both were designated chiefs by their
cities, which contract with the county for law enforcement services.</TE>
<TE>   They don't hold jobs that draw too many headlines, but that's OK,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of what we do is just help people solve problems," Randy
Pentis said, "and that doesn't necessarily make the news."</TE>

<HD>Local Schools Counting on Bond Measure</HD>
<DH>Education: Voters will be asked to approve billions for new
campuses. In Ventura County, Oxnard, Hueneme and Rio districts in
dire need.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been nearly three years, but things still feel very temporary at
Rio Rosales School.</LD>
<LD>   Every classroom on the Oxnard campus is in a boxy, dark-brown
portable. So is the front office. And the cafeteria. There is no
playground equipment, save for a few recently installed tetherball
poles. There are no trees to shade students playing on the blacktop
and no grass to cushion their falls.</LD>
<LD>   Rio Rosales is a school still waiting to be built. And, like other
cramped, crumbling campuses across California, it is relying on
voters to pass the largest construction bond in state history--a
$25.6-billion measure that will appear in separate portions on the
November 2002 and March 2004 ballots.</LD>
<TE>   "The bond is crucial," said Jim Sinutko, an assistant
superintendent in the Rio Elementary School District. "If it doesn't
pass, we will need to get very creative."</TE>
<TE>   In the worst-case scenario, the 350 students at Rio Rosales could
be bused to other area campuses while the district searches for the
$11 million it needs to build the school, Sinutko said. Because the
district's existing schools are already stretched for space, such a
move would force them onto a year-round schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something anyone wants, but we have to put some ideas
together on what-ifs," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The school's struggle reflects a statewide problem, as families
are moving into California faster than campuses can be built to house
them. During the last five years, about 206,000 new students have
entered the public school system, which now serves more than 6
million youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   "The population has continued to increase, and for many years, the
bonds were totally inadequate to meet the needs," said Duwane Brooks,
director of school facilities for the California Department of
Education. "It caught up with us."</TE>
<TE>   This time, the state will ask voters to approve a large bond in
two parts: $13.3 billion on Nov. 5 and $12.3 billion two years from
now. In the first round of funding, $4.8 billion is earmarked for
already approved but unfunded projects throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, the needs are greatest in fast-growing
districts such as Rio, Hueneme and Oxnard elementary. Those
districts, on average, also have greater numbers of students from
poor families and students who enter school speaking a language other
than English.</TE>
<TE>   The school bond "is absolutely critical in order to provide an
appropriate learning environment for our children," said Richard
Duarte, superintendent of the Oxnard Elementary School District, the
only district in the county forced onto a year-round schedule for
lack of space.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers and students rotate classrooms every three months, tiny
storage spaces are packed to the ceiling, lunch is served in as many
as seven shifts and few auditoriums are big enough for school
gatherings. Space is so tight at Bernice Curren Elementary School
that the district each year must bus 200 students to other campuses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our children deserve it as much as any other child in the state
does," Duarte said, "especially in light of all the other hurdles we
have to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Rio school district officials are moving ahead on plans
for Rio Rosales so they can be in line for state funding if the bond
passes. Sinutko said the district is applying for "hardship" status,
which means the state would pick up the tab for whatever the district
cannot afford.</TE>
<TE>   Though homeowners in the subdivisions surrounding Rio Rosales paid
into a school fund, the developer's fees covered less than one-third
of the construction and land cost.</TE>
<TE>   Rio officials said they are attempting to avoid future space
problems by negotiating better deals with housing developers, Supt.
Yolanda Benitez said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in the case of the proposed RiverPark project--with
2,800 homes and 2.5 million square feet of commercial
space--developers have agreed to donate the land and build three
schools, with no guarantee of reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   "We told them the only way there could be a school opening at the
same time as the homes is if they built it," Benitez said. "Those are
the ways we can make things good for the community, good for the
county and good for the kids."</TE>
<TE>   Benitez also said she will walk precincts from now until November
to convince Oxnard and El Rio residents to vote for the state bond
measure. "It's the most important thing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   No matter what happens, the temporary Rio Rosales cannot stay
where it is now, because the portables sit on city-owned land planned
for a neighborhood park.</TE>
<TE>   Officials erected the school there nearly three years ago so that
the permanent buildings could be constructed on 6.5 acres of district
land next door. At the time, however, they anticipated construction
starting by this year, Sinutko said.</TE>
<TE>   Money from developers' fees could be used to move the portable
buildings, but some fear that would only further delay construction
of a permanent school.</TE>
<TE>   Rio Rosales parents, meanwhile, are eager to see the school and
the park come to fruition.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very frustrated," said Kathy Bilodeau, who lives across the
street from Rio Rosales. Her son is a second-grader at the school.
"When we moved here they made it seem like within a year or two the
school would be there. Now they're saying fall of 2004. Where is our
tax money going?"</TE>
<TE>   Principal Bernie Lopez-Gonzales has heard most of the complaints.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the No. 1 concern," she said. Since she started the job last
fall, she said she has tried to make the school feel more homey.
Students painted a map of the United States on the blacktop and a
mural on the side of one of the portables. They brought in planters
in an attempt to add some color to the brown-and-gray landscape.</TE>
<TE>   "The outside needs some assistance," she said, "but inside it's
just like any other classroom."</TE>
<TE>   Still, parents say their children come home with badly scraped
knees and ripped pants from falling on the blacktop. They complain
about the heat, because there is no covered area to shield students
from the sun during recess.</TE>
<TE>   Connie Hammond, whose 9-year-old son, Matthew, is a fourth-grader
at Rio Rosales, said she has tried to make the best of dealing with
the interim school.</TE>
<TE>   "The faculty is great, and at least it's close enough for him to
ride his bike," she said.</TE>
<TE>   But Hammond said she wants a permanent school, not portables. And
she does not think parents will tolerate their children being bused
to other campuses or put on year-round schedules in the event the
bond money doesn't come through.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be a terrible thing--I wouldn't be willing to do it,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Navy Fliers' Mission Not Glamorous but Vital</HD>
<DH>War: Midair refueling is as difficult as it looks, says
crew returning from stint in Arabian Sea. But 'without gas, nothing
happens.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORONADO</DL>
<LD>Not every Navy pilot is Tom Cruise and not every plane is sleek and
savage. They too serve who function as midair gasoline station
attendants in bulbous-nosed craft whose engines hum but do not roar.</LD>
<LD>   Their mission is long on responsibility and difficulty but short
on glamour. No Hollywood movie will ever tell their story.</LD>
<LD>   But without the S-3 Vikings, many of the more famous carrier-based
planes--the Tomcats and the Hornets--could never reach and "loiter"
over enemy targets in Afghanistan to unleash their firepower.</LD>
<TE>   And when the eight planes of VS-33, a Viking squadron called the
Screwbirds, returned to North Island Naval Air Station on Sunday
after a six-month deployment on the carrier John C. Stennis in the
Arabian Sea, crew members were given a hero's welcome from family
members and friends assembled on the tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared every day he was there," said Joan Lewis of
Winchester, Va., as she waited for her son, Lt. Cameron Lewis. "But
he was doing what he loves, and he was doing it for America."</TE>
<TE>   "It's like I can breathe again," said Susan McCormick, wife of
Cmdr. Stuart McCormick, the squadron's executive officer.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the early 1970s to fly "low and slow" to detect and chase
Soviet submarines, the Viking's mission has evolved to fit the needs
of a post-Cold War environment. During the Gulf War, Vikings from
numerous carriers conducted surveillance missions with long-range
radar and listening equipment; a Viking became the first U.S. plane
to sink an enemy gunboat with bombs.</TE>
<TE>   In the war on terrorism, where targets are hundreds of miles
inland, and where planes often need to wait for hours above
Afghanistan while targets are selected and attack plans coordinated,
midair refueling has been crucial.</TE>
<TE>   Although much of the refueling has been done by large Air Force
tankers, the more numerous Vikings were key.</TE>
<TE>   "If the S-3s aren't airborne, the rest of the birds probably can't
do their jobs," said Lt. Mike Gonzalez. "We're the backbone."</TE>
<TE>   Midair refueling is a harrowing mission. The plane needing fuel
sticks a long prong into a waiting basket beneath the Viking. Both
planes must be steady, and the slightest turbulence or equipment
malfunction can be deadly.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the toughest at night when the [vibrations] increase and
when your depth perception disappears," Gonzalez said. It is a point
of pride with VS-33 that there were no lost planes or serious
injuries during the deployment.</TE>
<TE>   When the first bombers took off to drop the first load of bombs on
Afghanistan the night of Oct. 7, Vikings from the carrier Enterprise
were already airborne.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the first off the carrier and the last to return," said
Cmdr. Ross Myers, commanding officer of the Screwbirds. "She may not
be pretty or have a nice pointy nose, but she gets the job done.
She's a workhorse."</TE>
<TE>   Viking crew members joke about the plane's looks. The Viking's
nickname is Hoover because its engine is said to sound like a vacuum
cleaner. One squadron, noting the Viking's penchant for being first
to the fight, has a patch: "Go Ugly Early."</TE>
<TE>   No carrier is allowed to depart to war without a squadron of
Vikings.</TE>
<TE>   "Without gas, nothing happens," said Petty Officer Warren Britten,
a maintenance worker for the Screwbirds.</TE>
<TE>   When the Stennis departed from San Diego in mid-November, the
Screwbirds were ready. By mid-December, the carrier had relieved the
carrier Carl Vinson to provide 111 days of continuous bombing and
surveillance support for U.S., Afghan and coalition troops on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   "They like to say: 'We sure passed a lot of gas on this
deployment,'" said Howard Lewis, father of Lt. Lewis.</TE>

<HD>Resort Balks at Energy Hub Plan</HD>
<DH>Mexico: Many voice fear of safety risks, pollution if
natural gas terminal is built in Rosarito Beach. Firms say
informational drive is changing minds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ROSARITO BEACH, Mexico</DL>
<LD>A proposal to turn this tourist resort just south of the U.S. border
into a major energy hub has unleashed a fury of resentment among
local leaders.</LD>
<LD>   They are waging a fierce fight against a sophisticated corporate
public relations campaign in favor of a liquid natural gas terminal.</LD>
<LD>   Just last Tuesday, a dozen global energy company executives in
dark suits filed into a banquet room at the Rosarito Beach Hotel to
pitch their plan to build a $460-million gas plant in the heart of
town.</LD>
<TE>   The plant, they told an equal number of casually dressed Rosarito
civic leaders, would generate 1,400 jobs and pump $15 million a year
into the local economy. The townspeople were assured that the chances
of a catastrophic accident at the gas plant would be less than that
of dying from a bee sting.</TE>
<TE>   The group listened patiently, and then let the visiting corporate
executives have it. One of the first to confront them was furniture
store owner Eduardo Orosco, who was one of many who didn't buy the
pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't B.S. me," Orosco grumbled, standing nose to nose with one
of the men in suits. "What makes you think terrorists won't target
your plant to get back at America?"</TE>
<TE>   Responded Rob Bryngelson of El Paso Global LNG: "Say, I'd like to
talk to you more about that. Call me sometime.... What's most
important to us is making everyone feel comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, right," Orosco replied.</TE>
<TE>   So ended the most recent attempt over the last eight months by a
partnership of El Paso Global LNG and Phillips Petroleum Co. to forge
a working partnership with leaders of the town of 100,000 best known
for its seaside hotels, restaurants, watering holes and rowdy
spring-break revelers.</TE>
<TE>   Now, proponents and detractors are gathering their forces for
bigger battles ahead over what would be the only facility of its kind
on the Pacific Coast, and the largest private investment ever in
Rosarito Beach.</TE>
<TE>   But Rosarito is just one of several Mexican and American coastal
communities targeted for such facilities, which receive natural gas
via pipeline from ships, to be burned at power plants that produce
electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, liquid natural gas is among the most efficient, abundant
and cleanest-burning fuels in the energy business. It is also among
the safest.</TE>
<TE>   North of the international line, Occidental Petroleum had hoped to
build a $250-million natural gas terminal next to the Ormond Beach
power plant in Oxnard. But that land was purchased last week for a
nature preserve.</TE>
<TE>   Along the coast of Baja California north of Ensenada, at least
four energy plant proposals remain in play.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign over the Rosarito Beach proposal has been
particularly contentious.</TE>
<TE>   Galvanized by what they view as a threat to the rhythms of life in
the town that incorporated in 1995, local leaders have organized
street demonstrations and launched letter-writing campaigns to
Mexican federal authorities, including President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   The energy firms have taken out full-page ads in Rosarito Beach
newspapers, conducted surveys and passed out brochures during an
intensive door-to-door campaign, extolling the project's benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the firms sent 20 local business and political leaders
on an all-expenses-paid tour of a model natural gas plant in
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Torres, owner of the landmark Rosarito Beach Hotel, is among
those who worry that the project is not safe and is all but certain
to destroy the beach town's charms.</TE>
<TE>   "They want a back door to the California market," Torres said,
although corporate officials say most of the electricity would be
consumed locally. "But we don't consider ourselves energy producers;
we are a tourist center."</TE>
<TE>   "Who will win?" he asked. "I can't say. But we are at a critical
juncture in this fight."</TE>
<TE>   Rosarito Beach Mayor Luis Enrique Diaz was unavailable for
comment. But his spokesman, Macario Gonzales, said the mayor has said
that if a majority of residents wants it, he will recommend issuance
of a permit. If not, he won't.</TE>
<TE>   The final decision will be made by the Rosarito Beach City
Council.</TE>
<TE>   The Rosarito location is favored for its proximity to several
natural-gas-fed power plants under construction or on the drawing
boards south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the gas, however, would be piped to energy-hungry Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Billions of Dollars in Revenues at Stake</TE>
<TE>   Potentially at stake are billions of dollars in revenues.</TE>
<TE>   By 2010, Baja California's demand for natural gas is projected to
grow more than five times from what it is today, from 150 million
cubic feet per day to 800 million cubic feet per day, Mexican energy
authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   Without new sources of the clean-burning fuel to meet the demand,
the growth of the region's economy is threatened, the energy
companies say.</TE>
<TE>   By most accounts, however, power plants in Baja will need only one
natural gas facility to meet their needs.</TE>
<TE>   Competing with Phillips' proposal in Rosarito Beach are the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group and Sempra Energy of San Diego, both of which want
to build natural gas terminals just north of Ensenada and within
sight of the Bajamar golf resort, about 70 miles south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Marathon Oil Co. and Pertamina, Indonesia's state oil company,
hope to build a $900-million project in Tijuana, roughly 15 miles
south of the international line.</TE>
<TE>   Each would involve construction of fuel silos and piers of up to
half a mile in length for ships, which environmentalists fear could
block the paths of gray whales that swim by twice a year in their
5,000-mile migration from feeding grounds in the Arctic to nurseries
in southern Baja.</TE>
<TE>   In Rosarito Beach, many business owners fear the 261-acre site's
silos, pipelines, power lines and truck traffic would transform
picturesque coastal vistas into a bleak industrial landscape.</TE>
<TE>   As it stands, however, Rosarito is far from pristine. The first
thing a southbound visitor sees when coming into town is an
industrial zone with an oil-fed power plant with 100-foot stacks
belching dark, acrid smoke. Nearby stands a sprawling fuel oil
storage depot of enormous rusting tanks and rumbling big rigs. The
proposed terminal would be built between those facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Those images are conspicuously absent in the colorful renderings
of the gas plant that project managers have been handing out around
town. They depict gleaming white gas silos surrounded by vast,
manicured lawns under clear blue skies.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Reyes, a spokesman for the project, said recent survey
results show the public relations campaign has made a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "Prior to the campaign, folks were 3 to 1 against the proposal,"
he said. "Afterward, it changed to a 50/50 split."</TE>
<TE>   Still, some locals have their minds made up: Building a fuel
distribution center doesn't make sense, given the existing industrial
zone's track record, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Series of Accidents Weighs on Foes' Minds</TE>
<TE>   A week after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, an accidental
explosion in a Rosarito power plant generator shook the ground and
knocked out the region's electrical service for a day. Late last
year, trucks belonging to the state-owned oil company Pemex were
blamed for two separate oil spills on downtown Rosarito streets. This
month, an oil spill dirtied the coast.</TE>
<TE>   Those incidents have weighed heavily on the minds of Rosarito
physicians, architects, teachers and business owners, who have
organized to block the plant.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday night, while sipping English tea and diet sodas at a
downtown restaurant, they hatched a plan to send hundreds of letters
written by local elementary school students to Mexico's first lady,
Martha Fox. She has emerged as her husband's liaison to women,
children and the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that day, a group of business leaders led by Rosarito
Beach Hotel owner Torres and furniture store owner Orosco agreed to
fund an independent review of the gas plant proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "We want a scientific study of the potential impact on our city,
and then time to review that information," said Rosamaria Plascencia,
who heads a civic association that makes recommendations on new
business proposals.</TE>
<TE>   "These companies thought they were just going to roll over us,"
Orosco said. "But it's not over yet."</TE>
<TE>   Alan Sweedler, director of the Center for Energy Studies at San
Diego State University, believes the groundswell of grass-roots
activism reflects a positive change in a place that has been regarded
as a permissive border hangout.</TE>
<TE>   "The Mexican public is getting sophisticated about these kinds of
things," Sweedler said, "and the companies are learning they'll have
to win over a large number of people before they can build in a place
that views itself as a tourist destination.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people in Rosarito compare building a natural gas plant in
their backyard to sticking a power plant in downtown Carmel."</TE>
<TE>   It's not just Rosarito Beach.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 miles to the south in Bajamar--a gated community of 300
residents, condos and luxury homes, two hotels and a 27-hole golf
course--American homeowners also are feeling "dumped on," because
such facilities would face huge hurdles in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In Bajamar, they say, a natural gas plant would be an eyesore, and
potentially devastating to real estate values at the development
where 5,000-square-foot homes on the bluff go for $500,000.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado businessman Peter Salg, president of the 225-member
Bajamar homeowners association, said, "What is deeply disturbing to
me is that we have heard absolutely nothing about any of this from
Mexican government officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that we're only about 1,000 meters from the proposed
industrial development, you'd think some Mexican government agency
would be informing us about what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   The mayors of Ensenada and Rosarito have been under considerable
pressure to block, or approve, the projects in their respective
communities. They are still weighing the arguments.</TE>
<TE>   The same could be said for residents in Rosarito's Colonia
Reforma, a neighborhood of brick homes and shacks crisscrossed by
dirt roads only a few hundred yards from the terminal site.</TE>
<TE>   Bricklayer Gabriel Dominguez, 32, was excited about the project
until he learned that all but 60 of the 1,400 jobs it would generate
would be temporary construction work positions and not permanent.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want it if there are no benefits," he said. "Can't they
build it someplace else?"</TE>

<HD>School's Legacy Endures on Two Continents</HD>
<DH>Korean War: Old Glory still waves over the facility
Californians built in 1952. Veterans returning to Kapyong are cheered
even now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was July 13, 1952, and the California National Guard's 40th
Infantry Division was pulled off the front in Korea to regroup in
Kapyong, a city in ruins from battles between United Nations forces
and communist armies.</LD>
<LD>   With the front lines finally established a safe distance from the
city, the seesaw battles early in the war had given way to a
desperate hope for normalcy among the city's residents. As the
Americans set up a bivouac area, they were struck by the devastation.
No building in the city was intact.</LD>
<LD>   More disturbing to the soldiers, however, was the sight of raggedy
children attending school in tents, using crates for desks. In 1952
South Korea, attending school in tents and writing on boxes passed
for normal.</LD>
<TE>   Hoping to lift morale and instill a sense of purpose in the
battle-weary soldiers, the division's chaplains "passed the helmet"
to collect funds to build a school. It was finished in October 1952
and named the Kenneth Kaiser Middle School in honor of a 19-year-old
Los Angeles sergeant who was the division's first soldier killed in
combat in the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   The 40th Division's soldiers contributed almost $31,000 in two
months for construction of a 10-room middle school, built by the
Manhattan Beach-based 578th Combat Engineers Battalion with the help
of South Korean labor. At the time, the school was the only modern
building in the ravaged city.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years later, the 40th Division and its soldiers maintain
close ties to the school, a reminder of its role in what has been
called America's Forgotten War. Today, the 40th Division will
remember not only its dead from Korea and both world wars, but also
the school half a world away built for "the future leaders of the
Republic of Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Jung Bun Jo has taught English at the school for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "Our school is here because of the American soldiers who helped
the people of Kapyong," Jo said in a telephone interview. She praised
Maj. Gen. Joseph P. Cleland, the wartime division commander who
encouraged the chaplains and soldiers to build the school.</TE>
<TE>   "Gen. Cleland rendered distinguished service to our country and
established Kapyong school for cultivating men of ability in Korea.
We thank all of the 40th Division," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A "Tower of Hope" memorial to Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Kaiser Jr.,
member of B Company 1st Battalion 160th Infantry Regiment, and
Cleland stands outside. The U.S. flag still flies over the school
alongside the South Korean colors. Members of the division return to
Kapyong every year or so, and each time they are greeted as
liberators.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the U.S. military will commemorate the 50th anniversary of
the Korean War, and the 40th Division will remember its victories at
the Punchbowl and Heartbreak Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   But its legacy continues at the Kapyong school.</TE>
<TE>   "The school sends a message about the American citizen-soldier,
who, after he destroys the enemy helps rebuild the country," said
Brigadier Gen. John Gong, a deputy commander of the division. "We try
to show by example that a democratic nation is the best pick of all
options."</TE>
<TE>   It is noteworthy that the school and division have maintained ties
for half a century, given that the division left Kapyong two days
before the school was dedicated, never to return as a unit. The
division had previously served in Korea from September 1945 to March
1946 as an occupation force after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Retired Maj. Gen. James Delk, former commander of the 40th
Division and author of its history, said Southern Californians
rallied around the division and school in the 1950s, when South
Koreans rebuilt their country after the 1953 armistice.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of Hollywood celebrities got behind the effort. In April
1954, we collected over 200 tons of clothing, school materials and
athletic gear donated by citizens at 43 armories in Southern
California," Delk said.</TE>
<TE>   "As [South] Korea's economy got stronger, the need for financial
assistance lessened."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when soldiers from the division are sent to South Korea for
duty, many make a point of visiting the school, where the 40th
Division's sunburst patch is instantly recognized. On some visits,
soldiers also take a financial contribution of about $1,000 and books
about the United States for the school library.</TE>
<TE>   When Gong and about 20 former soldiers visited last year, they
were greeted by the campus' 600 students, who lined up and cheered
the Americans while a band played.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite emotional, especially when you see the plaques of
Gen. Cleland and Sgt. Kaiser. Then you see Sgt. Kaiser's photograph
inside the school, and you realize that you're standing in the
division's boot prints, part of its combat legacy."</TE>
<TE>   Command Sgt. Maj. Stuart Fuller, who was among the soldiers who
traveled with Gong, said the students were ecstatic over books he
brought with him about the pop vocal groups Backstreet Boys and 'N
Sync.</TE>
<TE>   "My visit there was the highlight of my career. It was truly
gratifying to see how much these kids appreciate the American
soldier," said Fuller, a Vietnam War veteran.</TE>
<TE>   Although the school has been remodeled and expanded over the
decades, the original building constructed by the 578th Engineers,
still headquartered at the Manhattan Beach armory, continues to be
used. South Korean officials renamed the school the Kapyong Middle
School in 1984; it was later renamed again to the Kapyong
Comprehensive High School.</TE>
<TE>   The first name change took place over the objections of
then-Principal Sheon-ho Kim. In a letter to the division's
then-commander, Maj. Gen. William J. Jefferds, Kim said, "I think it
wrong that the name of [the] school, Kaiser, was changed.... I hope
the blessing of God would be with Sgt. Kenneth Kaiser forever.</TE>
<TE>   "We Kapyong residents and students never forget the kindness and
help of the 40th Infantry Division."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The 40th Division's history and ties to the Kapyong School are on
display at its museum at Camp Roberts in Paso Robles. The unit's
Korean War dead will be honored today at the Korean War Memorial at
Vandenberg Air Force Base, formerly Camp Cooke, which is where the
division trained before it shipped out to the battlefields in Korea.</TE>

<HD>Agency's Woes Muddle Search for New Leader</HD>
<DH>Government: Ventura County's mental health department, once
a model, has suffered serious setbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County supervisors face a challenge when they go looking for
a new mental health chief next month: How does one recruit a leader
for a department rocked by management turnover, turf wars and a
federal investigation?</LD>
<LD>   Once regarded as an innovator for mental health treatment, the
Behavioral Health Department's reputation has been shattered in
recent years by a series of setbacks.</LD>
<LD>   Most recent was the firing last month of its director, Dr. David
Gudeman, following criticism that he couldn't get along with other
county managers and was driving talented employees out of the
division.</LD>
<TE>   Gudeman's predecessor was forced out after psychiatrists fought
with social workers for greater control over patients' cases. And in
1999, the federal government fined the county $15.3 million for years
of incorrect Medicare billings.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a long and very public fall for the department.</TE>
<TE>   "We have followed the [story in the] newspapers," said Dave Meyer,
Los Angeles County's chief deputy of mental health services. "It's
been painful, frankly, for everyone in the mental health community to
watch, because we are a very tight group."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors are expected to launch a nationwide search for
Gudeman's replacement next month, said County Executive Officer
Johnny Johnston, who acknowledged that the recruitment may be a
challenge.</TE>
<TE>   But key players, including the Board of Supervisors and the Mental
Health Advisory Board, have made it clear in recent weeks that they
are determined to put chronic troubles to rest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever there is controversy, that makes some people skeptical,"
he said. "But based on meetings with the Mental Health Advisory group
last week and our other partners, I think anybody who is interested
will get a positive view of what we are doing. We are expecting to
recruit top talent."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, Ventura County designed a new way to deliver
mental health services to the poor.</TE>
<TE>   Agencies that previously had nothing to do with each other began
working together to solve the many problems that mentally ill people
face, including lack of housing and run-ins with police, and began
practicing state-of-the-art medical treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The model was adopted as a statewide standard and is now accepted
practice in many areas, Meyer said. But the county's standing began
slipping when turf wars erupted within the department in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Officials who helped create the model program were ousted, and
Behavioral Health employees began leaving in droves. Gudeman's
successor will have to rebuild trust among 400 employees while facing
the possibility of painful cuts in the department's $45-million
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer believes the job is doable for the right person.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be some people who will just say, 'No way,'" he said.
"But on the other hand, there is much to envy in Ventura County. It's
the right size and has the right mix of rural and suburban, of
civility and toughness. Some will see it as a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Johnston's office is studying the possibility of separating
Behavioral Health from the larger Health Care Agency. Although Meyer
didn't want to offer an opinion on that, he noted that Los Angeles'
mental health division works well as a stand-alone agency.</TE>
<TE>   "We pulled out of the health agency several years ago," he said.
"We did that because we found that mental health services got lost in
the larger health-care system."</TE>
<TE>   The Behavioral Health director position currently pays $115,000 a
year. Supervisors could decide to increase the figure before they
send out recruitment notices, said Barbara Journet, head of the
county's personnel department.</TE>

<HD>History of WWII Gets the Latino Perspective</HD>
<DH>Legacies: Ambitious project comes to L.A. to videotape
aging veterans. 'I found myself when I served my country,' one says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A dozen World War II veterans, willing to share their distant
memories, arrive punctually this spring Saturday morning to be
interviewed at the East Los Angeles Veterans Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Purple Hearts and Silver Stars pinned to the chests of the old
soldiers, all bearing Spanish surnames, hint at the tales they'll
tell. In small rooms, in front of a video camera, each veteran drifts
back to the war, sharing stories of battle, of friendship and,
sometimes, of racism.</LD>
<LD>   As the veterans speak, their stories are captured as part of an
oral history project being conducted by the University of Texas at
Austin to paint a full sociological portrait of Latino and Latina
military personnel before, during and after World War II.</LD>
<TE>   On this morning in East Los Angeles, and in interviews throughout
the Southwest, certain themes arise, some common to all soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Leon Leura--a Duarte combat engineer in the 36th
Division--remembered coming face-to-face, bayonet-to-bayonet with a
German soldier in Anzio. After a brief struggle, Leura shot him in
the forehead. "He was a real young guy. I felt sorry for him."</TE>
<TE>   Other memories are shared only by other Latino veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Some gravitated toward other Spanish-speaking soldiers overseas.
For spiritual support, their parents back home leaned on their Roman
Catholic faith. When the soldiers returned, some saw themselves in a
new light: They were no longer "Mexicans"--how many men, and society,
perceived themselves before the war. Now they saw themselves as
"Mexican Americans."</TE>
<TE>   "When I went into the service, I didn't have the feelings that I
acquired when I was in there--hearing taps, raising the flag," said
Armando Gonzales, 82, of East Los Angeles, who invaded Attu Island as
a member of the 7th Infantry Division. "I found myself when I went
and served my country faithfully."</TE>
<TE>   The camera captured other scattered scenes from the old men:</TE>
<TE>   During breaks from battles in Europe, Gilbert Lopez--an Irwindale
infantryman in the Army's 44th Division--picked up a box guitar and
began to sing war-themed songs popular among Latino soldiers. The
other Latino soldiers joined Lopez, singing in Spanish about the
pride of fighting for their patria--country--and the sorrow they felt
leaving their lonely mothers back home.</TE>
<TE>   In a foxhole in the Philippines, Jesse Nava, a Lincoln Heights
squad leader in the 24th Infantry Division, faced an unthinkable
decision: His buddy, arms severed by shrapnel in a 2 a.m. firefight
with Japanese troops, asked Nava to have mercy and shoot him.</TE>
<TE>   "That's always bothered me: Would he have lived?" Nava said.
"I went to a rabbi, I went to a Catholic priest, I went to a minister
and asked them the same question: Would he have lived?"</TE>
<TE>   The mother of Santos Sandoval, a Montebello platoon leader in the
40th Infantry Division, fulfilling a vow she made to God if he
brought her four boys home alive, walked several blocks on her knees
to St. Mary's Church in Fullerton. "That's how strong her faith was,"
Sandoval said, his voice shaking.</TE>
<TE>   Latino World War II veterans have been interviewed before, in
small numbers in a handful of regional oral history projects.</TE>
<TE>   But the University of Texas project--started three years ago in
the journalism department and led by assistant professor Maggie
Rivas-Rodriguez--is the most ambitious in scope.</TE>
<TE>   Rivas-Rodriguez, a small staff and scores of volunteers have
interviewed 220 veterans, mostly in the Southwest, though they also
want to collect memories from Cubans and Puerto Ricans on the East
Coast. The project is branching out beyond soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "We are trying to get at what was going on with Latinos in
society," said Rivas-Rodriguez. "We have interviewed veterans, women
who worked at factories. Now we have some interviews with
braceros--Mexican farmhands--who took the place of the [Mexican
American] men who left the fields to go to war."</TE>
<TE>   The project, which aims to establish an archive for researchers,
is welcomed in the Latino academic community, where mainstream movies
or books about America's wars prompt new complaints that the story of
Latino veterans remains largely excluded.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Brokaw's widely lauded 1998 book, "The Greatest Generation,"
particularly irritated Mario T. Garcia, a UC Santa Barbara Chicano
studies professor.</TE>
<TE>   The book, which told the stories of Americans who weathered the
Great Depression and World War II, did not include a Latino.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unconscionable," said Garcia, "for Brokaw, plus his
publisher, to have marginalized the Latino experience in World War
II."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's discontent is not new.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's Failure to Portray Latino Heroes</TE>
<TE>   Latino activists often cite the 1960 movie "Hell to Eternity,"
based on the acts of Guy Louis Gabaldon. The Marine captured hundreds
of enemy soldiers using the Japanese he learned from his Japanese American
foster parents in his native East L.A.  In the movie, Gabaldon was
depicted as an Italian American played by Jeffrey Hunter.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus Salvador Trevino, a television writer and director with
directorial credits that include "The Practice," has complained of
Hollywood's failure to portray Latinos' heroism in America's wars.</TE>
<TE>   For years he tried fruitlessly to get funding to tell the story of
"Hero Street USA." The street in Silvis, Ill., was only a few hundred
yards in length. Yet, during World War II, 22 Mexican American
families sent 65 men to battle.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Latinos have fought in every war since the American
Revolution, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of World War II, the Latino male population--mostly
Mexican American--was about 1 million. Veterans Affairs estimates
that up to 500,000 of them, including 53,000 Puerto Ricans, enlisted
or were drafted.</TE>
<TE>   Latinos have been awarded the Medal of Honor 40 times--most of
them given to Mexican Americans, who have earned the honor more
frequently than any other ethnic group, according to Veterans
Affairs.</TE>
<TE>   That's the context to the oral history project.</TE>
<TE>   As the United States was drawn into World War II, many of the
Southwest young men and women who joined the military were the
children of immigrants who came in search of work or who fled the
Mexican Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   In their interviews, some veterans tell of that era's
discrimination against Mexican Americans--particularly segregated
schools and swimming pools.</TE>
<TE>   "The Anglos would swim for about a month or so," said Lopez, 82,
recalling Mexican American children's attempts to use an Azusa pool.
"Then, they'd get ready to empty the thing, they put chlorine in the
water, and then here we go, nosotros tontones--us, dummies. Imagine
that, all that stuff we went through."</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers traveling between military training facilities in the
Southwest commonly encountered signs at restaurants--particularly in
Texas--that read: "We don't serve dogs or Mexicans."</TE>
<TE>   After being denied a meal, some soldiers, such as Jesus Armendariz
of Pico Rivera, a medic in the 88th Infantry Division, quietly walked
out.</TE>
<TE>   Not Fred Castro, a La Verne born-and-bred soldier who fought in
Europe with the 84th Infantry Division. When he and four other
Mexican American soldiers got denied service at a Texas restaurant,
they broke everything in the place.</TE>
<TE>   The restaurant owner called the military police, who sided with
Castro and his buddies.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as these fellas have the uniform on," one MP told the
owner, "they are white."</TE>
<TE>   But the war also offered many men, who had seldom ventured out of
their rural home towns, a chance to befriend other young men from
throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   "I never experienced any racism," said Leura, who was taken
prisoner by the Germans in France. "I used to hang around with the
Italian guys from New York. They got to be buddies with me."</TE>
<TE>   The war offered many Mexican Americans, as well as other ethnic
minorities, a chance to prove their patriotism.</TE>
<TE>   In East Los Angeles, families prided themselves in sending
overseas "not one--the whole bundle" of sons, remembered Jose
Zaragoza, 81, who joined the Coast Guard and operated electronic
equipment in the South Pacific that guided American ships and planes.</TE>
<TE>   For others, such as Armendariz, overseas service gave them
memories they treasure.</TE>
<TE>   During a break from action in Italy, he and a buddy
strolled through Rome to St. Peter's Basilica, hoping to glimpse Pope
Pius XII. The pope, to their delight, met with several soldiers.
Armendariz brought a Sacred Heart, which the pope blessed--and
Armendariz brought it home to his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It was something out of this world," Armendariz said. "He said,
'Be with God, my son.'"</TE>
<TE>   The importance of religion--particularly Catholicism--has been a
consistent theme in the veterans' stories, as has the bonding
influence of Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers had never felt more American and yet, reflecting
their dual heritage, worked to keep up their Spanish, afraid to lose
their ability to communicate with their parents if they made it back.</TE>
<TE>   As they returned home from war, they also came ready to demand
rights that had been denied to them as children in their own country,
said author Henry A.J. Ramos, who has written about World War II and
Mexican American civil rights.</TE>
<TE>   Of the many organizations that formed after the war, the one that
perhaps best exemplifies veterans' involvement in civil rights, is
the GI Forum.</TE>
<TE>   Group Helped Veterans Get Their Benefits</TE>
<TE>   It was founded in 1948 in Corpus Christi, Texas, by Dr. Hector
Garcia--who with other veterans initially fought to make sure Mexican
American vets received GI Bill benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The GI Forum's legal victories include helping desegregate schools
throughout the Southwest. But no event captures the group's quest for
justice better than the one that launched its founding:</TE>
<TE>   That year, the body of Pvt. Felix Longoria--who was killed three
years earlier in the Philippines--arrived in Three Rivers, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The local funeral chapel refused to bury him. His widow said the
funeral director told her the town's white residents would not like
Mexican Americans using it.</TE>
<TE>   The forum's leadership appealed to then-Texas Sen. Lyndon Johnson,
who, outraged, helped arrange a hero's burial at Arlington National
Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Making sure such incidents are not forgotten is what drives
Rivas-Rodriguez's project.</TE>
<TE>   After their two-hour interviews, the soldiers--appreciative of the
project's interest in their tales--basked in the rare attention.</TE>
<TE>   "It's good they're interviewing us because we're old," said Nava.
"When we die, the history is going to go with us."</TE>

<CX>      Latino veterans--A story in the May 27 California section
incorrectly stated that Mexican Americans have been awarded the Medal
of Honor more frequently than any other ethnic group. According to
the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, there have been 87 African
American and 40 Latino recipients. The story should have said that
Mexican Americans have the most recipients within the larger Latino
community. Additionally, some others that could be defined as ethnic
groups, such as Irish Americans, also have more Medal of Honor awards
than Latinos.</CX>

<HD>Colombia Vote Puts Rebels on Notice</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Hard-liner Uribe becomes next president
after promising to step up the war against the nation's leftist
guerrillas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. CHRISTIAN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Colombians elected as their next president Sunday a hard-liner who
promised to aggressively confront this nation's leftist guerrillas,
an option that promises to broaden the country's bloody internal war.</LD>
<LD>   With 98% of the vote counted, conservative career politician
Alvaro Uribe had won almost 53% of the ballots, enough to avoid a
runoff election. His major opponents conceded defeat.</LD>
<LD>   Uribe's accession to the presidency of this war-torn nation
appears to augur a new and more dangerous stage in Colombia's civil
war, which has grown increasingly violent since the collapse of peace
talks earlier this year.</LD>
<TE>   A stepped-up war would destabilize the region, encourage increased
U.S. military intervention and threaten Latin America's oldest
democracy with economic and social chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe, 49, who did not campaign in public after surviving numerous
assassination attempts, appeared exhausted as he addressed the media
late Sunday night. His face wan, his eyes red, he seemed to choke up
as he referred to his father, killed by guerrillas during a botched
kidnapping attempt 19 years ago. He promised the nation peace through
strength.</TE>
<TE>   ''Reinforcing the military is going to be a necessary road for the
protection of our citizens and the total recovery of human rights,''
Uribe said. ''The international community must know that Colombia has
expressed its willingness to return to civility, to restore order.''</TE>
<TE>   Uribe also pledged educational and economic reform, and said he
would attack rampant corruption. But achieving security, he said, was
key. He promised to ask the guerrillas to negotiate, but only if they
gave up terrorist attacks and laid down their arms.</TE>
<TE>   The guerrillas have consistently rejected calls for a cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   ''From this moment on, we are going to enact our beliefs in order
to achieve democratic security for everyone,'' Uribe said. ''Security
so they don't kidnap the businessman, they don't kill the union
leader, they don't extort the ranch owner, or the field hand.''</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's chief opponent, Horacio Serpa appeared late Sunday at a
convention center to acknowledge Uribe's victory. A traditional party
machine politician, Serpa was a distant second with 31.7% of the
nearly 11 million votes cast. Turnout was estimated at 46% of
eligible voters.</TE>
<TE>   Serpa, who had accused Uribe of receiving support from the
country's right-wing paramilitaries, warned Colombians that a broader
war was coming.</TE>
<TE>   "I warned this country about the dangers of authoritarianism and
all-out war," Serpa said as he stood surrounded by his wife, children
and supporters. "The future of Colombia cannot be in war."</TE>
<TE>   Other opponents also conceded that Uribe would become Colombia's
43rd president, taking office in August.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Eduardo Garzon, a former golf caddie universally known as
"Lucho," won a surprising third place with 6.2% of the vote as the
head of a left-wing coalition that insisted on negotiations as the
only viable solution to the conflict.</TE>
<TE>   He recognized Uribe's victory but promised to continue fighting
for peace with his new party, known as the Democratic Pole. Noemi
Sanin, the fourth-place finisher with 5.8% of the vote, also
acknowledged Uribe's victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace is an indisputable condition for development," said Garzon,
later adding: "We are not going to have anything to do with war."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson showed up at Uribe's campaign
headquarters to congratulate him, saying the U.S. would have "very
close" relations with Uribe, who has studied at Oxford and Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe's victory was the first time since implementation of the
country's 1991 constitution that any president has won outright in
the first round. Analysts interpreted the results as a stunning show
of support in a crowded field of four major candidates.</TE>
<TE>   It also bodes well for Uribe's ambitious center-right reform
program to improve the military, government and public services.</TE>
<TE>   The diminutive politician wants to double the size of Colombia's
military. He also plans to create a million-member-strong citizen
patrol force to warn of attacks by the rebels and paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe is seeking direct U.S. funding of the conflict; American aid
has been confined to drug-fighting efforts. The Bush administration
has already proposed such a change in part of this year's
$657-million aid package to Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe has also proposed slashing the size of Congress, cutting
tariffs and opening hundreds of new schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a clear mandate for Uribe," said Pablo Franky, a political
analyst at Javeriana University. "I believe it's overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts were less sure. Uribe, running as an independent,
is facing a legislature filled with hard-core members of the
country's traditional Liberal Party.</TE>
<TE>   He will also have a hard time implementing his reforms. Colombia's
economy is suffering, with public debt now equal to nearly half the
GDP. Unemployment hovers at about 20%, and more than half the
population lives in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   "Uribe has no political organization. He can't count on anything,"
said Elisabeth Ungar, an analyst with the University of the Andes.</TE>
<TE>   But for many Colombians, such concerns were secondary to a more
aggressive stance against the guerrillas as a way to halt a conflict
that costs 3,500 lives a year, the vast majority civilians killed by
either rebels or paramilitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Outgoing President Andres Pastrana, who is constitutionally barred
from seeking reelection, pursued three years of peace talks with the
guerrillas. They ended in failure, with the rebels having used the
time and a special demilitarized zone created for the talks to
prepare for combat and solidify their control of the cocaine trade
that funds their war.</TE>
<TE>   Uribe "knows how to lead with weapons, not words," said Ciro
Mansalve, 70, who braved pouring rain in Bogota, the capital, to vote
for Uribe. "Get rid of the guerrillas, get rid of the war."</TE>
<TE>   Colombians needed no reminder of the cost of the conflict in the
weeks and months leading up to the elections.</TE>
<TE>   One candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, was kidnapped and remained in
captivity Sunday. Local governors, congressional representatives and
mayors were kidnapped or killed during the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago, guerrillas fighting paramilitaries in a forgotten
corner of the country launched a homemade rocket that killed 119
people seeking refuge in a church.</TE>
<TE>   In the days immediately before the vote, the sound of car bombs
and gunfire reverberated throughout the country. Rebels blew up
bridges, knocked down power lines and blocked major roads.</TE>
<TE>   Both guerrillas and paramilitaries menaced the mostly rural
populations they dominate. They burned voting cards and threatened to
disrupt elections. Overall, however, voting proceeded smoothly
Sunday, a remarkable fact given that the rebels control about 40% of
the national territory, most of it in sparsely populated rural areas.</TE>
<TE>   A massive show of more than 210,000 police and military troops
kept violence to a minimum. On Sunday, rebels from the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, burned voting materials in five of
the country's 1,000 counties.</TE>
<TE>   About 20% of the voting booths in rural areas had to be moved into
cities for security.</TE>
<TE>   Voters lined up in searing heat and pouring rain, from this
country's vast lowland jungles to the fog-shrouded Andes.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone was happy with Uribe's victory. While Uribe won the
vote in 21 of Colombia's 32 departments and one capital district,
Serpa won in some of its poorest.</TE>
<TE>   Serpa's support was strongest along the Caribbean coast where the
Liberal Party has long held sway, but he also won many departments on
Colombia's vast eastern plains, where rebels have long been strong
and government services are nearly nonexistent.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, [Uribe] represents the rich. We are the poor.... Peace
interests us more than anything," said Bonifacio Chicunque, a member
of the Kamentxa indigenous tribe who is originally from Putumayo,
where most of Colombia's cocaine is grown.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups worried that Uribe's victory and his support
of a strong military might encourage more violence by paramilitaries,
many of whom are thought to support him.</TE>

<HD>U.S. to Leave Philippines Despite Hostage Situation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL and JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>ISABELA, Philippines</DL>
<LD>Most U.S. military forces in the southern Philippines, the largest
Pentagon deployment outside Central Asia in the war against
terrorism, will leave this summer even though an Islamic extremist
group linked to Al Qaeda continues to operate in the region,
according to U.S. and Philippine government officials.</LD>
<LD>   About 660 troops, including 160 Special Forces soldiers, were sent
early this year to support a long-stalled Philippine military effort
to crush Abu Sayyaf guerrillas and free three hostages, including
American missionaries Martin and Gracia Burnham. The Kansas couple
were kidnapped from a nearby resort a year ago today.</LD>
<LD>   Abu Sayyaf, which spouts Islamic fundamentalist ideology but lives
mainly off a lucrative kidnap-for-ransom business, last July beheaded
a third American hostage, Guillermo Sobero of Corona, Calif.</LD>
<TE>   The failure to eliminate the group, a botched ransom effort and
reports that the Burnhams are in poor health have combined to dampen
the optimism that greeted the Green Berets in January. With their
high-tech surveillance equipment and superior weaponry, the U.S.
forces boosted morale among both the Philippine military and much of
the war-weary civilian population.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Philippine experience has become more of a cautionary
tale. Here, as in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the war against terrorism
is also a battle against poverty, rampant government corruption and a
fierce resistance to central authority that has endured for
generations.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, the Green Berets, Marines, Navy Seabees and other U.S.
forces were sent to train, advise and support about 3,500 Philippine
combat troops trying to hunt down about 100 Abu Sayyaf rebels on the
southern island of Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing the deployment late last fall, as well as $100 million
in military aid to Manila, Bush administration officials said Abu
Sayyaf had links to Al Qaeda and called the Philippines an important
new front in the global war on terrorism. Indonesian national Fathur
Rohman Al-Ghozi, a prominent member of the Southeast Asian militant
group Jemaah Islamiah, which has been tied to Al Qaeda, was arrested
in Manila. Other militants have taken shelter among the country's
minority Muslim population, mainly in the south.</TE>
<TE>   But the administration's program immediately ran afoul of
Philippine domestic politics and fell behind schedule. Nationalist
politicians, including the Philippines' vice president, Teofisto
Guingona, fought to limit the U.S. military's role. American soldiers
were never allowed to join combat patrols hunting for Abu Sayyaf
fighters, the group's headquarters or the American hostages.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said last week that the six-month deployment of U.S.
troops will end as planned July 31, however, and that most U.S.
troops will withdraw whether or not the Burnhams are freed or Abu
Sayyaf is eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   A small group of military engineers who arrived on Basilan in
April may stay on to help improve wells, roads and an airstrip.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously we're impatient to see the Burnhams released ... but
the fact is we have methodical program and time management to help
improve the capabilities of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,"
U.S. Ambassador Francis J. Ricciardone Jr. said in an interview. "It
[the exercise] seems to be on time and proceeding well."</TE>
<TE>   But some challenge that positive view and question what U.S.
involvement here has achieved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a travesty that they [the U.S. Special Forces] could come
and go with Martin and Gracia still in captivity," said Robert
Mycell, a Manila-based spokesman for the Burnhams' employers, the New
Tribes Mission of Sanford, Fla. "This will be very difficult for
people to understand."</TE>
<TE>   Missing Ransom</TE>
<TE>   Remains a Puzzle</TE>
<TE>   But so is a $300,000 ransom attempt that apparently went awry.
Martin Burnham's father, Paul, is believed to have organized the
ill-fated payoff in March, but the money has disappeared. The elder
Burnham has consistently refused to address questions about ransom
payment, stating only that Abu Sayyaf had reneged on a deal that
would have freed his son and daughter-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   According to those familiar with the deal, local police contacts
were supposed to pass the ransom money to an Abu Sayyaf spokesman
named Sahinon Hapilon, better known publicly as Abu Sulaiman.</TE>
<TE>   But Sulaiman, the brother of Isnilon Hapilon, an Abu Sayyaf
commander believed to be holding the three hostages, insisted to
associates that he never received the ransom.</TE>
<TE>   In the weeks since, suspicion has fallen just about everywhere--on
the Philippine national police, on Philippine army officers angry at
being cut out of the original deal, on other factions in Abu Sayyaf
and on Sulaiman himself, who was killed this month in a police
shootout in the western Mindanao city of Zamboanga.</TE>
<TE>   Parouk Hussin, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao, which includes Basilan, claimed to have knowledge that the
money was actually passed to Abu Sayyaf couriers. But he also said
Sulaiman told him personally that he had received nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "The consensus is that if ransom was paid, it went to the wrong
people," Mycell said, noting that the debacle is something the
Burnham family "won't talk about, even with us."</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear how much FBI officials or others at the U.S. Embassy
in Manila who focus on the Burnham case knew about or helped
facilitate the ransom plan. Embassy officials, happy to discuss most
issues related to the anti-terrorism campaign, refused to address the
incident.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, a House staffer who is familiar with the U.S.
military deployment said the Bush administration had "acquiesced" to
the ransom plan in an apparent exception to its efforts to cut off
funds to terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf, which means "bearer of the sword," was founded in 1992
by Abdujarak Abubakar Janjalani, a young zealot who attended Islamic
schools in Libya and Saudi Arabia and is believed to have joined
Afghan rebels during the 1980s war against Soviet forces.</TE>
<TE>   Muslim insurgencies have raged and waned for several hundred years
in the southernmost Philippines. Abu Sayyaf claims to be fighting for
an independent Muslim state in this predominantly Roman Catholic
country and recently has sought to publicly align itself with other
Islamic extremist groups opposed to the West.</TE>
<TE>   Group Shunned for</TE>
<TE>   Being Un-Islamic</TE>
<TE>   But Abu Sayyaf is more widely seen as a vicious criminal gang in a
largely lawless region. It is officially shunned by other, larger
Islamic separatist organizations in the southern Philippines, who
reject the group's tactics of kidnapping for ransom and beheading
victims as un-Islamic.</TE>
<TE>   Its factions reportedly have raised millions of dollars in recent
years by kidnapping foreign tourists and others for hefty ransoms.
Some Philippine officials say the group has funneled part of the
money to Al Qaeda, but they have offered no evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Those who monitor Abu Sayyaf say it is composed of hard-core
fighters, many of them now in their mid- to late 30s, who are Al
Qaeda-trained veterans of the anti-Soviet resistance in Afghanistan.
An undetermined number of younger, less-experienced hired guns drift
in and out, depending on the group's finances.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, Abu Sayyaf is believed to have received Al
Qaeda money, and its members met regularly with Mohammed Jamal
Khalifa, a brother-in-law of Osama bin Laden. The group also boasted
ties to Ramzi Yousef, convicted for his role in the 1993 New York
World Trade Center bombing.</TE>
<TE>   A separate Abu Sayyaf faction of about 700 fighters operating on
the nearby island of Jolo has nurtured ties with Libya, which two
years ago paid the group $20 million in ransom for the release of 21
hostages, including 11 foreigners, kidnapped from a Malaysian resort.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf members kidnapped the Burnhams and 18 others at a
resort on the Philippines' Palawan island last year. They beheaded
the only other American in the group, Sobero, and repeatedly have
threatened to kill the Burnhams and a local nurse they also are
holding. The other hostages have escaped or been released.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with a Manila newspaper this month, an Abu Sayyaf
foot soldier suggested that the group was seeking social justice in a
region ravaged by poverty, illiteracy and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had jobs and no army to bother us, we would not be
fighting," he said. "The problem is there has been a lot of talking
since I was very young. Lots of projects from Manila, but nothing has
changed."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, fearful that the Southeast Asian nation
could become a breeding ground and launching pad for terrorist
attacks, has restored close ties with Manila after a decade of
relatively little attention. Senior Philippine military officers talk
of using the $100 million in U.S. military aid to upgrade antiquated
communications equipment and enhance night-vision capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine and U.S. officials stress that the Burnhams still may
be found before the American forces leave in July.</TE>
<TE>   Rebel leaders have put feelers out for new ransom negotiations,
and rumors fly about an arranged release or a rescue attempt by
Philippine troops. None of the reports have proved substantive, and
officials concede that they don't know for certain that the Burnhams
are still being held on Basilan.</TE>
<TE>   Philippine army officials say the rebels are most likely concealed
in 30 square miles of dense jungle and rugged hills in the island's
center. The sweltering climate has prompted the Green Berets, who
have not joined in the patrols, to trim their packs from 80 pounds to
35 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time we are fighting nature rather than the enemy,"
said Gliserio Sua, the Philippine army general in command of the
hostage rescue operation.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon Asserts</TE>
<TE>   Impact Is Felt</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon strategists say the Green Beret advisors and trainers
have had an impact even though they are largely confined to
Philippine military bases. Thanks to U.S. training and equipment,
they say, the Philippine army now operates in villages the government
has not controlled for years.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels "are fleeing ... because of the pressure," said Eduardo
R. Ermita, an advisor to Philippine President Gloria Macapagal
Arroyo.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, officials say, Abu Sayyaf has been weakened by
defections, a handful of arrests and clashes with Philippine military
units in recent months. They say the group's strength on Basilan has
fallen from several hundred last year to fewer than 100 today.</TE>
<TE>   In Isabela, the capital of Basilan island, where heavily armed
U.S. troops still roll by in their Humvees, city leaders say
conditions are as peaceful as they've been in years. Whether that
will last is anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's going to be better when we leave," said Brig. Gen.
Donald Wurster, commander of the U.S. soldiers in the region. "I
think the chances of it lasting are not bad."</TE>
<TE>   Locals aren't so sure. Some fear a resurgence of Abu Sayyaf
activities after July 31. "When the Americans leave, that's the time
they will strike again," warned Christopher Puno, a spokesman for
Basilan Gov. Wahab Akbar.</TE>

<HD>Thrill Rides' G-Forces Also Being Felt in Court</HD>
<DH>Health: Brain injury lawsuits are on the rise. Amusement
parks defend coasters' safety.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no other thrill quite like it. Nothing that plummets you,
hurtles you, twists you and turns you at the speeds and dizzying
heights of the newest generation of roller coasters.</LD>
<LD>   Amusement park engineers design the swings, flips and drops to
create the illusion of risk. But as rides have become bigger, faster
and scarier, doctors, regulators and lawyers are saying the danger
isn't imaginary.</LD>
<LD>   Even as millions flock to parks this weekend for the start of
tourism season, critics of the rides contend that thrill-seekers'
brains are being rattled around in their skulls, causing brain bleeds
and tears that can result in permanent damage or death.</LD>
<TE>   This fall, New Jersey is expected to set the nation's first legal
limits on the gravitational force that amusement park rides can
produce. Industry officials, too, are moving to set new standards,
although they say many of the people who have suffered injuries so
far had preexisting health conditions, such as aneurysms.</TE>
<TE>   Over the past several years, claims of brain injury from roller
coasters have increased, according to policymakers and doctors.</TE>
<TE>   Some who say they've been injured allege that the industry
downplays an important risk. "At least when you are smoking, the
cigarette [package] says you can get lung cancer," said Zipora Jacob,
49, a former genetics researcher who settled a lawsuit with
Disneyland after alleging she suffered a brain hemorrhage on the
Indiana Jones Adventure ride.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went on that ride, nobody told me that I could have a
brain injury. People should know. They have to beware that it's
risky."</TE>
<TE>   Industry representatives accuse plaintiffs' lawyers and regulators
of hyping a small number of cases. They say roller coasters are safer
than many forms of family entertainment, such as soccer on the
weekends.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone can find an activity that 320 million people do each
summer that has less incidents, I'd really like to see what it is,"
said Gary Story, president of Six Flags Inc., which operates 38
amusement parks worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors and regulators examining the rash of claims are focusing
on G-force, or the force of gravity, on roller coasters. The G-force
can be measured by direction: up and down, forward and backward, or
left to right. Of concern is how long the forces last and how quickly
and radically they change, and whether the ride jolts back and forth
abruptly, or suddenly speeds up or slows down.</TE>
<TE>   One G-force equals the normal tug of gravity on the body. Two
G-forces make a person feel twice as heavy as normal. As the G-force
increases, it becomes harder for the heart to pump blood to the
brain.</TE>
<TE>   Zero G is weightlessness--the sensation of floating--and negative
G gives the sensation of being pulled upward out of the seat.</TE>
<TE>   Coaster enthusiasts' Web sites show that the 10 fastest coasters
have been built in the past eight years. The record holder, Dondonpa
in Japan, opened in December and travels 106.9 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Combining Speeds and Twists Increases G-Force</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, roller coaster top speeds were 80 mph. Records for
height, drop and angle of descent have also been shattered in the
past several years. This year, Magic Mountain debuted X, a coaster
whose cars can spin forward and backward 360 degrees. Combining speed
and twisting tends to increase G-force, said ride engineer Steve
Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   Although NASA has researched G-forces, those studies have not
measured the kinds of forces that roller coasters exert on riders.
Industry executives dispute whether today's rides expose customers to
more G-force than those of past years. Although the coasters are
higher, faster and loopier, technology also has made them smoother,
industry officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at rides today, you would see that the G-forces have
actually come down from where they once were," said Story of Six
Flags.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors who have studied injured patients say coasters can pose a
risk. In an article in Neurology in January 2000, neurologist Toshio
Fukutake chronicled the case of a 24-year-old Japanese woman who
developed headaches and subdural hematomas--blood clots--after riding
several large roller coasters at an amusement park in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Riding giant roller coasters can cause chronic subdural hematoma
even in a previously healthy woman," Fukutake concluded. "Builders
and designers, managers of amusement parks, and potential passengers
on giant roller coasters need to be aware of this risk."</TE>
<TE>   He urged government to consider regulating speed and acceleration
of giant coasters.</TE>
<TE>   In California, no law governs ride design or G-forces, but
legislation has been passed requiring the reporting of injuries,
accident investigations and ride inspections. Regulations for that
law, which took effect in 2000, are being finalized.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey will become the first state to set G-force limits for
coaster designers and manufacturers when it finalizes its regulations
in October.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a free pass in the system, and we didn't think that was
appropriate," said Bill Connolly, New Jersey's director of codes and
standards.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey engineers determined that brain injuries are
occurring--along with a spate of back and neck injuries from the
jolting, jerking rides and rapid changes in direction and speed.</TE>
<TE>   "We think that the issue has currency, not just because it is
something that needs to be done, but as rides get bigger and bigger
and there's competition in the marketplace, they're exploring the
edges of the envelope," Connolly said. "We really think there needs
to be a line, someone taking a look at it on behalf of the public."</TE>
<TE>   Under the proposed standards, front-to-back G-forces cannot exceed
5.6 for more than one second; and side-to-side G-forces cannot exceed
2.5 for more than a minute, although the figures can change,
depending on the kinds of restraints. New Jersey officials say rides
in their state fall within those limits. Industry officials initially
scoffed at New Jersey's efforts, calling the state unqualified to
draft guidelines. Connolly said he got letters from parks telling
him, "We know what we're doing. Leave us alone."</TE>
<TE>   Now, an industry task force is working on its own set of
regulations. Bret Lovejoy, president of the International Assn. of
Amusement Parks and Attractions, said he hopes New Jersey will adopt
the industry's standards.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Six Flags has commissioned a study on ride-related
brain injuries by Neuro-Knowledge, a research program of the American
Assn. of Neurological Surgeons.</TE>
<TE>   The findings are not complete, but one panel member said Six Flags
executives commissioned the study with "no strings attached" and
said: "If there is a problem, we want to know about it."</TE>
<TE>   The new attention to the issue is in part due to Rep. Edward J.
Markey (D-Mass), who has publicized allegations of brain injury and
requested studies from the National Institutes of Health and other
medical experts.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, more doctors have weighed in. Two brain-injury
researchers at the University of Pennsylvania, Douglas Smith and
David Meaney, have asked the industry to provide G-force data for the
country's biggest and fastest roller coasters.</TE>
<TE>   They plan to use the numbers to determine the rate and extent of
head movement on the rides and compare that to known injury
thresholds for other kinds of accidents, such as car crashes.
G-forces alone, Smith said, are not an adequate standard for
determining the potential for injury.</TE>
<TE>   Apart from that, Smith said he is not sure the issue merits more
research.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if there's increased risk, even for people who have
defects," said Smith, an associate professor of neurosurgery. He
compared the brain-injury debate to the shark-attack hysteria of last
summer.</TE>
<TE>   In January, emergency-room physicians Robert Braksiek and David J.
Roberts published an article in the Annals of Emergency Medicine,
saying that although the rate of brain injuries is low, the trend is
"worrisome."</TE>
<TE>   "The skull is very rigid," Braksiek said. "The brain, whenever
it's tossed around inside there, is very susceptible to damage.
There's very little room for the brain to move. It could be related
to high G-force; it could be related to sudden stops and starts."</TE>
<TE>   Although riders with preexisting conditions are at higher risk,
some of those people may have lived longer or without serious injury
had they not exposed themselves to the forces of the ride, Braksiek
said.</TE>
<TE>   "These patients were injured on roller coasters, and that's a fact
that can't be debated," Braksiek said.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the injured are convinced the coasters are to blame.</TE>
<TE>   Zipora Jacob alleges she suffered a brain hemorrhage in 1995 while
riding Disneyland's Indiana Jones Adventure. That ride has been the
focus of at least three brain-injury related lawsuits, including one
that alleged wrongful death.</TE>
<TE>   The ride takes patrons on a rambunctious simulated off-road
adventure in a Jeep-styled car. It doesn't reach breathtaking speeds,
but jostles people back and forth with rapid changes in direction,
acceleration and deceleration--a phenomenon referred to as "jerk."</TE>
<TE>   "You are shaken from right to left, up and down, and at the same
time you have a roller coaster going on," said the Los Angeles woman,
who reached a confidential settlement with Disney in 1999.
"Immediately after the ride stopped, I felt like my head was going to
explode. I never felt anything like that in my life--such pressure on
my head."</TE>
<TE>   Jacob, who said she was healthy before her trip to Disneyland,
said she suffered a torn blood vessel and fell into a coma. Years
later, she said she still suffers depression, memory lapses and takes
five medications designed to ease her brain's chemical imbalance. Her
scalp is uneven and lumpy from multiple surgeries, and a plastic tube
runs from her head to her abdomen to drain excess fluids.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Chaim Jacob, accuse park executives of
failing to acknowledge injuries and hiding behind inaccurate safety
data. At the time of Jacob's accident, for example, Disney logged her
brain hemorrhage as an "illness" rather than an "accident," they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has denied fault in the case, and officials said they are
prohibited from discussing it because of the confidential settlement.
That settlement, they said, is not an admission of liability or
fault. They said the Indiana Jones ride falls well within the
industry's proposed G-force standards. Independent scientific testing
has found that the motions and forces are "not sufficient to cause
the kind of injury alleged by the plaintiff's attorneys," Disneyland
spokesman Ray Gomez said.</TE>
<TE>   During another recent lawsuit alleging brain injury on Indiana
Jones, the amusement park was fined for "willful bad faith" after
failing to turn over brain-injury data. Six days before a
court-imposed deadline, Disneyland settled without releasing any
information.</TE>
<TE>   Since filing Jacob's lawsuit, Barry Novack has sued amusement
parks on behalf of four other brain-injury clients. Two have settled,
and Novack said he has been retained on eight more cases.</TE>
<TE>   "When I started out in 1995 with Zipora Jacob, Disney laughed at
me," Novack said. "They said, 'Come on, a brain injury from a ride?
We've never had this....' Now, lo and behold, there seems to be some
type of pattern here."</TE>
<TE>   But Gomez said the only pattern is among personal-injury lawyers
using the media to "generate more coverage and troll for more
business."</TE>
<TE>   Rachelle Johnston, 34, is suing Six Flags Fiesta Texas, alleging
her head was whipped around and against the ride's harness as a
result of the "jerking motion and violent turns" on Joker's Revenge,
a roller coaster that twists and loops upside down and backward.</TE>
<TE>   The San Antonio woman, who said she was healthy before the 1999
coaster ride, alleges she has suffered more than 1,000 seizures since
the accident, as well as memory loss, slurred speech and tunnel
vision.</TE>
<TE>   Park officials said they are "vigorously opposing" her assertion
that she suffered traumatic brain injury.</TE>
<TE>   Those who have sued parks say roller-coaster brain-injury cases
are particularly difficult to prove and expensive to litigate.</TE>
<TE>   Before a case goes to trial, the plaintiff must enlist the
services of neurologists, biomechanical engineers and safety
consultants, who can charge tens of thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   For those who reach settlement, the parks typically require a
confidentiality agreement and rarely admit any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte Norris, 47, a law-firm administrator from Honolulu, has
sued Six Flags Magic Mountain in Valencia, alleging she suffered
three brain clots in 1998 while riding Viper, then the largest
looping roller coaster in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "My head was whipping back and forth," Norris said of the ride
that turned her upside down seven times in two minutes. "It's like
the shaken-baby syndrome."</TE>
<TE>   She said that she developed an intense headache during the ride,
and that afterward she experienced difficulty speaking, lost use of
the left side of her body and developed spasms.</TE>
<TE>   Six Flags officials said Norris did not visit a doctor until more
than a month after the ride and never reported the injury to the
park's staff during her visit. Norris lost her first round in court
on the grounds that her lawsuit was filed too late. She is appealing
to the Hawaii Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   For every person who alleges injury, there are scores more coaster
enthusiasts and park patrons who rave about the new rides.</TE>
<TE>   Ric Turner, 42, of Valencia has ridden 450 coasters in North
America and Japan and is already eyeing his next big
thrill--Xcelerator at Knott's Berry Farm, set to open June 6. The
coaster launches riders to 82 mph in 2.3 seconds, shooting them up
205 feet, then into an immediate 90-degree descent.</TE>
<TE>   Straight down, head first? No worries, Turner said. "I will be
there."</TE>

<HD>Killers Slip Away to Mexico</HD>
<DH>Fugitives facing possible life terms now are protected from
extradition. One father went south to seek his own justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESSICA GARRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saul Zavala tucked a gun into his Levi's and drove for hours up and
down the hot, dusty streets of a tiny Mexican village, studying each
face he passed.</LD>
<LD>   If U.S. and Mexican law enforcement authorities would not punish
his daughter's killer, this grieving father from Lynwood felt he had
no choice but to cross the border and "make justice with my own
hands."</LD>
<LD>   The man he believes shot his daughter is among scores of Los
Angeles County murder suspects who have sought refuge in Mexico. That
government has long refused to extradite anyone who may face the
death penalty in the United States. Recently, the Mexican Supreme
Court extended that protection to fugitives who may face life in
prison, provoking outrage among law enforcement officials in several
border states.</LD>
<TE>   Mexican officials say the policy arises from a philosophy that
criminals should be rehabilitated, not locked up for life or killed,
both of which they consider cruel and unusual punishment.</TE>
<TE>   But for many U.S. authorities, their neighbor's refusal to
extradite means that criminals are literally getting away with
murder--and flouting the U.S. justice system.</TE>
<TE>   "A terrorist can commit a horrendous act ... and Mexico would be a
haven," said Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley. "It's
inevitable. It's happening. It's becoming a haven for murderers."</TE>
<TE>   One of those, authorities say, may be the man who shot Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Deputy David March last month in Irwindale and is
suspected of fleeing home to Mexico. Another is a man who allegedly
killed a Drug Enforcement Administration agent in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "We have several fugitives down there who have participated in the
murder of law enforcement [officers] and other serious crimes, and we
can't get them back," said Janet Napolitano, Arizona's attorney
general. "It's a total disaster."</TE>
<TE>   Although the district attorney's office does not have an exact
figure, officials estimate that more than 60 suspected killers from
Los Angeles County are in Mexico, along with countless more fugitives
suspected of rape, child molestation or attempted murder. Some have
been picked up and prosecuted in Mexican courts, but others remain
free.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, all 50 state attorneys general signed letters
to U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft and Secretary of State Colin Powell
pleading with them to negotiate a solution to the extradition
problem. The letter warned that Mexico has created "a dangerous
incentive for people to commit grievous crimes and escape" and that
if terrorists involved in the Sept. 11 attacks were found there, even
they could not be extradited unless the United States agreed not to
sentence them to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Zavala has put a face--a sad, haunted face--to the problem. Cooley
calls him a symbol of the policy's injustice.</TE>
<TE>   Zavala's anguish began the June morning three years ago when his
daughter Jessica, 15, and her cousin Olivia Munguia, 17, were gunned
down.</TE>
<TE>   The inseparable cousins, who both dreamed of becoming soap opera
stars, had set out together on foot that Tuesday for Lynwood High
School.</TE>
<TE>   They got only three blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia was shot first. Her body slumped onto a utility pole as
Jessica stood beside her, screaming. Then the bullets ripped into
her.</TE>
<TE>   It took less than a month for Los Angeles officials to file a
criminal complaint charging Juan Manuel Casillas, Olivia's
ex-boyfriend, with murder. Casillas, 24, who authorities say is a
gang member from an affluent Mexican family, reportedly had been
furious that Olivia had broken up with him.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks later, law enforcement officials located Casillas in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office
met with the girls' parents and explained that Casillas most likely
would remain south of the border. Gil Garcetti, who was then district
attorney, refused to waive the death penalty at the outset in any
case, saying it would set a bad precedent.</TE>
<TE>   Another option for Casillas was prosecution in Mexico. Under a
provision of Mexico's treaty with the United States, boxes of
evidence from the United States can be translated into Spanish and
shipped south. Mexican officials say that since 1993, more than 150
U.S. criminals have been convicted under such circumstances, 109 of
them from California.</TE>
<TE>   But California officials say that many of those convicted in
Mexico receive light sentences, and that some cases just seem to
vanish, said Janice Maurizi, director of branch operations for the
district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   That possibility wasn't acceptable to the Zavalas.</TE>
<TE>   "I want him here. He did it here," Zavala said. "I am from Mexico.
I know Mexico. If his father pays the money, he'll get out right
away."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, without an agreement to waive the death penalty or a
request from Los Angeles authorities to go forward with foreign
prosecution, Mexican authorities did not arrest Casillas. It took Los
Angeles officials nearly a year after the killings to ask Mexico to
begin a foreign prosecution of Casillas.</TE>
<TE>   The thought of him riding horses on his family's ranch near
Guadalajara tormented Zavala. The obsessed father made frequent
visits to the district attorney's office, carrying a white plastic
photo album devoted to Olivia and Jessica and begging Garcetti to
waive the death penalty and bring Casillas back.</TE>
<TE>   With each refusal, Zavala grew angrier. Once, after a chance
meeting with Garcetti at a march for victims of gun violence, he
screamed at the prosecutor until friends pulled him away.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Zavala said, one of Garcetti's secretaries took him aside
and whispered that he should go see Cooley, who was then challenging
Garcetti for the district attorney's job.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley seemed the answer to Zavala's prayers. He met with Zavala,
looked at Jessica's photographs, and vowed to get Casillas extradited
if he won the election.</TE>
<TE>   Zavala, who had never been involved in politics, began organizing
marches and parties in support of Cooley's campaign. He went on
Spanish-language radio stations and told the story of his daughter's
death, urging people to vote for Cooley. A month after taking office,
Cooley kept his promise, sending a letter to Mexico promising not to
seek the death penalty in Casillas' case.</TE>
<TE>   For Cooley, it was to be a new era for justice in Los Angeles.
Hundreds of victims' family members across Los Angeles County could
prepare for the closure of confronting perpetrators in court. But by
then, Casillas' trail had grown cold, and Mexican authorities said
that they couldn't find him.</TE>
<TE>   About this time, Zavala and his wife, Petra, visited their
hometown in the Mexican state of Michoacan. One morning before
sunlight, without a word to his wife, Zavala rose. With his
brother-in-law, Olivia's father, he made the three-hour drive across
the hills to Jalisco. After getting a tip from a woman who had heard
Zavala speak about his plight on the radio, they thought they knew
where to find Casillas.</TE>
<TE>   It was early afternoon when their battered truck rumbled to the
town plaza in Ayotlan, and the sun was beating down. The two men had
guns, once used for hunting, in their waistbands. They carried
pictures of Jessica and Olivia as well as a sketch of Casillas.</TE>
<TE>   They approached merchants and shoppers. Had they seen this man, or
anyone in his family?</TE>
<TE>   They found Casillas' house, but no one was home. Finally, they
drove home. The next day, Zavala wanted to return to Casillas' house,
but Olivia's father refused.</TE>
<TE>   Thank God, Zavala now says.</TE>
<TE>   "I was going to do something terrible there," he said. "Even if I
saw his mom, or his sister ... I was doing something terrible."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, a few months after that clandestine trip, Casillas was
arrested at a gas station in Mexico City as he filled his car to flee
to Veracruz, officials there say. American officials quickly moved to
have him extradited, and the Zavalas began to prepare themselves for
the bittersweet victory of facing their daughter's killer in court.</TE>
<TE>   Then, on Oct. 2, the Mexican Supreme Court issued a one-page
ruling that dashed their hopes. Life without parole is not
rehabilitation, the court ruled. Casillas' extradition was denied.
Other suspects sought in California and other border states also had
their tickets back to the United States canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The extradition picture was further complicated last week. A
Mexican federal tribunal ruled that drug kingpin Jesus Amezcua,
wanted in San Diego, would not be extradited, even with the U.S.
guarantee that he would not face a possible life term, indicating
that the assurance wasn't sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Maurizi, from the Los Angeles County district attorney's office,
said that decision "just makes an impossible situation worse."</TE>
<TE>   Jorge Garcia-Villalobos, a federal prosecutor with the Mexican
attorney general's office in Los Angeles, said Mexican legal
authorities haven't yet figured out if the ruling will have broad
application.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to understand that Mexico and the United States have two
different legal systems," Garcia-Villalobos said. "The penalty should
help rehabilitate them in order to reincorporate them into society.
If the requesting country doesn't give a less-serious punishment, we
cannot extradite."</TE>
<TE>   But he added that Mexican officials were committed to working with
their U.S. counterparts to put criminals where they can't hurt
people. "These days, if we don't join forces, we cannot fight these
guys," he said. "These guys do not have borders."</TE>
<TE>   By international human rights standards, Mexico's position on the
death penalty is consistent with most of the rest of the world,
especially Europe, said Jorge Vargas, an expert on Mexican law at UC
San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   While not defending the Mexican system, Vargas said the United
States "is exactly the same when it comes to the death penalty as
Saddam Hussein and Iraq. We're one of the few countries in the world
with the death penalty."</TE>
<TE>   This reasoning makes U.S. prosecutors crazy.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's talk about justice," Cooley said. "Not someone's view of
humanity. The murders occurred here. We get to set the standards of
justice in our community. The [Mexican] Supreme Court should not be
interfering with the sovereignty of the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, this spring the Mexican government began prosecution of
Casillas, which means he could not be prosecuted here even if he did
return.</TE>
<TE>   For Zavala, this is a torment. Even though he can think of no
solution any more than prosecutors can, he won't give up.</TE>
<TE>   "I promised her that it's never going to stop until I make justice
for her," he said about his daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica's mother, agrees--to a point.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is where he committed the murders," Petra Zavala said. "But
if they bring him here, or don't bring him here, still, my daughter
is not here."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Hector Becerra contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Exports Misery to Africa With Farm Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WARREN VIETH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House and Congress are trumpeting their determination to
bring economic opportunity to the people of Africa. But first, a few
million sub-Saharan farmers will have to suffer.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration has been busy extending special trade
status to African exporters, designing a $10-billion aid package for
poor countries and dispatching Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill and
other top officials to confer with African leaders. There has even
been talk of a "Marshall Plan" for Africa.</LD>
<LD>   But all of those initiatives added together may not be enough to
offset the damage inflicted on Africa's small farmers by the
$190-billion agriculture bill that President Bush just signed into
law.</LD>
<TE>   "This farm bill, I think it's fair to say, will put millions of
small farmers out of business in Africa," said Mark Ritchie,
president of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy in
Minneapolis. "They will have to move to cities and become part of
unemployed labor pools."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials and independent economists say the big
subsidies doled out to U.S. farmers will contribute to global
overproduction of wheat, corn, cotton and other basic crops. That, in
turn, will drive down world commodity prices, making it more
difficult for small, unsubsidized Third World farmers to compete.</TE>
<TE>   African nations will be particularly hard hit because agriculture
plays such a big role in their economies--accounting for more than
50% of the gross domestic products in some.</TE>
<TE>   "Commodity prices will probably sink lower on a global basis. For
countries that do not subsidize their farmers as well as we do, that
will mean economic and financial trauma," said Neil Harl, director of
the Center for International Agricultural Finance at Iowa State
University. "We're making decisions here in the U.S. that affect the
entire world, yet the rest of the world doesn't have much say in what
our policy is."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, O'Neill has been pummeled with complaints about the farm
bill since his arrival in Africa on a 10-day fact-finding tour with
Bono, the Irish rock star and global debt relief advocate. A
government official in Ghana told O'Neill the U.S. subsidies will
undermine the economies of many African nations. In South Africa,
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the bill will jeopardize the
continent's efforts to overcome poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Even Bono chimed in. "We can't have people in Congress who agree
with debt cancellation and want to do something on AIDS, and then
sponsor the farm bill," he said, according to a report in Friday's
Financial Times.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts fear the farm bill will sabotage the sweeping world
trade negotiations launched in November in Doha, Qatar. The U.S.
persuaded many poor countries to support the trade talks by promising
that wealthy nations would reduce their agricultural subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, lavish farm subsidies employed by other industrialized
nations, notably France and Japan, long have been a target of
criticism by U.S. trade negotiators as inimical to the cause of free
trade.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Undermines U.S. Message on Values</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Birdsall, president of the Center for Global Development, a
Washington think tank, said the farm bill belies the "Horatio Alger"
ethic that the U.S. encourages poor countries to embrace.</TE>
<TE>   "We're undermining our message about what our values are and what
has worked in our country to bring about healthy development,"
Birdsall said. "We're creating another round of frustration."</TE>
<TE>   The agriculture bill Bush signed recently authorizes about
$190billion in farm spending over 10 years--$83 billion more than
lawmakers anticipated when they passed 1996's big farm bill.</TE>
<TE>   The money will finance a variety of farm programs, from
agricultural research to conservation programs. But much of it, an
estimated $57 billion, will be paid directly to farmers to make up
for low commodity prices. The biggest subsidies are earmarked for
producers of wheat, corn, sorghum, barley, oats, rice and cotton.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development, which monitors fiscal policies in industrialized
countries, farm subsidies already are distorting the economics of
agriculture in the United States. Of every $1 in U.S. farm revenue,
about 25 cents comes from the government, according to OECD analysts.
In 2000, government support averaged $20,800 per farmer.</TE>
<TE>   In most cases, the subsidies are pegged to commodity prices. The
less money a farmer gets for his crop in the market, the bigger the
subsidy he gets from the government. No matter how far the market
price falls, the farmer has no incentive to reduce production.
Saturated markets become even more glutted with surplus production,
and prices fall even further.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a Catch-22," said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a former top
government official who now co-chairs the European-American Business
Council. "Because the bill is counter-cyclical, as prices decline you
get more subsidies to try to make up for it, and you just keep the
vicious circle going."</TE>
<TE>   Effect Is Greatest in High-Production Areas</TE>
<TE>   The effect is greatest in the markets for grains, soybeans and
cotton, where world production tends to exceed demand year after
year. Some of those crops are among the major agricultural products
of sub-Saharan Africa--where farm production accounts for an average
of 17% of the total economic activity in 48 nations--and the effect
of low prices on the continent's small farmers can be devastating.</TE>
<TE>   Eizenstat said he expects the farm bill's negative impact on the
developing world will eclipse the potential benefits of Bush's
proposed Millennium Challenge Account, which would provide poor
countries with $10 billion in additional development aid over three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Oxfam, the London-based relief organization, noted in a recent
analysis that the United States has been selling surplus wheat on
world markets at prices 46% below the cost of production, and corn at
20% below costs. In most other export products, selling below cost is
a violation of anti-dumping rules. But farm products never have been
subject to those restrictions. "For practical purposes, the world
agricultural market is a dumping market in which prices are unrelated
to costs of production," Oxfam said in its report.</TE>
<TE>   According to World Bank economists, cotton exporters in West and
Central Africa would take in an additional $250 million a year if the
U.S. stopped subsidizing domestic production. Overproduction has
caused cotton prices to fall to about a third of their peak levels in
the mid-1990s. The $2 billion in subsidies received by U.S. cotton
farmers every year is partly to blame, the World Bank says. Americans
are hardly alone in this practice, however: Other rich countries pay
their cotton farmers more than $3 billion a year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts at the International Monetary Fund reached a similar
conclusion, noting that this year's U.S. cotton crop is expected to
be the biggest since 1927. Farmers keep increasing production even
though market prices have fallen sharply in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "This has contributed significantly to downward pressure on
prices, hurting some of the world's poorest countries," IMF
economists said in a recent analysis.</TE>
<TE>   The resulting loss of cotton exports amounts to 3% of the total
economic output of Mali and Benin, the IMF said, and 1% to 2% for
Burkina Faso and Chad. The damage exceeds the total value of the
relief provided to those countries under a global debt relief

<TE>   Analyst Fears for Talks on Trade Reforms</TE>
<TE>   John Weekes, who heads the Global Trade Practice of APCO
Worldwide, a Geneva-based consulting firm, said he fears the farm
bill may convince other countries that the United States is not
serious about trade reform, dooming the recently launched round of
trade talks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a dangerous game," said Weekes, a former Canadian government
trade official. "It will have a severe impact on other countries'
trading prospects, and also on the temperament and mood of [trade]
negotiations."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the United States ultimately agrees to scale back its
agricultural support as part of a new global trade accord, U.S.
farmers will have become "hooked on subsidies," Weekes said. "It may
be harder to wean them off at the end of the negotiating process."</TE>
<TE>   Birdsall, the Washington think tank official, said the
psychological blow dealt by the farm bill may be even bigger than the
actual economic effect.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as though you have crippled economies, and you're trying to
get them back on their feet so they can enter the race," she said.
"And then, just before the race begins, you whack them back from the
starting line."</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Barge Topples I-40 Span</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER and STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WEBBERS FALLS, Okla.</DL>
<LD>One of the nation's most important cross-country truck routes was
severed on Sunday when a barge slammed into an Interstate 40 bridge
in this tiny town, knocking a 500-foot span into the Arkansas River
and plunging up to a dozen vehicles into the murky waters below.</LD>
<LD>   Divers and emergency workers had pulled two cars and a motor home
from the silty water by late evening. Each vehicle contained one
body, but officials warned that eight or nine more people may have
died and that it could be a day or two before they could reach them
all.</LD>
<LD>   The tugboat operator pushing the barge apparently had a seizure
and blacked out, Gov. Frank Keating said. With no one at the
controls, the barge swerved well out of the navigation channel and
rammed into the concrete pilings supporting the bridge.</LD>
<TE>   As many as a dozen cars and two tractor-trailers plunged 100 feet
into the river as the bridge collapsed with a thunderous roar about
7:45 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Several survivors were pulled from the waters within minutes by
fishermen. Four were taken to hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue efforts were then delayed for hours by a storm and the need
to shore up the massive slab of concrete that was left balancing
precariously atop the barge.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue crews returned to the water in the afternoon, able only to
collect items floating on the surface: Clothing. Car seats. Diapers.</TE>
<TE>   Divers received the all-clear to enter the water by early evening.
The divers, who worked in teams of six, said most of the vehicles
appeared to have piled up, one atop the other, on the bottom of the
river, which is only 11 feet deep at that point. Also recovered was a
horse trailer, with the carcasses of at least two horses inside.</TE>
<TE>   "We just feel tremendous sadness. We're all shocked," said Steve
Williams, who manages a nearby state park.</TE>
<TE>   Williams raced to the site with several of his rangers to help
with rescue efforts. What he saw horrified him: "Both ends of the
bridge were pancaked into the water," he said. "And in the middle,
there was this span of about 500 feet where there was absolutely
nothing."</TE>
<TE>   Coming on a heavy holiday traffic weekend, in the midst of urgent
warnings about terrorist threats, the bridge collapse drew quick
attention from federal investigators.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, which is responsible
for barge navigation, said authorities were "treating it like a crime
scene until they're sure it's not."</TE>
<TE>   Reporters from around the world quickly besieged the mayor of this
modest town of 726 people set in the rolling hills of eastern
Oklahoma farm country. "We've had calls from England, Canada,
France--from all over," said Mayor Jewell Horne, who doubles as the
police commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   Yet authorities from federal agencies quickly moved to dismiss any
dark speculation. "Preliminary indications are that this was nothing
other than a maritime accident," said Chet Lunner, a spokesman for
the U.S. Department of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   But there is much more to do than simply determine the cause of
the collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Interstate 40, which runs in a nearly straight shot across the
country from Barstow to the Atlantic Ocean near Wilmington, N.C., is
"a critical piece of the national infrastructure," Lunner said.</TE>
<TE>   It is the most heavily traveled east-west truck route in the
country, he said. The road carries about 113,000 vehicles a day on a
structure designed to carry 72,000.</TE>
<TE>   And with the span over the Arkansas River knocked out, it has now
been snapped in half.</TE>
<TE>   Repairing the bridge is expected to take six months.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, trucks were being diverted to get around the impasse,
in a detour of about 20 miles. But Lunner said the delays will have a
"major impact" on interstate commerce for days, perhaps weeks, to
come.</TE>
<TE>   Locals also expect the traffic snarls to have a major impact on
their economy, which depends in the summer on fishermen coming to
this lush land of rivers and lakes in search of the abundant catfish
and bass.</TE>
<TE>   Charles Mills, a lock operator who passed the tugboat and barge
through his lock about eight hours before the disaster, said
"everything was normal" at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The tug, which was pushing two empty barges lashed together, was
traveling upstream at a normal speed.</TE>
<TE>   And according to the corps, conditions were far from dangerous; in
fact, the river was a bit slower and lower than is typical this time
of year.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing was wrong," Mills said. "Everything was just fine."</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the tugboat captain was found at the controls in
his wheelhouse after the accident, but it was unclear whether he was
conscious at the time. He was still hospitalized late Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Two tug mates ... said it was a seizure or a blackout, and the
captain hit the bridge," Keating said. "A number of fishermen down
there saw it happen. They said [the barge] veered right into the
piling."</TE>
<TE>   The seven crew members on board were not injured. Shane Guthrie,
personnel manager for the tugboat's owner, Magnolia Marine Transport
Co. in Vicksburg, Miss., said the barge was not loaded.</TE>
<TE>   "They just got hold of the bridge span there somehow," Guthrie
said. "We're still investigating what caused the accident."</TE>
<TE>   The multi-agency probe, launched Sunday, includes investigators
and engineers from local law enforcement, the FBI, the National
Transportation Safety Board, the Coast Guard and the Department of
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1967, the bridge was last inspected a year ago and was
found to have no problems, said Terri Angier of Oklahoma's Department
of Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The bridge was built with barriers that protect some of the
bridge's pilings against precisely this sort of accident, but only on
its north side. The tug was traveling upriver from the south. Also,
it had strayed so far outside the shipping channel that a protective
barrier would not have helped.</TE>
<TE>   Officials had not yet estimated the cost of repairing the bridge.
Building an entire new span would carry a price tag of about $20
million, state officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Webbers Falls is about 100 miles east of Oklahoma City, not far
from the Arkansas line. On Sunday, the town's city hall was being
used as a morgue.</TE>

<KH>WORLD CUP</KH>
<HD>A Peerless Primer</HD>
<DH>Here are several things to know about the soccer
extravaganza</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Asia, it is confirmation that, at last, it is ready for the big
leagues.</LD>
<LD>   For Japan and South Korea, it is a chance to out-promote,
out-accommodate, out-sell and out-host one another, with the rest of
the world watching, for 31 hyper-kinetic, hyper-competitive days.</LD>
<LD>   For France, it is the opportunity to become the first team since
Brazil in 1962 to repeat as soccer's world champions.</LD>
<TE>   For the United States, it is a grand experiment in sleep
deprivation and/or VCR dependability, with most games kicking off
locally some time between Conan O'Brien's last joke and the first
shriek of the morning alarm clock.</TE>
<TE>   For millions across the planet, it is time to start brushing up on
Saudi Arabian strikers, Mexican midfielders, Danish defenders and
German goalkeepers, because the world's biggest sporting spectacle
kicks off in four days, defending champion France against newcomer
Senegal, in Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to aid the cause, here are 20 things you should know
about the 2002 World Cup, which begins Friday:</TE>
<TE>   1. THE FORMAT</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two teams--16 in Japan, 16 in South Korea--divided into
eight round-robin groups of four teams. (South Korea gets Groups A,
B, C and D, Japan gets E, F, G and H.) Top two teams in each group
advance to the second round, where the single-elimination phase of
the tournament begins. Because South Korea got the opener, Japan will
play host to the final--June 30 at Yokohama.</TE>
<TE>   2. THE GROUPS</TE>
<TE>   Group A: Defending champion France and three teams playing for
second. Denmark reached the quarterfinals in 1998, Uruguay is back
after a 12-year absence and tiny Senegal is making its World Cup
debut.</TE>
<TE>   Group B: Spain and Paraguay are paired in the same group again, an
ominous sign for the Spaniards. In 1998, Spain, harboring title
aspirations, finished third in its group behind Nigeria and Paraguay.
Slovenia is a World Cup first-timer and South Africa, in its second
go-round, looks to win its first game in a World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Group C: A gift from the "soccer gods" for Brazil, that's how Pele
put it. Brazil, which struggled to qualify, should have little
trouble finishing first in a group that includes World Cup rookie
China, injury-ridden Costa Rica and Turkey, back in the tournament
for the first time since 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Group D: The United States tries to better its 1998 performance,
which shouldn't be difficult; the Americans were a dead-last 32nd in
France four years ago. Team USA faces its sternest test first,
opening against Portugal, a potential semifinalist. After that, the
Americans play South Korea, with second place in the group probably
coming down to the U.S.-Poland match June 14.</TE>
<TE>   Group E: Germany represents the past, Cameroon the future and
Ireland is an experiment in what can happen when your coach fires
your team captain--in Ireland's case, fiery midfielder Roy
Keane--barely a week before the World Cup opener. Saudi Arabia fills
out the foursome.</TE>
<TE>   Group F: The group of death, with four teams capable of winning
other groups--Argentina, England, Sweden and Nigeria--crammed into
the same quartet. Two will advance, two will shake their heads every
time they look at Group H.</TE>
<TE>   Group G: Italy, which finished second in 1994, and Croatia, third
in 1998, seek to protect their turf against Mexico and debutante
Ecuador. Second place behind Italy could be decided early; Mexico
opens against Croatia on June 3.</TE>
<TE>   Group H. The group of dearth, also known as Belgium, Japan, Russia
and Tunisia. None of these teams are ranked among the top 22 in the
world, yet two of them will advance to the round of 16. It's in the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   3. BEST TEAM</TE>
<TE>   France. Since winning the trophy four years ago, France has added
the 2000 European championship and a cast of forwards (Thierry Henry,
David Trezeguet, Sylvain Wiltord) who know how to put the ball in the
net, which is more than the champions of 1998 could say.</TE>
<TE>   4. WORST TEAM</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia. After watching his team fail to score in the African
Nations Cup in January, Coach Henri Michel bailed, leaving his
players with these inspirational words: "We have weaknesses
everywhere--tactically, technically, mentally, physically."</TE>
<TE>   5. PROBABLE FINAL FOUR</TE>
<TE>   Three teams--France, Argentina and Italy--have the talent, the
pedigree, the coaching and the karma to win the tournament. Argentina
has so much skill up front that even with its three-forward
alignment, Gabriel Batistuta, one of the top goal-producers on the
planet, might not crack the starting 11. Italy has a potent
three-headed strike force of its own--Francesco Totti, Christian
Vieri and Alessandro Del Piero. With any amount of luck, Coach
Giovanni Trapattoni might even permit them to shoot.</TE>
<TE>   France and Argentina are set to meet in one semifinal. Italy's
savvy defense and favorable draw should send the  Squadra Azzurra
into the other semifinal against the winner of an all-Iberian
quarterfinal, Spain-Portugal. Portugal hasn't been to the World Cup
since 1986, but Spain has, and we're too familiar with that sad
story. Give it to Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   6. TEAM TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   Cameroon. The Indomitable Lions are reigning African and Olympic
champions, with enough attacking talent to become the first African
team to reach a World Cup final. One problem: If Cameroon wins its
group, it is set to face Italy in the quarterfinals. If the Lions
take second, they'd probably get Spain, Portugal and Italy in their
next three games.</TE>
<TE>   7. BEST FIRST-ROUND MATCHUP</TE>
<TE>   Argentina-England, June 7 at Sapporo. Argentina eliminated England
in 1986 on Diego Maradona's infamous "Hand of God" goal. Argentina
eliminated England in 1998 on penalty kicks. A player from Argentina,
Pedro Duscher, broke the foot of English star David Beckham with a
hard tackle during a club match in April. Falklands IV, as some have
dubbed it.</TE>
<TE>   8. BEST PLAYER</TE>
<TE>   Zinedine Zidane, France. As his spectacular winning volley for
Real Madrid in the Champions League final again demonstrated, Zidane
rises to the big moment like no one else in the sport. In 1998, his
dribbling and playmaking assisted France to the final--and then,
Zidane took it from there, heading in two goals in a 3-0 upset of
Brazil. However, Zidane injured his leg and asked to be removed
during an exhibition Sunday against South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   9. COMEBACK PLAYER</TE>
<TE>   Ronaldo, Brazil. His disappearing act in the 1998 final was merely
the least of it. Ronaldo, twice FIFA world player of the year, lost
three years to knee injuries and surgeries before returning to
Internazionale's lineup late in the just-completed Italian League
season. If he's fit and in form, Brazil is a different team, making
this an altogether different tournament.</TE>
<TE>   10. COMEBACK COACH</TE>
<TE>   Hernan Dario Gomez, Ecuador. Barely a year ago, Gomez was
pistol-whipped and shot in the leg by a group of attackers allegedly
angered by Gomez' decision to leave the son of former Ecuadorian
president Abdal Bucaram off the national under-20 team. Gomez briefly
resigned before a nationwide show of support persuaded him to return.
From there, Gomez finished guiding Ecuador to its first World Cup
appearance.</TE>
<TE>   11. COACH TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   Bora Milutinovic, China. After taking Mexico, Costa Rica, the
United States and Nigeria to the second round of the last four World
Cups, Bora tries to make it five for five with his biggest challenge
yet.</TE>
<TE>   12. GOALKEEPERS TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   Fabien Barthez of France is an obvious choice, because he's
capable of being the best keeper in the tournament and the worst
keeper in the tournament--sometimes both in the same half. Jose Luis
Chilavert of Paraguay is the Charles Barkley of international
soccer--always quick with an outrageous opinion, and currently
serving a one-game suspension for spitting in the face of Roberto
Carlos. Oliver Kahn of Germany and Gianluigi Buffon of Italy are two
of the most dependable shot stoppers in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   13. GOALKEEPERS TO WATCH AFTER U.S. COACH BRUCE ARENA TELLS ONE OF
THEM HE HAS TO SIT</TE>
<TE>   Tissue-thin at most positions, the United States has two keepers
capable of starting, and expecting to start, which makes either Kasey
Keller or Brad Friedel the leading candidate for Most Disgruntled
American at the World Cup. At least until the Portugal game is
finished.</TE>
<TE>   14. FORWARDS TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   Michael Owen of England fulfilled the promise that his
scintillating strike against Argentina four years ago suggested; he
was selected European player of the year after leading Liverpool to
the English League Cup, F.A. Cup and UEFA Cup in 2001. Henry made a
similar mark with Arsenal this season, leading the Gunners to the
English Premier League and F.A. Cup titles. Patrick Mboma of Cameroon
tries to take his country further than any African nation has gone in
a World Cup. Raul of Spain gets his last chance to turn reputation
into production in a major tournament.</TE>
<TE>   15. MIDFIELDERS TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   Luis Figo of Portugal, Zidane's teammate at Real Madrid, was
FIFA's world player of the year in 2001, but he comes to the World
Cup with a bad ankle. Manchester United teammates Beckham and
Argentina's Juan Sebastian Veron have never had an intrasquad
scrimmage quite like the one scheduled for June 7 at Sapporo. Patrick
Vieira of France is an important defensive shield, the man in the
middle who has Zidane's back.</TE>
<TE>   16. DEFENDERS TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   In this World Cup, they come in tandems. Lilian Thuram and Marcel
Desailly of France, and Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Nesta of Italy
are the keys to the best two backlines in the tournament. Carlos
Gamarra and Celso Ayala of Paraguay are not as celebrated, but in
1998 they anchored a defense that gave up only two goals in 383
minutes. Brazil's Roberto Carlos is not really a defender in the
traditional sense--more a fullback-forward hybrid who seems to be
drawn to the opposition goalposts like an overdeveloped magnet.</TE>
<TE>   17. DEFENDERS TO WATCH THROUGH THE FINGERS OF THE SWEATY PALMS
PLASTERED ACROSS YOUR NERVE-RACKED FACE</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. backline, which is too slow in the middle, too tentative
on the outside and the reason goalkeepers Keller and Friedel have
lost most of their hair. A thrill a minute, this bunch. Figo and
Portugal can hardly wait.</TE>
<TE>   18. STADIUM TO WATCH</TE>
<TE>   The brand-new Sapporo Dome features a grass field that soaks up
sunshine outside on most days, then is wheeled inside on a "hovering
stage" for games. More fun to watch than Belgium-Tunisia.</TE>
<TE>   19. BEST U.S. PLAYER</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mathis. Yes, that's him on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
A male American soccer player on the cover of Sports Illustrated. A
male American soccer player who scores important goals for the
national team and is now wanted by some of the biggest clubs in
Europe. And to think the Galaxy shipped him to New Jersey to make
room for Luis Hernandez.</TE>
<TE>   20. BEST-CASE SCENARIO FOR TEAM USA</TE>
<TE>   Keller starts against Portugal and saves everything knocked his
way, save one, holding the final result to 1-0. Confidence buoyed,
the Americans get two goals from Mathis to beat South Korea, then
close out the group with a 1-1 tie with Poland. Team USA advances on
goal differential, meets Italy in the second round, begins
preparations for Germany 2006.</TE>

<HD>Kobe Has Enough Energy Left to Handle Bibby</HD>

<LD>While the jubilant Laker fans stuck around Staples Center to cheer
Robert Horry, refusing to leave until the guy who hit the
three-pointer that beat the Sacramento Kings had finished an on-court
interview, the real hero of Game 4 laid his exhausted body on the
locker room floor.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant took on more assignments than an overworked secretary.</LD>
<LD>   His roles are as varied as his baseball jersey collection. He
showcased his Derek Jeter Yankee model last series and wore a Boston
Red Sox top with Pedro Martinez's No. 45 on Sunday. Mariano Rivera
and Hank Aaron are among those in the closet.</LD>
<TE>   Clutch hitter, ace, closer, slugger--name the task and Bryant can
give you the basketball equivalent.</TE>
<TE>   He provided the bulk of their offensive punch in the second
quarter, when he scored 13 of the team's 31 points.</TE>
<TE>   He suggested what has been the most important tactical change of
the series.</TE>
<TE>   He shut off the spigot of Sacramento's offensive flow, point guard
Mike Bibby, and reintroduced the Lakers to the concept of defense in
the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Defensively tonight is where I really wanted to provide the
spark," said Bryant, who scored 25 points on 12-for-26 shooting in 42
minutes. "We were a little lethargic defensively. I felt like that's
where we needed our energy boost."</TE>
<TE>   It was Bryant who needed the energy boost postgame. He wrung every
ounce out of a thinned body that is still working through the
aftereffect of food poisoning a week ago. And when he was through, he
needed yet another bag of intravenous fluid to counter his
dehydration.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt light-headed during the game and was dead-dog tired,"
Bryant said. "I just came in the locker room after the game and had
to lie down."</TE>
<TE>   Saving a season can be exhausting work.</TE>
<TE>   It started in practice Saturday, when he told Coach Phil Jackson
that he was willing to take on the assignment of guarding Bibby.
Something had to be done, because Bibby has been tearing through the
Lakers the way Shawn Green took out the Milwaukee Brewer pitching
staff. Jackson was reluctant.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he didn't want to wear me out the entire game, but I
reminded him that's what I did for this team two years ago, was chase
little guards around," Bryant said. "I'd be more than willing to give
myself up to benefit the team if that's what he wanted me to do.</TE>
<TE>   "If that's what Phil wants me to do, I'm going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Jackson had no choice after Bibby continued to torch
Derek Fisher and Lindsey Hunter in the first quarter of Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby made five of his first six shots. He didn't rack up the
assists, but his ability to get by the Laker guards wrecked the Laker
defense and enabled his teammates to shoot open jumpers.</TE>
<TE>   Down by 24 points, Jackson finally put Bryant on Bibby in the
second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "You saw why it was so long: he got in foul trouble," Jackson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant picked up his fourth foul midway through the third quarter,
when he guarded Bibby almost exclusively. One came on a reach-in at
half court.</TE>
<TE>   "Kobe loves to gamble," Jackson said. "He's very active
defensively and he's got to be careful out there. We know that he can
play [Bibby] for some minutes, but I didn't want to play him 40
minutes or 48 minutes or 35 minutes, to be honest with you. I thought
he could guard him for a couple of quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel like it was worth the gamble. We had to gamble at that
particular point. I'm not a person that likes to pull out a lot of
gambles, but we had to. We had no other recourse."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant has a handle on Bibby's game. They know each other from
their childhood days, when their fathers (Joe Bryant and Henry Bibby)
played with the Philadelphia 76ers. Kobe and Mike played together in
the McDonald's high school All-American game, before Bryant went to
the NBA and Bibby went on to win an NCAA championship at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, Bibby had a little something-something for Bryant, including a
nasty little crossover that sent Kobe flying and freed Bibby for a
jump shot. But Bryant worked to deny Bibby the ball. He hustled to
stay in front of him. He harassed him all over the court when Bibby
dribbled.</TE>
<TE>   After scoring 14 points in the first 17 minutes, Bibby had only
seven the rest of the way. The Kings went from scoring 40 points in
the first quarter to scoring 34 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to really thank Kobe for that," Horry said. "He put
some pressure on Bibby, the offensive flow kind of stalled. Kobe put
a lot of pressure on Bibby and interrupted their groove."</TE>
<TE>   Bryant called Bibby "an orchestrator."</TE>
<TE>   "He dictates the tempo out there for the Kings," Bryant said.
"It's important to make him feel uncomfortable, to get out there and
harass him a little bit and not let him get to a point where he can
direct the offense like he's done for the entire playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings felt Bryant got a little too up-close and personal. Now
it's their turn to complain about the officiating.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if Bryant's length made a difference in how he was
defended, Bibby chuckled and rolled his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," Bibby said. "He's more physical too."</TE>
<TE>   King backup guard Bobby Jackson was even more vocal.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see all the grabbing and holding and all the stuff that
they let get away," Jackson said. "There's no way possible that that
should have been allowed. I think they let a lot of stuff get away in
that second half, but we've got to be able to counter that.</TE>
<TE>   "And the refs gotta be able to recognize that too. There's no way
[Bibby should be] taken out of the game like that, with all that
grabbing and holding that they were doing. Bryant said the non-calls
"come with being on the all-defensive team."</TE>
<TE>   Guess membership has its privileges.</TE>
<TE>   And Bryant has learned his lesson. No more room service.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got some enchiladas packed already," he said.</TE>

<HD>Moyer Continues Mastery of Orioles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Someone told Jamie Moyer about his dominance against the Baltimore
Orioles and the only response it drew was a slow shrug, with Moyer
lifting his shoulders several times.</LD>
<LD>   "OK," he said after a few seconds. "I'm sure if you look at
histories, there are teams you have good records against and teams
you have bad records against. The numbers, they happen."</LD>
<LD>   The delayed answer was not much different from the way he pitches.</LD>
<TE>   The soft-throwing left-hander gave up five hits in eight innings
to win his 13th consecutive decision against Baltimore as the Seattle
Mariners defeated the Orioles, 8-1, Sunday at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore's Jerry Hairston is used to seeing a faster changeup and
said Moyer's slow style is what makes him so effective.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, guys are throwing in the mid-90s and the changeup is
like 85 or 84," Hairston said. "That is his fastball. His changeup I
saw a couple times at 72. That's more like a double changeup. You see
it and go after it to attack the ball and it's not there yet."</TE>
<TE>   The Orioles head home having finally won at Safeco Field, yet they
still haven't figured out how to defeat Moyer. Baltimore ended a
15-game losing streak in Seattle on Saturday, winning for the first
time at Safeco.</TE>
<TE>   Moyer (4-2), who pitched parts of three seasons for the Orioles,
is 13-1 in his career against Baltimore, with his only loss coming in
1989 when he was pitching for Texas. It's his best record against any
major league team.</TE>
<TE>   "He's pitching as well as you can pitch," Manager Lou Piniella
said. "And at the same time, our offense came alive."</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Guillen went three for four with a home run, two runs
batted in and three runs scored. He missed hitting for the cycle by a
triple. John Olerud homered and doubled for Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Guillen sat out for most of the playoffs last season with
tuberculosis, but says he's 100% healthy now.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never hit for the cycle," he said. "It was a good chance for
me. I feel really comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Moyer gave up two singles to Chris Singleton, who extended his
career-best hitting streak to 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up a fourth-inning single to Tony Batista, Moyer
retired 11 consecutive batters before Mike Bordick singled in the
eighth. Moyer gave up five hits, no walks and struck out two in eight
innings.</TE>
<TE>   New York 14, Boston 5--Alfonso Soriano hit two of the Yankees'
season-high six home runs as they split a four-game series at Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Soriano led off consecutive innings with home runs to give him 14
this season, tying Texas' Alex Rodriguez for the AL lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Giambi and Robin Ventura hit three-run homers, and Jorge
Posada and Ron Coomer had two-run shots as the Yankees hit at least
six homers for the 16th time. New York leads the majors with 82
homers in 51 games.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 9, Chicago 2--Adam Bernero pitched eight innings for his
first career victory and Robert Fick went four for five with four
RBIs for the Tigers at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Bernero (1-0), making his first major league start since 2000 and
fifth of his career, held the majors' top offense in check, limiting
the White Sox to two runs, four hits and one walk.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 7, Tampa Bay 0--Barry Zito gave up two hits over seven
innings at Oakland and Adam Piatt homered twice as the Athletics
completed a three-game sweep of the Devil Rays.</TE>
<TE>   Zito (5-2) won his fourth consecutive decision and extended his
home winning streak to 12.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 3, Toronto 1--Bartolo Colon pitched a four-hitter and
the Indians completed a three-game sweep at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Colon (6-3) gave up only an unearned run and struck out five in
his third complete game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Thome hit his 11th homer as the Indians sent Toronto to its
fifth loss in six games.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 7-9, Texas 5-8--At Kansas City, Mo., Cory Bailey
became the first pitcher in Royal history to win both ends of a
doubleheader.</TE>
<TE>   Bailey (2-4) doubled his victory total of the previous five years,
pitching a scoreless ninth in the first game, then getting two outs
in the sixth inning of the nightcap.</TE>

<HD>Angels' Central Heating Shut Off</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Twins win game, 5-2, and weekend series to
salvage a little dignity for the AL Central Division, whose teams
have lost 16 of their last 20 to Anaheim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels lost a game and a series Sunday when, despite evidence to
the contrary, the Minnesota Twins showed that there really is some
life in the American League Central.</LD>
<LD>   The Twins' 5-2 victory before 22,854 at Edison Field was their
second in three games against the once red-hot Angels, who rebounded
from the worst start in franchise history in large part by beating up
on AL Central teams last month.</LD>
<LD>   Since losing four consecutive games to division rivals Oakland and
Seattle April 20-23, the Angels have gone 22-5, and 16-4 against AL
Central teams.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday's loss prevented the Angels from winning their ninth
consecutive series, a feat last achieved by the franchise in 1998. It
also dropped them three games behind the first-place Seattle Mariners
in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   "This series wasn't good, but you can't expect to keep up that
pace forever," said pitcher Kevin Appier, who suffered his first loss
since April 9. "You carry the confidence of having turned it around
before. This is a small series, but we have confidence to get back in
the groove quickly."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, who are off today, have a chance to further fatten up
on AL Central teams this week. They begin a six-game trip Tuesday
with two games at Kansas City, followed by four games against the
Twins at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are expecting another tough series against the Twins,
who continued to show why they will remain a presence in the playoff
hunt despite the threat of contraction.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a solid club, and it comes back to pitching," Angel
outfielder Tim Salmon said. "They peck away, manufacture runs and
play great defense."</TE>
<TE>   For the second time in as many games, the Twins thwarted Angel
rallies by throwing out two runners at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied, 1-1, in the fourth inning, the Angels had
runners at first and third with two out. Jose Nieves broke for second
base on a steal attempt, but instead of throwing to the bag, Twin
catcher A.J. Pierzynski threw the ball to second baseman Denny
Hocking, who fired back to the plate to nail Scott Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins led, 3-2, in the seventh when Spiezio reached third
again after doubling and advancing on a sacrifice bunt by Nieves.
David Eckstein, making his first appearance since injuring his left
knee Monday, pinch-hit and hit a ground ball to shortstop Cristian
Guzman, who backhanded the ball on the run and threw out Spiezio at
the plate.</TE>
<TE>   Pierzynski also threw out Salmon at second base on the back end of
an attempted double steal in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to stay aggressive," Angel Manager Mike Scioscia
said. "It just didn't work out today."</TE>
<TE>   Appier (5-2) gave up three runs and nine hits in 52/3 innings.
Only two of the runs were earned, marking the eighth time in 10
starts the veteran right-hander has allowed two earned runs or fewer.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a good contact-hitting team and some balls were falling
in and they hit some balls hard," Appier said. "They played a good
game and we definitely can't say we did. It was an off day for us."</TE>
<TE>   It usually is when the Angels face Eric Milton (7-3). The
left-hander, who threw a no-hitter against the Angels on Sept. 11,
1999, improved his career record against them to 5-0. He gave up two
runs and six hits in six innings.</TE>
<TE>   One of the runs came on a sixth-inning home run by Garret
Anderson, who ended an 0-for-10 stretch with a shot into the
right-field seats that pulled the Angels to within 3-2. It was
Anderson's eighth homer and his third in 17 at-bats against Milton.</TE>
<TE>   But Torii Hunter led off the Twins' eighth with a double against
reliever Lou Pote and scored on Cory Koskie's single to center.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins scored their final run in the ninth when Jacque Jones
led off with a double to left, moved to third on a single by Doug
Mientkiewicz and came home on David Ortiz's fly ball to the
center-field fence.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota closer Eddie Guardado gave up a one-out single to
Spiezio in the ninth but got Nieves to pop out and retired Adam
Kennedy on a ground ball to first baseman Mientkiewicz to earn his
15th save.</TE>

<HD>Nieves Utilizing His Chances</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Utility man Jose Nieves started for the second consecutive game
Sunday and, as is becoming his custom, took full advantage.</LD>
<LD>   A night after playing shortstop in place of the injured David
Eckstein--driving in a run with a squeeze bunt and producing his
third multihit game of the season--Nieves started at second base in
Sunday's 5-2 loss to the Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   Nieves, who had started two games in a row twice previously this
season, went two for three, scored a run and had a sacrifice bunt. He
also made a diving stop on a ground ball hit up the middle by A.J.
Pierzynski in the sixth inning, but flipped the ball past shortstop
Alfredo Amezaga for an error that allowed the Twins to score their
third run.</LD>
<TE>   Nieves, acquired last season from the Chicago Cubs in a trade for
pitcher Mike Fyhrie, has played shortstop, second base, first base
and third base this season. He is batting .288.</TE>
<TE>   "I come every day with the mentality that I might play. I'm
getting more chances because Eck is hurt, but I'm always ready,"
Nieves said.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia said Nieves is proving his worth.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been given more playing time because he's been productive,"
Scioscia said. "He can sit for a while and come off the bench, play
defense and hit at a minute's notice. He's very valuable."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein, who had not played since injuring his left knee Monday,
was used as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning after Scott Spiezio
hit a double and moved to third on Nieves' sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein hit a ground ball to shortstop Cristian Guzman, who threw
out Spiezio at the plate. Eckstein was replaced by pinch-runner Adam
Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said a determination on when Eckstein will return to the
lineup will not be made until Tuesday, when the Angels open a
two-game series at Kansas City. Eckstein said he still must test his
lateral movement.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Amezaga's first major league hit was a second-inning double
against Eric Milton that traveled down the left-field line and drove
in Nieves for the Angels' first run.</TE>
<TE>   "He threw me a curveball for a ball and then a fastball, so I knew
he was going to come in," said Amezaga, who was called up from
triple-A Salt Lake on Friday. "I just turned on it a little bit. It
feels good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel catcher Bengie Molina threw out both runners who attempted
to steal. He has thrown out 16 of 29 (55%) this season.</TE>

<HD>Fonoimoana Can Rest a Spell</HD>
<DH>Volleyball: He starts season right by winning Huntington
Beach Open with Holdren.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BRESNAHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eric Fonoimoana, one of the bigger typographical terrors in beach
volleyball history, could have made his surname much simpler by
changing it to what he felt last year: Frustration.</LD>
<LD>   Fonoimoana won the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics but faltered
last year on the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals tour, failing to
win an AVP match.</LD>
<LD>   The success that surrounded him at Sydney was surrendered amid a
string of substandard finishes, including two seventh places and a
ninth.</LD>
<TE>   He began this season with a new partner and, on Sunday, a new
result:</TE>
<TE>   A championship.</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana and Dax Holdren defeated Mike Whitmarsh and Canyon
Ceman, 21-18, 21-14, to win the Huntington Beach Open.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm only here to win," Fonoimoana said. "Whatever partnerships I
need to do to get me in that position, I'll find it. This is a good
start for us."</TE>
<TE>   Fonoimoana and Holdren never gave Whitmarsh and Ceman a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "We put in a lot of hard work during the off-season, probably a
lot more than anyone else," Holdren said.</TE>
<TE>   "The only people who could hurt us [today] was us."</TE>
<TE>   They rarely did so, clamping down against Stein Metzger and Kevin
Wong in a semifinal, 21-17, 19-21, 15-11, that ended a rough day for
the top-seeded men's team.</TE>
<TE>   Metzger and Wong breezed through their first three matches
Saturday, but lost two of three matches Sunday in the
double-elimination tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably played our best volleyball [Saturday] and that's not
good," Wong said.</TE>
<TE>   Karch Kiraly and Brent Doble, on the other hand, played better
volleyball on Sunday, to the delight of AVP fans who didn't see a lot
of Kiraly last season.</TE>
<TE>   The leader in tournament titles, Kiraly, 41, was sidelined most of
last season with injuries, appearing in only two tournaments and
finishing ninth in both.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly and Doble, however, had a strong run at Huntington, losing
to Whitmarsh and Ceman in a semifinal, 21-8, 21-23, 15-13. Kiraly and
Doble led the third game, 13-12, but dropped the final three points.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The women's final was packed with subplots.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Youngs was supposed to play with Barbra Fontana this
season, but opted out of the partnership last month because Fontana
had a sore back that limited practice time.</TE>
<TE>   Youngs made a phone call to Holly McPeak, who had planned to play
with Dianne DeNecochea this season.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak said yes to Youngs; DeNecochea and Fontana, left behind,
formed their own team.</TE>
<TE>   McPeak and Youngs dominated at first, stumbled in the second game
and recovered to defeat DeNecochea and Fontana, 21-18, 20-22, 15-9.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in a tournament together for the first time, McPeak and
Youngs look like the team to beat this season ... despite practicing
together less than a month.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a reason why I play with Holly: I want to win more," said
Youngs, who had a tournament-high 21 blocks in only five matches.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned a lot this weekend about ourselves, about our team.
We'll work on a couple things and be ready for Hermosa Beach in two
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   McPeak won her 57th championship, Youngs her 15th.</TE>
<TE>   Like the men's champions, McPeak and Youngs will split $14,500.</TE>

<LD>Checked your resume lately?</LD>
<LD>   Greg Cote of the Miami Herald suggests doing so to avoid the kind
embarrassing misrepresentations that cost Sandra Baldwin her job as
first female president of the U.S. Olympic Committee and George
O'Leary his job as Notre Dame football coach:</LD>
<LD>   "Fibbing on resumes has become America's fastest-growing sport. It
is now officially more popular than bowling.</LD>
<TE>   "O'Leary and Baldwin are the president and first lady of
background fabrication in sports--George is The Lyin' King--but not
the only practitioners. You've got to figure a million little
untruths are yet undetected as anxious administrators and coaches
scramble to 'revise' their resumes in the name of honesty or fear.</TE>
<TE>   "Better to own up to something you can couch as a regrettable
mistake blamed on a hallucinogen-spiked '60s drink than to be outed
as a liar."</TE>
<TE>   More Cote: "This might be the proper time to volunteer the need
for slight corrections in my own resume submitted to the Herald way
back when.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear boss, remember the line, 'Master's degree in literature from
Harvard?' Certain words were omitted because of a typesetting error.</TE>
<TE>   "The line should have read, 'Planned to obtain master's degree in
literature from Harvard had I been accepted for enrollment.'"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: What is the only NBA expansion team to reach the
playoffs in its first season?</TE>
<TE>   Down and out: Shaun Powell of Newsday doesn't hold out much hope
for the New Jersey Nets after their fourth-quarter collapse Saturday
against the Boston Celtics:</TE>
<TE>   "Can the Nets win a series after [Saturday] night? Oh sure, after
a fourth quarter in which they were outscored, 41-16, they said all
the right things, that it was only one game, that it wouldn't linger
into [today's] Game 4 ... blah, blah.</TE>
<TE>   "Sorry. A collapse--excuse me, a choke--like this tends to stick
to you like gum on a shoe."</TE>
<TE>   Brewin' up homers: There's no telling what the Dodgers' Shawn
Green, who tied a major league record with four home runs Thursday
against Milwaukee, could accomplish if he faced the Brewers more
often, says Dale Hoffman of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:</TE>
<TE>   "Last season he had the good fortune to bat 21 times against
Milwaukee pitching, and the result was five home runs. Let's do the
math here.</TE>
<TE>   "That comes to about a dinger every five times up. If Green could
have maintained that pace in his 619 total at-bats, he would have had
124 home runs last season, and Barry Bonds would still be just
another sullen outfielder."</TE>
<TE>   Fight on: France's defending World Cup champion soccer team
arrived in South Korea on Saturday amid tight airport security and
cries of "French team, fighting!" from dozens of mostly teenage fans.</TE>
<TE>   No, the fans weren't voicing fears of hooliganism. Koreans often
shout "fighting!" in English when they cheer sports teams.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The Chicago Bulls in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Dan Cook of the San Antonio Express-News says he
keeps hearing the same joke since the Spurs were eliminated from the
NBA playoffs by the Lakers:</TE>
<TE>   "What's the difference between the Spurs and a dollar bill?</TE>
<TE>   "Well, for a dollar you get four quarters."</TE>

<HD>Trojans Get Their Sweep</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Mike Gillespie figured the only way his Trojans would play
host to an NCAA regional is if they won the Pacific 10 Conference
championship. With Stanford and Washington sitting only one game back
entering the weekend, a sweep of UCLA was the only way they could
ensure that.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojans won't know if they will be one of 16 host sites until
this morning. But they will begin the playoffs as the Pac-10 champion
after beating the Bruins, 13-3, Sunday to take all three games at
Jackie Robinson Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Freshman Joey Metropolous homered and drove in seven runs for
USC--34-22 overall and 17-7 in the Pac-10--which won its second
consecutive conference title and fifth in Gillespie's 16 seasons as
coach.</LD>
<TE>   "I would think [we'd host]," Gillespie said. "But I've got mixed
feelings about the whole hosting thing. I would rather not be matched
up with all the other good clubs in the West. But if that's the case,
I'd rather be at home."</TE>
<TE>   Metropolous hit a three-run home run in the fourth, his 13th of
the season. He added a two-run double in the eighth that broke open a
close game and finished the scoring with another two-run double in
the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   He said a three-game sweep was the only thing on the Trojans' mind
all weekend. Stanford finished one game behind in second place and
Washington two games back in third.</TE>
<TE>   "We definitely wanted it," Metropolous said. "We knew if we didn't
get three of three, we might have to share the title. You don't want
to depend on another team losing."</TE>
<TE>   USC took all six games from UCLA (26-35, 9-15) this year. Since
going to six-game play in 1972, the only other Trojan season sweep
was in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   San Diego won its first West Coast Conference championship after
it scored four times in the eighth inning to rally for a 5-3 victory
over host Pepperdine in the deciding game of the best-of-three
series. Jacob Barrack's sacrifice fly brought in the eventual winning
run for the Toreros (38-21), who earned the automatic NCAA berth.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State (37-19, 17-7) strengthened its bid for a
postseason berth and a possible host site with a three-game sweep of
Cal State Fullerton. The 49ers won seven in a row to end the season.</TE>

<HD>Dodgers Lose More Than Merely a Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Dodgers lost their ace in the first inning Sunday afternoon, when
right-hander Kevin Brown was forced out of the game because of pain
in his surgically repaired elbow, and Manager Jim Tracy went through
his entire deck trying to piece together a winning hand.</LD>
<LD>   Nine wild innings, a combined nine relief pitchers, four double
switches, three improbable comebacks, two lead changes and about four
hours later, Arizona defeated the Dodgers, as David Dellucci's RBI
double in the 10th inning off knuckleballer Dennis Springer lifted
the Diamondbacks to a 10-9 victory before 47,388 in Bank One
Ballpark.</LD>
<LD>   The frustrating loss, in which the Dodgers bombed the usually
impenetrable Randy Johnson for seven runs and eight hits in five
innings, left the Dodgers with a 3-3 record on the trip. But they
won't know until Brown is examined today by team doctor Frank Jobe
whether their losses will multiply.</LD>
<TE>   Brown, who underwent surgery to repair a torn flexor tendon last
Sept. 27, experienced a grabbing sensation in his elbow, just below
his triceps, in the first, when Arizona took a 4-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Stan Johnston didn't believe the injury was as serious as
the setback Brown suffered April 13, when he was pulled from a game
at San Diego because of torn scar tissue in the elbow and went on the
disabled list. But the extent of the damage won't be known until
Brown is examined.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reason to think it's more serious, just because of the
location and the fact there was no swelling," Johnston said. Such a
problem, the trainer added, could occur "when the capsule covering
the [elbow] joint gets pinched or inflamed.... It's probably not
related to his surgery or scar tissue."</TE>
<TE>   Brown was unavailable for comment. Johnston said Brown felt some
discomfort while warming up in the bullpen, but Brown, whose
ambitious rehabilitation schedule has led some to speculate that
he--and not the Dodgers--has called the shots during his comeback,
insisted he was sound enough to pitch.</TE>
<TE>   After two singles, a walk and Steve Finley's two-run single,
catcher Paul Lo Duca noticed that Brown "didn't look right." Lo Duca
went to the mound, but Brown remained in the game.</TE>
<TE>   On the next pitch, a ball to Damian Miller, Lo Duca noticed Brown
"cringe." The catcher went the mound for another discussion that
seemed more like an arm-wrestling match, pitting the tough-as-nails,
obstinate veteran pitcher against the head-strong, second-year
catcher. And the surprise winner was ... Lo Duca.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me to give him the ball and I said no," Lo Duca said.</TE>
<TE>   "He asked again, and I said no. We already lost one guy, [Darren]
Dreifort, for the season [because of an elbow injury last June]. I
didn't want to lose Brown for the long haul. I didn't want him to
blow it out. After we talked, he was OK with it."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy refused to speculate on the severity of Brown's
injury, but he did not hesitate pulling his starter.</TE>
<TE>   "When I heard the word 'grabbing,' that was it," Tracy said. "It
wasn't a situation where I was going to let him throw a few warmup
pitches and see how he feels."</TE>
<TE>   Omar Daal replaced Brown and gave up a two-run single to Miller,
but the Dodgers, on the strength of Marquis Grissom's two home runs,
Adrian Beltre's homer and Brian Jordan's two-run single, took a 7-4
lead in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   But Dodger reliever Paul Quantrill, who hadn't given up a run in
his last 12 innings, was rocked for four runs and four hits in the
seventh, as Arizona took an 8-7 lead, eventually extending the lead
to 9-7.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers rallied for two runs in the ninth off Arizona
closer Byung-Hyun Kim to tie it, 9-9.</TE>
<TE>   Springer, recalled from triple-A Las Vegas on Friday night,
retired the side in order in the ninth, but he issued two walks
before Dellucci's game-winning hit in the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough game to lose," Green said, "but it would have been
a huge game to win."</TE>

<HD>Pitchers' Duel Turns Into a Hitters' Feast</HD>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>A highly anticipated pitching duel between Arizona's Randy Johnson
and the Dodgers' Kevin Brown never materialized Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Brown was forced out of the game because of injury in the first
inning, after being tagged for four runs and three hits, and Johnson
failed to hold a four-run lead.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson (8-1) received a standing ovation in the second inning
when he passed Walter Johnson for eighth place on the all-time
strikeout list, registering No. 3,509 with his punch-out of Brian
Jordan. Three innings later, the Dodgers railroaded Johnson to the
clubhouse.</LD>
<TE>   Marquis Grissom, who had one single and 15 strikeouts in 25
at-bats against Johnson, and Adrian Beltre, three for 21 against
Johnson, each homered in the third inning, trimming Arizona's lead to
4-2. Grissom, who had four hits in the game, capped a three-run
fourth with a two-run shot to left off Johnson for a 5-4 Dodger lead.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's bases-loaded, two-run, two-out single gave the Dodgers a
7-4 lead in the fifth, putting the finishing touches on Johnson's
worst start since April 8, 2001, when the 6-foot-10 left-hander gave
up nine earned runs, including three homers, in 52/3 innings against
the St. Louis Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to imagine a game featuring so many runs and hits
hinging on one split-second decision by a reliever, but this one was
costly to the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   After opening the seventh inning with four singles off Dodger
right-hander Paul Quantrill, including run-scoring hits by David
Dellucci and Craig Counsell to trim the lead to 7-6, the Diamondbacks
had runners on first and second with no out.</TE>
<TE>   Quinton McCracken dropped a sacrifice bunt to Quantrill, who had
plenty of time to throw to third for a force play and was being
instructed by catcher Paul Lo Duca to throw to third.</TE>
<TE>   But Quantrill went for the out at first instead. Luis Gonzalez
then walked to load the bases, Quantrill walked Erubiel Durazo to
force in the tying run, and Junior Spivey's RBI groundout gave
Arizona an 8-7 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was hard to hear Paul," Quantrill said. "That was a small play
in the large scheme of things, but the truth is, those plays can make
a difference. I could have had him at third."</TE>

<KH>CHARTING THE LEAD: A look at the Lakers' lead or deficit by
the minute</KH>
<HD>SACRAMENTO VS. LAKERS/ GAME 4 REPORT</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 40 LAKERS 20</LD>
<LD>   Highlight reel: Mike Bibby is a fine player and a nice guy, but he
had to play only half a game in this quarter. He had to concern
himself only on the offensive end because the Lakers fell into
another deep hole and didn't make him work on defense. He had no real
assignment because Derek Fisher wasn't going to do anything in the
Lakers' stagnant offense. This is an old-school thought, but how
about setting a hard pick on Bibby? Knock him down, offer him a hand
up. For the love of James Naismith, make him work at both ends of the
court. At this point, he was working over the Lakers and making it
look easy.</LD>
<LD>   Not in the box score: Kobe Bryant's name with any points next to
it. He went scoreless on four shots, including an airball on his
first attempt for the second consecutive game. If he still wasn't
right because of the bad burger, perhaps he should have been on the
bench in favor of someone who wasn't ill.</LD>
<TE>   Winning numbers: The Kings' 15-for-21 shooting (71.4%).</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: The Lakers' eight-for-27 shooting (29.6%)</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Shaquille O'Neal 9, Devean George 5;
Kings--Bibby and Vlade Divac 10.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--George and Rick Fox 3; Kings--Hedo
Turkoglu 4.*</TE>
<TE>   SECOND QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 65 LAKERS 51</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: As if on cue, Bryant snapped to life with his best
quarter since dialing room service in his Sacramento hotel room one
week ago. The Kings had Doug Christie on him, but it didn't really
matter because Bryant began to move the way he can and shoot the way
he can. He wasn't settling for the first available jumper, but moving
with the ball. Catching Bobby Jackson on him, Bryant even freelanced
a bit and took the shorter man down low. The Lakers didn't score
because of a poor entry pass to Bryant, but at least there was a sign
of life at long last.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: Anyone in a King uniform who can stop Bryant
when he's playing well. Christie has done a fine job against him in
the series, but he can't silence Bryant when Bryant is feeling well
and playing well.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Bryant's 13 points and six-for-10 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Kings' eight-for-21 shooting (38.1%).</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Bryant 13, O'Neal 5; Kings--Bibby 8,
Jackson 5.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal and Robert Horry 6;
Kings--Turkoglu 6.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THIRD QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 80 LAKERS 73</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: Bryant had been guarding Bibby off and on in Game
4 and it finally began to pay off. Bibby had to sweat a bit, rather
than waltzing around the floor as if without a care in the world.
Bibby is the key to all the Kings do with the ball. If he's huffing
and puffing, he's not able to set the offense as easily. Bryant
played him a good deal more physically--a little too physically
according to the Kings. But it was just the thing the Lakers needed
to start their second-half rally from oblivion.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The momentum shift was apparent from the
opening seconds of the quarter. The question was whether the Lakers
were beaten down after falling behind by 24 points. The oft-maligned
L.A. crowd was alive and filling Staples Center with noise. It seemed
to be pushing the Lakers toward loose balls and rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Winning number: The Lakers held the Kings to 15 points.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong number: The Kings' six-for-18 shooting (33.3%).</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--O'Neal 7, Bryant 6; Kings--Divac 5, Chris
Webber 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--Horry and O'Neal 4; Kings--Divac 4,
Webber 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH QUARTER: SACRAMENTO 99 LAKERS 100</TE>
<TE>   Highlight reel: The Kings did all the right things before Horry's
winning three-pointer. Divac cut off a driving Bryant, who missed.
The Kings swarmed O'Neal, who missed. Divac slapped the ball out of
harm's way, which is the play to make with time running out. Trouble
was it went right to Horry, who swished his 25-footer from almost
straightaway with zeros showing on the clock. Given another chance at
defending a two-point lead with 11.8 remaining, they could do all the
same things and probably have it work out for them in the end.</TE>
<TE>   Not in the box score: The luck factor. Stuff happens. After the
game, the Lakers chose to applaud Horry's clutch shooting. So did the
Kings, but with a trace of bitterness. The Kings, to a man, seemed to
believe it was a fluke play. Perhaps it was, but it also was the sort
of play that could turn a series in the other direction.</TE>
<TE>   Winning numbers: Three for four, Horry's three-point shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong numbers: For the Kings, it was the Lakers' 14-7 rebounding
edge.</TE>
<TE>   Leading scorers: Lakers--Horry 11, O'Neal and Bryant 6;
Kings--Divac 7, Turkoglu and Webber 4.</TE>
<TE>   Leading rebounders: Lakers--O'Neal 6, George and Horry 3;
Kings--Christie and Jackson 2.</TE>

<HD>Furyk's a Tiger Down Stretch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Furyk was plodding along Sunday when he noticed the Memorial
tournament was up for grabs, a dozen players within two shots of the
lead and three-time defending champion Tiger Woods long departed.</LD>
<LD>   "I was caught off guard by that," Furyk said.</LD>
<LD>   Then, he delivered a few surprises of his own.</LD>
<TE>   With a 30-foot birdie chip at No. 12 and a bunker shot that
rattled the pin and dropped for eagle on No. 15, Furyk seized control
with a back-nine charge that carried him to a seven-under-par 65 and
a two-stroke victory at Dublin, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   He proved a worthy successor to Woods' reign at Muirfield Village
with a finish that even Woods could appreciate. Furyk's 65 was the
lowest final-round score by a winner in the 27-year history of the
Memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how he did it," said John Cook, who joined David
Peoples as the runner-up in a tournament that figured to go down to
the wire.</TE>
<TE>   Furyk finished at 14-under 274, winning for the seventh time in
his career. He earned $810,000.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, trying to become the first player in 75 years to win the
same tournament four consecutive years, closed with a ho-hum 66 and
was gone by the time the fireworks began, proving that there is life
on the PGA Tour without him.</TE>
<TE>   David Duval, one of seven players who had at least a share of the
lead at one point, went through a rally-killing stretch of three
holes, but still closed with a 66 and tied for fourth, his first
top-10 finish of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Furyk gave the Memorial its first champion other than Woods since
1998.</TE>
<TE>   Woods never had a chance to win his fourth in a row, starting the
final round 12 shots back. He tied for 22nd, eight strokes behind.
Still, it was the 60th consecutive stroke-play event on the PGA Tour
in which Woods has finished in the top 30, dating to a tie for 56th
in the 1999 Bay Hill Invitational.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Nicklaus, playing in the group behind Woods, had three double
bogeys in a round of 79, although his 295 was still two strokes
better than Sergio Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz became the first native New Yorker to win the Corning
Classic, shooting a two-under 70 for a two-stroke victory over Rosie
Jones at Corning, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz, of Scotia, N.Y., finished at 14-under 274 and never lost the
lead she held since the opening round. The victory was worth $150,000
and moved her into second place on the money list behind Annika
Sorenstam with $459,699.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old Diaz, in her fourth full year on tour, notched her
first tour victory in March in Tucson. She won her second by holding
off Jones, who was seeking her third Corning title.</TE>
<TE>   Diaz reeled off 11 consecutive pars after a six-foot birdie putt
at No. 6 broke a tie with Jones, then birdied the final hole to close
the door. Jones shot a 71 to finish at 276, one stroke ahead of New
Zealand's Marnie McGuire and Italy's Silvia Cavalleri.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jay Sigel won for the first time since having surgery on both
shoulders, shooting a five-under 67 for a two-stroke victory over
Morris Hatalsky in the Farmers Charity Classic at Ada, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Sigel, who won for the first time in 94 starts since the 1998 EMC
Kaanapali Classic, had two eagles in the final round en route to a
13-under 203 total on the Egypt Valley course.</TE>
<TE>   The 58-year-old Sigel earned $225,000 for his seventh Senior PGA
Tour title.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The too few, the proud, the Kings.</LD>
<LD>   Seven little Kings went out to shock the world Sunday and came
within :00.1, which is the official time in the fourth quarter that
Robert Horry's three-pointer came crashing down on their day and
their dream.</LD>
<LD>   That was one of the Kings' problems Sunday and throughout this
series. With Peja Stojakovic out, seven of them have played all but
eight minutes (an eighth, rookie Gerald Wallace, got five in Game 1,
and a ninth, Lawrence Funderburke, three Sunday), which was one
reason the desperate Lakers could out-rebound them by 10 in the
second half, including the two on the play that will live forever in
Laker hearts.</LD>
<TE>   Almost magnificent, seven.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to be careful what I say here," Sacramento Coach Rick
Adelman said. "I think the game changed in the second half and we've
got to adjust to that. There was a lot of physical play. I don't know
if they wore us down but they turned it up and they did what they had
to to get back in the game....</TE>
<TE>   "I guess the last call, the foul that put Vlade [Divac] at the
line was like a fingernail foul, compared to everything that was
going on out there.... I mean, if that's not called, it's a layup,
it's a three-point game but that's just my opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Give the Lakers credit. You're right, it could have worn us down,
especially Mike [Bibby, who played 46 minutes]. I mean, Kobe [Bryant]
got into him and hounded him all the over the court and they brought
Lindsey [Hunter, who also guarded Bibby] ...</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that was my sour grapes."</TE>
<TE>   No, it wasn't a happy bunch of Kings, who went home from what had
turned into quite an exciting weekend in the big city. Divac told his
teammates they should feel great--"This is the way basketball should
be, a last-second shot"--but it would have been easier for them if it
had been their last-second shot.</TE>
<TE>   One moment, you're up 24 points, about to take a 3-1 lead ... the
next, they're celebrating as if Charles Lindbergh just landed in
Paris, the series is 2-2 and you're starting over.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a lucky play," Chris Webber said. "Coach didn't draw
that up. It wasn't the second or third option, that was a lucky
play.... Now Horry shooting it was not lucky. I have to give him
credit, that's a big-time player, but it was a lucky play."</TE>
<TE>   Ask the Lakers if they'd rather be lucky or good.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant misses, O'Neal rebounds and misses, Divac tips the ball,
which rolls out to Horry, camped at the top of the circle, where he
has been waiting patiently for just such a development....</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq had the ball inside," Webber said, "and he's not going to
pass it off, it's only a two-point game, so I got in there and I
think I got a hand up in his face and contributed to helping him
miss. Vlade and I talked about it. Vlade tipped the ball out ...</TE>
<TE>   "Horry's standing behind the three-point line. I saw that, I
recognized it, I tried to defend, I busted tail all the way out there
to try and get a hand in his face or something like that. It was too
little, too late. One more second."</TE>
<TE>   Said Adelman: "It's just one of those things. You give Horry
tremendous credit. He caught it, he was composed, but it's one of
those things....</TE>
<TE>   "If the ball is tipped to the right or left of him, he doesn't
have that same shot.... I guess Robert knew what he was doing and
fate shined on him."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, nobody believed in the Kings, but the Kings and their
fans, and let's face it, who else did the fans have to root for, the
River Cats' local minor league baseball team?</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, there were the Kings, torching the two-time
defending champions, never caving in the stretch, even as the
desperate Lakers unleashed an effort far beyond anything seen during
their season, in a Staples Center so loud, people went home with
their ears ringing for the first time in the three-year history of
the building, excepting rock concerts.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman, asked if he was satisfied with a split, wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   "People ask that question all the time, he said, bristling. "We
came here to win. We didn't come here to play the Lakers and
hopefully we could just survive and we would represent ourselves
well....</TE>
<TE>   "So no, you've got it all wrong. We're not in awe of them. We
think they've got a good team. And that's the bottom line. They're
the world champs so I have great respect for them, our team has great
respect for them. But we think we can compete with anybody."</TE>
<TE>   Said Webber, looking for blessings to count: "We'll be OK, just
come back and play, don't worry about this because we feel we have
the better team. It's all about the team."</TE>
<TE>   Today in Sacramento, Stojakovic, who has been out since May 9 with
a badly sprained right ankle, will try to practice. Even if he makes
it back, he won't be 100%, nor was he doing that well before he left,
averaging 18 points and shooting 32%.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if he's back, the Kings will be up to eight
players and they've been doing well enough with seven.</TE>

<HD>Beating Fonz's Was Cool Predictor</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Few thought victory at Illinois Derby was a
sign of things to come for War Emblem.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Once upon a time, War Emblem and Fonz's ran in the Illinois Derby.
Shipping in from Hollywood Park seven weeks ago, Fonz's had run well
against California's best 3-year-olds and went off at a respectable
7-2. At 6-1, War Emblem's odds were even higher.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the English-speaking world--and Saudi Arabia--know what's
happened since. War Emblem won the Sportsman's Park race, beating
third-place Fonz's by 10 3/4 lengths, to launch a hellbent streak
that's produced wins in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness and left the
Saudi-owned colt within one victory--in the Belmont Stakes on June
8--of becoming the first Triple Crown champion since Affirmed in
1978.</LD>
<LD>   While War Emblem shoots for another $1-million purse and the
$5-million Triple Crown bonus, Fonz's, unraced since suffering a hoof
injury in the Sportsman's race, is the 2-1 morning-line favorite in
today's Laz Barrera Memorial, a $150,000 race that kicks off a strong
card at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<TE>   No one could possibly have envisioned what was ahead for War
Emblem the day he beat Fonz's and seven others that April afternoon
in suburban Chicago, but David La Croix, who trains Fonz's, is as
high as trainer Bob Baffert on Prince Ahmed Salman's colt now.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's going to run with him in the Belmont?" La Croix said Sunday
at Hollywood Park, where his 7-5 favorite, Royal Place, finished
fourth in the $69,530 Willard Proctor Memorial Stakes. "I can see him
just coasting through the mile and a half."</TE>
<TE>   Five days after the Illinois Derby, the prince bought 90% of War
Emblem for $900,000. The next time La Croix saw Baffert, after the
Kentucky Derby, he said:</TE>
<TE>   "That colt you bought is not much to look at, but maybe that's
because he's so damn fast you can never get a good look at him."</TE>
<TE>   Before the Illinois Derby, War Emblem had won half of his six
starts, but was badly beaten in all three stakes outings. However, in
a one-mile prep for the Illinois Derby, he was a 10 3/4-length winner
in an allowance race at Sportsman's.</TE>
<TE>   "He got a 98 Beyer [speed rating] for that race," La Croix said,
"so you knew going into our race that he liked the track and had a
lot of run in him. Then the race set up for him when One Tuff Fox got
scratched."</TE>
<TE>   One Tuff Fox was another horse with early speed that might have
pressured War Emblem, but he was declared by the stewards when his
groom, in violation of Illinois rules, went to take a shower, leaving
the colt unattended after he had been given a bleeders' medication in
a holding barn.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics said that War Emblem was lucky a second time in the
Kentucky Derby, when the speedy Buddha was scratched and Medaglia
d'Oro, another horse with early speed, had a bad start, but War
Emblem silenced the doubters in the Preakness. He will be odds-on in
the Belmont, much like Real Quiet was when his Triple Crown
aspirations were dashed by Victory Gallop in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the presence of a heavy favorite, at least nine other
horses are probable for the Belmont: Proud Citizen, Essence Of Dubai,
Like A Hero, Magic Weisner, Perfect Drift, Puzzlement, Request For
Parole, Sarava and Sunday Break. Others that might run include
Medaglia d'Oro, Tracemark and Wiseman's Ferry.</TE>
<TE>   Trainer Wayne Lukas, who trains Proud Citizen, said Sunday that
Table Limit, who was 11th in the Preakness, will miss the Belmont
because of a hoof injury.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess everybody saw a 50-1 shot [Magic Weisner, who was second
at 45-1] almost come in at the Preakness, and they're willing to take
a chance," Baffert said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Crowned Dancer, a maiden, won the Willard Proctor by five lengths
at Hollywood Park. Jockey Martin Pedroza won three consecutive races
on the card.... Take Charge Lady, the winner Saturday of the Dogwood
Stakes at Churchill Downs, might be headed for Belmont Park for the
Mother Goose on June 29.</TE>

<HD>Checkered Win for Castroneves</HD>
<DH>Auto racing: Brazilian repeats Indy 500 victory when
Tracy's pass in final laps is disallowed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>After 495 miles of the Indianapolis 500, there finally was a pass for
the lead--and it didn't count.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Tracy, charging like a Canadian buffalo in the fading laps of
the 86th annual race Sunday, swept past leader Helio Castroneves in
the third turn of Lap 199, but a crash at about the same time between
Buddy Lazier and Laurent Redon brought out a race-ending yellow flag.</LD>
<LD>   Did the yellow caution light come on before Tracy's pass? Tracy
says no. Chief steward Brian Barnhart said yes.</LD>
<TE>   So, the winner appears to be Castroneves, who would be the first
back-to-back champion since Al Unser in 1970-71, and the first Indy
Racing League driver to win since CART teams resumed running here in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   But not necessarily.</TE>
<TE>   IRL officials posted "final official results" at 7:40 p.m., nearly
six hours after the race ended, but Team Green, owner of Tracy's car,
filed an official protest.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the video, it is unclear when the yellow light came on,
in relation to the time of the accident, but other data we have
accumulated supports the results as posted," said Barnhart. "Clearly,
the 3 car [Castroneves] was in front of the 26 [Tracy] at the
conclusion of the race."</TE>
<TE>   The protest will be heard today.</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves treated the more than 400,000 spectators on a sunny
day to his usual fence-climbing celebration after taking the
checkered flag. This time the Brazilian was joined by car owner Roger
Penske--who won his record 12th Indy--and most of the Marlboro crew.
The winning car was a Chevrolet-powered Dallara.</TE>
<TE>   "My interpretation of the rule is that when you are ahead of
somebody when the yellow comes out, then that's your position," Tracy
said. "I feel that we were ahead when the yellow came out. All I can
do is cross my fingers and pray and hope. If it's not to be, then I
congratulate Helio and Penske and the job they did."</TE>
<TE>   Castroneves and Penske, not surprisingly, had a different version.</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to conserve my fuel, and when the yellow light came
on when I was in Turn 3, the fuel light came on too," Castroneves
said. "Then Tracy went by me so fast. I thought, 'Hey, he passed me
on the yellow. He can't do that.'"</TE>
<TE>   Added Penske: "We had telemetry in the pits and when the yellow
light came on, Helio was in the lead. No question about it."</TE>
<TE>   The dramatics began when South African rookie Tomas Scheckter,
driving one of Eddie Cheever's Infinitis, crashed on Lap 173 after
dominating most of the race. Coming out of the fourth turn,
Scheckter's car went straight into the new SAFER barrier, scattering
debris down the front straightaway.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say anything broke because I'm not certain," said
the son of former Formula One champion Jody Scheckter. "It just went
in straight. It wouldn't turn. The thing is, we could have won. The
thing was on cruise control."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the mess was cleaned up, there were 20 laps left,
Castroneves was leading, followed by several lapped cars, then rookie
Alex Barron, Felipe Giaffone and Tracy. Giaffone and Tracy quickly
passed Barron.</TE>
<TE>   They remained in that order despite several parries by Tracy that
just fell short. Then, catching Giaffone trapped behind Dario
Franchitti's lapped car, Tracy made his move and his momentum carried
him right behind Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't think Helio could finish, I knew he was running low on
fuel, so I kept the pressure on. Then all of a sudden I was right on
top of him. I got a good run through [Turns] 1 and 2 and came up on
him as he was protecting his position down the back straightaway.</TE>
<TE>   "I made my move toward the outside and like I said, when I passed
him going into [Turn] 3, he came out of 3, and the [yellow] light was
on."</TE>
<TE>   Giaffone finished third, Barron fourth in a finish that probably
will earn him rookie-of-the-race honors at tonight's victory banquet.</TE>
<TE>   "Alex was in a position to win this race," said Tom Gloy,
president of Rayovac Blair Racing, Barron's team. "In reality he
almost did in it, not based on anything other than the fact that if
Scheckter had not hit the wall, we were the only team that could go
to the end. And when Scheckter hit the wall, it put us in a situation
where we were all packed up. But the key is that we were in the right
spot at the right time."</TE>
<TE>   Barron started 26th, just ahead of Tracy, who began the day 29th.</TE>
<TE>   Results of the Indy 500 have been changed before. In 1981 Bobby
Unser was declared the winner, but a day later Mario Andretti was
given the win when it was ruled that Unser had illegally passed cars
while blending into the field during a yellow caution period. An
appeals hearing did not decide the winner until the following
October, when Unser was given the official win by a 2-1 vote.</TE>
<TE>   The statistics show that there were 19 lead changes among nine
drivers, but not one of them occurred at racing speeds on
Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile rectangular oval. All but two
came when the leader made his pit stop.</TE>
<TE>   The other two came when the race leader, Tony Kanaan on Lap 90 and
Scheckter on Lap 173, crashed while in front.</TE>
<TE>   Kanaan, the CART veteran driving as a rookie here for Mo Nunn, led
23 laps before spinning in oil apparently left by pole-sitter Bruno
Junqueira's blown engine.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that's the price you pay for being in first place because
you're the first one to get to the oil," Kanaan said. "But I had a
blast. At least I can say I led the Indy 500. We did what we could,
but unfortunately, we missed it."</TE>
<TE>   Junqueira led the first 32 laps after pacing the field through
what was probably the worst start in 86 years. Instead of the famed
11 rows of three-abreast cars, starter Bryan Howard let them go
single-file with Junqueira at least two car lengths in front of
Robbie Buhl and the rest strung out behind.</TE>
<TE>   Scheckter, on probation for "unsportsmanlike conduct" at an IRL
race last month at Nazareth, Pa., appeared to have the strongest car
in the race while building leads of up to 10 seconds while running in
front for a race-leading 85 laps. Scheckter also had the day's
fastest lap, 226.499 mph, on Lap 20.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven drivers were on the lead lap at the finish, the most for
the 500 since 1963 when 14 drivers completed the full 500 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Five caution flags for 34 laps, including the final two, reduced
Castroneves' winning speed to 166.499 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Arie Luyendyk set the race record 185.981 mph in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Luyendyk, at 48 the oldest driver in the race and driving in his
17th 500, finished 14th.</TE>
<TE>   "The day actually was better than our finish would indicate," the
two-time winner said. "I did some 222-224 [mph] laps on my own and
that gave me hope that I'm not too old for this."</TE>
<TE>   George Mack, who joined Willy T. Ribbs as the only African
Americans to drive in the 500, was the second-highest rookie
finisher. He was 17th, two laps back of Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   "The 310 Racing crew kept telling me to relax because I got
frustrated a few times, and they had to try to keep me as calm as
possible so we could bring [the car] home," said Inglewood's Mack. "I
started to get a little too aggressive at one point, and they had to
remind me to back off. The team actually did more than I did. The
entire crew fought with me the entire race, both in the pits and over
the radio. This finish is theirs as much as it is mine."</TE>

<LD>No matter what track is a horseplayer's favorite, he or she will have
plenty of action on this holiday Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood Park is offering a Grade II stakes, a pair of Grade I's
and a $1-million guaranteed pick six, Belmont Park has the $750,000
Metropolitan Handicap and Lone Star Park has the return of Congaree
in the $300,000 Lone Star Park Handicap, one of seven stakes worth a
combined $1 million on the card.</LD>
<LD>   After six 3-year-olds begin the day at Hollywood Park in the
$150,000 Lazaro Barrera Memorial Stakes at seven furlongs, Astra will
try to defend her title in the $500,000 Gamely Breeders' Cup Handicap
and trainer Julio Canani will try to win the $500,000 Shoemaker
Breeders' Cup Mile for the third time in four years.</LD>
<TE>   Canani, who finished 1-2 with Silic and Ladies Din in 1999 and
2000, will try to hit the exacta again with Ladies Din, who is one
for one as a 7-year-old, and the improved Special Ring.</TE>
<TE>   Run at a flat mile on the turf, the Shoemaker also attracted the
Neil Drysdale-trained duo of Irish Prize and Touch Of The Blues. They
finished 1-2 in the race last year and Drysdale will be trying for
his third victory in the Shoemaker since 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan, which is one of the best betting races of the
year, has a definite California feel. Among the horses running are
Grey Memo, D'wildcat, Swept Overboard, Aldebaran and Crafty C.T.</TE>

<HD>Webber: 'We're the Better Team'</HD>

<LD>The bounce-back factor is always important for a team that loses on a
buzzer-beater. Instead of seizing a commanding three-games-to-one
lead, the Kings returned Sunday evening to Sacramento tied with the
Lakers, two games apiece.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the luckiest thing I've ever seen in my life," Hedo Turkoglu
said of Robert Horry's three-pointer that made the Kings 100-99
losers in Game 4 on Sunday at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Whether the Kings get over it before Game 5 on Tuesday at Arco
Arena remains to be seen. They sounded down, but defiant after
squandering a 24-point second-quarter lead. They also sounded
frustrated and angry.</LD>
<TE>   "I would rather lose this way than by five or 10 points," Chris
Webber said. "We were one lucky play away from a win. We were one
second away. We'll be OK. We'll come back and play. We feel we're the
better team."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' physical play in the second half and the referees'
willingness to let them play in that manner troubled King Coach Rick
Adelman.</TE>
<TE>   "The game is not supposed to be that physical," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to adjust. Every game is different.... I am interested
in how we respond. We've never not responded.</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum has shifted, though, so I'm interested to see how we
respond. I'm sure I know the answer, though."</TE>
<TE>   Backup point guard Bobby Jackson watched the Lakers' physical
pressure against starter Mike Bibby and gnashed his teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "As a point guard, you see everything going on," Jackson said.
"There's no way possible that should be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the refs] let a lot of stuff go. The refs have to recognize
it. With all the grabbing and holding they did, they let them [the
Lakers] play like that."</TE>
<TE>   Facing the same pressure, Jackson missed 10 of 12 shots and scored
nine points.</TE>
<TE>   He was averaging 16.3 points in the series and was Sacramento's
third-best scorer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Swingman Peja Stojakovic, out since spraining his right ankle May
9, is expected to participate in more strenuous drills during the
Kings' workout today at Sacramento. Stojakovic has been running
lightly on his own the last few days, but Adelman made it clear it
was time to step up his workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "If he can cut and it feels good, we'll make a decision [today],"
Adelman said of putting more pressure on Stojakovic's ankle in the
workout. "He's only been doing straight up running and some shooting.
Now, we'll see how he does."</TE>

<HD>Indy 500 Is Classic Confusion</HD>
<DH>Commentary: Trying to determine the winner tops the list of
interesting moments at the race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The buzz before the race was, with the best field in years, this
year's Indianapolis 500 would be a classic, a race to remember.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, well. Half a loaf and all that.</LD>
<LD>   It ended under the yellow flag, so it won't go down as a classic.
It certainly was a race to remember, though, from its rag-tag,
single-file start right on through its but-who-really-won? finish.</LD>
<TE>   In between were such memorable moments as:</TE>
<TE>   * Pole-sitter/leader Bruno Junqueira stalling his car in the pits,
then later unintentionally oiling the track with a blown engine,
causing subsequent leader Tony Kanaan to hit the wall.</TE>
<TE>   * Robbie Gordon's pit fuel tank catching fire and blowing its top
while crew members sprayed Gordon and his car with fire retardant to
keep him from doing the same.</TE>
<TE>   * Leader and dominant rookie Tomas Scheckter, a hot young driver
known for his aggressiveness, hitting the wall while enjoying an
eight-second lead with only 27 laps to go.</TE>
<TE>   * Gil de Ferran driving out of the Penske pit--the Penske pit,
mind you--and almost immediately losing his just recently changed
right rear wheel.</TE>
<TE>   And all that was before things got really interesting.</TE>
<TE>   At issue, ultimately, was the victory, and it remains at issue
today, pending resolution of a protest.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Helio Castroneves, Roger Penske's other driver,
took the checkered flag and, as is his custom, climbed the fence in
celebration, then drank the traditional winner's milk.</TE>
<TE>   But had he really won?</TE>
<TE>   Or had Paul Tracy, as he maintained, passed Castroneves just
before the yellow light flashed on Lap 199 of the 200-lap race?</TE>
<TE>   Race officials ultimately ruled that Tracy had passed after the
caution period had been called and that Castroneves was the winner,
but for the longest while, confusion reigned and the crowd of 400,000
left the track not knowing which driver deserved the accolades.</TE>
<TE>   As the race neared what suddenly looked like a sprint to the
finish, Castroneves led but was nursing his car's fuel supply, having
skipped a pit opportunity after teammate De Ferran's loose-wheel
goof. Behind him, but also behind a lapped car driven by Dario
Franchitti, were second-place Felipe Giaffone, a Brazilian rookie,
and Tracy, Franchitti's Team Green teammate.</TE>
<TE>   On Lap 197, Giaffone made his move, trying to pass Castroneves for
the lead. Franchitti was in the mix, though, and Giaffone had to go
high on the track, opening the door for Tracy, who slipped past
underneath and set out after Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   He caught him on the next-to-last lap, just about the time rookie
Laurent Redon and 1996 winner Buddy Lazier tangled behind them on the
track, bringing out the yellow and sending Redon to the hospital with
a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   "I caught Helio and passed him on the back straight, going into
Turn 3," Tracy said. "I passed him on the outside and ... the green
[light] was still up. In my eyes, I saw the green.... My
interpretation of the rule is that when you are ahead of somebody
when the yellow comes out, then that's your position."</TE>
<TE>   Precisely so, but Castroneves begged to differ on Tracy's
recollection of the pass.</TE>
<TE>   "The yellow light came on and ... then Tracy came by and I said,
'He passed me on the yellow! He passed me on the yellow!'"</TE>
<TE>   Trackside officials apparently saw it that way, for they declared
Castroneves the leader and eventual winner.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, however, things were not so certain. Scoring-and-timing
posted Tracy as the winner on the TV screen in the press room,
showing Castroneves second, Giaffone third. That posting stayed up
for five minutes or more, then suddenly it was changed--Giaffone
showing as the winner. Then, finally, seconds later, Castroneves was
posted as the winner, Tracy second, Giaffone third.</TE>
<TE>   Unofficial printed results were distributed later, showing that
finish--but also listing Tracy as having taken the lead on Lap 199
and leading for two laps, which would have made him the winner.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Barry Green, owner of Team Green, was threatening to
protest, which, he was told, he couldn't do until official results
were posted. Instead, Indy Racing League officials showed him what
they considered definitive tapes of the disputed pass. He asked for
something more definitive, so they went searching for more.</TE>
<TE>   And, naturally, this being Indianapolis, there were politics to be
considered, on several levels.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy, in his younger years, drove for Penske, won races for him,
in fact. But Tracy is a free spirit and Penske is a buttoned-down
kind of guy--he's known as "the Captain"--and when their
disagreements reached the impasse state, Tracy was politely fired.</TE>
<TE>   That was in their CART days.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after last season, Penske, at the urging of his sponsor,
Marlboro, jumped from CART, an organization he had helped form, to
the IRL, the rival group founded by Indianapolis Speedway owner Tony
George. The move of CART's premier team to the IRL gave George's
struggling group instant credibility.</TE>
<TE>   So now, here's a dispute between Tracy, a CART guy, and Penske,
the IRL's newfound savior, about who had won the Indy 500, the event
around which the IRL was built.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a lot of politics playing into this," Tracy
said. "I don't want to dig too deep into that, but there's politics
in everything, every form of motorsports, and I hope it doesn't come
to that."</TE>
<TE>   Penske's take on that?</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfortunate that a situation like this comes up and people
take sides," he said. "I don't think there's any politics involved.
I've got to go along with what the chief steward says. It's my
understanding that he said we won the race."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, nearly six hours after the race had ended, Brian
Barnhart, IRL vice president and chief steward of the race, ruled
definitively that Castroneves had won.</TE>
<TE>   Team Green filed its protest and Barnhart said IRL officials would
hear that protest today. So, until then, at least, Castroneves is the
winner, Tracy the runner-up.</TE>
<TE>   A race to be remembered, certainly. But hardly a classic.</TE>

<LD>Game 4 turned in a lot of little corners. The Lakers, and Kobe Bryant
in particular, hounded Mike Bibby into three second-half points on
five second-half shots.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers had 25 offensive rebounds, three short of the franchise
playoff record, seven in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   They held the Kings to 41.7% shooting in the second half, when the
Kings missed all eight of their three-point tries.</LD>
<TE>   While that might not qualify as suffocating, exactly, the Kings
made 15 of 21 shots in the first quarter and shot 54.8% in the first
half.</TE>
<TE>   It also turned at the free-throw line. Overrun by the more
aggressive Kings for most of the first three games, the Lakers took
27 free-throw attempts, while the Kings took 26.</TE>
<TE>   And, in the final minute, it was the Lakers who made their free
throws, and the Kings who missed the one that made them vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal was fouled and made two free throws that brought
the Lakers to within 98-97.</TE>
<TE>   On the next possession, Vlade Divac was fouled intentionally, and
he hit the front of the rim with the first one, then made the second.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were clutch baskets," Bryant said of O'Neal's free throws.
"He always says he'll hit them when the money's on the line, and he
did that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who took four liters of intravenous fluids last Monday in
Sacramento, needed another Sunday afternoon, after Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robert Horry said he never considered stepping in to attempt a
tying two-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "I never moved," he said. "I said that I wanted that three so bad.
I am the type of guy that's going for a three. I am not going for a
two to tie the game, because anything can happen in overtime. I am
going for the win."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horry wasn't the only Laker power forward to beat the buzzer.
Samaki Walker made a running 34-footer at halftime that brought the
Lakers from 17 to 14 points back. Those were Walker's only points.</TE>
<TE>   Said Horry: "A lot of guys, when the ball is coming, sit there and
look at the clock, then it makes you rush your shot. I was like, 'If
I don't get it off in time, we lose. If I do, it's money.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Horry had 14 rebounds and is averaging 12.8 in the series. ...
From their largest, latest deficit, the Lakers outscored the Kings,
74-49. Between the first quarter of Game 1 and early in the second
quarter of Game 4, the Kings had outscored the Lakers by 50 points
(326-276).</TE>

<HD>Horry Is Even Money</HD>
<DH>Last Shot Proves to Be Rallying Cry for L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After the buzzer, the last of a frantic afternoon, the jump shot that
left Robert Horry's hand with six-tenths of a second remaining, the
shot that spellbound an arena and a series and two cities, fell.</LD>
<LD>   It fell, and a budding NBA dynasty still had hope, and the Western
Conference finals still had purpose, and the Lakers let go of their
fears on a taut, rigorous Sunday afternoon at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   Horry gathered a loose ball 25 feet and straight on from the
basket and swished a three-pointer that gave the Lakers a 100-99
victory over the Sacramento Kings, who only then lost the last of a
24-point lead. The series is tied at two games apiece, with Game 5 on
Tuesday night in Sacramento.</LD>
<TE>   After a week of creating the improbable, after beating the Lakers
in nearly every manner, the Kings made one critical error: They left
the ball in Horry's grasp, with the game nearly over, when one shot
could change the course of the series.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a second from needing only one victory to eliminate the
twice-defending champion Lakers, and leading, 99-97, the Kings
watched Kobe Bryant miss a short runner with five seconds left, and
Shaquille O'Neal miss a layup with three seconds left. Vlade Divac
reflexively knocked the ball away from the rim, up the middle of the
lane, one bounce to Horry, who took it with 1.5 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the time was going to run out," Divac said.</TE>
<TE>   Horry stepped left, leaped, and let go, as Chris Webber floated
past, his right hand inches beneath the ball. The buzzer sounded and,
as a series held its breath, as Bryant held his fists to his
shoulders and Rick Fox laid his head back to watch the ball pass over
him, the shot fell, exactly perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh," Horry said, "I knew it."</TE>
<TE>   He knew, because of Philadelphia last year. Because of Portland
last month. Because of all the other shots like it that have fallen
for him, in all the funny little moments that have widened his eyes
and slowed his heart and drawn the basketball to his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a steel kind of will," Laker Coach Phil Jackson said of
Horry, whose shot gave the Lakers their first lead since 2-0, and
only their second since the second quarter ... of Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers trailed by 20 after one quarter and by 24 in the second
before they pushed back, before Bryant clung to Mike Bibby. After
scoring 65 points in the first half, the Kings scored 34 in the
second, and the Lakers found a semblance of a shooting touch, and
something of a defensive conscience.</TE>
<TE>   Horry scored 16 points in the second half, 11 of them in the
fourth quarter. O'Neal scored 27 points, including two free throws
with 26.9 seconds left, and took 18 rebounds. And Bryant, whose
exhaustion required another liter of intravenous fluids after the
game, scored 25 points. But after their final shots were off, it was
Horry who carried them all back to Sacramento with a feeling of
something other than desperation.</TE>
<TE>   "That's lucky shot, that's all," Divac said. "You don't need skill
in that situation. You throw it, it goes in, it goes in."</TE>
<TE>   Typically he is subdued, but Horry was nearly aghast that Divac
would suggest such a thing.</TE>
<TE>   "If you go back and look at the shot, a luck shot is one of those
guys who has no form," Horry said. "If you look at the shot, it was
straight form. He shouldn't have tipped it out there. It wasn't a
luck shot. I have been doing that for all my career. He should know.
He should read the paper or something."</TE>
<TE>   And Horry laughed. He was taken by what he had done and how it had
changed things.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes after his shot remade the series, the emotionally
wrecked crowd chanted his last name, and Horry waved back. In the
pandemonium, public address announcer Lawrence Tanter was moved to
repeat something he had heard before, seven years ago, something
Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said from a championship podium.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Tomjanovich had held the trophy aloft and bellowed it,
Tanter engaged his microphone and said, "Never underestimate the
heart of a champion!" Horry was on that team, and so it fit, and
people cheered him again. Tanter had never said it before, and it had
been a long time since Horry had heard it.</TE>
<TE>   "He saved us today," O'Neal said. The season was not yet doomed,
not quite, but the Lakers played on the brink of that.</TE>
<TE>   It had become hard. So hard, again.</TE>
<TE>   They had become a team disjointed, on offense and defense. They
missed the simplest jump shots and then failed to defend the same.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's cool demeanor often was gone, replaced by pointed shouts
to play defense, to find the offensive rhythm within them, and
scowls.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings have played four games against the Lakers, none of them
with Peja Stojakovic, their second-leading scorer, and have never
looked inferior.</TE>
<TE>   Into that stepped Horry, in time to save them, from themselves. In
time to do something dynamic, when nothing else would be enough.</TE>
<TE>   Asked early what it would have been like had the Lakers lost,
O'Neal said, "I don't believe in 'if.' If my father didn't meet my
mother, and go on a date, I wouldn't be here. I don't believe in
'if,' but we just wanted to chop it down, just keep fighting and
fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Which, then, led him to Horry's shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great day," O'Neal said. "It was a blessed day for us.
Thank God for Robert. Thank God his father met his mother too."</TE>

<LD>Amazing game, astonishing ending at Staples Center on Sunday. And,
overall, quite a chess match. But I favor Sacramento in this series
for checkmate.</LD>
<LD>   This was a game where the ending transcended all of what happened
in the beginning and middle. But consider this: the most unlikely
scenario of the afternoon was not Robert Horry's fortuitous winning
shot, but Shaq O'Neal making six consecutive free throws down the
stretch, each one as gut-wrenching as the one before.</LD>
<LD>   And consider that the Lakers don't even have a prayer with a
last-second shot if Samaki Walker, of all people, doesn't fling in a
34-foot three-pointer just before the half to cut Sacramento's lead
from 17 to 14 points. I hesitate to call it a jump shot. Let's just
say one man's shot put is another man's J.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers made a couple of adjustments that allowed them to
finally turn the game against a very good team. Call it Phil
Jackson's moves in the chess game.</TE>
<TE>   First, switching Kobe Bryant to Mike Bibby on defense played a
huge role. Kobe is the Lakers' best defensive player. He not only
contained Bibby more, but disrupted him. And he was doing a lot of
this with four, and then five fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Kobe does so many things that are hard to see and understand.
Bibby plays off picks--he may be the best in the game at this. And
Kobe negated his effectiveness somewhat by jumping through and not
getting caught under the picks. Kobe also keeps going even when he is
caught in a pick. He also is anticipatory. He plays the pick even
before it becomes a pick. He has the size and the speed and the game
smarts for this, unlike almost anybody.</TE>
<TE>   And then, Derek Fisher, who needs to hunker down on defense
against Bibby when he plays him--maybe not play him so tight high and
defend him in a more defined area--did a fine job, when Kobe switched
to Bibby, of not letting Doug Christie, whom he had to switch to,
post him up effectively.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby is really becoming a handful for the Lakers. What he does
now, better than anybody in basketball--it is almost Magic
Johnson-esque--is make the pass that leads to the pass that gets the
assist. Another big part of the chess game is how Sacramento plays
Shaq. The Kings have a nice double-dip going on him. When he is going
against Scot Pollard, Vlade Divac's replacement, he is going to get
bodied and blocked out and banged around. He also is going to have to
chase more because Pollard runs him, and Shaq has to play 40-42
minutes for the Lakers to win. Then the chess game changes with Divac
in. Now, Shaq faces a guy who just as likely will bang you as flop on
his back at the first sign of light contact. He is a coy veteran who
can dunk on you as well as pick, roll, draw, hand off and run outside
and hit a perimeter shot.</TE>
<TE>   It all adds to something important: Sacramento makes Shaq play
every minute.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the fan called Laker Boy.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the game, attention shifted to the big screen that hangs
over the court. And there he was, in full Laker jersey, halfway up
the first level in the east end, dancing and wiggling and showing
moves you'd never see at any of the better L.A. nightclubs, mostly
because they'd never let this guy into the better L.A. nightclubs.
There was so much moving on this guy from the waist to the neck that
it would have made Jell-O look stiff. Clearly, here was a guy who had
never walked past the front door of any hamburger joint in the
country.</TE>
<TE>   I, of course, was personally disgusted.</TE>
<TE>   But give him credit. He really got it going in Staples. He pretty
much did what the Laker shooters couldn't do all afternoon, until
Horry's game-winner. He brought the crowd to its feet.</TE>

<HD>Martin's Patience Pays Off</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Martin patiently worked his way to the front as NASCAR's young
stars took themselves out of contention in the longest race of the
season.</LD>
<LD>   Martin took advantage of Jimmie Johnson's rookie mistakes to win
the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday night at Concord, N.C., ending a two-year
victory drought and giving Roush Racing its fourth consecutive
victory in the race.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if I'm going to win another one, so you better
believe I'm going to party all night--and I don't even drink," said
Martin, breaking from his usual serious demeanor. "This may be the
last time I ever stand down there, I don't know."</LD>
<TE>   Martin, at 43 the anchor of Jack Roush's four Winston Cup teams,
held off teammate Matt Kenseth over the final laps to end his 73-race
winless streak with his 33rd career victory.</TE>
<TE>   After the race, NASCAR said Martin's car was an eighth of an inch
below the minimum height requirement and that any penalties would be
handed out Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Kenseth was the last driver to fail a postrace inspection when his
car was a quarter of an inch short after his February victory at
Rockingham.</TE>
<TE>   His crew chief was fined $30,000, but the victory and the points
were not affected.</TE>
<TE>   Roush, recovering from serious injuries sustained last month in a
plane crash in Alabama, also fielded winning cars in the spring race
at Lowe's Motor Speedway for Jeff Burton in 1999 and 2001 and Kenseth
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Roush reached Martin by cell phone in the winner's circle and
joined in the raucous celebration.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't really hear him, but I know he must have had tears in
his eyes not being here," Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   It was Martin's fourth victory at Lowe's, tying him with Jeff
Gordon for the most wins at the track among active drivers, and he
won a $1-million bonus from the series sponsor for winning the race.</TE>
<TE>   He had promised his crew when they became eligible for the bonus
that he would share it with the entire team if they won the race.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really, really important to win this race because there
are so many guys on this team who hadn't been to victory lane," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is their win, not mine. I'll take the trophy with me back to
Florida, that's enough."</TE>
<TE>   Robby Gordon successfully completed "double duty" racing in the
600 after finishing the Indianapolis 500 earlier in the day. He
finished eighth at Indy, flew to Charlotte and was in his Richard
Childress-owned car for the start of the second race.</TE>
<TE>   But his Chevrolet was never a factor en route to a 16th-place
finish.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long day, the biggest thing was the cramps," said
Gordon, clearly drained. "I got a cramp in my right leg the final 30
laps that really slowed me down."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   David Coulthard seized the lead before the first curve and held
off Michael Schumacher to win the Monaco Grand Prix at Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   Coulthard, who started second on the grid, beat pole-sitter Juan
Pablo Montoya to the first curve and led the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Coulthard, the 2000 Monaco champion who had not finished better
than fourth this year, claimed his 12th career victory.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, the winner of five of seven races this year, chased
Coulthard over the last 30 laps, but couldn't find a place to pass on
the narrow, twisting streets of Monte Carlo.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya was forced to retire on the 46th lap when smoke began
pouring out of his Williams BMW engine, ending his bid to add the
title to his Indianapolis 500 win. The Colombian crashed on the
second lap last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tony Pedregon raced to his second funny car victory of the year
and second in a row at Heartland Park Topeka in the O'Reilly NHRA
Summer Nationals in Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   Pedregon had a quarter-mile run of 4.910 seconds at 320.58 mph to
hold off Tim Wilkerson (4.999 at 302.69).</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Russell raced to his third career top-fuel victory,
defeating Larry Dixon with a run of 4.638 at 314.90. Troy Coughlin
topped the pro stock competition, defeating Mark Whisnant with a run
of 6.924 at 198.44.</TE>

<LD>More than three months after the Olympics ended, the IOC disqualified
a pair of Austrian cross-country skiers and banned two team officials
from the next two Winter Games in a blood-doping case from Salt Lake
City.</LD>
<LD>   The International Olympic Committee executive board announced the
doping sanctions Sunday in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, after a
three-month investigation, rejecting the Austrians' claim that the
blood treatments were merely for therapeutic reasons.</LD>
<LD>   Marc Mayer and Achim Walcher, who both finished far out of medal
contention, were each disqualified from their events and had their
results removed from the records.</LD>
<TE>   Mayer finished 25th in the 50-kilometer race and 55th in the 10K
pursuit, and Walcher was 38th in the 10K pursuit and 45th in the 30K.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Mayer, the Nordic team coach and the skier's father who
performed the transfusions, and Volker Mueller, the German
chiropractor who prescribed the blood treatments, were banned from
the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, and the games in 2010.</TE>
<TE>   It's the first time the IOC has banned an athlete or team official
for more than one future Olympics.</TE>

<TE>   Jennie Finch and Jackie Coburn hit home runs in the 11th inning as
Arizona advanced to the NCAA softball championship game with a 6-2
victory over Florida State at Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats (55-11) will play today against California (55-19),
which advanced to the title game for the first time by defeating
Arizona State, 3-0, earlier in the day. Arizona is going for its
seventh national title, and second in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Finch, who threw 196 pitches and struck out 17 for the victory,
hit her 16th homer over the left-field fence with two outs to give
Arizona a 3-2 lead. After a walk and a hit batsman, Coburn hit a
three-run shot.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, Jocelyn Forest threw a one-hitter for
California. Forest gave up only a second-inning single to Phelan
Wright and retired the last 18.</TE>

<TE>   Defending champion Matais Boeker of Georgia and fourth-seeded
Jesse Witten of Kentucky defeated players from Stanford to advance to
the NCAA tennis final at College Station, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The top-seeded Boeker, a junior from Argentina, beat David Martin,
6-4, 6-4, and Witten, a freshman from Naples, Fla., edged Ryan
Haviland, 6-4, 5-7, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Martin and Scott Lipsky advanced to the doubles final, defeating
Duke's Phillip King and Michael Yani, 7-6 (6), 6-3. The second-seeded
Stanford duo will face Auburn's Andrew Colombo and Mark Kovacs, 6-4,
6-4 winners over Illinois' fourth-seeded Michael Calkins and Amer
Delic.</TE>

<TE>   Ronnie Ekelund scored on a penalty kick in the second half to lift
the San Jose Earthquakes (5-3-2) to a 1-1 tie with the Chicago Fire

Soccer game. Chicago's Kelly Gray opened the scoring in the ninth
minute with a low shot past goalkeeper Joe Cannon.</TE>

United Soccer Assn. game</TE>

<TE>   Three-time Tour de France champion Lance Armstrong won the Midi

France. Armstrong had an overall time of 19 hours 22 minutes 36
seconds in the five-stage race.... American Tyler Hamilton beat
Sergei Honchar by 31 seconds in an 18-mile time trial and moved into
third place at the Giro d'Italia at Numana, Italy. Jens Heppner

<LD>With more than a dozen future Hall of Famers playing for the Colorado
Avalanche and Detroit Red Wings, the Western Conference finals is
living up to the hype.</LD>
<LD>   "It's simply unbelievable the amount of skills and the quality of
the leadership on both teams," Colorado Coach Bob Hartley said Sunday
after both teams practiced. "And that's why this round is even at
2-2, and that's why there is so many Hall of Famers on both sides."</LD>
<LD>   Even the players are impressed.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the best hockey I've seen," Detroit's Sergei Fedorov said.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of tonight's Game 5 in the Western Conference finals at
Joe Louis Arena will take a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody knows it's big," Fedorov said.</TE>
<TE>   Hartley said it will be a game-time decision whether defenseman
Mike Keane will play tonight. Keane missed Game 4 with a rib injury.</TE>

<HD>Helton's Big Day Ends in a Sweep of Giants</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Batting in the seventh inning, Todd Helton needed a triple to
complete the cycle.</LD>
<LD>   "No, I wasn't thinking about it at all," Helton said. "I was too
tired to run that far."</LD>
<LD>   Helton struck out, but by then it didn't matter.</LD>
<TE>   His three runs batted in, including a homer, led the Colorado
Rockies to their sixth consecutive victory, 10-6, over the San
Francisco Giants on Sunday at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado, 20-8 under Manager Clint Hurdle, moved two games over
.500 for the first time since June 19, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   After starter Jason Jennings struggled early, Rick White, Kent
Mercker, Todd Jones and Dennys Reyes combined to pitch four shutout
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Jennings (5-2) won his fourth consecutive decision for the first
time in his career. He gave up six runs--five earned--and eight hits
in five innings.</TE>
<TE>   "J.J. didn't have his best stuff, but he battled and got us
through five," Hurdle said. "On offense, we were relentless."</TE>
<TE>   The Rockies, trailing 6-3, got two runs in the third, three in the
fifth and two more in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants, who were swept for the first time this season, have
lost five of six games.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 7, Cincinnati 5--Keith Lockhart made the most of a rare
start, hitting a three-run homer off Chris Reitsma (3-1) to lead the
Braves at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Vinny Castilla and Wes Helms also homered for Atlanta to back
starter Greg Maddux (5-2).</TE>
<TE>   Ken Griffey Jr., making his second start for the Reds since
returning from a seven-week stint on the disabled list, went 0 for 4.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Philadelphia 5--Jose Vidro went four for four to
extend his major league-best hitting streak to 20 games and Vladimir
Guerrero had an RBI single to cap a four-run seventh inning at
Montreal as the Expos swept the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   In the seventh, Vidro he had an RBI single against Vicente Padilla
(6-4) to draw Montreal within 5-4. After Vidro stole second, Jose
Macias scored the tying run on Padilla's wild pitch. Guerrero brought
the Olympic Stadium crowd of 19,015 to its feet with a single that
scored Vidro with the go-ahead run.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 7, Pittsburgh 3--Fernando Vina hit a grand slam and
drove in five runs with the help of pitcher Jason Simontacchi's first
two career hits as the Cardinals won at Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Simontacchi (3-0), a former Pirate farmhand, limited Pittsburgh to
homers by Aramis Ramirez and Brian Giles over 7 1/3 innings to
outduel fellow rookie Josh Fogg (5-3), who gave up three homers.</TE>
<TE>   New York 3, Florida 0--Jeff D'Amico gave up three hits over seven
innings and Mike Piazza hit a two-run double at New York.</TE>
<TE>   D'Amico (4-4) allowed one walk and struck out five. Mark Guthrie
pitched the eighth and Scott Strickland worked the ninth for second
save, completing a combined five-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 8, Milwaukee 7--Pitcher Dennis Tankersley homered and
doubled at Milwaukee and got his first major league victory in four
starts, and the Padres ended a losing streak at five games.</TE>
<TE>   Tankersley (1-0) gave up five runs in 5 2/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 7, Chicago 5--Craig Biggio's two-run single capped an
eighth-inning rally at Houston and the Astros ended a losing streak
at six.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros overcame a five-run deficit and ended the Cubs' winning
streak at five.</TE>

<HD>Looking for Luck in All Right Places</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After the Lakers had danced off the floor in shock, after the Kings
had been barking in their showers in despair, after 18,000 fans had
flooded the downtown streets singing "Hor-ry" as if it were the
recessional song at high mass, the question was raised.</LD>
<LD>   Was it luck?</LD>
<LD>   An answer can be calculated as quickly as voices were lost and
breaths disappeared in the most chill-bumped Laker moment of the Phil
Jackson era.</LD>
<TE>   Of course it was luck.</TE>
<TE>   Vlade Divac tips away a rebound that just happens to land at the
feet of Robert Horry?</TE>
<TE>   Luck.</TE>
<TE>   This pass from the opposing team just happens to give Horry enough
time to throw up a three-point shot with less than one second
remaining on the clock?</TE>
<TE>   Luck.</TE>
<TE>   That Horry made the shot Sunday afternoon to give the Lakers a
100-99 victory over Sacramento in Game 4 of the Western Conference
finals, that was skill.</TE>
<TE>   Horry has hit more pressure 25-footers than Tiger Woods. He has
more game-winning hits than Barry Bonds. He is more money than Eddie.</TE>
<TE>   But the play was set up by luck. The Lakers won by luck. The
series has been tied at two games apiece by luck.</TE>
<TE>   Luck, luck, luck.</TE>
<TE>   And so what?</TE>
<TE>   There is no asterisk for luck. There are no penalties for luck.</TE>
<TE>   Luck does not diminish a win.</TE>
<TE>   Luck simply adds to a legend.</TE>
<TE>   That is what is happening here, you know. Smooth brick by crumbled
brick by magical brick, these Lakers are building memories that will
last long after their glares fade and their tattoos wrinkle.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting across the court from Horry on Sunday afternoon, stuck to
my chair for several long minutes after the swish, strangely unable
to move amid the chaos of hugging ushers and howling fans and a court
overrun with joy, I had one thought.</TE>
<TE>   I've been here before. We've all been here before.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the clincher against Sacramento and the comeback
against Portland.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the comeback in San Antonio and Horry's posing
three-pointer in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Horry's three-pointer against Portland, and Kobe
Bryant's rebound and shot against San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   And now this, the most dramatic and emotional and downright
unthinkable of all.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the second quarter, the Lakers trailed by 24.</TE>
<TE>   With four minutes remaining, they trailed by eight.</TE>
<TE>   With two minutes remaining, they trailed by six.</TE>
<TE>   With 11.8 seconds remaining, they trailed by two.</TE>
<TE>   But Devean George had been hustling for offensive rebounds, and
Bryant had been hustling Mike Bibby across the court, and Shaquille
O'Neal had been hustling as he used to always be hustling.</TE>
<TE>   And then it happened, as it has always, inevitably happened with a
team that is sometimes hard to love but always impossible to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   Six-tenths of a second that perhaps changed the course of eight
months.</TE>
<TE>   A possible 25-foot bridge to a third consecutive NBA crown.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson laughed and said he couldn't have possibly drawn up
that last play, but it symbolized the best of the Lakers in the last
three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant takes the ball to the basket. He fails, but O'Neal is
watching his back.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal takes the ball to the basket. He fails, but Horry is
watching his back.</TE>
<TE>   Horry's shot felt like that Bryant-to-O'Neal alley-oop of 2000,
but with a twist.</TE>
<TE>   This didn't clinch a series win, but it may have saved a season.</TE>
<TE>   Said Brian Shaw: "Finishing like we did could take the steam out
of them. I'm pretty sure they thought they had it in the bag."</TE>
<TE>   Said Rick Fox: "We hope this is the reason we win the
championship."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this could also be little more than a reason that it
takes the Kings two more games to win the series.</TE>
<TE>   They are clearly an equal team to the Lakers. They possibly will
be welcoming injured Peja Stojakovic back to the lineup this week.
They have two of the last three games at home.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing they didn't have Sunday was the ability to conjure
up the one play that surely would have sent them to the NBA Finals.
While available to anyone, it is the sort of conjuring that is
usually only possible with champions.</TE>
<TE>   Snarled Divac: "Just a lucky shot."</TE>
<TE>   Moaned Chris Webber: "We were one lucky play from winning."</TE>
<TE>   To which the Lakers should reply, indeed, and thank you.</TE>

<HD>Celtics and Nets Are Sputtering to Conclusion</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Pucin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>This is not the Golden Age of NBA basketball.</LD>
<LD>   It can't be if the team with the second-best player in the game
(according to MVP voting) blows a 26-point third-quarter lead to a
team with two scorers, no center and a point guard of many words and
few great accomplishments.</LD>
<LD>   What fun it was to see the greatest-ever playoff comeback. The
Boston Celtics get credit for proving that the best of sports is the
mental resilience that can be imparted by one optimistic star. Celtic
forward Antoine Walker tells his teammates, especially Paul Pierce,
to quit the quitting and don't, to steal from the late Jim Valvano,
give up, don't ever give up. And they didn't. So good for Walker.</LD>
<TE>   The moment of triumph was emotionally rewarding, but the
post-mortem is discouraging.</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kidd, who has had a growing number of supporters (especially
on NBC) saying Kidd should have beaten out Tim Duncan as the NBA's
most valuable player, could not keep his New Jersey Nets from losing
all of its third-quarter 26-point lead and getting outscored, 41-16,
in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd, according to some "experts," may be one of the best point
guards ever? They even compared Kidd to Oscar Robertson and Magic
Johnson because he had triple-doubles in the first two games of the
Eastern Conference finals against Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine Robertson or Magic letting their teams lose
26-point leads?</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, 63 years old and missing a kidney, right now might not
have let a team do that. Robertson and Magic would have scored 20
points themselves in a fourth quarter if they had to.</TE>
<TE>   Kidd has a large heart, great hustle, an inconsistent shot and the
inability to gather enough teammates to follow his lead. Maybe
because the other players aren't good enough. Maybe because Kidd
isn't as good as we want him to be.</TE>
<TE>   It's pointless to keep looking for the next Michael Jordan and
pointless to always refer to Michael moments, but would MJ have ever
let his team blow that lead?</TE>
<TE>   If the Nets come back to win the series, if they can throw out the
memories of how they blew that lead, if they can convince themselves
it was no big deal to become the first team in playoff history to
lose a game after leading by 21 points at the end of the third
quarter, if they truly believe what happened Saturday was only one
loss, it will be the greatest recovery since Lazarus.</TE>
<TE>   And also very disappointing for it will mean the Celtics are less
good than imagined.</TE>
<TE>   The Nets didn't practice Sunday. What would be the point?</TE>
<TE>   They gathered in a hotel ballroom, a sullen, desolate collection
of dazed basketball players and were forced to tell us all that they
were over Saturday's debacle and that the epic 94-90 loss didn't
matter.</TE>
<TE>   "We win [today]," Kidd said, "and we've accomplished what we set
out to do. Win one game here and get home-court advantage back."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody snickered. At least not so you could hear.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Kenyon Martin was more honest. He suffers everything more
visibly and vocally than most players. "It feels as if we lost the
series," Martin said. "But we haven't yet. We've got to find some way
to come back, though. If we don't, as a team, bounce back today, it
will carry over until tomorrow. If it carries over until tomorrow, we
might as well just pack up and go home for the summer."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets might as well do that now.</TE>
<TE>   Because the thing is, whatever team wins this series--the happily
discombobulated Celtics who lead the best-of-seven affair 2-1 and
still aren't quite sure how, or the Nets who will for a long time be
associated with the biggest playoff collapse ever--that team isn't
very good.</TE>
<TE>   If you build yourself a 26-point lead at the Celtic home and you
can't hold on, you have terrible, terrible problems.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics have two guys who are reliable scorers, Walker and
Pierce, the pride of Inglewood High. And until Saturday's fourth
quarter, Pierce had been dangerously off-kilter.</TE>
<TE>   He had shot five of 34 in the previous game and three quarters.
And many of the misses weren't even close.</TE>
<TE>   The Celtics have no center. Tony Battie is listed as one. But he
is really a 6-foot-11 forward who would make a nice backup on the
Lakers or Kings. He would come in and get some rebounds, inflict some
energy on a game, then sit down. Battie isn't a scorer and he's not a
great defender.</TE>
<TE>   But in the East finals, Battie is lucky. The Nets apparently have
no center either. Todd MacCulloch is 7 feet tall.</TE>
<TE>   He played in the NBA Finals last season with the Philadelphia
76ers (which tells you what you need to know about the Eastern
Conference) and he sat on the bench for Saturday's decisive fourth
quarter, when the Nets could manage only 16 points and could muster
no oomph or anger or desire or shooting.</TE>
<TE>   And if you get yourself into a 26-point hole, at home, against the
Nets, you have terrible problems.</TE>
<TE>   Celtic Coach Jim O'Brien acknowledged as much Sunday. "The bad
news is, we didn't play very well," he said. "That can't continue if
we expect to win the series."</TE>
<TE>   By O'Brien's count, the Nets have won eight of the 12 quarters
played so far. By O'Brien's count, the Celtics also aren't playing
NBA championship basketball.</TE>
<TE>   No kidding. Whoever wins the West, flaws and all, would drill
these Celtics, magical comebacks and all.</TE>
<TE>   There hasn't been the jubilation one might have expected out here
over the Laker predicament. Maybe because the Nets and Celtics can't
even imagine themselves as NBA champions.</TE>
<TE>   No one has that much imagination.</TE>

<HD>Divac Gets on a Roll, Then Taps Out</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A simple tap.</LD>
<LD>   Vlade Divac has been waiting 13 years for such a simple tap,
through seven years with the Lakers, two with the Charlotte Hornets
and four with the Sacramento Kings.</LD>
<LD>   He joined the Lakers for the 1989-90 season, hoping to follow in
the giant steps of the just-retired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, hoping to
win an NBA title alongside Magic Johnson and James Worthy and the
rest of the remaining Showtime cast.</LD>
<TE>   Wrong place, wrong time.</TE>
<TE>   Divac's biggest contribution to the Lakers was not his arrival,
but his departure. It was his trade to Charlotte that gave the Lakers
the draft choice they used to get Kobe Bryant, which, in turn, led to
two championships.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday at Staples Center, with 12 seconds to play, Divac felt he
was about to take a giant step toward the championship ring that has
so long eluded him.</TE>
<TE>   With a team-high 22 points, with seven rebounds, with a solid
defensive effort, Divac had helped his Kings hang on to a 98-97 lead
in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals against the Lakers.
Victory would give the Kings a 3-1 series lead with two of the
possible three remaining games in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Not only that, but Divac had the ball in his hands and a clear
shot at the basket. He drove in, scored, and figured his team was
guaranteed no worse than a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he heard a whistle cutting through the roar of the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they had called me for traveling," Divac said.</TE>
<TE>   Nope. Foul on Rick Fox.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised," Divac said. "He didn't touch me at all. I
thought I had scored. I did score."</TE>
<TE>   Divac still had a chance to get those two points at the free-throw
line. He stepped up there having connected at an 80% success rate
Sunday, having hit eight of 10. This time, he had to settle for 50%,
getting one of two.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that stretched the King lead to two. Now all they had to do
was defend at the other end. Bryant put up a shot that missed, but
Shaquille O'Neal got the rebound. Divac didn't know exactly how much
time was left, but he knew it couldn't be more than a few ticks of
the clock. If he could just get that darn ball out of there, his team
would be home free.</TE>
<TE>   Divac got his chance against O'Neal in the battle of
seven-footers. The Laker center's shot came off the rim and hung in
the air. All Divac needed to do was tap it out of there like a
volleyballer.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq was on my back," Divac said. "I was fighting for position. I
didn't have time to think about what to do with the ball. I just
knocked it out of there and I thought time would run out."</TE>
<TE>   Almost. But Divac's tap went to the wrong place at the wrong time,
straight to Robert Horry just outside the three-point line. With half
a second remaining, Horry fired up the game-winning three-pointer.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just a lucky shot," Divac said. "You don't need to have
skill to do that. You just throw it up and if it goes in, it goes
in."</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Chris Webber backed up his teammate.</TE>
<TE>   "It is something I would have done," he said of the tap. "It was
something we all would have done."</TE>
<TE>   Seeing Horry with the ball in hands, Webber came leaping out, arms
outstretched.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to bust tail," Webber said, "tried to get out there, get
a hand in his face, but it was too little, too late."</TE>
<TE>   In the stunned King locker room afterward, Divac tried to boost
his teammates' spirits.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the guys they should feel good," Divac said. "A basketball
game should be decided on a last-second shot."</TE>
<TE>   But Divac didn't feel good. Not even when Laker owner Jerry Buss,
encountering Divac outside the locker room, told him he thought it
was the best game Divac had ever played.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to make his way to the interview area, Divac instead
accidentally walked into the Laker locker room.</TE>
<TE>   Same old story for Divac, wrong place, wrong time.</TE>

<LD>Never a doubt, although I do have concerns.</LD>
<LD>   I called the Holiday Inn on J Street, concerned that local
basketball fanatics might be looking to leap off one of Sacramento's
best-known landmarks after Sunday's shocking finish.</LD>
<LD>   "Not yet," said J.B. Villalovos, the night manager. "There are a
couple more games left, and then we will see what happens."</LD>
<TE>   Two more Laker wins, and all those cowbells are going to be scrap
metal and I fear for the mental health of those yokels who had to
think they would be attending a playoff-clinching game Tuesday in
Arco Arena after watching the Kings go ahead by 24 points Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's got to be disappointing for those people," a sympathetic
Rick Fox said. "They had to think they had a win, which would have
put them in the driver's seat. But the way we won it, we kind of
kicked them out of the car."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE LAKER comeback really started with Samaki Walker's three-point
shot from 34 feet with less than a second remaining in the first half
to bring the Lakers within 14 points. Robert Horry had the choice of
throwing the ball to Kobe Bryant or Walker for the shot, and
obviously Horry went to the better three-point shooter.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm two for two now in my career," Walker said. "I hit one in the
final seconds against San Antonio a while back."</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure Bryant has ever hit two three-pointers in a row in
his career.</TE>
<TE>   He was 0 for 1 against the Kings, and required an IV following the
game. After all, it is a long way to have to shoot the ball.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IN THE Laker locker room after the game, a breathless Fred Roggin
told Walker he was live on TV, and then asked, "What were you
thinking when you took that three-pointer before the half?"</TE>
<TE>   Walker said, "Make the shot."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KOBE APPEARED at the postgame news conference decked out in
red--his Tiger Woods Sunday-victory-clinching look.</TE>
<TE>   He was wearing red shoes, red-tipped sunglasses and a red and
white Red Sox jersey with pitcher Pedro Martinez's No. 45 on the
back. Last week he wore a Derek Jeter Yankee jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a baseball fan," he said, "but I like individual talent
like Jeter and Pedro have."</TE>
<TE>   I asked him if the Dodgers had any individual talent.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, the guy you were bashing all last week, and who made major
league history this week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   I know one thing, Shawn Green would never wear red shoes in
public.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE BIGGEST issue facing the Lakers as they prepare to leave for
Sacramento tonight is who will be food tester for Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   Isn't that why they still have Mitch Richmond on the roster?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WONDER if Bill Walton is saying "My Los Angeles Lakers" today?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DEREK FISHER has hit 35 of the 109 shots he has attempted in the
playoffs and 18 of the 57 three-point shots he's tried. It's almost
to the point now that Times handicapper Bob Mieszerski has hit more
long shots than Fisher, and Mieszerski almost never hits it big.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have missed 153 of the 240 shots they've taken in the
last 10 quarters against the Kings. And Slava Medvedenko hasn't even
taken a shot yet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THERE WERE 11.8 seconds remaining with the Lakers trailing by two,
and an older gentleman, you know, about sports editor Bill Dwyre's
age, left his courtside seat with a beautiful young girl, who I'm
sure was his daughter, to beat the crowd out of the arena. I would
imagine that's one guy who has never watched "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   LAKER OWNER Jerry Buss hangs around with young girls too, but he
showed staying power Sunday, not only hanging in there for the whole
game, but making his way to the locker room afterward to congratulate
the players.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't remember all the games, but at this moment, that was the
most exciting game I've ever seen," Buss said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE KINGS were making a big deal out of the "lucky" turn of events
that had the Lakers winning, and when a reporter asked Chris Webber
to clarify his remarks, he said, "I know everyone in here wants to
beat me up."</TE>
<TE>   Putting aside an acute case of paranoia for a moment, I think if
you took a vote, everyone in there would have been satisfied just
getting the chance to meet Tyra Banks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE FIRST sign of a crack in the Kings' drive to close out the
Lakers: They went 0 for 8 in the second half from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SOMETIMES IT takes years to build a champion.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God," Shaquille O'Neal said, "[Horry's] father met his
mother."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don Rickles topped the celebrity list for Friday's loss; wouldn't
you like to have been in his car on the way home listening to him
talk about the Lakers' performance?</TE>
<TE>   Will Smith, who looks like Horry, and Denzel Washington, who's as
old as Horry, were the top celebrities in the crowd Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'M TRYING to get confirmation that Staples concession sales went
up 10% the last two days. Maybe it's just a coincidence, but Utah
basketball Coach Rick Majerus was in Staples the last two games
writing columns for The Times.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IT WAS very hard to hear in Staples Center because of crowd noise
when our Dodger beat reporter in Arizona called to tell me that
"Kevin Brown was feeling pain in the posterior of his elbow." At
first I thought he said, "Kevin Brown was a pain in the posterior,"
and I didn't see where that was news and worth bothering me at the
Laker game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Jason A:</TE>
<TE>   "Please tell me you will be joining the Lakers in Sacramento so we
can give you the proper welcome in our cow town."</TE>
<TE>   That stuff is so hard to get off your shoes, so I think I'll stay
home and watch the game on TV.</TE>

<HD>Schedule Looks Fresh in France</HD>

<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The pre-French Open intrigue has been limited to wondering about the
fitness of various players. There's Marat Safin's back, the shoulder
of Tommy Haas, Venus Williams' wrist and the shape of Felix
Mantilla's car.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, the day before the tournament has been
dramatic--a last-minute withdrawal of a big-name player and
reshuffling of the draw. But it was quiet on another sporadically
rainy day at Roland Garros.</LD>
<LD>   The Sunday withdrawal came on the men's side, as 1998 semifinalist
Mantilla pulled out because of rib injuries after a car accident
Tuesday. A motorcyclist ran a red light, smacked into Mantilla's car,
and the air bag expanded full-throttle into the Spaniard's ribs.</LD>
<TE>   This is not exactly headline news, even in Spanish papers.
Although he beat Pete Sampras on clay this spring--who hasn't,
lately?--Mantilla's best days appear to have passed.</TE>
<TE>   The curious development seemed to be today's schedule. It looked
more like the U.S. Open than the French Open. Scheduled on the main
show court, Court Philippe Chatrier, were Venus Williams, three-time
champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, Sampras and Monica Seles.</TE>
<TE>   Not a single French player.</TE>
<TE>   Had Arlen Kantarian, the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s chief executive
officer for professional tennis, somehow wrested control from
tournament co-directors Alain Riou or Herve Dutriel?</TE>
<TE>   The only things missing were an Ashley Harkleroad exhibition on
Philippe Chatrier, or an Andy Roddick night match. (Granted, there
are no official "night matches" here, thank goodness).</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the great French hope, 15-year-old Richard Gasquet, and
all-too-often-hyped Amelie Mauresmo were put on the second show
court, Court Suzanne Lenglen, and the current top-ranked French
female player, eighth-seeded Sandrine Testud, was dispatched to Court
1.</TE>
<TE>   Retro marketing?</TE>
<TE>   We have another take. How about refreshing?</TE>
<TE>   Tennis officials throughout France are traditionally invited to
take in matches at Suzanne Lenglen on the first day, so it makes
sense for Gasquet and Mauresmo to play there.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, it makes sense to acknowledge Kuerten, who has won the
last two French Opens, and Williams, the winner of four of the last
seven Grand Slams, on Philippe Chatrier.</TE>
<TE>   As for Sampras and Seles, another three-time winner, there is
always the thought this could be their last appearance at the French
Open.</TE>
<TE>   As for Gasquet, playing on Suzanne Lenglen should lessen the
pressure on the youngster, a wild-card entrant playing in his first
Grand Slam event.</TE>
<TE>   And perhaps a change would help the nervous Mauresmo, who was gone
within the first few hours of the French Open last year, losing to
the unheralded Jana Kandarr of Germany, on Philippe Chatrier.
Mauresmo admitted she mentally melted down because of the
overwhelming pressure and high expectations from French fans.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Mauresmo was one of the favorites, having won four of
her five tournaments before Paris. That isn't the case in 2002 with
the talk centering on Italian Open champion Serena Williams, German
Open champion Justine Henin of Belgium, defending champion Jennifer
Capriati, 2001 French Open runner-up Kim Clijsters of Belgium and
Venus Williams, who has an ideal draw in the early rounds.</TE>
<TE>   The men's field is considered to be more open, mainly because of
Kuerten's hip surgery in February. He is rounding into shape,
gradually, and it wasn't too long ago that he wasn't even sure he
would make it here.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a magic place," Kuerten said.</TE>
<TE>   He drew a heart on the court when he won his third French Open
title last year, and those feelings motivated him to accelerate his
comeback. Still, Kuerten is probably a few weeks short of ideal form
and, more or less, gives Italian Open champion and 1999 French Open
winner Andre Agassi the slight edge.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see a guy who everybody is looking for as the one to beat
these [last few] weeks," Kuerten said. "Probably Agassi, who really
played well in Rome, and we all know when he's in good shape and
playing well, he's tough to beat. [Juan Carlos] Ferrero is the same."</TE>
<TE>   Ferrero, of Spain, has been suffering from a leg injury, and Safin
hurt his back last week in Germany. Before the injuries, U.S. Davis
Cup captain Patrick McEnroe placed them, along with Roger Federer and
Agassi, on the top rung of contenders, and former champion Carlos
Moya, Haas of Germany, Lleyton Hewitt of Australia and Roddick in the
next group. Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco is McEnroe's outside
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Although Hewitt is the top-seeded player, he has not gathered much
support from McEnroe or many others.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of Hewitt's titles has come on clay, and that was not on
red clay.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, Hewitt, he's got a game you think would be good on clay,"
McEnroe said. "But he doesn't move as well on clay. He doesn't hit as
heavy a ball, which becomes more evident on clay than it does on a
hard court because he can counterpunch on a fast court and use his
speed. Whereas on clay, his normal shots just don't have as much
weight on them.</TE>
<TE>   "I think clay is his worst surface. I think he's got a better
chance to win Wimbledon than he does the French."</TE>

<HD>Shotput Has Its Place at Eugene</HD>
<DH>Track and field: Top three go beyond 71 feet as Toth sets
meet record at Prefontaine Classic. Jones wins women's 100.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Forgive Kevin Toth his exuberance. It's not often shotputters get a
moment in the sun, and U.S. shotputters had never enjoyed a day like
Sunday's Prefontaine Classic, when three exceeded 71 feet and claimed
the top three places.</LD>
<LD>   "This is shotput town now," Toth said after setting Hayward Field
and meet records with a personal-best throw of 72 feet 9 3/4 inches.
"It's not track town anymore."</LD>
<LD>   That's a bit of an exaggeration. But Toth, Adam Nelson (72-0 1/4)
and UCLA alum John Godina (71-10 3/4) staged an entertaining show for
a sellout crowd of 11,227 gathered to honor the memory of distance
runner Steve Prefontaine and applaud respectable performances from an
elite field.</LD>
<TE>   "This was electrifying," said Toth, who is making a strong
comeback from back surgery. "This was more entertaining than the
WWF."</TE>
<TE>   And it was real too. So was the drama in many other events.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Montgomery didn't match his season best but still won the
men's 100 in a wind-aided 9.97 seconds. If he needed incentive, he
got it from seeing world-record holder Maurice Greene watching at the
finish line. Greene didn't compete here, but they will both run at
Athens June 8.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery had claimed that Greene pulled strings to get
Montgomery uninvited from the Athens meet. However, Montgomery said
Sunday that Greene got him reinstated. "I want to be in that race, no
matter what it takes," said Montgomery, who was second to Greene at
last year's World Championships.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't had a chance to see him run, but he's had a chance to
see me, and he can go back and evaluate what he needs to do. He made
me want to do something special.... Maybe it's a good thing Maurice
was watching, and he's thinking, 'I can come back and beat these
guys.'"</TE>
<TE>   No one could beat Marion Jones in her first 100 of the season.
Like the rapt crowd, the wind subsided when she ran, keeping her time
of 10.90 seconds within the limits for an official world-leading
mark.</TE>
<TE>   Cautious after being charged with a false start, she didn't get
her usual powerful burst out of the blocks and had to pass Tayna
Lawrence of Jamaica in the last half of the race. "I had to bear down
and bring it on through," Jones said after setting field and meet
records. "It doesn't get much better than this, competing in front of
this crowd. [Clocking] 10.90 with a bad start, I'll take it."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Gail Devers, the wind kicked up during the
100-meter hurdles. Her time of 12.29 seconds would have been a U.S.
record if not for a wind of 2.7 meters per second, seventh-tenths
above the threshold.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been training by myself," she said, "and when you're out
there, you don't know where you are. So I was a little apprehensive.
I was telling everybody I just wanted to get this race over. I had no
idea what my time was."</TE>
<TE>   Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco won the mile in 3:50.89, the world's
fastest time this year. He ran the last quarter-mile in 54.6 seconds,
pushing past William Chirchir of Kenya (3:51.03) and Bernard Lagat of
Kenya (3:52.63).</TE>
<TE>   "It was my first race, so I was a little afraid," he said. "When I
saw the time was not so fast, the most important thing was to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew [Chirchir] was behind me, and he's a very good athlete. I
shifted into another gear."</TE>
<TE>   Marla Runyan was more than satisfied with her winning time of
8:39.36 in the women's 3,000, even though she missed a stadium record
by 0.03 of a second. Bloodied by an errant spike, she had the
fortitude to pass Sonia O'Sullivan with a 61.9-second last lap.</TE>
<TE>   "I just can't believe I won," Runyan said after cutting nearly
five seconds off her previous best time. "This was an elite field.
Sonia O'Sullivan is great. I came up on her shoulder and decided to
see if I could do it on the turn, and I was able to. This was about
the most perfect race I could have run."</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Dragila defended her pole vault title by clearing 15-5 3/4
inches, but hit the bar on the way up on her three attempts at a
world-record 15-9 3/4.</TE>
<TE>   In other events of note, Tim Mack won the men's pole vault by
clearing 19-2; 110-meter hurdles world champion Allen Johnson won his
event in 13.16 seconds, Nicole Teter won the 1,500 in 4:12.93, more
than two seconds ahead of Regina Jacobs, and Abraham Chebii of Kenya
won the men's 5,000 in 13:13.53. Charles Clinger set a field and meet
record by clearing 7-8 1/2 in the high jump.</TE>

<HD>Signs of Settling In at U.S. Camp</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: New use of military protocol and renovation of
buildings at American base indicate a shift to a more permanent
installation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>As American troops marked Memorial Day with a barbecue here Sunday,
they were surrounded by mounting evidence that U.S. forces will
probably be at this base for Memorial Days to come.</LD>
<LD>   Across the dusty compound north of Kabul, the Afghan capital, are
signs that the United States is settling in. The dilapidated
Soviet-built structures that dominate the landscape have received new
roofs in recent weeks. Afghan crews are installing new windows and
sealing up the pockmarks of war with thick layers of fresh mortar.</LD>
<LD>   Trucks line up outside the base's main gate every morning, loaded
with gravel and building materials. And within weeks, a permanent
power generation facility is scheduled to start up, ending the base's
reliance on dozens of portable generators.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps most telling of all, new rules are kicking in requiring
soldiers here to salute their superiors. The policy is widely viewed
by the rank and file as a nuisance, but officers said the change
reflects Bagram's transition from no-nonsense combat zone to a more
traditionally ritualized military installation.</TE>
<TE>   The changes underscore a growing realization at Bagram, which is
home to about 3,000 U.S. troops, that even if the military objectives
are easy to spell out, predicting how long it will take to achieve
them is not.</TE>
<TE>   The first priority remains rooting out Osama bin Laden's terrorist
network, and coalition forces continue to have success. Last week, a
raid near Kandahar, in the south, netted about 50 suspected Al Qaeda
or Taliban members.</TE>
<TE>   But progress on this front appears increasingly incremental.
Officials said Sunday that it's almost inevitable that some, if not
many, of those captured last week will turn out to have no terrorist
connection and be released.</TE>
<TE>   Military leaders acknowledge that large-scale battles such as
Operation Anaconda in March are increasingly unlikely. Instead, most
expect infrequent encounters with small pockets of the enemy along
the Pakistani border.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be surprised if the enemy coalesced again like he did at
Anaconda," said Lt. Col. David Gray, the chief of military operations
at Bagram. Americans should see the new direction of the war as
evidence of its overall success, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We've hurt Bin Laden bad and got him on the run," Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   The question now is how to keep him that way without requiring
U.S. troops to permanently patrol the Afghan-Pakistani border. U.S.
leaders say that eventually that task will fall to the nascent Afghan
army. American Special Forces soldiers recently began training its
first 500 members, and the Pentagon has said the goal is for
Afghanistan to field an army of about 18,000 troops.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a long-term process," Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   For clues to how quickly Afghanistan might be able to manage its
own affairs, U.S. officials are closely eyeing the loya jirga, the
complicated nationwide assembly that will be held next month. U.S.
officials are anxious to see whether there will be an orderly
transition from the interim government of Prime Minister Hamid Karzai
to a more permanent structure.</TE>
<TE>   "If people in Afghanistan see that as a legitimate process, it
will bode well for the country and our mission," said Maj. Bryan
Hilferty, spokesman for coalition forces at Bagram.</TE>
<TE>   Sensitive to the question of how long the U.S. might be here,
Hilferty and others are quick to point out that the changes underway
are not too permanent. Construction is being done to comply with
Afghan standards, not U.S. code.</TE>
<TE>   Hilferty noted that a new technical operations center was built of
cheap plywood. "That doesn't exactly reek of a 40-year plan," he
said. "This is an Afghan air force base; we're merely their guests."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Hilferty said, "We're going to be here for a few more
holidays. That's certainly true."</TE>

<LD>   Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, whose government is mired
in increasingly serious allegations of sleaze and corruption,
abruptly removed two ministers.</LD>
<TE>   Defense Minister Art Eggleton lost his job after a newspaper
revealed that an ex-girlfriend had been given a military contract for
which there had been no open tender. He said there was nothing to the
story but was forced to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Public Works Minister Don Boudria was at the center of a furor
over revelations that fat government contracts were awarded to
friends of the Liberal Party. He was moved to a less sensitive post.</TE>

<HD>In France, Bush Stays Focused on Asia</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President meets with Chirac and praises Paris'
search for terrorists. But he also repeats concerns about Pakistan
and Kashmir.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>President Bush kept up steady pressure on Pakistan on Sunday to halt
rebel incursions into the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir and to
help bring calm to its tense border in the disputed region.</LD>
<LD>   He also said the U.S. is considering Russian President Vladimir V.
Putin's report that his country is confident that the aid it gives to
Iran's nuclear power program will not "enable Iran to develop weapons
of mass destruction."</LD>
<LD>   Bush spoke at a news conference at the Elysee Palace here  with
French President Jacques Chirac. The two leaders met after Bush's
arrival from Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Bush is nearing the end of a weeklong trip. He will mark Memorial
Day today at the American Cemetery on a cliff overlooking  Omaha
Beach in Normandy and will spend Tuesday, the last day of his trip,
in Rome.</TE>
<TE>   Bush showed signs of fatigue after staying out until just before
midnight Saturday, very late by the standards of this early-to-rise,
early-to-bed president. He and Putin attended a performance of "The
Nutcracker" ballet in St. Petersburg--also a rare event for a
president whose taste in cultural diversions runs more toward
baseball--and then spent several hours cruising the Neva River.</TE>
<TE>   In their news conference, Bush and Chirac sought to minimize the
gap between European public opinion and the policies the United
States and its major Western allies are pursuing in the war on
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's first stop, in Germany, brought out 20,000 demonstrators to
protest a variety of U.S. policies, from support of Israel to the war
in Afghanistan and Washington's opposition to the Kyoto Protocol on
global warming. Smaller demonstrations took place Sunday in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   Chirac said the protests do not reflect an aversion "to the
president of the United States or to the U.S. people as a whole." And
Bush praised France for taking the lead in Europe in searching for
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   In the conflict between India and Pakistan, the United States is
finding that it has few cards it can play, because it relies on
Pakistan in the effort to track down members of the Al Qaeda
terrorist network and the former Taliban regime of Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's greatest concern is not Pakistan's tests
over the weekend of missiles capable of reaching India, but continual
incursions into the country by Islamic militants from Pakistani
territory. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf promised in January
that he would bring them to a halt.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he was insisting that "President Musharraf show results
in terms of stopping people from crossing the Line of Control,
stopping terrorism. What's more important than the missile testing is
that he perform."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, speaking with reporters outside a synagogue he
visited in St. Petersburg, the president said the United States had
expressed "strong reservations" to Pakistan about the tests.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, speaking in St. Petersburg on
CNN's "Late Edition," said that India seemed to be taking the tests
in stride, "but we were disappointed that the Pakistanis decided to
conduct these tests during a time of high anxiety and tension."</TE>
<TE>   "The whole international community is seized with this problem,"
Powell added. "We've got to get back from the edge, because these are
nuclear-armed nations, and they also have huge conventional forces."</TE>
<TE>   The issue of Russian support for the construction of a nuclear
reactor in Bushehr, Iran, proved to be one of the more sensitive
topics during Bush's meetings with Putin. Bush said the Russian was
willing to allow international inspectors to determine whether such a
project could develop weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   "And we're thinking about what he told us," Bush said of Putin's
assurances.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also called attention in St. Petersburg to what he said was
"a new attitude" among some Palestinian leaders. The president added
that he was withholding judgment of Yasser Arafat to see whether the
Palestinian Authority president holds to his promise to halt
Palestinian attacks on Israelis and to reform the Palestinian
leadership.</TE>
<TE>   Bush began the Paris news conference listening to a 10-minute
account by Chirac of their private meeting. When it was his turn to
speak, Bush quickly said, "It's true," as if all he wanted was to
agree with Chirac, get on with the questions and have dinner.</TE>
<TE>   He then delivered his own brief summary of the meeting, wrapping
it up by saying: "I'm looking forward to the dinner. He's always
saying that the food here is fantastic, and I'm going to give him a
chance to show me tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Bush perked up.</TE>
<TE>   When Chirac was asked whether he had underestimated Bush a year
ago, the U.S. president interjected: "Like everybody else."</TE>
<TE>   Then, when Bush couldn't remember the second part of a three-part
question, he said, "I'm jet-lagged." He asked for help on the third
part, saying, "That's what happens when you're over 55." Bush turned
55 last July 6.</TE>

<HD>Taiwan Crash Has Echoes of Flight 800</HD>
<DH>Aviation: The lead investigator in the case says a China
Airlines plane split apart before crashing Saturday, as in the 1996
TWA disaster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>The lead investigator of the weekend crash of a China Airlines 747
that broke up and fell into the Taiwan Strait with 225 people on
board said today that his team had begun studying similarities with
the crash of a TWA jumbo jet off New York six years ago.</LD>
<LD>   "That is certainly an important incident for us," said Kay Yong,
managing director of Taiwan's Aviation Safety Council, the government
agency responsible for determining the cause of Saturday's crash.</LD>
<LD>   In a telephone interview from the Taiwanese capital, Taipei, Yong
said that both planes were among the first versions produced of the
Boeing 747 aircraft and that both disintegrated without any apparent
warning shortly into their flights.</LD>
<TE>   After years of speculation, safety investigators in the United
States concluded that faulty wiring most likely triggered a fuel tank
explosion that brought down TWA Flight 800 in July 1996, just 14
minutes into a transatlantic flight from New York's JFK International
Airport. All 230 people on board perished.</TE>
<TE>   Yong's comments came as investigators determined that China
Airlines Flight 611 apparently split into four pieces shortly after
it reached its cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. The aircraft
disappeared from radar screens without warning about 20 minutes into
a 90-minute flight from Taipei to Hong Kong.</TE>
<TE>   The TWA plane was from the 747-100 series and had been in service
for 25 years at the time it went down off Long Island. The China
Airlines aircraft was a slightly modified jumbo jet from the 747-200
series in its 23rd year of operation. Yong said the fuel tank designs
on both models were virtually identical.</TE>
<TE>   But Yong cautioned that it was far too early to draw conclusions
about the cause of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, we don't have any evidence other than the radar
track," he said. "Honestly, it is not possible to rule anything out."</TE>
<TE>   He said that early today, the investigators located both the
plane's cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder in waters
about 15 miles north of the town of Makung, the major city of the
Penghu islands.</TE>
<TE>   "The next step is to retrieve those recorders and determine what
they can tell us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A team of investigators from the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board was due to arrive in Taipei later today. Participation
of U.S. specialists is considered routine when an American-made plane
is involved, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwanese Deputy Minister of Transportation Chang Chia-chu also
told reporters it was too early to discuss exactly what might have
triggered the plane's midair disintegration.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many causes that could lead to high-altitude
disintegration," he said. "It might have something to do with the
plane's structure or mechanical problems."</TE>
<TE>   Because the plane was flying in airspace between Taiwan and its
longtime adversary, China, some Taiwanese speculated it might have
been brought down by a missile. Others talked about a possible bomb
on board, but investigators said there was no initial evidence to
indicate the aircraft was brought down intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's crash marked the fourth fatal accident for China
Airlines in the last eight years, giving the airline one of the worst
safety records in civil aviation. Saturday's disaster involved the
last remaining passenger-configured 747-200 in the carrier's fleet of
29 jumbo jets. Airline officials said the plane was due to be sold
shortly.</TE>
<TE>   The airline grounded its four 747-200 cargo planes Sunday, pending
safety inspections.</TE>
<TE>   Rescue teams continued to recover bodies today from the choppy
seas near the Penghu island group about 30 miles west of Taiwan's
main island. However, brisk winds and 10-foot waves have hampered
recovery efforts. One official involved in the operation said about
80 bodies had been taken from the water.</TE>
<TE>   Taiwan government officials said there was little likelihood that
anyone survived.</TE>

<DL>KATMANDU, Nepal</DL>
<LD>Revolt-racked Nepal was plunged into a fresh crisis Sunday after the
centrist ruling party expelled Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba over
his move to dissolve parliament and call early elections.</LD>
<LD>   Deuba told reporters that the expulsion would have no effect on
his ability to remain caretaker prime minister of the Himalayan
kingdom where security forces are battling a bloody Maoist
insurgency.</LD>
<LD>   But constitutional experts called the events unprecedented in
Nepal, known for its revolving-door governments, and were not certain
Deuba could remain as prime minister until the elections set for Nov.
13.</LD>
<TE>   Deuba was suspended as a member of the ruling party last week
after asking King Gyanendra to disband parliament and advance the
elections by two years after a party revolt against his move to
extend emergency rule to fight the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   The Maoist guerrillas are seeking to topple the constitutional
monarchy and install a communist republic.</TE>

<HD>Frail Pope May Have to Scale Back Travel</HD>
<DH>Religion: Pontiff, who has Parkinson's, leaves Bulgaria for
Rome. Vatican says his plans for a Latin American trip in July are up
in the air.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PLOVDIV, Bulgaria</DL>
<LD>As Pope John Paul II concluded an arduous five-day trip to Azerbaijan
and Bulgaria on Sunday, the Vatican indicated that the increasingly
frail pope's health may force him to cut back on foreign trips.</LD>
<LD>   The pontiff, who is scheduled to visit Canada, Mexico and
Guatemala in July, may drop Mexico and Guatemala from the itinerary,
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters here.</LD>
<LD>   "Toronto is clear," Navarro said. "In Toronto, there will be the
World Youth Day. As far as the others are concerned, we'll see. No
decision has been made yet."</LD>
<TE>   John Paul, 82, suffers from Parkinson's disease. He read only
portions of his speeches and appeared extremely weak throughout his
trip, although he managed to preside Sunday over a two-hour Mass on
in this city's main square.</TE>
<TE>   At the morning Mass, which was attended by thousands of
worshipers, he beatified three Roman Catholic priests executed by
Bulgaria's former Communist government on trumped-up spying charges
in 1952.</TE>
<TE>   Kamen Vichev, Iosafat Shishkov and Pavel Dzhidzhov, all put to
death by firing squad in a prison in the capital, Sofia, were
declared martyrs of the Catholic faith. Beatification is the last
step before possible sainthood.</TE>
<TE>   Before returning to Rome on an evening flight, John Paul visited a
Catholic church in Plovdiv where a gathering of youths gave him the
most enthusiastic welcome of his trip.</TE>
<TE>   The gathering at St. Ludwig Catholic Church had a bittersweet
quality. Wildly cheering youths shouted: "Holy Father, we are with
you! We love you!"</TE>
<TE>   John Paul was animated, waving and smiling, and besides reading
part of his speech in Bulgarian--with the rest delivered by an
aide--he ad-libbed in several languages. He also led group singing,
bursting out with a relatively strong voice in the first few words of
familiar songs that were then taken up by the others present.</TE>
<TE>   His weakness, however, was obvious.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul has said that he wants to continue his papacy rather
than resign, as some cardinals have suggested. But he gave an
indication Sunday that he recognizes limits to how long he will be
able to carry on. He told the youths, through a translator, that he
didn't know if he would ever be able to come back to Bulgaria.</TE>
<TE>   He then added: "It's good to be able to meet young Bulgarians at
the end of my papacy. It is you to whom tomorrow belongs."</TE>
<TE>   Antoni Bohdanowicz, 16, a British and Polish citizen who was part
of a school group from Warsaw that attended the event, said it left
him "just so sad" to see the pope's condition and hear his words.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'Farewell,' and it seemed not 'Farewell, Bulgaria,'" but
something more, Bohdanowicz said. "There's pressure rising on him to
resign. I think he shouldn't. Although he's lost his speech--he can't
speak properly--he's still got great wisdom."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Zaikova, 20, who is studying to become a nun, was among
those who welcomed John Paul at the church. She said she believes he
should keep up his traveling.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he should keep pushing until his last minute," Zaikova
said. "The reason he's here on Earth is to serve God, and God will
give him all the powers he needs to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   In an echo of the message of the morning Mass and its
beatification of the clergymen, John Paul cited to the youths the
biblical passage "Whoever loses his life for my sake and the Gospel's
will save it."</TE>
<TE>   "This statement can seem difficult and in some cases can even be
frightening," he added. "But I ask you: Is it better to resign
yourself to a life without ideals, to a society marked by inequality,
oppression and selfishness, or rather to seek with a generous heart
what is true, good and just, working to build a world which shows
forth the beauty of God?"</TE>
<TE>   In his homily at the morning Mass, John Paul cast the
beatification of the three clergymen in the context of his drive for
better relations and eventual unity between the Catholic and Orthodox
faiths.</TE>
<TE>   "In thinking of the three ... I also feel duty-bound to honor the
memory of the other confessors of the faith who were sons and
daughters of the Orthodox Church and who suffered martyrdom under the
same Communist regime," he said. In his departure address at Plovdiv
airport, John Paul came back to this theme.</TE>
<TE>   "Not so long ago, both Catholics and Orthodox underwent harsh
persecution for their fidelity to the Gospel," he said. "May so many
sacrifices make the witness of Christians in this country bear much
fruit and, with the grace of God, may they hasten the day when we
shall be able to rejoice in the rediscovered fullness of unity among
us!"</TE>
<TE>   Antonia Remmeke, 27, a Bulgarian woman married to a German who was
back in her country on a family visit, said that she had seen John
Paul at youth events in other countries but that his appearance here
touched her far more.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a special gift to me, to hear him speaking to me in
Bulgarian," Remmeke said. "He's a very old man. His hands tremble,
and his voice is not that strong. He's a weak, weak old man. But in
his weakness I see God."</TE>

<HD>Deadly Mozambican Rail Crash Blamed on Worker</HD>
<DH>Africa: Official says train cars went out of control when
rocks placed under their wheels came loose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>MAPUTO, Mozambique</DL>
<LD>The worst rail disaster in Mozambique's history occurred after a
railroad worker unsuccessfully used four large stones to keep a
packed passenger train from sliding down a hill, a railway official
said Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, funerals began for some of the approximately 200 people
killed in the crash, and health officials pleaded for blood donations
for the 400 people who were injured.</LD>
<LD>   The crash of a train carrying passengers and freight from South
Africa happened about 5 a.m. Saturday near the town of Tenga, about
25 miles northwest of Maputo, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   The train developed a mechanical fault as it descended a hill, so
the driver disconnected the passenger section, at the back of the
train, and drove the front section carrying freight to the nearby
Tenga station, railway officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The driver had wedged four large stones under the wheels of the
passenger train to keep it from sliding down the hill, but the stones
apparently came loose and the train barreled down the tracks into the
freight train, said Antonio Libombo, an official with the Mozambican
Railway Co.</TE>
<TE>   The collision resembled a large explosion, and cement dust carried
by the freight train filled the air, railway workers at the station
said.</TE>
<TE>   The choking dust buried dozens of passengers alive, and three cars
were smashed to scrap metal.</TE>
<TE>   "An investigation is still underway," Transportation Minister
Tomas Salomao said. "But at first glance, the crash was caused by a
human error."</TE>
<TE>   Rescue workers toiled throughout Saturday to free many victims who
were trapped in the wreckage.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital authorities said medics then worked through the night to
treat the many wounded, including 22 in intensive care and 169 more
in a high-dependency unit, where patients are in a critical condition
but out of immediate danger.</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday, all the bodies had been removed from the wreckage and
it had been cleared, Salomao told Radio Mozambique. Regular train
service resumed, and three trains had passed through the area by
Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Funerals for some of the victims were held Sunday in Moamba, not
far from the crash site, and several border towns. Local civic
organizations were helping with burial arrangements, and many people
in this impoverished southern African country had gathered money
together to help buy coffins for the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The railroad also promised financial assistance to the families of
those killed.</TE>

<DH>Environment: Politicians and developers want to put a golf
course on a former landfill in the Bronx. One problem: The land is
sinking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Ferry Point Park in the Bronx is one of this city's last, big pieces
of undeveloped land. At 414 acres, it's half the size of Central
Park, with spectacular waterfront views and vistas of the Empire
State Building.</LD>
<LD>   Seemingly the perfect spot for a PGA-caliber golf course being
billed as the "Pebble Beach of the East." At least that was what city
officials had in mind two years ago, when the parks department
awarded developers the rights to construct the course.</LD>
<LD>   But work at Ferry Point stopped in January because the land--a
former garbage dump built atop a marsh--is sinking. Today the site
resembles a moonscape, stripped of foliage and covered by a layer of
gray construction debris.</LD>
<TE>   The developers want to shore up Ferry Point by bringing in an
additional 550,000 cubic yards of landfill. But environmental groups
are protesting the plan, which they argue threatens to further
compact the garbage like a giant whoopie cushion, sending not only
potentially explosive methane gas into neighboring homes but also
polluting the East River with toxic chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   All sides in the controversy agree the stakes are sizable.</TE>
<TE>   "It is essentially a good and honorable deal for everyone," said
Henry Stern, who was the city's parks commissioner under former Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani. "It was a wasteland for 30 years, and it is
making the desert bloom."</TE>
<TE>   The project has the support of virtually all politicians in the
Bronx. Giuliani, an enthusiastic golfer, had lobbied to make the
course a stop on the PGA tour.</TE>
<TE>   But Leslie Lowe--former executive director of the New York
Environmental Justice Alliance, which filed an unsuccessful suit
seeking to cancel the developer's contract--charged that Ferry Point
"has all the landmarks of a wired deal.... The project is
undercapitalized. They put all of the potential liability off on the
taxpayers.... You don't play PGA tournaments on a toxic golf course."</TE>
<TE>   The accusation caused Edward C. Wallace, one of the developer's
principal lawyers, to bristle.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody would put up tens of millions of dollars to produce a
toxic golf course.... I count on my client to do the right thing," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You are taking a landfill that was a horrific eyesore.... [The
course] will be next to Yankee Stadium and the Botanical Gardens and
the Bronx Zoo, the fourth jewel of the crown of the Bronx," Wallace
predicted.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1950s and '60s, the Ferry Point site was a garbage dump
where hazardous materials, including lead paint and asbestos, were
deposited. Authorized use of the landfill stopped in the 1970s, but
illegal dumping of used cars, drums of chemicals and old
refrigerators continued.</TE>
<TE>   During the summers, brush fires fed by methane from decomposing
waste were so frequent that a fire engine often was stationed next to
the park.</TE>
<TE>   "When I moved here in January 1978, Ferry Point Park looked like
something out of a science fiction movie," Lehra Brooks, a longtime
neighborhood resident, said in a court affidavit. "There were deep
craters and the ground was very uneven. Parts of it sank below street
level. For a long time, I didn't know that it was a park.... This
ooze came up between the cracks [in the asphalt].... In the spring
and summer, you would see lots of rats, really big rats, and the
odors were horrible."</TE>
<TE>   In May 2000, the parks department awarded the concession to build
the golf course on 222 acres to Ferry Point Partners, a consortium
consisting of J. Pierre Gagne, a White Plains, N.Y., developer, Jack
Nicklaus' design firm and several New York investors.</TE>
<TE>   The 35-year contract called for Ferry Point Partners to build the
course at its own expense and pay the city $60 million in fees over
the life of the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is one of the most spectacular locations for a golf
course in the United States," Gagne said, praising Nicklaus as the
designer. "You have 140,000 cars that pass that property a day.
Multiply it by a year, and it is one-third the population. It is
surrounded by 13 million people."</TE>
<TE>   The original 2001 completion date for the course has been pushed
back to 2004. The cost has risen from $22 million to more than $40
million, and some estimates are that it could reach $50 million.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that techniques used these days to prevent the
spread of contamination were not employed back when the dump was
sealed decades ago. Because of a lack of cover materials over the
garbage, it became necessary to bring in debris from construction and
demolition sites to build up the ground so the course could be
shaped, soil put down and grass planted.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to these problems, methane gas was detected in surrounding
communities. Prompted by worries from residents, several
environmental groups began investigating.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe charged that the Giuliani administration "made it impossible"
to obtain information. When methane readings occurred in the basement
of Throggs Neck Houses, a development with more than 3,500 residents
next to the site, the New York City Housing Authority was queried. No
response. Requests for records of previous fires at the site went
unanswered. So did letters to the Department of Sanitation asking for
listings of what was dumped back when Ferry Point Park was a
landfill.</TE>
<TE>   Former Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer, a supporter of the
project, also had trouble getting information from the Giuliani
administration.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor's attitude was he wanted to get this done. His term was
getting done," Stern said. "He wanted to get this done beyond the
point of no return."</TE>
<TE>   But completion has proved to be difficult. The project is stalled
while the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
considers whether to issue the permit for the additional
landfill--and whether remedies for the methane, including a
5,350-foot trench the developer dug at the department's direction to
vent the gas, are sufficient.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups see the permit request as a chance to reopen
the case.</TE>
<TE>   So it doesn't look like Tiger Woods will be teeing off at a PGA
tournament at Ferry Point anytime soon.</TE>

<HD>Loyal to the Core, Bush Knows How to Play to the Crucial
Outsiders</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>If President Bush's approval rating stays in the stratosphere, he
will probably coast to reelection in 2004. Every incumbent president
with approval ratings even approaching his 70%-plus has won a second
term without breaking a sweat. You can look it up.</LD>
<LD>   But political strategists, like generals, are paid to anticipate
worst-case scenarios. And hints of how Bush would hope to win a close
election are surfacing. These clues are contained in the pattern of
Bush's decisions over his first 16 months, particularly where he's
broken from his conservative base. On the biggest questions, like
taxes or energy, Bush has almost always sided with his core
conservative supporters. But on secondary issues, he's shown himself
willing to abandon conservative orthodoxy to appeal to precisely
targeted groups, like steelworkers or farmers.</LD>
<LD>   This isn't the behavior of a president trying to fundamentally
realign the electorate by inspiring wholesale changes in the
allegiance of swing voters. To do that, Bush would have to risk
angering his core supporters by moving to the center on big issues,
something he's done only rarely.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, after the closest presidential election in more than a
century, Bush's camp is placing a different bet. Their underlying
assumption seems to be that, if Bush holds his base from 2000, he'll
be close enough to a majority that he won't need to convert large
groups of those who resisted him last time. All he might need is to
tip small numbers of voters in key places, like steelworkers in the
industrial belt. "The goal ultimately has to be to hold what you
start with and then change the dynamics of 4% or 5%, total," one
senior Bush political advisor says. "It's not like you're trying to
build to 60% of the vote, but rather to build to 52%."</TE>
<TE>   Seen from that angle, Bush's principal policy decisions over his
first 16 months sort into three broad categories.</TE>
<TE>   The largest group are actions that appeal to his conservative
base. Almost all of Bush's front-page decisions fall into this
column.</TE>
<TE>   On energy, taxes, judicial nominations, guns, the environment,
defense spending, resistance to international treaties, opposition to
human cloning for research, the partial privatization of Social
Security--in short, on almost all of the major issues he's
faced--Bush has sided with conservatives, even at the risk of
alienating moderates.</TE>
<TE>   This approach has quickly advanced the first part of his strategy:
holding his vote from 2000. Even before Sept. 11, Bush had
consolidated his base as effectively as any incoming president in
memory, with an approval rating among Republicans that consistently
levitated above 90%. Before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, though, this success carried a price: a
sharply polarized electorate and unusually high disapproval ratings
among Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   The second category of decisions has involved issues on which he
has tried to find a "third way" that attracts moderates without
alienating conservatives. Politically, these "compassionate
conservative" issues are intended to soften the sharp edges of his
decisions in the first category. Bush has made some progress,
particularly on education, but none of the other ideas on this
list--like promoting faith-based charities--has proved central to his
presidency. As a result, if his post-Sept. 11 glow appreciatively
fades, these ideas are unlikely to convert too many voters who are
uncomfortable with his posture on the bigger priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Which increases the importance of an emerging third group of
issues in broadening Bush's support. These are what might be called
Bush's targeted heresies: the issues on which he courts distinct
groups of voters outside his coalition through positions that collide
with his conservative base--and often his own general principles as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Bush put one issue in this basket last year when he reached out to
Latinos and defied the military by agreeing to end Navy artillery
testing on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. More recently, he
outraged free traders but thrilled steelworkers by imposing punishing
tariffs on steel imports. Then, this month, he signed a farm bill
popular with rural communities but so expensive that most Senate
Republicans voted against it. Immigration reform, which intrigues
Latinos and infuriates conservatives, would fall into this category
too, if Bush ever moves forward on it.</TE>
<TE>   This is micro, not macro, politics. Immigration aside, none of
these issues stirs great national passion. But they matter deeply to
discrete groups in specific places. The farm bill will help Bush in
Midwestern states he narrowly lost last time--and which also could
determine Senate control next year. Bush's deal for steel could lift
him in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Latino votes will be critical
in Florida and the Southwest.</TE>
<TE>   This precise attention to the needs of narrow constituencies
adapts to the national level a distinctive style of local politics.
"It's ward politics in many ways," says Marshall Wittmann, a
political analyst at the conservative Hudson Institute in Washington.
"He can dole out goodies to various constituencies while not defying
the base of the party on the big questions." The old ward bosses who
passed out turkeys at Christmas would understand Bush's favors for
steelworkers or farmers: He is appealing to interests, not ideals or
ideology.</TE>
<TE>   For Bush, the harmonic convergence comes on policies that allow
him to solidify his base while courting key targets beyond it. By
supporting drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska,
Bush built common cause with Teamsters while pleasing energy
companies; his opposition to higher fuel economy standards cheered
the auto industry while opening doors to the United Auto Workers.
Likewise, Bush's staunch support of Israel satisfies conservative
demands while creating opportunities with traditionally Democratic
Jews.</TE>
<TE>   None of this guarantees Bush reelection. But it does suggest his
advisors aren't banking only on the post-Sept. 11 wave to carry him
to a second term. If the wave stays high, he won't need any help. But
Bush is working to ensure that, if the wave recedes, he'll still have
more ground under his control--a steelworkers' union hall here, a
farm town there--than he did in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The danger for Bush is that too many decisions obviously aimed at
expanding his turf could threaten his hold on higher ground: his
image of putting principle above politics.</TE>

<HD>Pilots Ramp Up Campaign to Allow Guns in Cockpit</HD>
<DH>Security: Aviators call themselves the last line of
defense, while critics see risk to both people, craft.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER OLDHAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, an aircraft
windshield must be able to withstand the impact of an 8-pound chicken
shot directly into the double-paned panel. But can a windshield hold
up under the force of a bullet?</LD>
<LD>   That is one of the central questions in the ongoing debate over
whether pilots should be allowed to carry guns in the cockpit. After
an intense eight-month campaign by pilots to be allowed to use
firearms, the Bush administration last week denied them permission to
do so.</LD>
<LD>   Now pilots are trying to rally support behind a House bill that
would let them carry arms. A companion measure was introduced in the
Senate last week.</LD>
<TE>   The debate is forcing Congress to reevaluate whether an aviation
security law it enacted last fall does enough to prevent hijackings.
And its outcome is likely to foreshadow how far Americans are willing
to go to protect the nation's aviation system.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments both for and against arming pilots are compelling.
Pilots call themselves the last line of defense--citing the eight who
died Sept. 11 with no way to protect themselves other than their bare
hands and emergency axes. Arming them would deter terrorists, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents argue that a pilot could accidentally shoot part of the
plane, or an innocent passenger, or that a terrorist could wrestle
the gun away and commandeer the aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   The pitch for pistol-packing pilots is not without precedent. To
guard against hijackings, about a dozen pilots were selected by the
FBI in the mid-1970s to receive training to carry a firearm, said
retired Capt. Stephen Luckey earlier this month in testimony before
the House Subcommittee on Aviation.</TE>
<TE>   For 15 years, Luckey wore a gun at all times in the
cockpit--saying it brought "an increased level of responsibility and
restriction." In fact, pilots were permitted to carry a gun with the
consent of their airline until as recently as July, when the FAA
rescinded the program.</TE>
<TE>   Now pilots are battling powerful opposition to providing them with
arms. Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta and Transportation
Security Administration chief John W. Magaw disapprove of the plan.
The airlines also don't favor arming pilots--citing potential danger
to passengers and crew members.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortified, reinforced cockpit doors, combined with armed air
marshals, provide adequate protection on board to pilots and
passengers," said Michael Wascom, a spokesman for the Air Transport
Assn., an airline trade group.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots argue that these measures might not be enough to stop
hijackers bent on taking over a plane and turning it into a missile.
Reinforced cockpit doors can be breached, or attackers could strike
when pilots leave the cockpit to use the restroom, they say. The
airlines have until April 2003 to install fortified cockpit doors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the federal air marshal program will cover only a
tiny fraction of the domestic aviation system's 30,000 or so daily
flights, said Capt. Gary Boettcher, who flies 737-800s to the
Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots propose a voluntary arms program, to be administered by the
Department of Transportation, under which they would receive 48 hours
of training and be deputized as federal law enforcement officers.
Being deputized would protect pilots and airlines from liability by
placing responsibility for the program with the government.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal would restrict gun use to the cockpit and make it
only a last resort, Luckey said. The program, mirrored in legislation
proposed in Congress, would require pilots to undergo criminal
background checks, psychological tests and classroom instruction on
employing a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   To receive a license, pilots would have to score well on field
exercises in which they would fire as many as 2,200 rounds in a
simulated cockpit, Boettcher said. Pilots also suggest that the
government could choose ammunition--such as "frangible" bullets,
which break apart when they hit metal or other hard objects--that
would be less dangerous in the confines of an aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots unions counter that 70% of the nation's pilots are former
military or law enforcement personnel and that many participate in
the National Guard and the Air Force Reserve. In fact, some of these
pilots flew fighter jets over Washington, New York and Chicago when
off duty in the months after the terrorist attacks, Billie Vincent,
former FAA security chief, said in comments submitted to the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of arming pilots, some airlines, such as United, favor the
use of stun guns that would be kept locked away in the cockpit and
then taken out and holstered within reach of the pilots during
flight.</TE>
<TE>   These weapons, known as Tasers, would have been particularly
effective during an incident in February on a United Airlines flight
from Miami to Buenos Aires when a passenger jammed his body through a
panel in the cockpit door.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of hitting him with an emergency ax--as a co-pilot did
with little success, prompting passengers to rush forward to
help--the crew could have relied on a stun gun to incapacitate him,
said Capt. Henry P. Krakowski, vice president for safety, security
and quality assurance at United, in testimony earlier this month
before the House Aviation Subcommittee.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots argue that stun guns are not effective against multiple
attackers and can be foiled by terrorists trained to anticipate their
effects.</TE>
<TE>   But Tasers, if misfired, don't run the risk of shattering
instruments on the flight deck or harming other parts of the
aircraft, as firearms do, Krakowski said.</TE>
<TE>   Pilots counter that the likelihood they would misfire in the
confined space of the cockpit is low, coupled with the fact that an
airplane can withstand a certain amount of gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   It's a myth that an airplane will rapidly depressurize and crash
if a bullet pierces the fuselage, said Capt. Dennis J. Dolan, who
flies 737-800s for Delta Airlines. Design experts at Boeing concur,
saying FAA certification requirements mandate that an aircraft
survive a 20-square-foot hole.</TE>
<TE>   With smaller holes like those caused by a bullet, a plane wouldn't
come apart if it started to depressurize, and people would still be
able to breathe because of numerous vents throughout the aircraft,
said Liz Verdier, a spokeswoman for Boeing Co.</TE>
<TE>   If a passenger window were shattered by a bullet, unbelted
travelers near the area would be in danger--and pilots would have to
immediately decrease altitude to regulate the pressure inside the
aircraft--but the plane could still land safely, Verdier said.</TE>
<TE>   "The windows and the windshield can withstand a bullet," she
added. "In spite of what people have seen in the movies, an aircraft
doesn't explode like a balloon when a bullet pierces the fuselage."</TE>

<HD>Moussaoui Memo Says FBI Stalled Probe After Attacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>FBI officials in Washington not only stymied an investigation into
flight school student Zacarias Moussaoui before Sept. 11, but also
actively tried to stop field agents from connecting the suspected
20th hijacker to the terrorist attacks after they occurred, a
Minnesota field agent contends in a 13-page "whistle-blower" letter
made public Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   FBI agent Coleen Rowley, general counsel in the Minneapolis field
office, also asserts that facts ''have been omitted, downplayed,
glossed over and/or mischaracterized in an effort to avoid or
minimize personal and/or institutional embarrassment.... ''</LD>
<LD>   By doing so, Rowley says, the FBI put Americans at further risk by
failing to act quickly and aggressively enough to determine the
extent of the Sept. 11 conspiracy or whether further attacks were
planned.</LD>
<TE>   Rowley contends in her letter to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III that intelligence on Moussaoui provided by the French government,
which included information on his "activities connected with Osama
bin Laden," was more than enough to obtain a special surveillance
warrant to search Moussaoui's laptop computer in the weeks before the
terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But requests for such a warrant were thwarted by FBI supervisors
in Washington who seemed so intent on ignoring the threat posed by
Moussaoui, Rowley wrote, that some field agents were frustrated
enough to joke that key officials at FBI headquarters "had to be
spies or moles ... who were actually working for Osama bin Laden to
have so undercut Minneapolis' effort."</TE>
<TE>   In August, FBI agents in Minnesota had become increasingly
"desperate" to search the laptop and personal effects of the
mysterious Frenchman of Moroccan descent, Rowley wrote. He had been
detained on immigration violations after arousing suspicion at a
Minnesota flight school, where he was trying to learn to fly a
commercial airliner. Moussaoui, 33, has since been indicted as an Al
Qaeda operative and is the sole person charged with conspiracy in the
Sept. 11 attacks. He faces the death penalty if convicted in a trial
scheduled later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley's scorching letter, sent Tuesday to Mueller and several
congressional intelligence committee members, was posted by Time
magazine on its Web site Sunday, two days after the FBI refused to
turn it over to congressional investigators or U.S. senators.
Excerpts of the letter were leaked to the media late last week.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials said Sunday that the letter remains classified and
that they would not comment on its contents. But it prompted an
immediate and angry reaction on Capitol Hill, from Democrats and
Republicans alike. Some said on the Sunday TV talk shows that it was
further proof the FBI needs an overhaul and called for additional
inquiries and public hearings into the burgeoning controversy.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ... shocking," Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, said of Rowley's letter during an
appearance on CNN's "Late Edition." "And the only way, I believe,
that we're going to get to the bottom of this thing is if we have a
broad investigation with a blue-ribbon panel, but also if we release
the documents now and hold people accountable."</TE>
<TE>   Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) seized on the Rowley
memo as proof that an independent commission was needed to
investigate the FBI, despite vigorous opposition to such an inquiry
from the White House. Daschle said on NBC's "Meet the Press" that
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney personally lobbied him
in January "not to investigate the events of Sept. 11."</TE>
<TE>   "They were concerned about the diversion of resources ...
[involved in] an investigation of any kind," Daschle said. Bush and
Cheney have said that the House and Senate intelligence committees
are the proper forums for such a sensitive investigation.</TE>
<TE>   On CBS' "Face the Nation," Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) sidestepped taking a position on an independent inquiry.
But, citing the Rowley letter, he too called for aggressive FBI
reforms and inquiries into what officials did in the Moussaoui case.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a serious criticism," Lott said, "and it cannot be ignored."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.) said he would use the forthcoming
hearings of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, of
which he is chairman, to examine whether officials at FBI
headquarters had removed information from the Minnesota agents'
request for a warrant--as Rowley contends--out of concern that they
were using "racial profiling."</TE>
<TE>   The full disclosure of Rowley's letter came as a U.S. official
confirmed Sunday that the Federal Aviation Administration had told
airlines more than three years ago to be on a "high degree of
alertness" against possible hijackings by followers of Bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA issued the warning in a Dec. 8, 1998, "information
circular" that expired about seven weeks later, the official said.
Like other FAA circulars issued in 2001 before the Sept. 11 attacks,
it did not contain any specific credible threats and did not order
the airlines to increase security, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was designed to be a specific warning around that period of
time, based on intelligence information we get from other agencies,"
the official said. "It was not designed to be a permanent warning."</TE>
<TE>   Rowley's detailed, often bitter comments raised a raft of fresh
questions Sunday--particularly her assertion that high-ranking bureau
officials had sought to impede an investigation into Moussaoui after
the attacks by "a delicate and subtle shading/skewing of facts"
concerning mistakes they had made before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of Moussaoui's arrest Aug. 15, FBI field agents in
Minneapolis were convinced he was a dangerous Islamic militant who
had sought aviation training for terrorist acts. That belief stemmed
from their investigation and information provided by the French
intelligence service, Rowley said. Her reference to "activities
connected to ... Bin Laden" is the first indication that authorities
had suspected Moussaoui of being linked to the alleged terrorist
mastermind before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Despite those concerns, officials at FBI headquarters in
Washington repeatedly quashed efforts to help the field agents secure
a special warrant under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,
which would have allowed them to run wiretaps and search Moussaoui's
computer and personal effects, Rowley said.</TE>
<TE>   The request for a FISA warrant was denied Aug. 28. Minutes after
two jetliners crashed into the World Trade Center, one of the FBI
supervisors in Washington who was intimately involved in the
Moussaoui case called Rowley on her cell phone. She believed, she
wrote to Mueller, that the supervisor reluctantly was going to admit
that the warrant to search Moussaoui's effects was now necessary.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the "supervisory special agent" told her that "we were to
do nothing in Minneapolis until we got [headquarters'] permission
because we might 'screw up' something else going on elsewhere in the
country," Rowley wrote. She did not name the supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   "Even after the attacks had begun, [the supervisor] was still
attempting to block the search of Moussaoui's computer,
characterizing the World Trade Center attacks as a mere coincidence
with Minneapolis' prior suspicions about Moussaoui," Rowley wrote.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Rowley contends, as field agents desperately tried to
learn who was behind the Sept. 11 attacks and whether more were
imminent, "we were prevented from even attempting to question
Moussaoui on the day of the attacks when, in theory, he could have
possessed further information about other co-conspirators."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, FBI officials did get a warrant to search Moussaoui's
computer on Sept. 11, using the same information initially rejected
by FBI lawyers and supervisors as being insufficient in showing
probable cause, Rowley said. They found a flight simulation program
and information about crop-dusters and other suspicious material.</TE>
<TE>   In her letter to Mueller, Rowley asserted her claim to the federal
government's "whistle-blower protection" provisions, which prohibit
any disciplinary or other retaliatory action while complaints are
being investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller has referred Rowley's letter to the bureau's inspector
general for investigation, and he has acknowledged that mistakes were
made in the Moussaoui case. He has said that he plans to overhaul the
bureau to better analyze and disseminate intelligence and get a
better handle on terrorist threats before attacks can occur.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who took over the FBI a week before Sept. 11, also is
moving to greatly increase the intelligence capacity of the bureau by
bringing aboard many CIA analysts and by forging better ties to the
CIA and other intelligence-gathering agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The director is expected to announce those reforms as early as
this week, when he unveils his reorganization plan for the bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley also criticized FBI officials for promoting the supervisor
whom she blames for blowing the Moussaoui investigation. And she took
exception to some of Mueller's own reform measures, saying they
"simply fly in the face of an honest appraisal of the FBI's
pre-September 11th failures."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Rowley criticized Mueller's plans to centralize
counter-terrorism efforts in Washington, including his proposal for a
"super squad" of agents at FBI headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "If we are indeed in a 'war,' shouldn't the generals be on the
battlefield," she asked, "instead of sitting in a spot removed from
the action while still attempting to call the shots?"</TE>

<HD>Veterans' Claims Backlog Slashed, Secretary Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Department of Veterans Affairs has doubled the number of claims
it decides each month and slashed a mountainous backlog of benefit
requests dating back years, Secretary Anthony J. Principi said.</LD>
<LD>   That backlog, which generated widespread concern on Capitol Hill
and among veterans groups as it ballooned during the 1990s, has been
cut from 600,000 to 394,000 claims in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   "We decided to really declare war on that backlog and took some
rather bold steps to address it," Principi said.</LD>
<TE>   VA claims managers now resolve about 70,000 claims a month, more
than double last year's rate of 29,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the department has established a "tiger team" of
managers in Cleveland that ruled on claims for about 28,000 veterans
over age 70 who had waited more than a year for answers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seen the figures where VA has been increasing their
production. I believe Secretary Principi is seriously concerned about
the state of the VA backlog and the adjudication process," said Joe
Violante, national legislative director for Disabled American
Veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "Our concern, however, is that, while they are increasing their
production, if they are not getting them right the first time they
are no better off than if they weren't processing those cases."</TE>
<TE>   Principi said he didn't have exact figures but the majority of the
processed claims do approve benefits for those requesting them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a case study that things can, in fact, turn around; not only
in the private sector but in government bureaucracy as well," said
Principi, a Vietnam War veteran.</TE>
<TE>   The VA, the second-largest government agency with 220,000 people,
has been besieged with caseload problems. Last year, Congress
excoriated the department for training problems that resulted in
inaccurate decisions on four of every 10 claims for veterans
disability payments.</TE>

<LD>Therapy is at least as effective in treating depression as drugs are,
and its effects last longer, scientists said last week in a report
sure to annoy drug companies that make millions selling
antidepressants. The cost of therapy is about the same as drugs
short-term and cheaper over the long term, University of Pennsylvania
researchers told a meeting of the American Psychiatric Assn.</LD>
<LD>   "This will be a surprising, controversial finding for many
psychiatric professionals," said Penn psychologist Robert DeRubeis.
"Most believe quite strongly in the efficacy of medication."</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A 3.85-billion-year-old, green-and-white stone formation on an island
near Greenland was once thought to contain the earliest known
evidence of life on Earth, but a study suggests it formed from molten
rock at temperatures too hot for life.</LD>
<LD>   A 1996 study concluded that rocks on the offshore island of Akilia
contained a high ratio of the isotope carbon-12, which was
interpreted as evidence of microscopic life billions of years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But a study by geologists Christopher M. Fedo of George Washington
University and Martin J. Whitehouse of the Swedish Museum of Natural
History concludes that the Akilia deposit was formed from superheated
melted rock and that the enriched levels of carbon-12 could have been
caused by chemical action, not by some life form. Their findings are
in the May 24 issue of Science.</LD>

<LD>The National Human Genome Research Institute has selected the next
group of organisms most likely to have their genomes sequenced as the
efforts with humans, mice and rats approach completion. The organisms
designated as priorities are chickens, chimpanzees, several species
of fungi, a sea urchin, a microscopic animal commonly used in
laboratory studies called Tetrahymena thermophila, and honeybees.</LD>
<LD>   The institute designated two other organisms, the rhesus macaque
and a protozoan, as having a lower priority for sequencing.</LD>
<LD>   The decision does not begin large-scale sequencing on any of these
organisms. Rather, it creates a pool of candidate organisms that
institute-supported sequencing centers can choose from as capacity

<HD>Death, and Rebirth, Are Comforting Limits Amid the Infinite</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Creation and apocalypse. These are the driving themes of religion and
cosmology. How it all began, and how it will all someday end. Or not.</LD>
<LD>   I was introduced to Dartmouth cosmologist Marcelo Gleiser through
his book on beginnings, "The Dancing Universe: From Creation Myths to
the Big Bang." Now the popular Brazilian writer has worked the
entwined threads of science and religion into a vision of "the end"
that is strangely comforting and inspiring--that gives us cause to
celebrate not only the gift of life but also the finality of death.</LD>
<LD>   "Without limits, there is no desire," writes Gleiser in "The
Prophet and the Astronomer: A Scientific Journey to the End of Time."
"And without desire there is no creation. Like stars, which generate
pressure to survive the crush of gravity, we create to survive the
crush of time."</LD>
<TE>   And as good books do, Gleiser's tells you things you thought you
already knew in a way that introduces them to you for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Take the obvious fact, for example, that the sky is falling--even
as we speak.</TE>
<TE>   Buzzing about the solar system like electrons around the nucleus
of an atom are something like 10,000 asteroids larger than 10
kilometers in diameter--roughly the size of my commute between Santa
Monica and UCLA; there are about a million larger than 1 kilometer,
and 28 million bigger than a football field.</TE>
<TE>   These interplanetary interlopers come to call with distressing
regularity, careening out of control like a distracted adolescent
driver, nudged out of their usual orbit by some chance gravitational
encounter. When they drop in uninvited, we know what to expect.</TE>
<TE>   In 1908, a puny rock a mere 30 meters in diameter crossed our path
and exploded over central Siberia with an energy equivalent to 1,000
Hiroshima bombs (approximately the size of an average weapon in
today's nuclear arsenal). Thousands of square kilometers of forest
were flattened. "As far away as California," Gleiser tells us, "the
soot from the blast darkened the skies for several weeks."</TE>
<TE>   As for comets, they are too numerous to count, and at an average
of a few kilometers in diameter, large enough to trigger a global
catastrophe. Remember what happened when comet Shoemaker-Levy crashed
into Jupiter in July 1994, setting off several days of spectacular
planetary fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, space is plenty big and pretty empty. Maybe it won't
happen here. Not in our backyards. At least, not any time soon.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, an impact of the Siberia scale can be expected once every
hundred years, which makes us nearly due.</TE>
<TE>   As for a Really Big One, we can expect one of those every 10
million years. It's already been 65 million since an asteroid 10
kilometers wide crashed into the Gulf of Mexico, sending up a plume
of vaporized rock and water halfway to the moon.</TE>
<TE>   "Most parts of the United States and Mexico were completely
destroyed in a matter of hours," Gleiser tells us. "The heavens
brought hell to Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Dust, equivalent to that spewed from 1 million volcanoes, rose
into the air, blocking the sun, turning the Earth dark and cold for
months. It wasn't long before one of the most successful species ever
to walk the Earth--the dinosaurs--was history.</TE>
<TE>   "What killed the dinosaurs can kill us too," Gleiser writes. "Yes,
scientists have become the new prophets of doom."</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that with the dinosaurs out of the way, mammals
flourished, leading eventually to us. Extinction is not all doom and
gloom. It's always an opportunity for someone.</TE>
<TE>   But if we wish to survive (and we don't self-destruct first), we
could do worse than listen to these prophets with telescopes. Gleiser
is not unaware of the irony. "What was first confined to ancient
religious texts, prophecies of fiery rocks falling from the skies and
bringing widespread destruction, has become a legitimate branch of
astronomy."</TE>
<TE>   In an earlier age, the fireworks of Shoemaker-Levy would certainly
have been taken as a sign: "Repent or else!" Today, the lesson is:
"Prepare or else!"</TE>
<TE>   "We have the chance to do something," Gleiser writes, "and we
should."</TE>
<TE>   Even when the odds are small, things happen. People win lotteries.
"It would be quite foolish to rest the future of civilization (at
least of countless lives) on the feeble assurance of small odds,"
Gleiser writes. "It is a matter not of whether a serious collision
will happen, but of when."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, of course, even hell will freeze over; that much we
know. The stars will all go out. Perhaps they will be reborn again in
another space and time. In the meantime, as Gleiser reminds us, "the
skies are full of magic."</TE>
<TE>   Redemption lies in looking up.</TE>

<LD>Question: Do the widely advertised "anti-aging" medicines really
work?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Absolutely not, according to a study prepared by a
blue-ribbon panel for the International Longevity Center.</LD>
<LD>   The panel says, "There is as yet no convincing evidence that
administration of any specific compound, natural or artificial, can
globally slow aging in people, or even in mice or rats."</LD>
<TE>   While the panel concedes that anti-aging medicine represents a
multibillion-dollar industry, it argues that the movement is linked
to "a long chain of quacks, snake-oil salesmen and charlatans."
Instead of spending money on such medicines, the panel says, the best
approach is to eat right and exercise regularly.</TE>

<DH>Archeology: Scientists discover the long-lost source of
Mayan jade artifacts in Guatemala.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The unlikely combination of a 1998 hurricane, Guatemalan mineral
collectors and a chance encounter in an Antigua jewelry store has
provided the solution to a mystery that has puzzled archeologists for
at least 200 years: Where did the artisans of the Olmec empire obtain
their fabulous trove of translucent blue jade?</LD>
<LD>   Scientific expeditions and treasure hunters, known informally
among themselves as jadeistas or jade-raiders, have scoured
Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and Costa Rica searching for the source
of the rare stone. They found plenty of the green jade favored by the
later Maya, but no blue.</LD>
<LD>   But a U.S. team says that it has now found the fabled jade supply
in a Rhode Island-sized area of central Guatemala centered on the
Motagua River. High in the Sierra de las Minas, the team found
massive veins of high-quality blue streaks 6 feet wide and 150 feet
long in the wilderness, and bus-sized boulders of jewelry-quality
stone.</LD>
<TE>   The site is marked by a long-hidden road that presumably served
the early miners, and virtually everywhere the team looked, they
found traces of mining activity, said geophysicist Russell Seitz of
Boston. There are also extensive quantities of jade in green and
other colors, including white, red, brown, orange and black.</TE>
<TE>   "The variety encompasses most, if not all, of the types so far
seen in pre-Columbian America," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "We were thunderstruck," said geologist George E. Harlow of the
American Museum of Natural History in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery indicates that the Olmec, whose empire was centered
primarily in the eastern Mexico lowlands, spread their influence much
farther inland than had previously been believed, according to
archeologist Karl A. Taube of UC Riverside, who participated in the
expedition. Even if they did not mine the jade themselves, they must
have carried out extensive trade with whoever did, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   "The trade routes must have been much more extensive than we
thought," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jade, both blue and green, was an extremely valuable commodity in
pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, more valuable even than gold. It was mined
and sculpted from as early as 1500 BC until the Spanish conquest
3,000 years later.</TE>
<TE>   The blue jade, formed in the fiery bowels of the Earth, was
particularly valued by the Olmec, who dominated the region from 1100
BC to 500 BC. Artisans fashioned the stone, prized for its color and
translucence, into figurines, masks and jewelry that became the
hallmarks of the first complex culture of Central America.</TE>
<TE>   "It was their major trading material and a way of storing wealth,"
Taube said.</TE>
<TE>   The blue jade was not only economically valuable but also key to
the Olmec's religious practices as a symbol of life itself. "It's
quite common to see human figures with jade beads floating in front
of their face to indicate their life force," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Spaniards who decimated Mesoamerican populations were more
interested in gold, and the skills associated with mining and
sculpting jade were largely lost.</TE>
<TE>   But the source of blue jade was probably lost even earlier, Seitz
said. Archeological studies of the first-millennium Maya often reveal
Olmec blue-jade artifacts that have been dug up and defaced to make
new objects. In effect, "They took written plaques and chopped them
down into costume jewelry," Seitz said.</TE>
<TE>   Those discoveries suggest that blue jade was "a valuable material
whose source had been lost but that was still valuable and still
traded," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts thought that perhaps the blue jade sources had simply
been exhausted. Others felt that the mines might have been buried by
the eruption of a volcano. Whatever happened, the location of the
mines was lost for hundreds of years.</TE>
<TE>   But not for lack of trying. The 19th century German naturalist
Alexander von Humboldt made a special trip to Central America looking
for the source of the jade Olmec artifacts that had made their way to
Europe. He didn't find it. He was followed by a variety of other
jade-raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, a variety of American expeditions, many led by
Seitz under the auspices of Harvard University's Peabody Museum, had
searched for the mines with equally negative results.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles author Jerry E. Pournelle recalls participating in one
such trip to Guatemala with Seitz. "Scientifically, it's interesting
because nobody knows where the Olmecs got their great big blue jade
heads. How did they transport them, how do you move something that
big?</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking all over in Guatemala. It was a colorful
adventure, but we didn't find anything."</TE>
<TE>   The situation changed when Hurricane Mitch turned into a tropical
storm as it swept through Central America in October 1998,
devastating Honduras and Guatemala. The most powerful storm from the
Atlantic in 200 years, Mitch killed more than 11,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   But it also, apparently, uncovered the jade deposits that had
previously been hidden and sent large jade boulders tumbling into the
Rio Motagua and Rio Blanco. Eventually, mineral collectors began
bringing this material into jewelry shops as far away as Antigua,
where Seitz stumbled upon some on a 1999 Caribbean vacation with his
fiancee.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a whole pile of it on the roof," he said. "I went up to
it and said, 'Lordy, this is Olmec type.'"</TE>
<TE>   On a series of return trips to Guatemala, Seitz began tracking
down the sources of the stones. Accompanied by Harlow, Taube and
geologist Virginia B. Sisson of Rice University, Seitz was ultimately
led to most of the sites by locals who had been collecting and
selling the stones.</TE>
<TE>   "We were getting geological information the old-fashioned way:
buying it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The first site he found was a two-day hike from the Rio Motagua to
an elevation of 6,000 feet. On the shallow back slope of the
mountains, "there were great hunks of blue-green, rather attractive
jade lying all over the place," Seitz said. "It was spectacular.
There were thousands of tons, just lying around."</TE>
<TE>   In April of last year, Isauro Meccinos of San Diego, Guatemala,
brought Seitz a "jade cobblestone that was the color of aquamarine
and that, when cut to a thickness of 6 millimeters, was transparent
enough to read through. It was a real super-grade stone. He said it
was from a site that was 12 hours away by horse."</TE>
<TE>   At the site, Seitz concluded he had found the mother lode of
pre-Columbian jade. "This was where the really good stuff came from."</TE>
<TE>   The team published a short article in the journal Antiquity in
January describing their finding. They have been careful not to
reveal its precise location, however, until measures can be taken to
protect the site.</TE>
<TE>   "We would like to get in there and do a more thorough job of
studying the sites before miners begin exploiting the material,"
Taube said. "So far, we've just been focused on finding the rock
sources. Now we need to get in there and do the archeology."</TE>
