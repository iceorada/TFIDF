<HD>Sarah, On and Off the Ice</HD>
<DH>These days, Olympic champion Hughes is as busy with school
and volunteer work as she is with her figure skating.</DH>

<LD>"There has been an enormous amount of attention on me," says Olympic
gold medal figure skater Sarah Hughes matter-of-factly. "Of course,
it has been a little overwhelming. But it has calmed down, as I knew
inevitably it would with time."</LD>
<LD>   Last February, the then 16-year-old Hughes surprised the world
when she won the women's figure skating competition at the Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City. In fourth place after the technical
round, Hughes skated a near flawless artistic program and beat out
such favorites as Michelle Kwan of the United States and Irina
Slutskaya of Russia for the gold medal.</LD>
<LD>   And now she headlines her first prime-time special, "Sarah Hughes:
A Life in the Balance," premiering Wednesday on NBC. The hourlong
special combines new skating performances by the 17-year-old as well
as private moments with her family on Long Island, N.Y., and a
behind-the-scenes look at her charitable and public service projects.</LD>
<TE>   "We have some fun family moments and serious family moments," says
Hughes. "I think it's cool. I wasn't expecting that cameras would be
following me around everywhere for the special, but I had a great
time. I did get four brand-new routines for the special. They all
have meaning for me."</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer John Faratzis, who has been covering athletics
for 24 years, says he wanted the show to reflect what makes Hughes
special. "There is a great level of dedication to be able to compete
at that level," he says. "Oftentimes you meet people who are
one-dimensional. There is no other way to put it. That is what their
life is, especially when you talk about some Olympic sports when you
peak very early. The kids aren't well rounded. Well, Sarah is like
the antithesis of that."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, the fourth of six children, has always lived at home.
"Sometimes [parents] ship these kids off and they go live with a
coach someplace and the kid doesn't even see their parents," says
Faratzis. "Sarah is part of a large family. She wasn't treated
differently than anybody else. She continued to attend public school,
and most kids go straight to tutoring. She has friends and she's
involved in social activities. It was impressive to me from the
beginning that she was able to balance all of these different
elements in her life, and at 16 she could make the kind of commitment
that was necessary to be a world classic skater but yet still be
interested in school work. I thought that it would be interesting to
people, given that she burst onto the world stage."</TE>
<TE>   In the special, Hughes talks about her mother's bout with breast
cancer. "Her cancer was very serious," says Hughes. "It required a
lot of treatment. She is healthy now, knock on wood. It used to be
very difficult to talk about, but it's very important to raise
awareness for it. This summer I shot a commercial on breast cancer
awareness, so the special shows behind the scenes of my commercials."</TE>
<TE>   The special also chronicles her work for General Electric's Heroes
for Health Program. "I am the ambassador for the program. I go around
the country and visit hospitals and spend time with kids and
recognize people who have really made a difference in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes also is involved with Campbell Soup's Labels for Education
program, "where schools can collect labels on the cans. You add up
the points [for each label] of the year and you trade in points for
educational equipment. The Sarah Hughes Scholarship offers additional
money. The special shows me visiting a school where we kicked off the
program this year."</TE>
<TE>   Currently a senior at Great Neck North High School, Hughes is busy
applying to colleges. At this point, though, she's undecided about a
major. "I was interested in medicine," she says, but since making the
special, Hughes acknowledges, "the more interested I am in
filmmaking."</TE>

<HD>Seeking a Haven, Mideast Vacationers Head for Malaysia</HD>
<DH>The Southeast Asia nation offers pristine beaches and
colorful culture with a peaceful, Islamic backdrop for well-heeled
Arabs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sean Yoong</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>When Saudi housing developer Ghassan Nasry began thinking about a
family vacation, he ruled out Western countries because of reports
about Arab travelers being harassed. Then he remembered TV
advertisements touting the allures of Malaysia.</LD>
<LD>   This predominantly Muslim nation in Southeast Asia has long
attracted visitors from nearby countries to its pristine beaches and
colorful culture. Now it's also becoming a destination for Middle
Easterners seeking luxury vacations with a peaceful, familiar Islamic
backdrop.</LD>
<LD>   "There is so much to see and enjoy," 32-year-old Nasry said as he
strolled with his wife and five children outside the Petronas Twin
Towers, the world's tallest buildings. "When I go back to Jeddah, I
can tell my friends: 'Why must you go to places where you do not feel
welcome? Just come to Malaysia!' "</LD>
<TE>   The number of Middle Easterners visiting this country had been
rising steadily since the late 1990s. After the Sept. 11 attacks on
the United States, even more have been coming to what they consider a
friendly, moderate nation.</TE>
<TE>   Malaysia had 66,010 tourists from the Middle East from June to
August, immigration figures say. That was an increase of 18% over the
same period in 2001, making the Middle East one of Malaysia's
fastest-growing tourist markets.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism is Malaysia's second-largest earner of foreign currency,
bringing in $6.8 billion last year from 12.8 million visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the tourists are from neighboring countries in Southeast
Asia, but those from the Middle East are much sought after because
many are wealthier, take longer vacations and visit several Malaysian
destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Tourism Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir, who has led numerous
promotional missions to the Middle East, said recently that Malaysia
hoped to attract as many as 250,000 visitors from that region in
2002, doubling the previous year's total.</TE>
<TE>   Travelers from the Middle East usually stop first in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia's largest city, which mixes mosques and Islamic museums with
cosmopolitan facilities like shopping malls and five-star hotels.</TE>
<TE>   From there, many head for scenic islands such as Langkawi and
Penang, which Malaysians call the "Pearl of the Orient." Others opt
for cooler hilltop resort areas like Cameron Highlands, filled with
strawberry farms and garden playgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   No one in Malaysia wants to be left out of this business boom.
Hotels and travel agents have been scrambling to increase their
promotional campaigns in the Middle East and cater to the needs of
tourists from that region.</TE>
<TE>   Suleiman Tunku Abdul Rahman, director of communications for
Malaysia's Shangri-La hotel group, said the company's two beach
resorts in Penang had set up rooms for Muslim prayers and hired Arab
staffers to operate a special front desk to welcome Middle Eastern
guests.</TE>
<TE>   The group sent representatives to tourism fairs in Saudi Arabia
and United Arab Emirates, and its efforts seem to be paying off. The
two Penang resorts had 21,478 Middle Eastern guests in the first
eight months of this year, a 44% increase over the same period in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   Awareness of Malaysia in Muslim countries has also been bolstered
by its hosting of several key meetings of the 57-member Organization
of the Islamic Conference in recent years and by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's high international profile.</TE>
<TE>   Mahathir is expected next year to become chairman of the Islamic
conference, the only pan-Islamic organization, which aims to
represent the world's 1.2 billion Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all hearing about Malaysia," said Nawaf Al-Matouq, a
28-year-old tourist from Kuwait. "We hear it's a beautiful place and
safe for Muslims. We hear about your leader, Mr. Mahathir. So, of
course, we would like to visit this country."</TE>
<TE>   Malaysia became a focus for part of the investigation into the
Sept. 11 attacks after officials revealed that two of the hijackers
who crashed an American Airlines jetliner into the Pentagon met with
other Al Qaeda figures here in January 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Mahathir's government has arrested more than 70 suspected members
of an Islamic militant network with alleged Al Qaeda ties. But
Malaysia is overwhelmingly peaceful, and militant sentiments are held
by a tiny minority.</TE>

<HD>Birds Build Nest Eggs for Thai Investors</HD>
<DH>Swiftlets move into 'condos' featuring such perks as proper
temperature and music. Their nests are a pricey delicacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Uamdao Noikorn</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>PAK PANANG, Thailand</DL>
<LD>The real estate market may be slumping elsewhere in Thailand, but
it's flying high in this small, sleepy town -- thanks to the birds.</LD>
<LD>   Enterprising residents are building "bird condos" and converting
old buildings to accommodate and pamper flocks of swiftlets whose
edible nests are proving to be a gold mine for investors.</LD>
<LD>   Although nobody is quite sure why these sparrow-like birds are
homing in on Pak Panang, building owners try to keep them coming,
adding inducements such as proper temperature, favored feed and even
hi-fi systems playing swiftlet songs.</LD>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of luck. There's no other way to explain this.
We've seen many times that they flocked into one building and ignored
the very next one with the same environment," said Chainarong
Sawasdeenarunath, the town mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Once happily settled, the swiftlets fashion cup-shaped nests for
their offspring from glutinous saliva. For centuries, the Chinese
have regarded the nests, often served in a soup, as a delicacy with
purported medicinal qualities.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of collecting the nests, which are normally found
in remote caves, and their scarcity have driven up prices.</TE>
<TE>   Locals say a pound of bird's nests, which cost about $14 three
decades ago, now fetches up to $830. The price can be three times
higher in Hong Kong, a major importer of a product that some believe
can do everything from cure cancer to increase sex drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Forestry Department says the area around Pak Panang, 370 miles
south of Bangkok, the capital, is prime ground for swiftlets because
it's close to Thailand's biggest wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The district's 20,000 humans have benefited from tourists
attracted by the novelty of seeing birds by the tens of thousands
blanketing the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "We're planning to turn one road into Swiftlet Street to handle
tourists more systematically," Chainarong said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the bird droppings, noise and danger of bird-borne
diseases, townspeople see the swiftlets as messengers of hope as
Thailand strives to recover from the Asian financial crisis of 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The town already has more than 100 bird homes, half of them
jointly owned by investors from Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and
Indonesia. But only about 30 are currently occupied, despite the
various lures.</TE>
<TE>   The municipality continues to approve applications for more "bird
condos" -- bare, empty structures punctured on all sides by small
holes that serve as entrances for the avian residents.</TE>
<TE>   Once a colony settles in, only trained nest collectors are allowed
inside because swiftlets are easily disturbed. Collectors must have a
soft touch and tread, and their clothes and bodies should not exude
strong odors.</TE>
<TE>   The nests are removed before the birds can lay eggs. This is done
at the start of three consecutive egg-laying periods. During the
fourth season, the nests are left untouched so that eggs can be laid
and hatched.</TE>
<TE>   Suthi Noppakun, 75, said the nestings started about 40 years ago
in a storeroom on the top floor of a three-story combination shop and
house owned by a merchant.</TE>
<TE>   Today, each condo can yield more than 100 pounds of nests a month,
he says.</TE>
<TE>   Suthi said the income has enabled him to buy a house in Bangkok.</TE>
<TE>   Even millionaires like Bunkit Leelertphan can't help salivating
over the profits.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see any reason why I shouldn't jump up on the bandwagon.
The Hong Kong and American markets are getting bigger. The Chinese
market is even more robust," said Bunkit, whose company produces a
popular herbal toothpaste.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bunkit paid $52,870 -- an exceptionally high price for
real estate in provincial Thailand -- for a small plot of land to
build a five-story building.</TE>
<TE>   Three months after construction began, the birds started coming
in.</TE>
<TE>   "All I do now is just wait for them to pack the place while
putting final touches on the condo," he says with a grin.</TE>

<HD>Large Carnivores Feeling the Bite of Development</HD>
<DH>Bears, wolves and lynx proliferated in communist era. But
now houses are infiltrating Eastern Europe's forests, and highways
are slicing up the wilderness.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vanessa Gera</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>BRASOV, Romania</DL>
<LD>For the fabled wolves and brown bears roaming the dark forests of
Transylvania, communism wasn't all that bad.</LD>
<LD>   Romania's notorious dictator, Nicolae Ceausescu, who ruled for 25
years before communism collapsed, outlawed bear-hunting for all but
himself and his friends.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, when Ceausescu was toppled and executed in 1989, the
country's forests were teeming with bears and other animals. In fact,
there were too many, environmentalists say. Shepherds and farmers
lost much livestock to wolves and bears pushed out of the forests in
search of food.</LD>
<TE>   But experts say the future could hold bad news for the beasts of
the East.</TE>
<TE>   They say rapid development, spurred by the prospect of joining the
European Union, could carve up one of the continent's few remaining
wildernesses and endanger its animal life.</TE>
<TE>   In a report this year, the World Wide Fund for Nature warned that
development threatens the Carpathian mountains that run from Austria
through Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and
Ukraine.</TE>
<TE>   The bulk of the Carpathians' 39,000 square miles are in Romania,
where the vast, virgin forests of Transylvania are among Europe's
last pristine ecosystems.</TE>
<TE>   The WWF predicts that the rapid spread of highways and modern
agriculture will lead to "land degradation and the loss of
biodiversity" in the Carpathians. Highways will fragment habitats,
and European Union farm policy encourages overproduction, large-scale
mechanized farming and use of chemical fertilizers, it says.</TE>
<TE>   All the former communist countries in the Carpathians except
Ukraine are expected to join the EU by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   At stake are the large carnivores -- bears, wolves, lynx -- and a
slew of other animals, including the chamois and imperial eagle, that
dwell in forests of pine, beech, hazelnut and fir.</TE>
<TE>   Decisions made now about construction and conservation will
determine whether Romania's natural treasures will ultimately
survive, says George Predoiu, a carnivore specialist at the state
Forest Research and Management Institute.</TE>
<TE>   "The bear population isn't threatened now," he said. "But it could
be in 10 years because of development.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to manage the situation now in order to prevent them
from becoming threatened," added Predoiu, who runs a project that
gives farmers free electric fences to protect livestock against
attacks by the big meat eaters.</TE>
<TE>   He and other Romanian environmentalists fear that the Carpathians
will go the way of Western Europe, where alpine areas have become
overdeveloped, and wolves, bears and other species are extinct.</TE>
<TE>   "In France, there are debates as to whether there are four or five
bears left in the entire country," said Ioan Abrudan, a professor of
forestry at Transylvania University of Brasov. "In this country,
there are more than 5,000."</TE>
<TE>   There are also about 3,000 gray wolves -- a species exterminated
in nearly all Western and Central European countries -- and some
2,000 lynx, making the Romanian Carpathians home to the highest
concentration of large carnivores in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   For once, communism gets a little credit.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was a myth that communism was terrible for the
environment," said Paul Csagoly, a spokesman for the WWF in Budapest,
Hungary. "Communism concentrated people and industry, and then you
got the smokestacks and chemical spills. This is what the West took
photos of. But outside of those concentrated areas, the land was
nationalized and left alone."</TE>
<TE>   With people eager to transform potholed roads into fast highways
and to retreat on weekends from dreary communist-era apartments in
polluted cities to mountain cottages, pristine areas will not remain
so forever.</TE>
<TE>   Already, forests that were nationalized in the 1950s and 1960s are
slowly returning to private ownership.</TE>
<TE>   "Before 1989, there were no landowners' rights," Predoiu said.
"But since the 1990s, it's again possible to build private homes, and
many have been built throughout the Carpathians -- wherever there's a
road and a power line."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1989, hunting has been fully opened to foreigners, who pay
up to $25,000 to kill a bear. Romanians pay much less -- up to about
$400.</TE>
<TE>   To meet EU requirements, Romania implemented international
agreements in the 1990s that strictly limit the numbers of wild
animals that can be culled and exported. For now, legal hunting poses
little threat to the long-term survival of Romania's carnivores.</TE>
<TE>   But this could change.</TE>
<TE>   Predoiu predicts that as rural populations modernize, they will
increasingly demand the removal of the bears and wolves that prey on
their livestock.</TE>
<TE>   Although lynxes -- so shy that some local people doubt that they
even exist -- inflict almost no damage on livestock, hunters oppose
protecting them because one lynx can kill 50 to 60 deer a year.</TE>
<TE>   Already, other countries in Eastern Europe are coming under
pressure to reduce the number of predators.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Slovenia doubled the number of bears that can be
hunted yearly, which could cause that country's 400 bears to
disappear soon, experts say. The government justified its decision by
citing the damage that bears cause.</TE>
<TE>   In Romania, hunters insist that they are committed to preserving
the number of animals in the forests.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in his office under a mounted boar's head, Tudor Daneti,
73, the president of the hunting association in Brasov, describes his
support for strict hunting laws and recalls how game managers used to
fatten up bears to make them easy prey for the dictator.</TE>
<TE>   "Ceausescu wasn't a hunter -- he was a killer," Daneti said. "But
no one really thinks about this anymore. We have other problems now."</TE>

<HD>Japanese Getting a Cultural Nudge -- From a Foreigner</HD>
<DH>An American woman is featured in a TV ad promoting the
nation's heritage at a time of lagging self-confidence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Yuri Kageyama</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The American in a kimono bows deeply with a polite smile, daintily
shapes flowers into an artful arrangement and kneels to put her
traditional Japanese slippers in their proper place.</LD>
<LD>   The message of this TV public service announcement starring Jeanie
Fuji is clear: Japanese have grown so out-of-touch with their culture
that they need reminding from an American who's doing it better.</LD>
<LD>   "Many younger Japanese don't know about Japan and aren't
interested. And I think Japan has such a fantastic, rich culture,"
said Fuji, a demure-looking blond who is clearly quite foreign
despite her kimono.</LD>
<TE>   The ad, first aired in October, highlights a growing trend here to
value cultural heritage at a time when the nation's self-confidence
is lagging from an economic slowdown.</TE>
<TE>   This one is in tandem with a government effort to promote cultural
identity. Authorities mandated the study of Japanese music and other
traditions in schools starting this year, and are considering a bill
supporting a curriculum to instill patriotism -- an idea some
pacifists oppose.</TE>
<TE>   "Here's an American who is more Japanese than a Japanese," said
Eiji Ga of the Japan Ad Council, which created the commercial
featuring Fuji, an innkeeper at a hot-springs resort.</TE>
<TE>   "It's calling on Japanese to re-examine our identity."</TE>
<TE>   The ad council is a group of businesses that periodically makes
public service announcements with social messages, such as staying
away from drugs or keeping city streets clean.</TE>
<TE>   The San Francisco-born Fuji, 36, entered one of Japan's strictest
worlds when she married the heir of Fujiya, a 350-year-old inn at the
Ginzan hot springs in northern Japan's Yamagata prefecture.</TE>
<TE>   Wearing a kimono every day, Fuji runs the inn -- all the while
following the strict rules of etiquette that dictate the proper way
to serve tea, pass a tray or enter a room -- "completely
choreographed," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Mari Kobayashi, a 41-year-old Tokyo doll maker, and her husband
spend New Year's Eve every year at the 12-room Fujiya.</TE>
<TE>   She said Fuji looks foreign, "but she isn't pushy or loud, like a
lot" of foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   Fuji taught English in Japan after college and met her husband,
Atsushi, 43, during a ski trip. They married 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Training at the inn was hard, she said. She had to start by
learning the dirty work -- like dishwashing.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a lot of mistakes. It's a habit now," Fuji said, switching
midway through the telephone interview into Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   The couple have a 5-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old son.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint that foreigners seem to appreciate Japanese culture
more than the Japanese themselves isn't new.</TE>
<TE>   Over the decades of modernization, Japanese have turned to
Hollywood, Disneyland and hip-hop for inspiration at the cost of
their own traditions: Kabuki theater, taiko drumming, the tea
ceremony and haiku poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Performers of traditional arts often go unnoticed at home, perhaps
taken for granted or considered unfashionable, only to reach stardom
after receiving rave reviews on overseas tours.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, school programs were devoted to Western music," said
Katsunori Ouchi, an Education Ministry official. "But unless Japanese
study their own culture, they can't explain anything when they get
asked questions abroad."</TE>
<TE>   Noriko Kitano, a hairstylist in her 50s who loves the samurai
theater, believes in tradition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the spirit of Japan," she said. "Young people shouldn't
forget the beauty of the kimono."</TE>
<TE>   Fuji believes it's up to the Japanese to decide how much tradition
they want to keep. She said all traditions -- like Christmas in the
United States -- are sometimes restraining but can be a bonding
force.</TE>
<TE>   "To become truly international, you must first understand your own
culture," Fuji said.</TE>

<HD>It's Not Just a Shopping Trip, It's an Adventure for Bored
Kuwaitis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Sullivan</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>At the Souk Sharq, all roads meet at the top of the escalator. And by
9 p.m. on a weekend night, the traffic inside Kuwait's premier mall
is jammed.</LD>
<LD>   The regular crowd of shoppers, loiterers and wanderers has become
a swirling mass of humanity. Teenage boys with stringy mustaches keep
watch on the girls out of the corners of their eyes. Lines lengthen
at Burger King, where mothers draped in black feed French fries to
their children. Immigrant janitors dodge everyone else as they try to
sweep up cigarette butts and trash. When a cell phone rings, and they
always seem to be ringing here, a dozen or more people pat their
pockets.</LD>
<LD>   Things aren't much different in the parking lot, where Fords and
Chevys battle for spots with herds of Mercedes and BMWs.</LD>
<TE>   Another Iraq war looms and the emir is ailing. But this is Kuwait,
and the weekend is here. So at the souk -- the Arabic word for market
-- there's just one thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   "I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT SHOPPING," blares a poster for a
clothing store in foot-tall pink letters, just outside the exit to
the mall. That pretty well sums things up.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here all the time," said Zeyad al Owaish, 19, who was at
the mall on a recent weekend night. "This is what we do."</TE>
<TE>   They do it with a fervency that borders on the religious. Shopping
is popular the world over, and cruising malls is a skill that
American teenagers have been honing for more than a generation. But
in Kuwait, a conservative Muslim country, heading to the mall has
become about much more than shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait has no bars, no discos and little for young people to do
with their free time. Alcohol is banned and dancing so restricted it
might as well be. It's a country where hashish can be easier to find
than black market Budweiser, and where money and boredom are helping
fuel an increasing drug problem. Over long weekends, it's almost
impossible to get flights to the more easy-living Gulf states, like
Dubai or Bahrain.</TE>
<TE>   So they shop.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing else to do here," grumbled Mohammed Kajal, a
Lebanese worker who has spent 20 years in Kuwait -- but only because
he can earn a better living here than he would in Beirut. "In Dubai,
you can have fun. But here: nothing!"</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Kuwaitis can afford to shop, even with the steep prices
at the Souk Sharq.</TE>
<TE>   This New Jersey-sized Gulf state sits atop 10% of the planet's
proven oil reserves, giving it the world's sixth-largest gross
domestic product per capita. They spend a lot of it at the Souk
Sharq. It's not Kuwait's most exclusive mall -- that would be the
Salhia Complex, with its Cartier, Chanel and other hyper-expensive
boutiques -- but on a weekend night, the souk becomes the country's
most popular destination.</TE>
<TE>   The mall, which sprawls out over many acres, is a monument to
oil-money consumerism and American-dominated globalization. Men in
flowing tunics and many women covered in black show that this is the
Arab world, but little else does.</TE>
<TE>   There's Starbucks and Haagen-Dazs and Whopper Value Meals at
Burger King for 1.25 Kuwaiti dinars -- about $3.75. Tommy Hilfiger
T-shirts are $39.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a quiet consumerism on display here. Instead, it's tight
spangly cardigan sweaters for $66 and green giraffe-leather Italian
shoes for $375. It's Swiss watches and diamond necklaces that cost
more than many in Kuwait's vast army of foreign workers earn in a
year. Nearly two-thirds of the 2.3 million residents come from abroad
to fill low-status jobs.</TE>
<TE>   For many of its patrons, the souk is barely about shopping at all.</TE>
<TE>   Al Owaish, the 19-year-old, says the prime attraction is one young
people find in malls everywhere: seeking the opposite sex.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to do it secretly," al Owaish said, waving his hand
discreetly to show how he motions girls to come over to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "If her brother sees you, it's a big problem. He might want to
beat you up," said al Owaish, who was photographing a friend outside
the mall on a recent evening, using his new $600 mobile phone-camera.
"With Arabs, this is a big problem."</TE>
<TE>   For some Kuwaitis, the real problem reaches much deeper. For some,
the rampant consumerism bred by oil wealth has irrevocably changed a
nation that is, at its core, deeply conservative.</TE>
<TE>   "We've made steps forward financially, but as far as our social
fabric goes, we've moved backward," said Waleed al Tabtabai, a
conservative lawmaker. He believes that Kuwait's wealth has made it
lazy, by allowing its citizens to contract out to foreign workers an
immense amount of work -- from street sweeping to newspaper reporting
-- leaving a lot of time for shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "Materialism has overpowered our values and morals," Tabtabai
said.</TE>
<TE>   That may be. But it's also lawmakers like al Tabtabai who have
tried to make sure that alternatives to shopping, from bars to
nightclubs, are banned.</TE>
<TE>   "People have to do something," Kajal said. "So they come to the
mall."</TE>

<HD>Chechens With 2 Homelands Find Neither Welcoming</HD>
<DH>Many families are back in land of exile, finding
war-ravaged Chechnya unbearable. But Kazakhstan refuses to accept
them as refugees.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Burt Herman</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>KAINAR, Kazakhstan</DL>
<LD>Abumuslim Israpilov places his hand on the cold tombstone rising from
the Kazakh steppes, praying briefly over his grandmother's body. It
is a moment soaked with irony.</LD>
<LD>   Israpilov's grandmother is buried here, in Central Asia, and not
in her native Chechnya, because nearly 60 years ago Stalin the
dictator deported the entire Chechen population 1,500 miles east to
Kazakhstan.</LD>
<LD>   Now her grandson has moved here because life in Chechnya has
become so awful that impoverished Kazakhstan, symbol of perhaps the
greatest injustice inflicted on the Chechens, has come to seem
comfortable by comparison.</LD>
<TE>   Israpilov was an airport technician in Grozny, the Chechen
capital, until the fighting and bombing became too much for him. In
June 2000, he became one of 12,000 Chechens who have sought refuge in
their forefathers' land of exile during the eight years that war has
ravaged their homeland in the Caucasus Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery of crescent-crowned Muslim graves is in Kainar, a
village 28 miles west of Kazakhstan's commercial capital, Almaty.
Kainar's small cement houses, built by Stalin's deported Chechens,
have become home to their uprooted descendants.</TE>
<TE>   Now more Chechens are appealing to Kazakhstan for sanctuary away
from the misery of refugee camps. Unwelcome elsewhere, they see this
country as one of their last options, a Muslim nation that once gave
them refuge, education and jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like a second motherland for us," Israpilov said.</TE>
<TE>   But the Chechens' plea to be recognized as refugees presents the
Kazakhstan government with a quandary. It wants good relations with
the Kremlin, and refugee status might be read as questioning Russian
President Vladimir Putin's claim that Chechnya is returning to normal
and that the refugees can go home.</TE>
<TE>   It was Feb. 23, 1944, when, on Stalin's orders, all Chechens were
deported to Kazakhstan -- half a million people herded into freezing
railroad cars bound for the steppes. Stalin feared that the Chechens
would join the advancing German army and turn against the Soviet
Union, as they had three other times after the 1917 revolution.
Actually, thousands of Chechens served in the Soviet army during
World War II, and some were decorated for valor.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Chechens were sent to the icy, inhospitable north of
Kazakhstan, and in the next 13 years until they were allowed to
return home, half of them died from cold, disease and hunger, said
Akhmet Muradov, chairman of a Chechen cultural association in
Kazakhstan.</TE>
<TE>   A few stayed here and today are Kazakh citizens, numbering about
32,000 -- a tiny minority in the vast post-Soviet republic of 17
million. But the newcomers are Russian citizens and not officially
recognized as refugees. They complain of discrimination in residency
permits and jobs, especially since the Moscow theater attack by
Chechen rebels in October that left 129 hostages dead.</TE>
<TE>   More than 10,500 Chechen refugees signed a letter in November
appealing to Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev for refuge, but he
refused, calling it an internal Russian matter.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Muradov warns that thousands of Chechens crowded into
refugee camps in Ingushetia, the region in Russia neighboring
Chechnya, will come here to avoid a fourth winter in tents,
surrounded by Russian troops.</TE>
<TE>   "They ran away from Chechnya to Ingushetia, but it's almost the
same situation as in Chechnya now," Muradov said. "In Chechnya, the
situation is even worse than it was in 1944 during the war. People
are looking for a place where they can survive."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. refugee agency has won Kazakhstan's agreement to grant de
facto refugee status to Chechens who have already fled here and let
them work. The agency is also pushing Kazakhstan to prolong residency
permits from three months to six months with a possible six-month
extension.</TE>
<TE>   But the Chechens have little money -- Israpilov survives on $6 a
month in handouts from relief agencies -- and refugees who can't
afford to bribe the corrupt bureaucracy don't get registered. During
a recent trip to northern Kazakhstan, U.N. officials said they had
heard reports of at least 30 deportations and feared that was only a
small part of the problem.</TE>
<TE>   Kazakh officials are also stepping up screening practices.</TE>
<TE>   Lyoma Zaurbekov, 51, a former electrician at the Grozny circus who
came to Kazakhstan in May 2000 with his wife and two sons, said that
when he recently tried to renew his registration, he was videotaped
mug-shot style, told to speak so that his voice would be on record,
then denied registration. He said the officials asked him: "When are
you getting ready to go home?"</TE>
<TE>   Taisiya Khildkhoroyeva, 37, who had a miscarriage of twins while
hiding in a basement during an air raid on Grozny, said she went back
to Chechnya this summer to see what had changed. She found her
university and apartment block in rubble.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had somewhere to go, I'd go, but I don't know where," she
said, taking a break from a free hairdressing class for refugees in
Almaty. "There's nothing there."</TE>

<HD>Near Miss Demonstrates Peril of Lake Victoria</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>George Mwangi</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ABOARD THE MV SERENGETI</DL>
<LD>The radar alarm suddenly goes off. Capt. Manase Kombe frantically
begins raking a searchlight over the dark waters of Africa's largest
lake, trying to locate whatever might be in the path of his ferry.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, the beam spotlights a dugout canoe carrying two men. A
voice rings out -- "May God protect you!" -- as the tiny craft rocks
perilously in the swell of the passing 185-foot-long MV Serengeti.</LD>
<LD>   "They're supposed to have some kind of light," the 35-year-old
captain said. "The radar often fails to pick them up."</LD>
<TE>   Mishaps and tragedies are common on Lake Victoria, the
second-largest freshwater lake in the world. But the millions of
people who live near it still prefer to travel by boat because roads
in central Africa are bad or nonexistent, and banditry is rife.</TE>
<TE>   On Nov. 6, a small overloaded wooden vessel carrying 30 passengers
and cargo struck another boat at night near the lake's Kenyan shore,
causing at least 18 deaths.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of people have perished in the last year in accidents off
the Ugandan shore.</TE>
<TE>   In May 1996, more than 700 people died when the badly overcrowded
MV Bukoba capsized just outside the Tanzanian port of Mwanza.</TE>
<TE>   Dangers on the water are not confined to this part of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Across the continent, the ferry MS Joola capsized in the Atlantic
off Gambia on Sept. 26 while carrying twice its legal passenger load.
The official death toll stands at more than 1,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Kombe's near-miss with the canoe, the Danish-built Serengeti
carried 405 people and 120 tons of goods, well below its capacity of
593 passengers and 565 tons of cargo, the captain says.</TE>
<TE>   It is the only big boat now making the 110-mile trip between
Mwanza and Bukoba, another Tanzanian port. The 262-foot MV Victoria,
with a passenger capacity of 1,254, is in dry dock for servicing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true that people are scared of my boat because it's smaller
and sometimes rolls, but I can assure you it is very safe," Kombe
said.</TE>
<TE>   He says he keeps a close watch on its load because overloading is
one of the main causes of boat accidents in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the passengers on the three-deck Serengeti make the
overnight trip spread out on the deck of a third-class lounge. Some
have brought mattresses; others rent them from enterprising crew
members.</TE>
<TE>   "I am confident I will travel safely although it is very
uncomfortable," said Fatuma Sued, huddling with her three children
amid bundles of second-hand clothing she has bought in Mwanza to sell
in Bukoba.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Hansen, 19, who is from Denmark, is doing volunteer work in
Tanzania. He and his friends are taking the boat to neighboring
Uganda for a holiday, he says, because there is no other way to get
to Uganda's Ssese Islands off Tanzanian territory.</TE>
<TE>   The captain, however, is not completely comfortable navigating the
26,500-square-mile lake, which has not been surveyed for nearly a
century.</TE>
<TE>   "We're using navigational charts from surveys done in 1908," said
Kombe, who has been a lake captain for 12 years. "So many things have
changed."</TE>
<TE>   On his chart, the Kenyan port of Kisumu is labeled Port Florence.
That was the name in British colonial days, when the town was named
after the wife of the chief engineer on a railway completed in 1902
to link Lake Victoria with the Indian Ocean.</TE>
<TE>   Kombe says one of the cargo boats operated by Marine Services,
owner of the Serengeti and Victoria, was badly damaged last year when
it struck a rock not marked on maps. Lighthouses along the shore were
vandalized years ago, and there are no buoys to mark rocks and other
obstacles, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He also doesn't like that there is no centralized radio
communication across the lake. If his ferry got in trouble, he
reckons that he would have to wait as long as five hours to get help.</TE>
<TE>   Josbell Sikazwe, a supervisor at a diving firm in Mwanza, blames
the management of shipping companies.</TE>
<TE>   "They are there for profit, they are not following proper safety

<HD>Terrorism Goes Trendy in Germany</HD>
<DH>Some worry about the Red Army Faction's pop culture
revival. Others view it as harmless expression of a bygone era.</DH>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>They kidnapped business leaders, gunned down police officers and
hijacked an airliner. But even after Sept. 11, the failed German
revolutionaries who spread fear in the 1970s and '80s have acquired a
certain chic.</LD>
<LD>   Left-wingers were always nostalgic for the ideals of the student
movement from which the feared Red Army Faction terrorists sprang --
strident opposition to the Vietnam War, rebellion against their
parents' silence on World War II, a society still not completely
purged of old Nazis.</LD>
<LD>   Now a wave of films that give the terrorists a more human face,
and a series of cheeky fashion items, suggest a broader recasting of
history is under way. Some, including Germany's president, worry
about the Red Army Faction's pop culture revival, while others see in
it a harmless expression of a bygone era.</LD>
<TE>   "There's an in-crowd who thinks it's chic to make the RAF into
Robin Hood figures," said Klaus Boelling, who was the government's
spokesman when the violence reached its bloody peak 25 years ago this
fall.</TE>
<TE>   "But murder is murder, and Germans know that ideological terrorism
is a real danger, today and in the future," he said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 18, 1977, Boelling was able to tell a relieved nation that
German troops had freed 86 hostages on a Lufthansa plane hijacked to
Mozambique to force the release of three jailed RAF leaders. The
three, Andreas Baader, Ulrike Meinhof and Jan-Carl Raspe, committed
suicide in prison after the attempt failed.</TE>
<TE>   But it was also Boelling's job to announce the day after that the
kidnapped head of the nation's Industry Federation, Hanns-Martin
Schleyer, had been found shot dead.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Army Faction went on to bomb U.S. military targets and
assassinate a string of business and political figures. It only
formally disbanded in 1998, although it had been inactive for some
years.</TE>
<TE>   Several cases remain unsolved, and suspects are still on the run.
Yet filmmakers and writers, many from the same generation, have
already begun to reexamine the period, placing a focus on the
perpetrators that rankles older Germans.</TE>
<TE>   Oscar-winning filmmaker Volker Schloendorff paved the way in 1999
with "The Legends of Rita," about a young woman swept into the
terrorist movement by idealism and love.</TE>
<TE>   The trickle has become a flood, with at least half a dozen new
films in cinemas and on television this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Box Germany" featured a gripping interview with the widow
of Alfred Herrhausen, the chairman of Deutsche Bank killed by a bomb
in 1989 -- and balanced it with a portrait of Wolfgang Grams, an RAF
terrorism suspect who, according to an official investigation, shot
himself to death in 1993 as police were closing in on him.</TE>
<TE>   Others include "The State I Am In," described by Der Spiegel
magazine as an "RAF road movie," and "What to Do in Case of Fire," an
attempt to make amateur bomb-making into sentimental comedy.</TE>
<TE>   Most disputed is the movie "Baader," about the male half of the
Baader-Meinhof name that evolved into the RAF. It drew stinging
criticism at this year's Berlin film festival for glamorizing the era
-- but still walked off with a prize.</TE>
<TE>   The movie, by little-known German director Christopher Roth,
begins with a pounding punk-rock soundtrack and spends two hours
painting a stylish picture of Andreas Baader as a moody maverick with
a taste for fine clothes and fast cars.</TE>
<TE>   It ends in his fictional death in a defiant solo showdown with
dozens of armed police, strutting out of a garage where he had been
cornered, pistols blazing. Baader was actually captured and
imprisoned in 1972, five years before his suicide.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics defend the Butch Cassidy-like embellishments as
little different from any Hollywood director's efforts to freshen up
a plot.</TE>
<TE>   But others say even that is done badly.</TE>
<TE>   "It lacks a sense of timing, plot and tension," the left-leaning
Tageszeitung daily said, judging that the film ultimately
"capitulates before the RAF myth."</TE>
<TE>   Addressing relatives of the terrorists' victims on the 25th
anniversary of the Schleyer killing, President Johannes Rau expressed
concern that young Germans know too little of what really happened.</TE>
<TE>   "For many, the acronym RAF is foreign, a phenomenon, almost a
phantom," he said.</TE>
<TE>   While praising some documentaries for capturing the fear of the
RAF years, Rau said others "seem to me to be strangely distanced and
sober. They lack feeling and compassion."</TE>
<TE>   Attention has also focused on the recycling of RAF symbols, such
as its trademark machine gun and red star.</TE>
<TE>   Stores have marketed underwear bearing the slogan "Prada-Meinhof"
-- a play on "Baader-Meinhof," making unauthorized use of the fashion
company's name. A Berlin boutique offers T-shirts for infants with
"Terrorist" in bright colors across the chest.</TE>
<TE>   "The symbols of murder have surfaced in stylish ad campaigns, as
if the terrorists were heroes of pop culture," Rau complained.</TE>
<TE>   Still, others argue that the terrorists could only be remodeled
because the leftism of the period is no longer relevant.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer was once a street-fighting
anarchist leader in Frankfurt -- part of the mystique that has helped
make him the country's most popular politician. Lawyer Otto Schily,
now Germany's interior minister, once defended Baader in court.</TE>
<TE>   Films such as Roth's, wrote the Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper,
show just "how completely the memories have lost their political
content, and into what deep sediment October 1977 has sunk."</TE>
<TE>   "So much time has passed that it has a different value today,"
Christoph Heiss, an unemployed 40-year-old, said after seeing
"Baader" at a Berlin movie theater. "It's already a matter for
history -- even for pop history."</TE>

<DL>SELISHTEN DOL, Bulgaria</DL>
<LD>A young pet tiger is scaring thieves away from a tiny Bulgarian
village and pulling in the tourists.</LD>
<LD>   Locals say no robberies have been reported in Selishten Dol, 40
miles west of Sofia, since a retired general bought the 9-month-old
Siberian female tiger, Raja, in June.</LD>
<LD>   "Not a single house has been burgled since the tiger has been in
the village. The fame of our Raja seems to be proving a better
deterrent than the police," said Iskra Simeonova, 75.</LD>
<TE>   Burglary was previously common in the village, where many holiday
villas are unoccupied for much of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Raja also makes Selishten Dol an attractive tourist spot, with
parents bringing children for a free glimpse of the tiger rather than
paying to visit the cash-strapped Sofia zoo.</TE>
<TE>   Raja shares her home with two cats, four dogs, sheep, hens, a pig
and a cow.</TE>

<HD>Chavez's Foes Keep Up the Pressure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ibon Villelabeitia</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets Friday,
pressing for President Hugo Chavez to resign and defying a Supreme
Court order to resume vital oil operations paralyzed by an opposition
strike.</LD>
<LD>   Chanting, "Not one step back," the protesters blocked highways in
Caracas in the 19th day of a shutdown that has slashed oil production
and crippled shipments from the world's No. 5 petroleum exporter. It
has also stoked fears of violence in this politically divided country
of 23 million people.</LD>
<LD>   Chavez sympathizers turned out in smaller numbers to support the
president, who refuses to quit and has sent troops to seize state oil
tankers, refineries and ports in an unsuccessful effort to break the
strike.</LD>
<TE>   There had been fears of clashes between the two sides but
opposition leaders stopped short of marching to the presidential
palace -- a potential flashpoint of violence. In April, more than 60
people were killed when rebel military officers toppled Chavez in a
chaotic and short-lived coup.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's marches snarled traffic across the sprawling capital but
were generally peaceful.</TE>
<TE>   Women in bikini tops with the colors of the Venezuelan flag danced
to salsa music as the anti-Chavez march streamed along a main
highway. Some protesters carried a huge effigy of a shaggy gorilla
with the words "I'm Chavez" on its forehead. The effigy also carried
a banner that read, "I'm deaf, dumb and blind."</TE>
<TE>   "Chavez has to go. We will continue to pile on more and more
pressure," said German Delgado, 42, an accountant.</TE>
<TE>   At the headquarters of the state oil firm, PDVSA, thousands of
Chavez supporters gathered, chanting, "Long Live Chavez."</TE>
<TE>   "The oil belongs to the people. Chavez is a beautiful president,"
said Orlando Colmenaras, 47, a farmer.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition leaders, who include business groups, unions and civic
groups, have pledged to press ahead with the strike until the
populist Chavez quits.</TE>
<TE>   While the shutdown choking off oil exports has delivered a
bruising blow to the nation's economic lifeline, the
paratrooper-turned- president still controls the government and
appears to command the loyalty of key armed forces leaders.</TE>
<TE>   This, combined with potential access to state coffers and
international reserves, gives him some weapons with which to try to
tough out the strike as he has promised.</TE>
<TE>   But in a show of civil disobedience, strike leaders ignored the
temporary Supreme Court ruling Thursday to resume oil operations at
PDVSA.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, rebel PDVSA employees voted in a noisy meeting to
continue the strike, which has throttled exports to the United
States, Venezuela's largest single client. Venezuela normally
provides more than 13% of U.S. oil imports.</TE>
<TE>   PDVSA Vice President Jorge Kamkoff said that oil output, cut to
less than 10% of normal, continued to slide.</TE>
<TE>   The stalemate has kept world oil markets on tenterhooks. Coupled
with fears of a U.S. war on Iraq, oil prices held near two-month
highs of $30 a barrel.</TE>

<HD>Starving Zambians See Little Hope for a Filling Future</HD>
<DH>Government rejected some U.S. corn because it was
genetically modified. But hungry people say they would gladly take
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dina Kraft</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>KOOMA, Zambia</DL>
<LD>In the village of Kooma, people compete with baboons and birds for
nuts and wild fruit to survive.</LD>
<LD>   "We share with animals," said Elliot Magoloi, 68. "It's a shame."</LD>
<LD>   His face was gaunt. Frayed blue coveralls hung from his body.</LD>
<TE>   Drought has left as many as 14.4 million people facing possible
starvation, according to United Nations estimates. Here, in Zambia's
southern province, a flat landscape of sandy soil and crackling, dry
yellow grasses, the crisis has hit especially hard.</TE>
<TE>   Magoloi's daughter-in-law, Maureen Kola, 22, sat on a straw mat
nearby with her five children. She fingered the rough shell of a wild
mungongo nut, put it on a triangular rock and smashed it with a
round, smooth stone. The thin porridge it would produce was the only
food in the village.</TE>
<TE>   The children cry, she said, "because of the hunger." She pointed
at a skinny dog. "That means there is nothing."</TE>
<TE>   In impoverished Zambia, where nearly 30% of the people are going
hungry, some argue that government policy has made things worse.</TE>
<TE>   Zambia's government decided in August to reject donated corn from
the United States because some of it was genetically modified. The
government said it worried about possible side effects, even though
U.N. agencies certified the food as safe.</TE>
<TE>   But the United States is by far the largest donor in response to
the southern African hunger crisis. Aid organizations said they are
scrambling to find alternatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is finding it fast enough," said Richard Ragan, the
World Food Program's representative in Zambia.</TE>
<TE>   In Kooma, a village of thatched-roofed mud huts, Cryson Mutema is
bitter about the debate going on in the capital, Lusaka, 340 miles
north.</TE>
<TE>   Mutema, 38, said he had heard radio reports of President Levy
Mwanawasa's fears that genetically modified food could be poisonous.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't want? But we want. He's eating, all day. He is
satisfied. Here, we are hungry. Here, we go starving," Mutema said.</TE>
<TE>   His 3-year-old son sat at his feet. The listless child's enormous
eyes stared but focused on nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The villagers said this year has been especially hard because a
cattle disease wiped out much of the area's livestock. In the past,
they could have sold a cow to buy food.</TE>
<TE>   Cattle, a sign of status, are used to perform the hard labor of
clearing fields. It is a task that this year must be done by hand on
empty stomachs.</TE>
<TE>   The wooden doors of several huts down the road are bolted with
long sticks. The owners have gone 25 miles west in hopes of eating
better in Livingstone, a resort town.</TE>
<TE>   Even the local schoolteacher has left. The villagers couldn't pay
her, so now children spend their days at home. Hunger leaves them too
tired to play.</TE>
<TE>   In Maunga, about 12 miles away, relief supplies had arrived. Women
in headscarves and print skirts of fuchsia and gold, and men in
threadbare shirts sat quietly in front of the village school waiting
for their names to be called to collect sacks of corn distributed by
the international relief group CARE.</TE>
<TE>   For many, it was the first corn they had had all year. They smiled
when they talked about once again making nchima, a cornmeal mush that
is their traditional food.</TE>
<TE>   Older couples walked off carrying the heaving sacks between them.
Some carted the grain away by wheelbarrow. Young women balanced sacks
on their heads and glided into the bush.</TE>
<TE>   But in Kooma, home to about 300 people, a small group sitting in a
packed sandy yard talked about a life of hunger.</TE>
<TE>   "I spend my days sitting because I can't do anything. I just want
to sleep," Magoloi said.</TE>
<TE>   Some food relief arrived later, but life remains difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The drought so devastated the village's corn, its staple crop,
that villagers did not bother building grain storage sheds. There was
nothing to store.</TE>
<TE>   As planting season begins this year, Magoloi and his neighbors say
they don't know how they will muster the strength to sow the fields
or find the money to buy seed.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm hungry, I feel like I have no hope," Magoloi said. "I feel
blue to my heart."</TE>

<HD>Doctor Fills Need, Finds Home in Rural W. Virginia</HD>
<DH>James Blume returned to his small-town roots, and his
patients respond by keeping him busy 365 days a year at 3 hospitals
and his office.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tara Godvin</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FOREST HILL, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>In the green hills along a narrow road to nowhere in particular, a
stream of patients come and go from the small, nondescript doctor's
office in the middle of town. Some pay for their treatment; some
receive a dose of medicine unique to their rural setting.</LD>
<LD>   This is where Dr. James Blume grew up. And, at a time when West
Virginians worry about physicians fleeing the state to escape
escalating insurance costs, this is exactly why he is staying put.</LD>
<LD>   In this community of 75 where more horses can be seen sauntering
around than humans, Blume counts 7,000 of the region's residents as
his patients, the people he wants to help.</LD>
<TE>   Between the family practice he has had in Forest Hill for 11 years
and his work as an emergency physician at three area hospitals, he
works 365 days year.</TE>
<TE>   Although his schedule allows little time for his wife and seven
children, Blume, 46, is happy that he returned to southern West
Virginia after 14 years away.</TE>
<TE>   His job, he says, is his calling.</TE>
<TE>   "God has a plan for everybody. Just takes awhile to find it
sometimes," said Blume, who recently finished a 5-year stint as
preacher at nearby Countryside Baptist Church. "I know this is God's
plan for my life."</TE>
<TE>   He's at the office during snowstorms and power outages. When he
was diagnosed with colon cancer last year, he saw patients the day
after starting 10 months of chemotherapy.</TE>
<TE>   "Me and him are buddies now. We're survivors," said Raymond
Coleman, 70.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman sports a long curly, gray mane that he grew after
completing his own chemotherapy for thyroid cancer. He jokes with
Blume about how the hair on Blume's legs is finally growing back.</TE>
<TE>   Blume grins and blushes a bit.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, who worked in the coal mines for 37 years, is at the
doctor's office on this Monday because of swelling in his ankle and
pain in his lungs. He complains that he has trouble fishing because
he can get down the bank, but not back up.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you just need a longer line, then," Blume replied.</TE>
<TE>   The jocular relationship repeats itself throughout the day as the
doctor makes his way through cramped halls decorated with pictures of
the children he treats and the "Get Well" cards sent to him during
his chemotherapy. He prides himself on the familial office atmosphere
that he and his staff have created.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm more accessible, then medical care is more accessible," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In acknowledgment of his work and dedication, Blume was named
Country Doctor of the Year by Staff Care, a Texas-based medical
staffing firm that has been honoring rural doctors for eight years.
As part of the award, a physician will cover Blume's practice for a
week so that he can take some time off.</TE>
<TE>   West Virginia is the second most rural state in the nation; 41 of
its 55 counties are considered a primary health care shortage area.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes some special people to practice in the really, really
rural areas of West Virginia," said Jill Hutchinson, executive
director of the West Virginia Primary Care Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors in remote areas feel isolated from the rest of the medical
community and regularly labor under long hours.</TE>
<TE>   "They oftentimes have a heavy caseload if they're the only game in
town," Hutchinson said.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to attract doctors to West Virginia, the state has
implemented a number of programs using state and federal funds to
provide sign-on bonuses and repay up to $90,000 in educational loans.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Blume has found it difficult to attract a partner to his
practice in the hills.</TE>
<TE>   "I could put three or four family doctors to work here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On a Friday that started without a single scheduled appointment,
Blume had seen 26 patients by closing time.</TE>
<TE>   Another threat to a rural doctor's survival is the shrinking
financial viability of the country practice, said George Wright, an
economist and professor with the Department of Family Medicine at the
University of Washington, home to one of six federally funded rural
health research centers.</TE>
<TE>   Rural areas are often too isolated and too poor to have a large
enough economic base, said Wright, who conducted an economic study of
rural medicine in Washington state.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a need for their services, but not a paying demand," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   As medical costs and the price of malpractice insurance rise while
the payouts from Medicaid and Medicare don't, the value of a practice
in a poor area diminishes.</TE>
<TE>   Summers County, where Blume's practice is located, has the state's
oldest median age, 43.4. The area's median household income was
$21,672 in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   About 60% of Blume's patients are covered by Medicare or Medicaid,
but these patients represent only a third of his revenue. He also
sees patients who have no insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "I see them and let them pay whenever," Blume said. "I typically
don't want to know these statistics."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the nation's rural doctors are exactly the type of doctor
that patients want.</TE>
<TE>   "Patients who go see that doctor know he's there for them and not
for a buck," Wright said. "These guys are heroes."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, as the stream of patients came and went, Bob
Martin, 60, escorted his 81-year-old mother into Blume's office to
check on her backache. Martin's entire family comes to Blume for
treatment, including his wife, who once nearly severed a toe with a
chain saw.</TE>
<TE>   "She hasn't had a minute's trouble with it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Martin was one of several patients who said that they trusted
Blume more than the local hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't have Dr. Blume, I don't know what we'd do 'round
here," Martin said. "He's a super good guy with it, good friend and
all."</TE>

<HD>Real Flames, Fake Emergencies for Texas Firefighter
Trainees</HD>
<DH>Forth Worth center creates scenarios, including house fires
and water rescues, where students gain hands-on experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Angela K. Brown</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>The smoke is thick, blinding, as the firefighters grope their way
through the house. They find a body in the back room and carry it
outside, hoping that they're not too late.</LD>
<LD>   The reinforcements go in, but no one can find the fire. Several
minutes later, they open the door to the garage and see a car ablaze.
In the blink of an eye, those flames are extinguished.</LD>
<LD>   "That's OK, guys. Come back out and we'll go over what you did
right and wrong," a voice calls from outside.</LD>
<TE>   The flames are real, but the emergency is not.</TE>
<TE>   The computer-controlled, gas-fueled fire at Tarrant County
College's new $17-million Fire Service Training Center mimics the
heat, smells, sounds and conditions that might be found at a real
fire. This one teaches them how to get the victims out, extinguish
the fire and escape.</TE>
<TE>   "You're supposed to practice like you play, and as realistic as
these buildings are, we can do that," said Mark Hunka, a Fort Worth
Fire Department training officer who recently led his crews in night
drills.</TE>
<TE>   American firefighters raced to 1.7 million blazes, including
forest fires, in 2000; 102 perished in the flames.</TE>
<TE>   In its effort to help reduce those numbers, the training center
seems all too real.</TE>
<TE>   It sits on 23 acres on the college campus and has the look of a
working-class neighborhood. An 18-wheeler is parked outside a small
warehouse. There's a tower that reaches up six stories, a two-story
apartment building, a strip mall, and one- and two-story houses with
an alley behind the fences.</TE>
<TE>   The gray concrete-block buildings are mostly empty except for some
metal pieces resembling couches, beds, stoves, desks and other
furniture, and flame-retardant, weighted dummies. Some interior walls
can be moved so that repeat trainees cannot memorize the layouts.</TE>
<TE>   An instructor programs a computer to set fires in designated
areas, using technology similar to a pilot light in a gas stove. The
instructor controls how high and how hot the flames burn, making
conditions more intense when veteran firefighters are training.</TE>
<TE>   Trainees wait for calls in a building resembling a fire station,
where they pass the time mopping and waxing the floors. They board a
firetruck for the ride to the hot spot when they get the call.</TE>
<TE>   "When students go in, if they don't put the right stream in the
right place, it won't go out," said Ted Phillips, chairman of the
college's Public Safety Institute. "And we give them a computer
printout of what they did wrong and right, so there's immediate
feedback."</TE>
<TE>   During training in the one-story house, the computer sensor shut
down the garage fire because it went unextinguished for more than
four minutes. Air vents opened automatically because the room
exceeded 500 degrees, another safety measure in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "The men chose to find the victim and remove it rather than put
out the fire first," said fire Lt. Rodney Smith, a coordinator at the
fire-training center and firefighter in nearby Arlington. "The goal
is saving lives first, and they found the victim."</TE>
<TE>   Smith and other instructors were in a control room overlooking the
neighborhood to monitor computer readings of heat, gas levels and
other data from the burning rooms. They watched images from a thermal
imaging camera that videotaped the firefighters in the house.</TE>
<TE>   The fire technology is from Symtron Systems, a Fair Lawn,
N.J.-based company that has done similar work for 160 other
fire-training centers nationwide. The Fort Worth center is the
largest.</TE>
<TE>   Symtron developed the technology 23 years ago for simulators for
the U.S. Navy, and now works with government agencies and colleges
that provide firefighter training, company spokesman Louis Orotelli
said.</TE>
<TE>   Under Texas law, firefighter recruits must complete 468 hours of
basic fire protection training at a certified academy -- including
the Fort Worth center. They're also required to pass an exam and
obtain emergency medical certification.</TE>
<TE>   Tarrant County College is one of dozens of state-approved fire
training sites in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The two-year college has offered a fire technology program since
the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   For hands-on training, the college rented a building or tower in
nearby cities.</TE>
<TE>   But the thick, black smoke from burning hay and wood hurt the
environment, and only a few students could be trained in one day
because of delays in cleaning and drying the waterlogged areas.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the program developed into an associate's degree
for students.</TE>
<TE>   And college officials, realizing that the region needed a large,
innovative training center, created one. Fire departments must pay to
use it; students use it separately as part of their college
curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Trainees gain valuable experience in water rescues, trench
collapses and hazardous materials spills. A car can be placed in a
concrete channel while 80,000 gallons of water is pumped through -- a
simulation of flash flooding.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to create as many scenarios as we could," Phillips
said.</TE>
<TE>   Before the training center opened in October, firefighters would
train at the water rides at Six Flags Over Texas amusement park in
Arlington. Inevitably, they would get hurt because they were thrown
against rocks.</TE>
<TE>   "Here," Phillips said, "we have more control."</TE>

<HD>Groups Aim to Make West's Forests Safer From Wildfire</HD>
<DH>Program taps 150 people for a series of workshops focusing
on 25 different ecosystems and elements of the $2.2-billion National
Fire Plan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Barnard</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>CAMP SHERMAN, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Against the spectacular backdrop of the headwaters of the Metolius
River, a busload of people listened raptly as Scott Aycock talked
about making flooring out of skinny little pine saplings.</LD>
<LD>   Why would anyone be listening when there was so much beautiful
scenery to see? Because Aycock was describing one local vision of a
brave new world of wood products manufacturing based on making the
forests of the West safer from wildfire.</LD>
<LD>   His presentation was part of a collaboration between the Nature
Conservancy, U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Department of Interior
called the North American Fire Learning Network. It brings together
scientists, public lands managers, community groups and other
interests to share success stories on their new relationship with
wildfire.</LD>
<TE>   The two-year, $2-million program has tapped 150 people for a
series of four weeklong workshops throughout the country focusing on
25 different ecosystems and elements of the National Fire Plan, a
$2.2-billion national strategy for dealing with wildfire.</TE>
<TE>   "What is driving a lot of this is the fact that this National Fire
Plan is such a huge undertaking," said Art DuFault, fire and fuels
liaison for the BLM director. "We need to have as much collaborative
support and interaction with a whole range of players to have this
thing make sense."</TE>
<TE>   Such close collaboration between federal agencies and a
conservation group is unusual, especially at a time when the Bush
administration has faced off against so many of them over such issues
as oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, logging on
national forests and industrial pollution.</TE>
<TE>   But the Nature Conservancy is different. Rather than trying to
influence legislation or public policy, it buys and manages land to
protect it as fish and wildlife habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "My experience working in Utah and Nevada is that the communities
are very anxious and very receptive to moving ahead," DuFault said.
"They just need a little direction. This blueprint coming out of the
Nature Conservancy is a good one to follow."</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, wildfires this year burned 7.1 million acres and $1.4
billion was spent putting them out, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center.</TE>
<TE>   "With the attention paid very recently because of huge
conflagrations, not only this last year, but also in 2000, we finally
have an opportunity with the general public to get in and create some
community-driven efforts," DuFault said.</TE>
<TE>   One community that took a leap forward is Camp Sherman, a vacation
and retirement settlement along the Metolius River, where the
organization Friends of the Metolius created a demonstration of what
various approaches to thinning forests would look like on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "If you came to the Metolius to play, you had to run into it,"
said Gregory R. McClarren of Friends of the Metolius.</TE>
<TE>   The Heritage Forest Demonstration Project includes 11 different
plots, culminating in a demonstration of what a ponderosa pine forest
looked like at the turn of the century, before the Forest Service
began putting out all the fires.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'What's commercial thinning?' and we can say, 'It's
this one here,' " McClarren said.</TE>
<TE>   Aycock said it is easy to build community consensus over where to
do thinning: the WUI -- pronounced WOO'-ey, for Wildland-Urban
Interface, where the vacation homes meet the forest. The hard part is
finding agreement over what kind of thinning the Forest Service and
BLM should do.</TE>
<TE>   That problem with public trust grew out of the fast-paced logging
of the 1970s and 1980s, which led to the spotted owl lawsuits of the
1990s and the current battle over President Bush's Healthy Forests
Initiative, which would ease environmental regulation to speed
logging to thin overstocked forests, even in remote areas far from
homes.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is based on gaining a common understanding of what
kind of forest you want, and what is an acceptable way to do that,"
said Kris Martinson, environmental coordinator for the Sisters Ranger
District of Deschutes National Forest. "People are very, very alarmed
about logging because of what happened on the national forests in the
1970s and 1980s."</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty is compounded by direction from the top changing
with each new occupant of the White House, she added.</TE>
<TE>   "We look forward to a 180-degree switch every four years," she
said. "That is part of the difficulty, and that is part of the public
trust. That makes it difficult regaining the public trust when the
administration proposes things that alarm people."</TE>
<TE>   The approach to thinning needs to be different for each landscape,
said Merrill Kaufmann, a Forest Service research ecologist.</TE>
<TE>   For example, mature ponderosa pine, with its thick bark and high
crowns, is adapted to survive low-intensity fires that clear out
brush and saplings. Lodgepole pines have cones that release their
seeds after being heated, so that new forests sprout from the ashes
of the old ones.</TE>
<TE>   Other ecosystems, such as subalpine forests, have little
relationship to fire.</TE>
<TE>   With lumber prices low and Deschutes County down to just two wood
products mills following the timber industry contraction of the
1990s, timber sales off national forests are going begging,
especially if they are made up of the skinny trees produced by
thinning, Aycock said.</TE>
<TE>   That's where making flooring out of small ponderosa pine trees
comes in.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there is no investment climate," Aycock said. "We're
trying to develop a pilot just focused on the small stuff so
investors can see what is coming out five to 10 years down the road.
Without that, there will be no fuels treatment in the area."</TE>

<HD>Development Plan Divides Small Utah Town</HD>
<DH>Rural area must decide whether to keep farming or permit
construction of a subdivision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesse Hyde</AU>
<BD>Deseret News</BD>
<DL>VINEYARD, Utah</DL>
<LD>Tucked in a corner between Geneva Steel and Utah Lake is a quiet town
that most people have never heard of.</LD>
<LD>   It has no police station, no gas station and no traffic lights.
Most residents can trace their heritage back to a grape farmer named
Shadrach Holdaway.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the 150 people who live in Vineyard hope that things never
change. They like driving past cornfields and falling asleep to the
sound of crickets. Others say the time has come to accept change. The
demise of Geneva Steel seems as certain as sunrise and, when the mill
goes, so goes much of Vineyard's tax base.</LD>
<TE>   "The whole area's going to change in 10 years," Glade Holdaway
said. "It's going to develop, and we might as well be the ones that
reap the benefits."</TE>
<TE>   He is one of four farmers who together have sold 180 acres to a
developer who wants to turn their corn and barley fields into a gated
community on the shores of Utah Lake, complete with polo fields and
equestrian trails. The planned community of 700 acres would also
include open fields for horseback riding and a boardwalk and
restaurants along the shore of Utah Lake.</TE>
<TE>   It is somewhat ironic that farmers like Holdaway are pushing for
change. The town was incorporated in 1989 to stop the tide of tract
homes that had already engulfed nearby Orem.</TE>
<TE>   "We incorporated to control our destiny. If we didn't do
something, the development would have gone from Orem to the shores of
the lake," said Grant Holdaway, a planning commissioner and town
councilman.</TE>
<TE>   Some planning commissioners and town councilmen do not like the
development plan and may vote against it. The proposal will come
before the planning commission in January.</TE>
<TE>   "The City Council is not in the business of making controversy or
stopping people. They just want to make it a nice community," said
Barbara Davies, town clerk. She likes to wake to the sound of
tractors and would just as soon keep Vineyard as is.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best of both worlds. We're close to the city, but we
come home to a quiet, peaceful place," Davies said. "We enjoy living
by the lake, hearing birds and farm equipment."</TE>
<TE>   She and others hope that another steel mill will buy Geneva's
operation and keep it running, but that seems unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "The town is not fading into the sunset just because Geneva might
go away," Davies said. "The town is not going bankrupt. We could
function just fine the way we are for a long, long time."</TE>
<TE>   Grant Holdaway, 71, feels as much loyalty to the town's heritage
as anyone. His great-great-grandfather, Shadrach Holdaway,
homesteaded the land in 1860. Grape vineyards once extended from Orem
to Utah Lake, giving the community its name.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the writing on the wall. Farming is out. The question is,
what do we do about the future," he said. "I don't like living in the
city, and it's all around me now. I've got two choices. Do I sell out
and move somewhere more rural, or do I adjust to change?"</TE>
<TE>   Glade Holdaway has decided to adjust, but with trepidation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have mixed emotions. My grandpa farmed this land, and I grew up
here. I can't imagine a more pleasant childhood than growing up on a
farm," he said. "Of course, we'd like to leave it as it is, but that
just can't happen."</TE>

<HD>More Lives Threatened by Friend's Deadly Secret</HD>
<DH>Frightened man confides fears to his father, who urges him
to go to the authorities.</DH>
<SE>Part two in a weekly series about two mysterious deaths and
a reluctant witness.</SE>
<AU>Helen O'Neill</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GREEN RIVER, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>THE STORY SO FAR</LD>
<LD>   Six years ago, a young mother and her 5-year-old son tumbled 100
feet down a cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail in desert country near
Green River, Wyo. Her husband, Bob Duke, frantically called for help.
A family outing gone tragically wrong -- or so it seemed. One man, a
hard-drinking, small-time drug dealer, doubted Duke's story. But with
his reputation, who would believe him?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   GREEN RIVER, Wyo. -- Butch Brauburger had never seen his son so
upset. Tears were streaming down Roger's face. There was a look of
terror in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Calm down, son, the father said.</TE>
<TE>   But Roger was a blubbering mess, ranting incoherently about guilt,
about how he should have said something years ago, about how more
lives were in danger.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to do, Dad," he sobbed. "Tell me what to do.
I'm lost."</TE>
<TE>   It was late at night on Jan. 3, 1999, and at first the father
thought that his son had been drinking.</TE>
<TE>   But the more Butch Brauburger listened, the more he realized that
Roger was deadly serious -- and that his son's life was in danger.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one thing to do, the father said. You have to go to
Mont.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mont Mecham, 53, is a grizzled veteran lieutenant with the Green
River Police Department, a formidable presence with his tough
exterior, searing blue eyes and the neck brace he wears like a badge
of honor.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad day on the job," he growled, describing the night five years
ago when a burglary suspect shot him through the throat and left him
for dead.</TE>
<TE>   He's had nine surgeries since then, and still doctors can't figure
out how to fix the nerve damage that leaves his back in constant
pain, his arms stiff and ice cold.</TE>
<TE>   Mecham knew Brauburger and Bob Duke. His son, now a cop, had gone
to school with them. As kids, the three sometimes hung out in
Mecham's basement. Nice kids, Mecham thought. Roger was a bit of a
hell-raiser, but the others had turned out OK.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Mecham had been bothered by the deaths of Liana and
Erik Duke. Too many things didn't add up. It didn't make sense for a
family to be out on the cliffs in the first place. No parents in
their right minds would allow a child to run around up there.</TE>
<TE>   "Two bodies, one eyewitness, no forensic evidence," he said. "It
wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   But Mecham couldn't investigate because the case fell into the
jurisdiction of the Sweetwater County sheriff's department. Frankly,
he told friends there, they could have done a better job.</TE>
<TE>   About a week after the deaths, out of curiosity, Mecham drove to
the end of Lost Dog Trail. He crept to the edge and peered over the
ridge where the bodies had fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the wind and the dust, looking down the cliff face, he
was sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking at the murder weapon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I need to talk to you as soon as I can," Brauburger said. "I've
got something super-scary to tell you."</TE>
<TE>   It was the day after Brauburger had talked to his father. Over the
telephone, Mecham could hear the terror in Brauburger's voice.</TE>
<TE>   Mecham drove to the construction site where Brauburger was
working. In the police car, Brauburger poured out his story.</TE>
<TE>   His old friend, Bob Duke, had been calling him from Houston, he
said. At first, it was just small talk about work, and what he and
his brother Mike were up to. But lately, the talk had turned ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Duke had run out of the $60,000 insurance money from his wife and
child's deaths and, with his brother, had hatched a plan to make a
lot -- fast. They just needed a few details wrapped up: alibis, a
driver. And could Roger get them a silencer?</TE>
<TE>   At first, Brauburger told Mecham, he went along with the
conversations because he didn't know what else to do. Sure, he told
Duke, he could get a silencer. What was the plan?</TE>
<TE>   In the police car, Brauburger sputtered out the words as if he
still couldn't believe what Duke had told him:</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'll pay you $20,000 to kill my parents.' "</TE>
<TE>   Go on, Mecham said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, Oh my God he's serious. He killed his wife and child,
and now he is planning to murder his own parents."</TE>
<TE>   Mecham looked at him sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "Slow down," he said. "How do you know he killed his wife and
child?"</TE>
<TE>   Duke told me that he was looking for a hit man this time,
Brauburger said, because, as he put it, "I've done family before and
I didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Shaking, Brauburger then told the veteran cop the secret he hadn't
dared tell anyone in years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was the summer of 1996. Brauburger had been hanging out with
Duke, watching movies, talking crazy hit-man talk for laughs, as
they'd done while growing up. Suddenly, Duke turned to him and said,
"Would you kill my wife and child for $15,000?"</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger laughed it off. Who's worth more, he joked, the wife or
the kid? But Duke persisted, Brauburger said. A few days later, he
laid out a detailed plan.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger could go to Duke's apartment on Idaho Street and hide
behind a shed where Duke would leave a .22-caliber Ruger rifle. Then,
during a family barbecue, Brauburger could shoot the wife and child
in the head, shoot Duke in the leg, spray a few neighborhood kids and
make his getaway. Duke would pay him with the insurance money he got
for Liana and Erik.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he was nuts," Brauburger said. "I said if he was that
unhappy, he should get a divorce."</TE>
<TE>   I can't do that, Duke told him. My parents would hate me.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, Liana and Erik were dead.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger's face was full of panic as he turned to Mecham.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew right away it was no accident," he said. "But I didn't
know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't you go to the police?" Mecham asked.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was incredulous.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my word against Bob's," he said. "Who would have believed
me?"</TE>
<TE>   Mecham knew that Brauburger had a well-documented history of using
drugs and selling marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   But he had never been in serious trouble, and he swore that he was
finished with drugs now. He was about to get married and start a
family.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger Brauburger was certainly no angel," Mecham said later. "But
people don't go to angels to kill their parents."</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger had just enough of a past to be credible.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to wire you," Mecham told him. "We need to
get this on tape."</TE>
<TE>   "No!" Roger cried. "If Bob gets word, I'm a dead man."</TE>
<TE>   Mecham rolled his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to do?" he snapped. "Let Mom and Dad die, like
the wife and kid?"</TE>
<TE>   That night, police taped a call between Roger Brauburger and Bob
Duke. The conversation rambled. The details were vague. But a date
for the killing was set, just three weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough for Mecham to believe everything that Brauburger had
told him. The next day, Mecham drove 273 miles to Cheyenne and played
the tape for the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger, stocky and tattooed, with a wispy goatee and small
eyes behind thick glasses, sat at the round table in his father's
kitchen. He stared anxiously at the phone on the wall. There was
nothing to indicate that it was wired to a recording device, but the
cops swarming around the tiny house were reminder enough.</TE>
<TE>   His heart beat wildly; beads of sweat broke out on his forehead.
He didn't feel right, and he was sure that his voice didn't sound
right.</TE>
<TE>   It was noon on Jan. 8, 1999, and Brauburger was about to place the
fourth recorded call to Duke in three days. Everyone -- the cops, FBI
and Brauburger himself -- sensed that this call would be the last.
They had too much to lose if Duke got suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   The previous calls had gone well -- chillingly well.</TE>
<TE>   Duke talked about setting a date for the murders, about using a
.22-caliber rifle, about the need to get into the house when both
parents were out because his father had a gun, about the need for
both Duke brothers to have alibis.</TE>
<TE>   He talked about money: $20,000 if Brauburger did the job himself,
$5,000 if he acted as a driver for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Police and the FBI were satisfied that they had enough to arrest
Duke on conspiracy charges for plotting to kill his parents. But they
wanted more. They wanted him to mail something -- a key or money --
physical evidence to strengthen their case.</TE>
<TE>   Even more, they wanted Duke to say something on tape to implicate
himself in the killing of his wife and child.</TE>
<TE>   The calls had been making Brauburger increasingly uneasy. Just the
day before, Duke had asked Brauburger, "You're not talking about
this?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Brauburger had replied. "No, I haven't said a word to no
one."</TE>
<TE>   But the question made police nervous too.</TE>
<TE>   They assigned extra patrols around the homes of Duke's parents and
the Brauburgers. And they staked out Duke's Houston apartment, ready
to burst in at a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   In the little kitchen in Green River, the air was thick with
tension.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger took a deep breath and dialed the Houston number.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, what's up?" he asked Duke.</TE>
<TE>   They bantered a bit about work, and then Brauburger got to the
point.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," Brauburger said. "Uh, is there any way we can make it look
like an accident, like you did with your wife and child?"</TE>
<TE>   There was a moment of silence. Then Duke exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "Dude, I did not do that.... "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I thought you said you did that."</TE>
<TE>   "No!"</TE>
<TE>   The cops signaled to him to stay calm. They shoved handwritten
notes across the table, but Brauburger was too distracted to read
them. Oh God, he thought. Bob's on to me. I'm a dead man.</TE>
<TE>   The cops were thinking the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no doubt in my mind that someone was going to get
killed unless we could stop it," Mecham said later, "either the
parents or Roger."</TE>
<TE>   It was time to make their move. Trembling, Brauburger listened
over the phone as FBI agents and police burst in on Duke in Houston.
He heard Duke cry out. In the background, a dog barked.</TE>
<TE>   Then the phone went dead.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were all over the news in Texas and Wyoming. Bob Duke
was charged in federal court with conspiracy to use interstate
telephone lines to plot his parents' killings. Mike Duke was charged
with failing to report the plot. (The brothers declined to be
interviewed for this story.)</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was elated. That night, he hit the bars and then drove
through the desert, whooping it up in a beer-soaked reverie.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he could move on. He could forget about the past, the
friendship with Duke, the guilt and torment of the past few years. He
had done the right thing. He had prevented more killing.</TE>
<TE>   It's over, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   But a new ordeal was about to begin.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Next: What no parent should know.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   How This Story Was Reported</TE>
<TE>   From Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   This story is based on extensive interviews with investigators
from the Green River (Wyo.) Police Department and the Sweetwater
County Sheriff's Department; prosecutors; the FBI; witnesses,
including Roger Brauburger and his family; relatives of Liana and
Erik Duke, and jurors. It also drew on court testimony and evidence
submitted in both the federal and state cases, including FBI tapes of
conversations between Bob Duke and Brauburger, the coroner's report,
photographs of the scene and of the autopsies. Research included
attendance at the trial and the sentencing as well as visits to the
cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail. Duke and his family refused to be
interviewed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years ago, a young mother and her 5-year-old son tumbled 100 feet
down a cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail in desert country near
Green River, Wyo. Her husband, Bob Duke, frantically called for help.
A family outing gone tragically wrong -- or so it seemed. One man, a
hard-drinking, small-time drug dealer, doubted Duke's story. But with
his reputation, who would believe him?</LD>

<HD>Alaska Offers Countless Ways to Vanish</HD>
<DH>It's easy to fall victim to the state's unforgiving terrain
and severe weather. Clearinghouse keeps missing person reports, with
1,027 files still active.</DH>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ANCHORAGE</DL>
<LD>Eric Miller wrestles with opposing theories about his brother's
disappearance. Either he died in the Alaska wilderness or he ran away
-- or both.</LD>
<LD>   Jim Miller, 39, left his Anchorage home Sept. 22 in the midst of
personal problems, including pending heart surgery. His car was found
about three weeks later in the parking lot of Resurrection Pass
Trail, a popular hiking route in the Chugach National Forest south of
Anchorage.</LD>
<LD>   But intensive searches turned up no sign of the experienced
outdoorsman other than unconfirmed sightings.</LD>
<TE>   "Nothing panned out," Eric Miller said. "What's left now is the
feeling that we'll never see him again."</TE>
<TE>   Alaska's 586,000 square miles afford countless ways to get lost,
whether by fate or design. It's easy to fall prey to the state's
unforgiving terrain and severe weather, according to those in the
business of searching.</TE>
<TE>   Miller is among 3,780 people reported missing in Alaska this year
and one of the 219 who remain missing, according to the Missing
Persons Clearinghouse maintained by Alaska state troopers. The
clearinghouse is a repository of data submitted by law enforcement
agencies throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   The great majority of cases involve young runaways who eventually
turn up alive, said investigator Bill Hughes, who manages the
clearinghouse. Others are lost hikers and snowmobilers, commercial
fishermen lost at sea and plane crash victims whose remains have not
been found.</TE>
<TE>   Then there are the people who are not really lost. They've either
chosen to start anew in one of Alaska's remote villages or they've
neglected to contact relatives living outside.</TE>
<TE>   "One man didn't want to be found," Hughes said. "He finally agreed
to call his mother when I told him, 'Look, if you don't call her,
I'll have to file a big report.' "</TE>
<TE>   More than 53,000 people have been reported missing in the state
since the clearinghouse was established in 1988. Of those, 1,027 are
still listed as missing.</TE>
<TE>   Their stories are represented by color-coded flags dotted across
an Alaska map in Hughes' office.</TE>
<TE>   Included are black flags, which mark locations where unidentified
human remains have been found.</TE>
<TE>   One such recent find -- a human foot inside a shoe discovered in
northwestern Alaska -- is being sent to the FBI's new National
Missing Person DNA Database at its Quantico, Va., academy.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska authorities are also sending saliva samples from relatives
of three missing fishermen involved in a boating accident in the area
a few years ago. The samples could provide a DNA link to the missing.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Alaska's unsolved missing persons cases are detailed on
the trooper clearinghouse Web site.</TE>
<TE>   There's Maryellen McMillin, who disappeared from her Fairbanks
home with her green Subaru station wagon in November 1998. Sabine
Duellmann, a German national who vanished soon after landing in
Anchorage on a United Airlines flight in 1998. Charlie Chocknok, an
elderly Yupik Eskimo last seen walking near the New Stuyahok village
airport in July 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Troopers say Chocknok, 84 at the time, had talked about visiting
Dillingham 43 air miles to the south, but he never made it on any
flights. Because of senility, he might have set out on foot, only to
encounter a bear or fall into the nearby Nushagak River, although a
thorough search of the area turned up no sign of either.</TE>
<TE>   "People are swept away in the river and their bodies are never
found, so it can't be ruled out," Trooper Mike Brandenburger said.
"Water conditions are colder here and body gases don't develop at the
same speed as in the Lower 48, so bodies tend to sink."</TE>
<TE>   The elements can change with amazing speed, particularly in colder
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Miller, the Anchorage outdoorsman, vanished as trees lost
their leaves, creating a ground cover thick enough to hide valuable
clues from even the keenest eyes, said Trooper Sgt. Keith Mallard,
who has participated in scores of searches.</TE>
<TE>   "The weather can sneak right up on you," Mallard said. "If you're
not prepared for the weather or the harshness of the environment, a
twisted ankle can put you into an emergency situation."</TE>
<TE>   Some remote communities rely on trail markers to guide
snowmobilers and other travelers during winter, when whiteout
conditions can erase familiar landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   In the Yukon-Kuskokwim delta, in western Alaska, the Bethel Search
and Rescue group puts up color-coded markers. White and orange
indicate a good trail. Red means a rough ice road. Blue signifies
thin ice or open water, and green a nearby shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The colors are marked on poles lining trails between villages
commonly used by residents who travel around the region.</TE>
<TE>   "Out there, it can go from clear one hour to zero visibility the
next," said Peter Atchak, Search and Rescue leader. "Even people who
know the terrain and conditions can become disoriented. But
experienced ones learn to stay put and equip themselves with survival
gear."</TE>
<TE>   Survival was a skill that Jim Miller had honed since childhood,
when his family lived briefly in tents and wilderness cabins in
northern Washington state and eastern interior Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   It's one reason that Eric Miller will always wonder about his
brother's fate.</TE>
<TE>   "Finding his body would be a relief at this point," he said. "But
we may never get to know what happened to him."</TE>

<HD>Wine Lovers May Get a Buzz Over State Laws</HD>
<DH>Wholesalers oppose vintners' efforts to ship directly to
consumers. Rules are contradictory, confusing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Matt Gouras</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HELENA, Mont.</DL>
<LD>To have his favorite wine shipped directly from a California winery,
Montanan Gerard Lemieux wanted to make sure that he did everything
legally. The law, he knew, could be as twisted as an old grapevine.</LD>
<LD>   Montana regulators said he needed a special state permit -- a
"connoisseur's license" -- to have wine shipped directly to his home.
Lemieux never claimed to be a connoisseur, but he shrugged it off and
paid the $50.</LD>
<LD>   Then the state said he would also need to keep track of every
purchase. Give special shipping labels to the wineries. Send more
paperwork to regulators. File a state tax return every six months.</LD>
<TE>   He did it all. But in the end, it was such a hassle that Lemieux
threw up his hands in disgust. The next time he wants a few bottles
from his favorite winery, he says, he's driving to Napa, filling the
trunk of his car and hauling it back himself.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing saying we can't do that," Lemieux said. "And in
the end, it's easier."</TE>
<TE>   The experience of Lemieux, a retired United Parcel Service worker
from Missoula and one of just 10 Montanans holding a state
connoisseur's license, is not uncommon for finicky wine lovers who
want a broader selection than that available at the local store.</TE>
<TE>   All states have laws to control the sale and shipment of alcohol
to ensure that they can collect alcohol taxes and prevent sales to
minors.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, however, the wine industry has persuaded some
states to make exceptions for wine, arguing that minors aren't likely
to try ordering fine merlots or chardonnays to get a buzz.</TE>
<TE>   What has resulted is a confusing array of state rules and
regulations that has often left wineries and wine lovers befuddled.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen states have reciprocal agreements that allow residents in
one state to order wine from another, as long as the other state
allows the same.</TE>
<TE>   Fourteen states and Washington, D.C., allow wine shipments, but
under tight limits or restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   Like Montana's law, many of the rules are so cumbersome, confusing
or ambiguous that critics say wineries and even shipping companies
like UPS won't ship to those states. Alaska, for instance, allows the
direct shipment of a "reasonable" amount of wine, but never defines
reasonable.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesalers, who stand to lose business to direct sales, have
resisted any move to exempt wine from state alcohol rules.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument is that fine wines are not alcohol, but if you start
opening the door, everything flows through," said Craig Wolf, an
attorney for the Washington, D.C.-based Wine and Spirits Wholesalers
of America.</TE>
<TE>   For wineries, though, the myriad rules mean that any time a
resident of another state places an order -- whether by phone, mail
or over the Internet -- the winery is supposed to make sure that
shipping there is legal.</TE>
<TE>   "We see this really as a matter of fairness for consumers," said
Steve Gross, state relations manager for the Wine Institute, a
California-based trade group. "It seems unfair that a consumer from
one state can have wine shipped to his home to enjoy, and a consumer
from another state is told, 'Sorry, we're not allowed to ship to you
because of where you live.' "</TE>
<TE>   Truchard Vineyards of Napa Valley takes orders over the Internet,
but is careful about where it ships. The company's Web site lists the
states where it can ship wine unfettered. Potential buyers from other
states are asked to inquire before ordering because state rules can
change "on almost a daily basis," the winery says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hassle," said Truchard's Linda Carr. "We'd love to see
things different because we're missing a huge part of the consumer
market."</TE>
<TE>   In Massachusetts, wine makers say such state laws are hampering
that state's fledgling wine industry.</TE>
<TE>   At Hill Vineyard in Dartmouth, owner Robert DeGrazia has to sell
"every last drop" of his 1,500 cases a year within Massachusetts.
That state's law forbids wineries to ship directly to consumers, and
his winery is too small to have been noticed by wholesale
distributors.</TE>
<TE>   "California wineries are 3,000 miles away, and they're beating us
up because we can't cross state lines," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The disagreement has resulted in about half a dozen lawsuits --
from Florida to New York to Washington state -- usually filed by
wineries or wine lovers. The lawsuits have pitted wineries and small
retail wine stores against wholesaler suppliers. Court rulings in
recent years have been mixed.</TE>
<TE>   In New York this month, a federal judge ruled that the state's ban
on direct shipments interferes with interstate commerce because it
treats in-state and out-of-state wineries differently. New York is
one of 23 states that bans direct consumer shipments of any alcohol
into the state, but allows New York wineries to ship directly to
consumers. But don't expect to be able to ship wine to New Yorkers
for Christmas; the judge stayed his ruling so the state could appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In Florida, a challenge to that state's ban on direct sales is up
in the air after a federal appeals court ordered the state to explain
why it treats out-of-state wineries differently.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides of the debate acknowledge that direct shipments, if
allowed in all 50 states, would probably amount only to a small
portion of all wine sales. Currently, direct shipments, including
sales direct from wine-tasting rooms, account for less than 10% of
all wine sales, according to one Wine Institute estimate.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, a survey by the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of
America found that 86% of wine drinkers are happy with their local
selection.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very elitist, minority issue," said Wolf of the
wholesalers' group. "They speak loudly, but in terms of the actual
interest in wines not available locally, it's very small. And they
would tear down an entire regulatory system to get what they want."</TE>
<TE>   But Gross, with the Wine Institute, said direct sales are vital to
many of the nation's smaller wineries.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of wineries, their biggest sales are right out of their
tasting rooms," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wholesalers note that there already are online alcohol retailers
who blatantly violate state laws for direct shipments.</TE>
<TE>   One site brags that it will ship any alcohol to all but six
states. "By placing this order you agree that you are at least 21
years of age," another Web site reads.</TE>
<TE>   "The regulations are being ignored nationwide," Wolf said. "It's
going to keep happening until some kid orders online and ends up
killing someone."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Waddington, who runs an Internet wine shop called
OnLineVines.com from Washington, D.C., said it is up to the wine
industry to find a workable solution.</TE>
<TE>   "There just needs to be some sort of compromise," he said.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of a tour of Marcel Proust's childhood home in
Illiers-Combray, the visitor is led up a stairway into a large empty
attic where four walls are lined with unframed photographic portraits
of some of the most eminent socialites of fin de siecle Paris. These
black-and-white figures, whom Proust had known, still convey the
luster of bygone antebellum European splendor, but they also stare at
the Proustian aficionado with the humbled gaze of people who, with
the passage of time, have become mere stand-ins for the complex,
larger-than-life picture Proust drew of them when he immortalized
them in his epic novel, "Remembrance of Things Past."</TE>
<TE>   "So this is So-and-so," one muses, not without a note of
disappointment. "And this is Such-and-such." And this arrogant young
man whose sharp, gaunt features betray the dissolute sensuality of an
ordinary lout would one day inspire the novel's aristocratic Robert
de Saint-Loup, Marcel's best friend, who marries Marcel's love
Gilberte and who then dies in the trenches of World War I. And this
woman, whose dreamy features are about to soften into the very
essence of human kindness, is none other than the model for the
unregenerate Odette de Crecy, Gilberte's mother, who cheats on her
husband Swann -- Gilberte's father -- and on everyone else she sleeps
with as well. And this, we realize, could only be the model for
Gilberte herself, with whom a young Marcel tussles in the park one
afternoon after school and in the process of pinning her down has an
orgasm. Finally, the most foppish of the lot, the Baron de Charlus --
who could forget him? There he is, with his inseparable walking
stick, in the person of Count Robert de Montesquiou, daunting and
dapper, a glimmer of impatience about to cross his features if the
photographer takes a moment longer.</TE>
<TE>   Could any of these real-life characters live up to what Proust did
with them? One might as well ask the same of the town of Illiers,
which renamed itself Illiers-Combray to commemorate Proust's
fictional Combray. Could the drab, gray, slate-roofed town ever live
up to the childhood paradise Marcel Proust made of it in his novel?
The question is unfair and should never be asked, but the answer lies
at the heart of Proust's aesthetics. Art uncovers meanings and
harmonies that real life wouldn't know the first thing about. A
portrait may vie with the model; with great artists, it's frequently
the other way around. The original pales before its replica.</TE>
<TE>   Proust loved photographs. Indeed, he liked nothing better than to
obtain, however obliquely -- and sometimes to his great shame --
photographic portraits of those individuals he felt he couldn't
possess other than on paper. With most people, the simulacrum ranks
second best. But for Proust, who almost never found real intimacy,
the photographic portrait of someone he worshipped in secret may have
been the only option.</TE>
<TE>   Now, all the people whom Proust transposed into his novel and who
were photographed by the French socialite photographer Paul Nadar
(1856-1939) have been culled into a book, "The World of Proust." This
is a very valuable -- and luxurious -- accompaniment to Proust's
novel and does with images what so many CDs have tried to offer with
compilations of music drawn from Proust's immediate world: the songs
of his friend and sometimes lover Reynaldo Hahn, the violin and piano
sonatas of Cesar Franck or of Gabriel Faure -- depending on which of
the two sonatas one believes may have served as the soundtrack to
Swann's love affair with Odette.</TE>
<TE>   Not much is stated about Nadar's technique, nor about his father,
Felix Tournachon, whose studio and clientele the son inherited in
1886. What we are told, however, is that "all the portraits are
modern prints faithful to the original plate, just as it came down to
us from the Nadar studio." The English of this short 160-page volume
is sometimes stilted, betraying the language of the French original.</TE>
<TE>   Nadar's portraits can be broken down into four categories. First
are family pictures. Proust's brother, his authoritarian father and a
rather beefy Madame Proust, shown both retouched and un-retouched,
looking nothing like the delicate mother we've always imagined her to
be. Then there is the picture of Marcel as a boy. Who would have
known that this slim, crew-cut, doe-eyed boy would devote the most
ringing pages of his novel to just that little boy staring at us from
the cover of Nadar's book?</TE>
<TE>   Then there are portraits of the French aristocracy, this highly
exclusive world that flung open its doors to the young Proust when he
was little more than a professional charmeur with a rich daddy's
allowance and a pronounced taste for things aesthetic: the Prince of
Wales, the Duke de Rohan, Charles Boson de Talleyrand-Perigord,
Prince de Sagan, the Count and Countess Greffulhe, to name but a few.</TE>
<TE>   Then comes a series of photographs of artists, writers and
composers: Claude Monet, Anatole France, Emile Zola, Jean Cocteau,
Claude Debussy, Faure, Hahn, Alphonse Daudet, Stephane Mallarme.
Others: the actress Sarah Bernhardt and, more stunningly attractive
yet, comedienne Gabrielle Reju, known as Rejane, who leased an
apartment to none other than Proust himself.</TE>
<TE>   More inexplicable are those in the fourth group: portraits of the
Agostinelli father and sons. (Alfred Agostinelli, the son, would
become Marcel's lover and a model for the ever-elusive and unfaithful
Albertine.) Then there is a picture of Nicolas Cottin, who worked in
the Proust household. What is unclear about Cottin and Agostinelli is
why a photographer of Nadar's stature would take pictures of such
humble working-class folk. Had Proust commissioned these photographs?
Could the men have afforded the photographer? Why are we not told?</TE>
<TE>   Nadar had an eye for detail: eyes, mouth, especially hair are
captured with exacting precision, as is the texture of an
individual's skin, even when retouched. Clothing, for all of its
fustian chic, tends to be perennially crinkled, a detail director
Luchino Visconti always tried to capture whenever filming the
patrician turn-of-the-century elegance of a world in which permanent
press hadn't yet been invented. On each face is the unmistakable
Nadar signature: arch as each person may have been, under Nadar's
lens there is almost always a troublesome hint of kindness and
humility verging on the sort of sweetness one often finds among
French aristocrats when, after having had tea with you and having
regaled you with an intimacy the likes of which you haven't
encountered in decades, the elder of the family stands up, walks you
to the door, holds the door for you, waits with you on the landing
and, when the elevator finally comes, even hastens to put his hand in
and presses the down button for you, all the while leaving you
feeling that, once the elevator door is closed, everyone in the
living room will instantly guffaw and promise never to have you over
again.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to the world of Monsieur Proust, a world where all that's
wonderful and legendary can never quite transcend the ugly, petty
side of human life, where all things, good and bad, close and not so
close to the heart, must ultimately remind us that we, like everyone
else in these photographs, like everyone in Proust's novel, young,
wealthy and privileged as so many of them were, must eventually grow
old and move on. In the process, though, some may learn the most
paradoxical lesson of all: that for all the timelessness of art, life
is an earthbound affair but that if one looks long and hard enough,
one finds in our day-to-day existence an echo, an image of what is
indeed eternal.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   That Paris would grow into the capital of a kingdom stretching
from the Pyrenees to the Rhine was not a given. But the tiny Roman
colony established on a fluvial island in a bend of the Seine did,
from the start, offer several key assets: a mild climate, a navigable
waterway propitious to the development of major commerce, two river
arms providing natural protection. The town prospered, soon extending
concentrically on either bank. The island, later known as the Ile de
la Cite, remained at its heart; it contained the medieval quarter,
and on it stand the cathedral of Notre Dame, the Sainte Chapelle and,
since more recent time, the Palais de Justice and other
administrative buildings.</TE>
<TE>   As Alistair Horne shows in his pleasurable and instructive "Seven
Ages of Paris," every major period has left its imprint. Remnants of
the medieval ramparts built by Philippe Auguste can still be seen
today. The great architectural landmarks, inseparable from the high
points in French history, are familiar to every tourist: the Louvre,
which Francois I transformed into an elegant palace; Henry IV's
splendid Pont-Neuf and Place Royale, now known as the Place des
Vosges; Louis XIII's creation of a whole new elegant residential
island, the Ile Saint-Louis; Louis XIV's Invalides and the stately
hotels particuliers in the Marais district (one of them now housing
the Musee Carnavalet); Napoleon's Rue de Rivoli and his triumphal
arches; the broad new tree-lined avenues and boulevards, as well as
the parks and symmetrical apartment buildings with their wrought-iron
balconies, created by Baron Haussmann during the Second Empire, which
gave Paris its modern face; the Belle Epoque's art nouveau entrances
to the Metro's stations; and the Palais de Chaillot facing the Eiffel
Tower, both of them built for World Expositions glorifying the
achievements of the Third Republic.</TE>
<TE>   A city of lasting monuments, Paris is also a city of revolutions,
of upheavals and demolitions, of turmoil and political storms. It has
been the scene of catastrophes and humiliating defeats. But
resilience seems to be in its character. Some of its problems, even
until quite recently, have been related to squalid conditions. When
Vautrin, Balzac's outlaw-diagnostician of 19th century Parisian
corruption, describes Paris as a mud hole, a bourbier, he is not
merely speaking metaphorically. Paris over the ages, as Horne
repeatedly reminds us, has been afflicted with problems of
sanitation, by slums, slime, inadequate sewers, decaying garbage,
lack of drains, occasional floods and lethal epidemics, such as
plague and cholera. Rulers tried, not always successfully, to combat
pollution and street violence. Louis XIV was eager to solve the water
problem. Napoleon was as concerned with clean water supply as he was
with violence in the crowded quarters. To be sure, Baron Haussmann,
Napoleon III's urban planner, cleared the worst slums, destroying
some historic sites in the process -- only to displace the growing
proletariat toward new slums and eventual bidonvilles at the
periphery of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Horne's previous work prepared him well for this book on the
history of Paris. His books on the Napoleonic period after the
victory of Austerlitz (1805), the Prussian siege of Paris and the
incendiary days of the Commune (1870-71), the terrible battle of
Verdun (1916) in World War I and the savage war of Algeria (1954-62),
which Charles de Gaulle brought to a welcome though inglorious end,
all qualify him to tell a story that links the most dramatic moments
of French history to a city he obviously loves. The title of one of
his books, "The French Army and Politics (1870-1970)," is only one
indication of his range. He seems to be especially at home in the
social and political history of post-Revolutionary France, which
explains also, in part, why he moves more swiftly over previous
periods.</TE>
<TE>   For "Seven Ages of Paris" evidently covers much more than the last
200 years. After a briskly paced introduction going back to Caesar's
time, Horne's story begins in the 12th century, each "age" centered
on key figures, such as Philippe Auguste, Saint-Louis, Henry IV, the
brilliant ministers Richelieu and Mazarin, Louis XIV, Napoleon,
Georges Clemenceau, De Gaulle -- surveying along the way the
Capetians' struggle against the Plantagenets, the persecution of the
Jews, the advent of the Bourbon dynasty, the Sun King's abandonment
of Paris in favor of Versailles, the collapse of the ancien regime
and reign of the guillotine, the alternating euphoria and anxiety of
the Napoleonic era, the deceptive glitter of the Second Empire, the
frivolous splendors of the Belle Epoque marred by scandals and the
divisive Dreyfus case, the carnage of the Great War, the ideological
tensions at the time of the Front Populaire, the dark years of the
Nazi occupation and the majestic salvational figure of De Gaulle.</TE>
<TE>   Always assessing personalities and events in terms of their effect
on the city of Paris, Horne is at the same time knowledgeable and
colorful. Whether describing cruel executions, macabre scenes of the
Black Death or the vendetta-like purges after the Liberation, he
projects a very personal voice that communicates passion as well as
compassion. He has his villains (Philippe le Bel, Louis XV) as well
as his heroes, among whom the most prominent is surely Henry IV, who
found Paris in terrible condition. That king's passion for building
and rebuilding, and preference for a new style exemplified by the
splendid Place Dauphine with its red brick and festoons of stone
work, as well as his dedication to order and prosperity, make him
stand out, according to Horne, as a wise urban regulator and a
supremely tasteful architect of Paris.</TE>
<TE>   The book is written with gusto and love: an Englishman's love of
Paris and of France, tempered by irony, humor and occasionally some
impatience, though without any trace of condescension. Horne has a
keen journalist's eye for realistic details. He provides careful
vignettes but also proceeds by large brushstrokes, moving ahead by
means of relatively short sections with fetching subtitles. He is not
reluctant to give his own opinions of the Bastille Opera House, the
Tour Montparnasse and the Church of St. Sulpice. And he displays
engaging directness and honesty, as when -- talking about the
collaborators, the denunciation and deportation of the Jews and the
overly zealous French police -- he asks himself whether the English
would have behaved any better had they experienced Nazi occupation.</TE>
<TE>   Now and then, Horne indulges in the anecdotal. He does not spare
his reader the gory details of tortures and executions. Aphorisms,
bons mots, historical pronouncements and colorful quotes are
frequently given without making totally clear where, when and under
what circumstances they were uttered or recorded. Considering the
magnitude of the documentation, Horne's sources are at times, of
necessity, secondhand. The system of references he adopted is often
frustrating. If one is lucky to find a given quote identified, it is
only by the last name of an author in a chapter-by-chapter list at
the end of the book; one then has to look up another list, also given
chapter by chapter, which provides the full name, followed by the
title. In many cases, however, there is no identification at all.
Some readers may like to know, for instance, where exactly one can
find Henry IV's statement "I rule with my arse in the saddle,"
Marshall Petain's complaint about the "sinister action" of the
milice, Victor Hugo's observation that the Middle Ages wrote things
down "in stone" (the reference to Andre Maurois is simply not good
enough) or Andre Malraux's comment about television and the Devil.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to his own literary judgments, Horne can be a little
hasty. Surely, Marivaux's theater reflects more than the "essential
frivolity" of his age, and Greek classical tragedy can hardly be
described as conveying "the theme of impotence." But such statements
only momentarily interrupt the pleasure provided by this ambitious
and skillful narrative that covers nine centuries of the history of
Paris with considerable brio and fervor.</TE>

<LD>Prey</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   Michael Crichton</LD>
<TE>   HarperCollins: 384 pp., $26.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One can always predict what new peril to Life As We Know It will
make its way to the TV news shows or the cover of Time magazine by
checking out the premise of Michael Crichton's latest bestseller.
"Jurassic Park" landed just in time for the recombinant-DNA scare,
and there was "Rising Sun" for the Japan-will-own-us panic of the
early '90s. Crichton has dipped into such topics as aircraft design,
quantum mechanics and sexual harassment in the workplace. Now comes
"Prey," featuring swarms of sinister microscopic software-programmed
beasties running amok. Already I can see the headline:
"Nanotechnology: Miracle or Menace?"</TE>
<TE>   "Prey" is narrated by Jack Forman, an unemployed Silicon Valley
software engineer working as Mr. Mom to three kids while his wife,
Julia, maintains workaholic hours at a high-tech firm. As the novel
opens, Forman is ruminating over his wife's increasingly strange
behavior, which includes unexplained absences from home, sudden
outbursts of rage and resentment and subtle changes in appearance. He
concludes she's having an affair, but the real explanation has
something to do with the mysterious corporate project she supervises:
a defense contract to manufacture, via nanotechnology -- that is, on
a molecular scale -- microscopic devices that can cruise above the
battlefield in large numbers and transmit a photographic image, all
without being detected or disrupted by the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, Julia's secret project has gone awry at a remote
outpost, due to some unwise software tinkering by the staff. A swarm
of the nanodevices has escaped into the environment, where they have
learned to reproduce themselves and taken to exhibiting the behavior
of predator colonies like ants, assaulting the local fauna and trying
to infiltrate the plant. In time, Jack lands the assignment to set
things right. Leaving the children behind, he heads for the desert,
and after an explosive confrontation between man and enemy, the
latter is vanquished.</TE>
<TE>   Prefacing the novel with a dour essay ("the obstinate egotism that
is a hallmark of human interaction with the environment") featuring
footnotes referencing works by creditable scientists such as Richard
Feynman, and closing with a bibliography of sources on artificial
life from an international selection of university presses, Crichton
obviously takes this story seriously. But it's hard to be convinced.
Crichton's admonitions about the imprudence of tampering with nature,
echoed by Jack, seem dropped in largely to darken the atmosphere,
like the Bernard Herrmann score of a Hitchcock film, rather than to
serve as a central theme. But Crichton should know that novels with
cautionary concern at their core spend more time on the threat to
society at large; that is, of course, the real work of cautionary
writers, the best of whom include H.G. Wells, Philip K. Dick and
Rachel Carson (whose nonfiction expose "Silent Spring" is perhaps the
scariest techno-thriller of all time).</TE>
<TE>   Crichton is an action writer, however, not an author of
speculative fiction. His novels come alive in ghost towns and distant
jungles, not among regular folks in the real world. In fact,
Crichton's Silicon Valley, where "Prey" opens, is oddly dated. In the
aftermath of the dot-com crash, there hangs over the region something
like, well, a dark cloud of nanoparticles, and if Crichton alludes to
this chill even once in "Prey," I must have missed it. (Jack's
unemployment has nothing to do with the lousy tech economy but rather
to his having unearthed some wrongdoing by the CEO of his last
company.)</TE>
<TE>   Yet this shouldn't surprise. With settings rendered so dimly,
prose merely serviceable and characters, with few exceptions,
indistinguishable from one another, Crichton's books often get their
charge from the nature of the threat. In this case, it must be said,
however, the threat lacks a certain panache.</TE>
<TE>   Crichton's most inspired effort to meld scientific alarmism with
genre convention was obviously "Jurassic Park." There the thrill came
prepackaged, awe and terror of dinosaurs being hard-wired into the
human brain from eons ago. Not so with the homicidal nanomachines in
"Prey." It's one thing to imagine a rampaging Tyrannosaurus rex on
one's tail, quite another to panic at the approach of a distant whir.
Being animals, the dinosaurs seemed endowed with malevolent
intention. Not so the nanomachines, whose behavior seems as sinister
as a cloud drifting on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   The scientific underpinning of "Prey," meanwhile, is too unwieldy
to keep the book hurtling along. Nanotechnology, genetic algorithms
and distributed computing are difficult concepts to slice into
explanatory morsels. In nearly every chapter of "Prey" there is a
point where the story stops dead so the narrator can drop in a
pedagogical aside.</TE>
<TE>   None of this is to denigrate Crichton's mysterious talent for
exploiting hot-button issues. But "Prey," lean as it is of drama,
tension or memorable peril, is decidedly lesser Crichton. It remains
to be seen what the Hollywood digital-effects houses can make of its
buzzing swarms.</TE>

<TE>   What is it about Paris? For the last two centuries it has been the
single most visited city in the world. Tourists still go for the art
and the food, even if they have to brave the disdain of ticket-takers
and waiters. Revolutionaries on the run, artists in search of the
avant-garde and writers looking for the license to explore their
inner selves went looking for people like themselves and created
their own enclaves filled with experimentation and constant
bickering. Would worldwide communist revolution have been conceivable
without the Paris that was home to Marx, Lenin and Ho Chi Minh?
(Communists and independence fighters had their own reason to be wary
of Parisian waiters, who are still assumed to provide a pipeline to
police forces.) Would Impressionism or Cubism have become "isms"
without Paris as a place to work and as a subject to paint?</TE>
<TE>   Tourists will continue to visit, no doubt, but the glow is fading
from the City of Light. New York has long surpassed it as the center
of modern art, Hollywood and even Bollywood as the place for cinema,
and revolution now seeks its headquarters in more dingy locations
such as Hamburg, Jakarta or the northwest frontier of Pakistan. What
better moment, then, to ask how Paris came to be, for such a long
time, "capital of the world"?</TE>
<TE>   The answer lies in the city's "myths," according to the
distinguished Harvard historian Patrice Higonnet in "Paris: Capital
of the World." A myth, for Higonnet, is not inherently false; he uses
the term to show that our images of a city are constructed over time
in response to specific circumstances. They are true, but only for a
while. The "myth" in question is Paris as the capital of modernity.
Already in 1799 the Parisian writer Louis-Sebastien Mercier could
boast that "this city eternally rivets the gaze of the entire world."
Paris came to stand for all the contradictions of modern life; you
went there to experience more fully what modern life had to offer.
Paris was imagined, by locals and foreigners alike, as the hothouse
of individualism, revolution, scientific progress, urbanism, artistic
innovation and cultural sophistication, but it also offered the more
dangerous enticements of pornography, prostitution, alienation and,
at the end of the line, crime.</TE>
<TE>   Higonnet fully appreciates how the two sides of the "myth"
complemented each other. In his chapter on Balzac, Baudelaire and
Zola, he traces the literary fixation with Paris as the center of all
that mattered in modern life. In an especially suggestive chapter on
Paris' place in the North American literary imagination, he reminds
us of the power of the myth of Paris for American artists and
writers, white and black. He mercifully passes over the well-known
expatriates to dwell on lesser known figures such as African
Americans Henry Ossawa Tanner, a successful painter and teacher, and
Chester Himes, whose detective stories appeared first in French.</TE>
<TE>   A product of two cultures himself -- he wrote this book in French
-- Higonnet is ideally placed to serve as guide to the riches of the
Parisian Golden Age, which ran roughly from the French Revolution to
1945. His book is beautifully produced and worth purchasing just for
the wonderful illustrations, which are, often as not, unfamiliar.
Among the many full-color reproductions is a dramatic black-and-white
magazine illustration from 1922 that depicts an imaginary grand
avenue of skyscrapers in Paris. The city that gave birth to arcades
and department stores, that identifies itself with the Metro and the
Eiffel Tower and that chokes today on its adoration for the
automobile stopped short at the skyscraper. Higonnet makes too little
of this; the refusal of skyscrapers is key both to Paris' long
cultural prominence and its eventual eclipse.</TE>
<TE>   Paris is suspended in the medium of mid-19th century urbanism.
Jerked into the future by the bulldozing prefect Georges Haussmann,
who in the 1850s and 1860s tore down enough of the city to make way
for 200 kilometers of new streets and 34,000 new buildings, Paris
went into a kind of metropolitan shock. It anticipated the future of
every European city by decades, making its new grand boulevards --
and sewers -- the envy of all. But the core of the city has been
virtually the same ever since. It is now a late 19th century museum
piece in terms of urban architecture; its occasional nods to the need
for updating are usually quirky rather than trend-setting, whether
you consider the brightly colored exterior tubing of the Pompidou
Museum, Pei's Egyptoid forms in front of the Louvre or the monstrous
monumentality of the French National Library (a pet project of
Francois Mitterrand's), whose only virtue is its location far from
the center of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Higonnet offers diverting accounts of Paris at its prime but is
less convincing about the reasons for its loss of luster. He somehow
blames the Surrealists of the 1920s and 1930s for the failure of
Paris to keep up its image as the avant-garde of modernity; they
never offered "a genuine myth," only a "phantasmagoria," a
self-deluding and self-indulgent fantasy. But at least the
Surrealists refused cultural nostalgia, soon to be the great sucking
sinkhole of Parisian intellectual and artistic life. Higonnet says
too little about the fatal attraction of nostalgia, which kept Paris
in the limelight well into the 20th century but ultimately left it
with no way to go forward. Cultural nostalgia became so powerful a
force in Parisian life because it eventually colonized the enormous
space first cleared out by the Parisian fascination with the new.</TE>
<TE>   It is telling that Higonnet can only conclude by citing the moment
in Casablanca when Humphrey Bogart says to Ingrid Bergman, "We'll
always have Paris." Higonnet passes up the opportunity to explore the
myth of Paris as the site of nostalgic loss. Nostalgia as cultural
mode came into being with and depended upon modernity, and thus, as
might be expected, it is most powerfully associated with the place
that stands for modernity. Nostalgia and newness thus have an
intimate relationship. Once upon a time, all that is now permeated
with nostalgia -- the shine of lights in the rainy streets, the cozy
corner bistro, the Metro signs, the Eiffel Tower -- were all
shockingly new. Indeed, many of the most charged sites of Parisian
cultural nostalgia had their origins quite literally in revolution:
The first restaurants and the Louvre Museum opened their doors during
the French Revolution, and the Eiffel Tower was inaugurated in 1889
for the centennial of the Revolution of 1789.</TE>
<TE>   David Garrioch's book "The Making of Revolutionary Paris" aims to
explain how this explosion of innovation could be set off in a city
whose ordinary people were most concerned with making ends meet.
Garrioch's highly readable account ends where Higonnet's begins, with
the French Revolution of 1789. Ironically, however, neither of them
actually says much about the pivotal events. Because Higonnet focuses
on the myth of Paris, he devotes little space to the bloody
syncopation of revolution in the city; the thousands dead in the
revolutions of 1789, 1830, 1848 and 1871 disappear inside the
tapestry of scientific and artistic progress. The backward glance of
nostalgia rarely lingers on moments of upheaval; it is a mode more
attuned to the clink of wine glasses than to the booming of cannon.</TE>
<TE>   Although Garrioch has little interest in the "myth" of Paris, he
has his own trouble with nostalgia; he is clearly enamored of a
social world in which men took their identities from their trades and
families knew their policeman by his first name and centered their
lives on the local parish, even if they disagreed with the church
hierarchy on some issues. He finds the origin of revolution in the
changes in the city in the 18th century. Many of these changes are
predictable and already well documented, such as population growth
and increased social mobility. But Garrioch has put them all together
in a compelling portrait of "a new political landscape," in which the
old power bases crumbled to be replaced by new men and women willing
to act against local interests and operate in citywide networks. His
book makes this ordinary but fateful new Paris come alive, whether
describing painters putting numbers on houses for the first time in
1779 or Jansenists (Roman Catholic dissidents) attacking priests in
the street in 1753 after the archbishop had decreed that they could
not receive the last rites. The details all come together in a
marvelous synthesis that depicts a vibrant, rapidly growing city
whose people were primed for a big change.</TE>
<TE>   There are two different pictures of Paris in these books, one the
Paris of cultural mythology, the other the Paris of its ordinary
people. Anyone intrigued by the still strong pull of one of the
world's great metropolises will find both worth reading.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The lives of philosophers seldom make compelling reading. Can you
think of a "drop everything, must buy now" biography of Hegel?
Wittgenstein? Newton? The life of a mind when its thoughts are
published can change the world, but it is very hard to make such a
life into a must-read. There are few hard acts to follow if you are
attempting, as Richard Watson does, to write a lively, pugnacious and
clear account of a philosophical life, in this case that of Rene
Descartes. Widely regarded as the founder of modern philosophy,
Descartes deserves the appellation. He grounded modern thinking on
the ability of the human mind to think clearly and distinctly, and he
was the first philosopher to see that the new science of Copernicus
and Galileo required a radical reordering of our understanding of
physical nature simply around the concepts of matter and motion.
During his lifetime and after his death in 1650, he was accused of
materialism and atheism and, almost as bad, of consorting with
Protestants. The other philosophical giant of the 17th century, Isaac
Newton, thought that Descartes' philosophy led straight to atheism
and was at pains to hide the enormous debt he owed to Descartes'
mechanistic understanding of nature and his mathematics.</TE>
<TE>   While Watson, an accomplished scholar of Cartesianism, has few
competitors for the prize of writing a really interesting life of a
classic philosopher, he has one big obstacle in his way: Descartes
himself. There are huge gaps in the knowable life of Descartes: He
tried to conceal his whereabouts for years, vital manuscripts are
lost, previous biographers in a less precise age made up stories to
keep the narrative flowing and partisans, particularly of the Roman
Catholic persuasion, have labored hard to lay Descartes in the
Procrustean bed of Baroque Catholicism and its hostile stance toward
all competitors. He is said to have been a great friend of the heresy
hunter Cardinal Pierre de Berulle, who watched with glee as Louis
XIII's army starved into submission the Protestants of La Rochelle.
Some even claim that Descartes went approvingly to watch the siege
and see the massive fortifications. Shortly thereafter, and
inconveniently for those who want Descartes to be a loyal son of the
church, he left France and lived for 20 years in the majority
Protestant Dutch Republic. There he resided for a time in common law
with a Dutch Protestant woman, with whom he had a daughter who died
young.</TE>
<TE>   Making the matter of his religious beliefs even more complex,
Descartes played his cards very close to his chest. He published his
major works, most famously "The Discourse on Method" (1637), in the
Dutch Republic, where, to paraphrase him, men got on with their
business and left him to think as he pleased. While living as a
Catholic, Descartes probably cared little about a person's creed
provided he or she shared a life of the mind compatible with clear
thinking and the search for nature's laws. At least that is what he
told Queen Christina of Sweden, to whom he became a tutor. Always in
somewhat fragile health, Descartes met his demise in the coldness of
a Swedish winter. When he died, he was recognized as having built the
most compelling case for seeing nature as a mechanism and for
accepting that the Earth was just like any other body, at motion and
held in place by the direct pressure of other matter in the universe.
For Descartes, no motion could occur without contact action between
bodies. In 1687, Newton would prove that universal gravitation
operated as a force in a vacuum and not in the filled Cartesian
universe, but that is another story. Both men knew that scholasticism
had to be replaced and, within a century after Descartes' death, that
had largely happened in countries without an Inquisition.</TE>
<TE>   However discreet about his address and private life, behind the
scenes Descartes sought out followers, particularly in the Dutch
Republic. By the 1640s, Utrecht, among other places, was the site of
a bitter contest between Cartesians and Aristotelians. We know that
the former won because we too see nature as composed of atoms and as
mathematically knowable. The followers of Aristotle, known as
schoolmen or scholastics, thought that immaterial forms, such as the
soul in human beings, and not contact action between bodies shaped
nature and that these forms carried with them "tendencies," that is,
bodies fell to the ground because it was in their nature to seek out
that which was heavier. It is not hard to see how people who thought
about nature in such a way also imagined kings and nobles as
possessing an inherently different form of nature. The defeat of
scholasticism by the new science of the 17th century -- and no figure
is more important in that story than Descartes -- laid down the
metaphysical foundations for democratic thought. That had not been
Descartes' intention. He thought that he was laying the metaphysical
foundations for certainty, as Watson rightly observes. Either way,
Cartesianism was mighty subversive, and perhaps Descartes' close
card-playing and general discretion signal that he knew the stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a life of which at times nothing is known, Watson
ad-libs and fills. With Descartes in remote Friesland, where Watson
and his wife briefly settled, Watson treats us to stories about Dutch
candies and weather. The first can be quite interesting; the second
is often atrocious. We are introduced to Watson's wife, Pat, and her
apt questions or comments. In pursuit of his hero in Sweden, Watson
tells us how he found the weather there and about the various
original manuscripts badly transcribed by previous editors. Part of
the charm of this book lies in the many tangential stories it tells
and the partisanship with which Watson has approached his subject.
The book in many ways is as much about Watson as it is about
Descartes. At times Watson's sum in his cogito gets in the way. To
have a feel for his rhetoric, Watson's dismissal of the story of
Cardinal Berulle and Descartes is best left in his own words: "The
members of the Saint Descartes Protection Society began to refer to
Cardinal Berulle as Descartes' director of conscience. That genocidal
maniac (and I speak precisely) as Descartes' director of conscience?
Not bloody likely." Watson thinks that Descartes was a liberal
Christian, a partisan for the modern, the tolerant and the rational,
and all the more admirable as a consequence.</TE>
<TE>   It is always risky to like a thinker and his thought so much as to
imagine him as one of us. Descartes was a French Catholic who knew
that Copernicus had been right, that Galileo was also right (and
under house arrest for his trouble) and that the struggle to dethrone
Aristotle and the clergy who supported him would take a massive
endeavor. He also knew that turmoil in beliefs and ideas could lead
to civil wars such as France had experienced from the 1560s to the
1590s. His 20-year sojourn with the Dutch made it possible for him to
publish and to gain followers in their Protestant universities. He
was a bitter partisan in philosophical warfare that makes our
cultural wars look trivial by comparison. He could not imagine a
world without kings and noblemen like himself. He was not one of us,
and he would have found little to his liking in England, where in
1649, the year before his death, the English beheaded their king. Yet
for all his conservatism, Descartes made us moderns possible.</TE>

<LD>Napoleon and Wellington</LD>
<LD>   The Battle of Waterloo and the Great Commanders</LD>
<LD>   Who Fought It</LD>
<TE>   Andrew Roberts</TE>
<TE>   Simon &amp; Schuster: 350 pp., $27</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In recent years there has been a spate of books with a similar
approach -- the depiction of parallel lives -- and seldom have they
been successful. A portrait of two lives is not necessarily more
interesting than that of one life, especially when they are forcibly
put next to each other. One of the worst was Lord Alan Bullock's
"Hitler and Stalin," in which this eminent historian neglected an
important matter: their relations, opinions and perceptions of each
other.</TE>
<TE>   In "Napoleon and Wellington," Andrew Roberts has done the very
opposite. "This is not a joint biography," he writes, "but rather a
study of beliefs and rivalry, propaganda and rancor." The two
protagonists ended up despising each other but that, too, was not a
simple matter. The Duke of Wellington's public statements about
Napoleon Bonaparte were different from what he said privately on many
an occasion. Moreover, their opinions regarding each other kept
changing. And, in the end, what they thought and said about each
other revealed their own characters. Roberts' book amounts to more
than a portrait of their relationship; it adds considerably to our
knowledge of the two men.</TE>
<TE>   There were certainly parallels in the lives of Napoleon and
Wellington. They were born in the same year and both had fathers who
died when they were very young. Each had four brothers and three
sisters and both got decisive help from brothers at turning points in
their careers. Neither had much interest in where he was born
(Napoleon in Corsica, Wellington in Ireland); both were successful
generals. But they never faced each other. For nearly six years,
Wellington marched up and down Spain and Portugal, battling French
generals, yet never Napoleon. They didn't meet in battle except, of
course, at Waterloo. There, at one moment, they may have been not
more than a quarter of a mile from each other; but whether they
actually saw each other is doubtful. Yet each imagined and talked
about how he saw the other plenty of times, both before and after
Waterloo.</TE>
<TE>   Their characters differed greatly: one the supreme egoist, the
impetuous Corsican who aimed and succeeded at becoming a brilliant
Frenchman; the other supremely self-centered, a cold and snobbish
native of Ireland who succeeded at becoming a paragon of an English
aristocrat. Napoleon seldom said anything good about Wellington;
Wellington admired Napoleon as a soldier but despised his character.
Some time after Waterloo, this duality disappeared. In a private
letter in 1835, Wellington wrote that "Bonaparte's whole life, civil,
political and military, was a fraud." Ten years before that,
Wellington, who was not a dedicated writer, decided to write a
53-page analysis of Napoleon's 1812 Russian campaign. As Roberts
writes, "The emperor who emerges from Wellington's account is a
bumbling, procrastinating, heartless fool, far removed from the man
Wellington continued to laud in public."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Wellington collected a vast hoard of Napoleonic memorabilia,
including the giant nude statue of Napoleon by Canova that stands in
Apsley House to this day. "Short of having the emperor himself in an
iron cage ... ," Roberts writes, "Wellington could hardly have had
more trophies of the man he had defeated." In turn, there is
Napoleon's summation of Wellington while on St. Helena: "a man of
little spirit, no generosity, without grandeur of the soul ... a
narrow-minded man." In his will (never executed), Napoleon bequeathed
a small sum to a Frenchman who had attempted to kill Wellington in
Paris. In sum, whatever respect they may have had for each other
disappeared after Waterloo.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts is an excellent writer, with a thorough knowledge of the
mass of literature pertinent to his difficult subject. His
understanding is as good as his knowledge, as when he writes that
"the denigration of Wellington by French writers is as ludicrous as
his deification by some British writers." He knows not a few curious
details (for example the existence of a "Wellington-Napoleon" high
school somewhere in Missouri) as well as the not unimportant fact
that Wellington's army at Waterloo of 68,000 men included fewer than
24,000 British and Irish soldiers (the rest were Dutch and other
continentals). One thing entirely missing is a description of
Wellington's beautiful, unfortunate and sad wife, although there are
pages and pages describing two courtesans in Paris whose favors both
Napoleon and Wellington probably enjoyed.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts concludes with a regret: "There is some irony in the fact
that Waterloo was fought a mere twelve miles from Brussels, the
capital of today's European Union. For, although Wellington won the
battle, it is Napoleon's dream that is coming true." That is
arguable, because Napoleon's "dream" of a united Europe was entirely
different from the bureaucratic confection at Brussels, a capital of
Belgium but not of a Europe that in reality does not exist. There is
a more stunning historical coincidence that Roberts did not mention:
Charles de Gaulle joined Winston Churchill in London to proclaim
France's resistance to Hitler's Germany on June 18, 1940, exactly 125
years after the day of Waterloo.</TE>
<TE>   Wellington was a great commander but, like other great British
military heroes -- the Duke of Marlborough, Gen. Douglas Haig, Field
Marshal Bernard Montgomery -- not a likable man. Wellington was not
modest, and his character was not particularly attractive. "Britain's
greatest military hero," Roberts writes, marked by his "nepotism,
racism and snobbishness ... saved Europe from despotism." Having
read, enjoyed and profited from this valuable and well-balanced book,
I faced a dilemma: where to put it in my library, on the French or on
the English history shelves? I chose the latter.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From "Napoleon and Wellington"</TE>
<TE>   The Emperor Napoleon seemed confident of victory when he
breakfasted with his senior generals at Le Caillou farmhouse on the
Charleroi-Brussels road at eight o'clock on the morning of Sunday, 18
June 1815. He had feared that the Anglo-Allied army under the Duke of
Wellington might have withdrawn from its defensive positions on the
ridge of Mont St. Jean during the night, but dawn had revealed it
still in place. The meal was served on silver plate bearing the
imperial arms, and once it was cleared away maps of the area were
spread across the table and the council of war began.</TE>
<TE>   "The army of the enemy is superior to ours by one-fourth,"
Napoleon announced.... "We have nevertheless ninety chances in our
favor, and not ten against us."</TE>

<LD>Hello to the Cannibals</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   Richard Bausch</LD>
<TE>   HarperCollins: 662 pp., $27.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Toward the end of Richard Bausch's novel "Hello to the Cannibals,"
heroine Lily Austin meets Violet Beaumont, a crotchety nonagenarian
straight from central casting, who "rambles on about the old days,"
nods off in a rocker and offers up crusty bits of wisdom to
22-year-old Lily and her gay best friend Dom. Violet shares Lily's
near-obsessive interest in Mary Kingsley, a late-19th century
explorer and travel writer who thrilled the readers of that time with
tales of her adventures in Africa.</TE>
<TE>   Though Lily has spent much of the novel researching and writing a
play about Kingsley, Violet better understands the harsh realities of
Kingsley's life as it was actually lived, the life of a defiantly
single woman in Victorian England, a woman who felt more at home
climbing Mt. Cameroon in corset and petticoat than serving tea in a
drawing room. "Mary Kingsley was an outlaw," Violet tells Lily, "An
outlaw in bombazine and lace."</TE>
<TE>   And, besides being an outlaw, Kingsley is an inspiration to Lily,
whose own life has turned out to be disappointingly empty. "Hello to
the Cannibals" is a big, sprawling sort of book that connects two
centuries through the lives of these two women, Kingsley and Lily.
Fearful and timid, Lily isn't quite sure how to navigate between the
banalities and freedoms of life in modern America; thus, she seeks
solace in Kingsley, not only writing a play about her but also
striking up a "friendship" with this lady from another time by
writing letters to her. These are interspersed throughout the novel.</TE>
<TE>   We first meet Lily in 1982, on her 14th birthday, when a friend
gives her a book about explorers, which includes a section on
Kingsley that immediately enthralls her. Later that evening, her
friend's grandfather makes a rather aggressive pass at her, causing
Lily to withdraw into herself, "troubled by the company of
strangers." Six years later, we meet Lily again, as a senior in
college. Her parents have divorced and her father's remarried to a
woman Lily's age. Although Lily's the star of the drama department,
she has only two friends: Sheri Galatierre, a Mississippi good-time
girl, and Dom, who has not yet realized that he's gay and who harbors
feelings for Lily.</TE>
<TE>   But Lily has fallen in love -- literally at first sight -- with
Tyler Harrison, Sheri's enigmatic half brother. The couple marry
hastily and move to Oxford, Miss., where Tyler has a job waiting at
his stepfather's Oldsmobile dealership. For a time, all is good.
Then, Lily discovers she's pregnant, and Tyler turns cold and
distant, for surprising reasons.</TE>
<TE>   All the while, Lily writes her letters to Kingsley -- "I admire
your bravery because I sense how prodigious your fear was" -- and
works on her play. We know this because Bausch tells us so, but he
never gives us a chance to have a sense of Lily as a writer or to see
her writing or wrestling with her material, (the play itself reads
like something from an undergrad playwriting workshop). Instead, as
Lily immerses herself in Kingsley's life, Bausch shows us scenes from
it (also starting in her 14th year), substantially fictionalized,
though Kingsley was someone whose life perhaps didn't need much
embellishment.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsley spent much of her brief life dutifully tending to her
invalid mother and dying father. At 30, a small inheritance allowed
her to fulfill her dream of exploring remote regions of West Africa,
battling alligators, befriending cannibals and generally going where
no white man had gone. Her first book, "Travels in West Africa," was
an immediate bestseller, "The Perfect Storm" of its day. She returned
to West Africa a second time, produced a second book, spoke out
against missionary activities, advised Britain's colonial secretary
on governing the region, and, in 1900, traveled to South Africa to
nurse casualties of the Boer War. In Simonstown, she contracted
typhus and died, asking that her body be tossed in the sea. She was
37.</TE>
<TE>   Bausch, unfortunately, captures little of Kingsley's humor and
chutzpah -- instead we get a nervous, neurotic Kingsley who doubts
herself at every junction. Yet he still makes her fascinating, and
all the more so in contrast to Lily, who remains something of a
blank, a non-character. Kingsley, of course, gets to do things -- to
talk with ship captains, climb mountains, meet cannibals -- while
Lily sits around, eating soup and wishing everyone would be nicer to
each other.</TE>
<TE>   And therein lies the novel's central irony: Lily has the freedom
to do whatever she pleases but is paralyzed by fear, awed by the
chaos of human relationships; Kingsley found freedom in a world that
didn't offer it, eschewing the trappings of Victorian life and
venturing out into the wild, untamed world. In the end Lily, left
alone with her baby after Tyler abandons her, makes a step toward
love in an unlikely place and, in doing so, moves a smidgen toward
confronting her own demons, toward knowing herself.</TE>
<TE>   "Were you so terrified of intimacy?" Lily asks Kingsley in one of
her early letters. "Did you have this same expectation, all the time,
that things were not going to work out? That something bad was just
on the other side of every minute?" The answer, of course, is a
resounding no. Kingsley feared nothing and bravely shaped her own
destiny.</TE>
<TE>   The most fierce cannibals, Bausch suggests, are those within us,
those who eat us from the inside out, who disallow us from seeing the
inevitability of our own Africas. It's a powerful sentiment -- and
one that carries the heavy weight of truth -- but one wishes Bausch
had allowed his heroine to be less than a mere vessel for such
thudding epiphanies, or to simply be less of a heroine and more of a
character, someone who might show her cannibals to the reader, even
if she can't yet greet them herself.</TE>

<TE>   Naomi Levy</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 264 pp., $19.95</TE>
<TE>   You may not like the idea of having someone else write your
prayers for you, but Naomi Levy, the first female Conservative rabbi
to lead a congregation on the West Coast, is very convincing when it
comes to the idea of personal hotlines to God. "Prayer," she
believes, "is ultimately an experience, not a request."</TE>
<TE>   Here are prayers for unfaithfulness, sleeplessness, pregnancy,
miscarriage, addiction, integrity at work, suicide, procrastination
and other modern-day afflictions and celebrations. Levy even includes
a prayer for gossips. Apparently, no subject is too small for God's
ear.</TE>
<TE>   "It is remarkable," Levy writes, "to see what can emerge from us
when we stop trying to pray to God and start talking to God instead."</TE>

<TE>   African Diary</TE>
<TE>   Bill Bryson</TE>
<TE>   Broadway Books: 64 pp., $12</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Bill Bryson was asked by CARE International to go to
Kenya for eight days and write an essay about what he saw there. The
proceeds would go to CARE. Apart from "the diseases and the bandits
and the railway from Nairobi to Mombasa, there's absolutely nothing
to worry about," his guides assure him, but the emotional distance
between his world and the slums of Kenya proves to be profound.
Bryson is particularly unprepared for Kibera, the largest slum, with
one-fifth of its 700,000 inhabitants diagnosed with AIDS. They visit
a refugee camp on the northeastern border, where the school does not
even have the paper, books and pencils to help the children pass to
the next level of education. "You mean you have no hope at all?"
Bryson asks one student. " 'Not much,' he said, and gave me a
heartbreakingly shy smile." That smile, you can picture it. It makes
the essay worth owning.</TE>

<TE>   God's Mountain</TE>
<TE>   Erri De Luca</TE>
<TE>   Translated from the Italian</TE>
<TE>   by Michael Moore</TE>
<TE>   Riverhead: 168 pp.,</TE>
<TE>   $12.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   "God's Mountain" is Erri De Luca's simple tale of a 13-year-old
boy growing up in Naples, Italy, and the summer he left childhood
behind. In a series of seemingly random events, his father gives him
a boomerang, which he practices throwing for months before actually
throwing it. His mother dies. The girl upstairs becomes his first
love. An old hunchback carpenter claims to have wings under the hump
that will soon spread and allow him to fly away.</TE>
<TE>   From the narrator's rooftop, the boy can see all of his town,
Montedidio, or God's Mountain. It is where he and Maria meet at the
end of their day to kiss and talk, and it is one of the most vividly
drawn in literary memory. Together they look at all the lights and
stars; all the other rooftops and beyond. "In the peacefulness of a
summer day, when the sun was down, we'd stand there wordlessly, close
to each other .... Until last year I was still a child."</TE>

<TE>   Hollyridge Press: 256 pp.,</TE>
<TE>   $17.95 paper</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Rosenthal hides out in the Santa Monica Mountains, brewing
concoctions like this novel, a tale of the future, just close enough
to us (2016) to make us afraid and just far enough away to set us at
ease. The Earth has finally suffered enough climatic meddling and is
rent with cataclysm. Cities are destroyed by earthquakes and
volcanoes. A dragon, released from the center of the Earth, threatens
humanity, while a Nobel laureate tries to save it. "I want mankind to
learn to live within itself," he tells the dragon. "But now, is this
for all mankind?" she asks. "Is it for womankind, too? And the other
animals of the planet? ... Do you think the worst human being is more
valuable than the worst dog?"</TE>
<TE>   Rosenthal has stepped out on a limb with this novel, and after
"Elena of the Stars," an earlier book, I am willing to go out on it
with him.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Henry Miller is remembered and celebrated for "Tropic of Cancer"
and other works of literature condemned as pornography during his
lifetime. But he also possessed a genius for cultivating highly
literary friendships with fellow artists and writers such as Lawrence
Durrell and Anais Nin. Indeed, one of his last books, written and
published a few years before his death in 1980, was a memoir titled
"Henry Miller's Book of Friends."</TE>
<TE>   Among his most enduring friendships was one with the
Hungarian-born photographer known as Brassai (born Gyula Halasz,
1899-1984), who attests to both the clamor and the richness of a
relationship with Miller in "Henry Miller, Happy Rock," a unique and
wholly fascinating account of their encounters and exchanges of
correspondence over the last four decades of Miller's life.</TE>
<TE>   The two men spent time together in California and France, the two
poles of Miller's life and work, and Brassai allows us to overhear
their urgent chatter, which ranged from arts, letters and history to
politics, intimate secrets and hot gossip. At one moment, Miller
muses on his second puberty and the samurai spirit; at the next, he
ponders the irony of Nin's elevation to iconic status in the women's
movement:</TE>
<TE>   "She gets asked for autographs like Liz Taylor," Miller told
Brassai in 1973. "It's funny, don't you think? Do you remember that
puny and timid creature?"</TE>
<TE>   Brassai begins the book with the period of self-exile when Miller,
who grew up in Brooklyn and flowered as a writer in Paris, found
himself without much honor in his own country. Later, when Miller's
work began to earn both recognition and royalties, they spent time
together during a series of sentimental journeys around France in the
'50s and '60s. And their friendship continued through Miller's last
years as an aging literary lion in the big white house on Ocampo
Drive in Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone comes here to sell his soul," said Miller about his
first sojourn in Los Angeles, where he took up residence during World
War II in the futile hope of making his fortune in the movies. He was
so broke that he was forced to walk from his place in Beverly Glen to
the studios in Hollywood where he was hawking his scripts. "He too
would have liked to 'sell his soul' to get by, but no one was
interested," Brassai writes of Miller. "All the ... screenplays he
proposed were rejected."</TE>
<TE>   Thus did Miller seek out the isolation of Big Sur, where he tended
his garden, killed rattlesnakes with a pickax and raised his two
young children. But Brassai shows us that it soon became a kind of
pilgrimage site for European writers who knew and admired Miller's
work and trekked into the California coastal wilderness to call on
him. Ironically, Miller found himself too distracted to write in
precisely the place that seemed to afford an idyllic refuge. "They
think I'm the Dalai Lama," he complained to Brassai. "And I'm too
weak to resist."</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Brassai rambled around Paris together in 1959, when he
took his children, Tony and Valentine, to Europe to acquaint them
with the world. On a visit to the Eiffel Tower, Miller and Brassai
made odds on his chances of winning the Nobel Prize even though
"Sexus" had been banned in Sweden because, according to the judges,
the book consisted of 15.7% obscenities.</TE>
<TE>   Miller despaired that he was best known for his banned books. "I'm
taken for a pornography giant!" he complained. "But I'm the most
normal of men. No vices or perversions. By stripping sex of all its
hypocrisy, I simply wanted to liberate myself from the puritan mind,
and also liberate others."</TE>
<TE>   But Brassai, who also wrote a critical biography of Miller,
insists on delving even deeper into Miller's inner workings. Thus,
for example, Miller is likened to a "happy rock" in the title of
Brassai's memoir because, as he explains, Miller always aspired to
"total detachment," and the best evidence are the sexual
relationships with women, each one ending in failure. Miller protests
that he is, in fact, "a sentimental man capable of true love," but
Brassai offers a damning calculation: "[A]ll Henry's love affairs
lasted exactly seven years," he observes, "not a year less or more."</TE>
<TE>   Miller made no note of protest when he was permitted to read and
comment on the manuscript of "Henry Miller, Happy Rock," and the book
is all the more revealing because Brassai reproduces the marginal
comments, thus allowing us to hear Miller's ghostly voice as a kind
of invisible commentator on the text. Where, for example, Brassai
quotes Miller as saying that one of his wives died young because she
"drank whiskey at night," Miller wrote in the margins: "Not only at
night, but all day long."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it is the honesty and intimacy of their friendship that
makes the book so pleasurable and so enlightening. "I'm curious to
find out how you see me, how you judge me," says Miller to Brassai in
one of the many conversations that are reproduced verbatim in the
book. "And now that you know me down deep, what is your dominant
impression? Chaos?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, not chaos. Contradiction!" replies Brassai. "Like the
pendulum of a clock, you oscillate constantly, between a sense of
being a genius, a superhuman man, and that of being a poor devil who
made a mess of his life."</TE>
<TE>   "Memory is history, but history is not always memory," writes
Alejandro Murguia in "The Medicine of Memory," an audacious but rich
and wholly rewarding exercise in the use of history as a tool for
self-discovery and self-definition. "My California is different from
the histories I had to endure as a young man, the ones that left me
out of the picture while rugged white pioneers conquered the West."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Moctezuma and Father Junipero Serra figure in Murguia's
book, but so do his first communion and the day he uttered his first
words of English. He muses on the fact that, unlike the Americans who
came to California during the Gold Rush, the Native Americans valued
abalone shell and eagle bird feathers above gold, and he observes
that the nugget so famously discovered at Sutter's Mill in 1848
"looked to me like calcified dog turd that I might hose from my
sidewalk on any given morning." And he explains why, growing up in
the 1950s, he valued a Bobby Avila baseball card fully as much as
those for Ted Williams and Willie Mays.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good to know one could play second base en las ligas
grandes and win the batting title and be Mexican."</TE>
<TE>   Murguia harks back to 1773, when one of his ancestors trekked into
Alta California with Serra. He tracks the family's fortunes through
the era of Mexican sovereignty and the conquest of California by the
U.S. He recalls the fact that his more recent forebears were among
the first to cultivate the San Fernando Valley, and he honors his
older brother's service in Vietnam. Indeed, the whole point of this
impassioned and stirring book is to write back into our history the
chapters that have been left out.</TE>
<TE>   "[A]s a reward for two hundred some years of nurturing this land
with our sweat and blood, ignorant governors and racist psychopaths
shout at us to go back to where we came from, and even the most well
intentioned liberal believes we are foreigners here," Murguia points
out. "But as I write this, I am standing where I was born; this is
where I am from."</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>It's all for one</HD>
<DH>They pitched and we bought. What this year's collection of
bestsellers and chart-toppers reveals about our 2002 state of mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They're the top of the pop-culture food chain, which isn't
necessarily the same as the cream of the crop. Tens of millions of us
have endorsed them with our cash and credit cards, though we may not
have embraced them fully with our hearts and minds.</LD>
<LD>   As a group they reside at the profitable midpoint of American
taste and opinion: A movie about a guy who romps around in spandex on
Manhattan's rooftops ("Spider-Man"). A twisted hip-hop ode to
American values ("The Eminem Show"). A novel that envisions the end
of the world in vivid, almost jubilant detail ("The Remnant"). A
self-help manual by "Oprah" spinoff celebrity Phillip McGraw ("Self
Matters: Creating Your Life From the Inside Out"). A video game whose
latest incarnation rewards quick reflexes and low animal cunning with
cool cars, hot babes and other people's money ("Grand Theft Auto:
Vice City").</LD>
<LD>   On first impression, the only quality these No. 1's share is a
knack for making cash registers sing. But look closer and you'll spot
strange affinities among them, echoes of a period that future
generations may refer to as the Year of Living Anxiously.
Collectively, they represent a moment in time when America
alternately swaggered and trembled, flexed its muscles and murmured
its prayers.</LD>
<TE>   In our competitive culture, of course, numerical rankings are the
cold, hard measure of success or failure, a raw index of national
obsessions. We know how easily No. 1 can be tweaked by music
merchandisers and Hollywood profiteers. We know that people tell
pollsters they're watching "Masterpiece Theatre" when really they're
tuned into a World Wrestling smackdown. Yet every year we ask: Who's
on top?</TE>
<TE>   "Put it this way: You never see somebody putting a sticker on the
package saying it was No. 52," says Bruce Haring, a former USA Today
reporter and the author of books about the music industry's marketing
shenanigans. "We're a society that craves the newest, the best, the
hottest." Whether it's a populist stroke of genius or a carny
barker's crass come-on, attaining No. 1 means you've somehow
convinced the masses to rise up as one and cry: We love it! We want
it! We'll take it!</TE>
<TE>   "In the media age, the information age, lists help us categorize
things and make sense out of the chaos, even if they're not true,"
says Lawrence R. Samuel, author of "Brought to You By: Postwar
Television Advertising and the American Dream." With that caveat,
what follows is a look at what we were really buying this year when
we shelled out our shekels for No. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Welcome to grim times</TE>
<TE>   Running through this year's group of chart-busters and bestsellers
like a low-grade fever was a sense that bad things were happening and
more were likely to come. The clues were scattered everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Watching CBS' "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," which took over
from "Friends" this fall as the No. 1 weekly TV series, we peered
over the shoulders of Gil Grissom and his colleague Catherine Willows
(actors William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger) as they bantered over
DNA samples and spun ingenious theories in emotionally flat-lined
voices.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing's absolute, Gil, even forensics," Grissom's boss told him
in a recent episode. Yet the premise of "CSI" is that each mystery
will be resolved within the allotted prime-time hour and the dead can
speak to us through their ghostly remains -- that every human body
has a story to tell. Set in Las Vegas (which Money magazine ranked
America's No. 1 metropolis), "CSI" is as much about recovering the
memory of those no longer among us as it is about collaring bad guys.</TE>
<TE>   On a more apocalyptic scale, that could also be the theme of "The
Remnant: On the Brink of Armageddon," the latest installment in a
serialized fictional account of the rapture, when Christ's followers
supposedly will be summoned up to heaven minus their clothes and
dental fillings. Nonbelievers left behind on Earth will face the
wrath of the antichrist, fiendishly disguised as head of the United
Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The series, called "Left Behind," is written by Jerry B. Jenkins
and conceived by Tim LaHaye, and it's not only the bestselling
Christian fiction work of 2002, but also one of the year's top
hardcover titles. Never heard of it? Better put aside your Stephen
King: In half a dozen years, the 10 "Left Behind" books together have
sold a stunning 36 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   The trade journal Publishers Weekly says its fiction rankings
won't be definite until after the holiday shopping season ends. But
John Grisham's "The Summons," about a boomer law professor's quest to
settle some unsavory family business, appears to have the edge over
both "The Remnant" and Alice Sebold's "The Lovely Bones," related by
a dead girl looking down from heaven, which caught the chill of last
summer's gruesome child-napping and murder incidents.</TE>
<TE>   "My crackpot theory is that it has a lot to do with 9/11," says
Publishers Weekly editor Nora Rawlinson. "The psyche of the country
is one that wants stories that talk about grieving and death and give
a positive spin on it."</TE>
<TE>   Which may help explain the "Left Behind" series' attraction. A
future filled with mass disappearances, cities leveled by devastating
earthquakes and oceans turned to vast seas of blood might seem
unbearably grim. But in the "end times" ideology of "The Remnant,"
worldly calamities merely herald the Messiah's imminent return.</TE>
<TE>   You can save yourself -- or enjoy the chaos. Just take a spin
through "Grand Theft Auto III," this year's bestselling home video
game, or its raunchier offspring, "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,"
released two months ago.</TE>
<TE>   Set in a cheerfully nihilistic tropical paradise (read: Miami),
circa 1985, "Vice City" features a surreal lineup of celebrity
voice-overs (Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, porn star Jenna Jameson),
brutal graphics and a strong sexual pulse. By year's end, "Vice City"
could be outselling its PlayStation progenitor.</TE>
<TE>   What's the appeal? Maybe it's the don't-call-me-guilty pleasure.
"So I just beat her and took her money," says a video game-loving
colleague of mine, demonstrating a "Vice City" sequence in which the
thuggish main character robs and kills a hooker who has just serviced
him. "Morally bankrupt!" he enthuses. "And there's no cops coming!"</TE>
<TE>   With rants and homilies</TE>
<TE>   Not all this year's chart-toppers took the path of violence, rough
sex and dark social commentary. In music, we flip-flopped between
Eminem's expletive-laced rants against "Ms. Cheney," Tipper Gore and
"white America" (on his overall No. 1 disc), and the vague spiritual
yearnings and homespun homilies of Alan Jackson's No. 1 country CD,
"Drive."</TE>
<TE>   Among the tracks that propelled "Drive" was the plaintive "Where
Were You (When the World Stopped Turning)," a post-9/11 lament in
which the singer declares himself to be "not a real political man"
who watches CNN but isn't sure if he "can tell you the difference in
Iraq and Iran."</TE>
<TE>   Did the world stop turning on Sept. 11, or did it rather seem to
be spinning out of control?</TE>
<TE>   While Eminem's defiant outbursts lately have taken on a
self-mocking tone, no such irony inhibits Kelly Clarkson, the Texas
cocktail-waitress-turned-would-be-diva after winning Fox's "American
Idol" TV talent contest. Clarkson scored this year's No. 1 single,
"Before Your Love," a plushly orchestrated piece of generic pop that
swamps Clarkson's croak.</TE>
<TE>   "How did I settle for the world in shades of gray?" she croons in
the opening verses. Ambiguity apparently isn't a good idea if you're
an ordinary Jane or Joe trying to seize the day, get ahead, be all
that you can be or (insert your own favorite mental-health mantra
here).</TE>
<TE>   "Your authentic self is there, it has always been there, and it is
fully accessible to you. You are not the exception to this fact.
There are no exceptions," writes Phil McGraw, a.k.a. Dr. Tell It Like
It Is, in "Self Matters," the pre-Christmas front-runner for No. 1
nonfiction hardcover title.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't know yourself, you can't run your own life, he
continues. Failing to express your authentic self "renders you
nothing more than the eighty-third 'sheep' from the left in Row
487,000,946!" he continues.</TE>
<TE>   Step one in correcting this failure, surely, is buying Dr. Phil's
book (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25). You are not the exception to this fact.
There are no exceptions. And pay no attention to that bleating behind
the curtain.</TE>
<TE>   Self-help no help? There was ample transformation at the movies.
Actor Tobey Maguire's transition from high school dweeb to
web-slinging marvel who saves Manhattan and gets the girl (sort of)
made "Spider-Man" Hollywood's top movie. For somewhat younger
consumers, there was the small-screen (video and DVD) saga of Harry
Potter, another class nerd magically transformed into a hero-savior.</TE>
<TE>   Even Hogwarts wizards might envy the electronic legerdemain of
LeapFrog's LeapPad Books, an interactive read-along "toy" that
educators have greeted with hallelujahs. Kids who preferred their
playtime mindless and cheap -- the LeapPad platform goes for about
$50, the books for $12 to $15 apiece -- stuck with Hot Wheels Basic
Cars, which list for less than a buck, the top toy in total units
sold. (LeapPad was first in sales dollars.)</TE>
<TE>   Our talent for crafting high-tech playthings and epic escapism
translated well beyond our borders. In Mexico "Spider-Man" beat out
"El Crimen del Padre Amaro" (The Crime of Father Amaro), a succes de
scandale about a corrupt young Roman Catholic priest. One of the few
countries to stand up to "Spider-Man" was France, which preferred its
own national super-hero, Asterix the Gaul, in "Asterix and Obelix:
Mission Cleopatra."</TE>
<TE>   Clever, these French: One minute they're moaning about
"l'imperialisme culturel americain." The next they're at the root of
another blockbuster exhibition of Impressionist painting. The show
"Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South" lured nearly 700,000
viewers to the Art Institute of Chicago, making it the year's No. 1
art show. With the French around, who needs McDonald's to feel like a
cultural colonial?</TE>
<TE>   Energetic anti-globalization move- ments didn't stop us from
making a Japanese import, Toyota Camry, the most-driven passenger car
in the country. In the CD player? Perhaps it was Andrea Bocelli, the
Tuscan Tenor, whose "Sentimento" was the year's most purchased
classical album.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond numbers</TE>
<TE>   But if consumer choice is all a numbers game, what happens when
the numbers only sow confusion, as they do in David Auburn 's
"Proof," which leads U.S. regional theaters this season with 29
scheduled productions. Like Michael Frayn's drama "Copenhagen" and
the feature film "A Beautiful Mind," "Proof" plumbs the connection
between genius and lunacy, probability and uncertainty, abstract
integers and tangible human feelings.</TE>
<TE>   Numbers, the play observes, can turn treacherous, even for
professionals. So we want more than numbers: We want proof. Proof
that our lives have meaning, proof of whodunit, proof that things may
be better in 2003. Proof that we can somehow save our selves and our
planet, short of divine intervention. Proof that the dead will be
heard from again, if only in the pages of a slim first novel or a CBS
crime serial.</TE>
<TE>   Until proof arrives, however, numbers will have to do. In the days
ahead, we'll tabulate sales figures and award appropriate honors. And
as we enter the bright new year, most of us -- all of us -- will keep
looking out for good ol' No. 1.</TE>

<LD>It's clear from Paul Morgan Fredrix's letter that the Los Angeles
Philharmonic's senior discount policies at Walt Disney Concert Hall
need to be clarified. The Philharmonic has always been most generous
to and supportive of seniors in our community. At this time, we are
the only performing arts organization at the Music Center, except the
Master Chorale, to offer seniors a discount on a subscription series
and will continue to do so at Walt Disney Concert Hall. I am very
sorry that Fredrix feels he was given incorrect information.</LD>
<LD>   I want to assure him, and all seniors who want to purchase tickets
to concerts at Walt Disney Concert Hall, that seniors can receive a
20% subscription discount in all sections of the house for the Friday
midday series, and that senior rush (and student rush) tickets for
$10 per ID, subject to availability, will be offered for all concerts
presented by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Assn.</LD>
<LD>   In response to pricing questions around our inaugural events, I
would like to remind Fredrix that prior to the opening galas, we are
offering to invited members of the community a full week of previews
called "Phil the House," which are totally free.</LD>

<LD>As Lynn Redgrave's collaborator and coach from just after "Georgy
Girl" (1967) to "Gods and Monsters" (1999), I'd like to comment that
she is, in my opinion, the best of the lot ("The Family Business,"
Dec. 15). She can have her off days, but there's an honesty about her
acting that is her signature and, in my opinion, can't be beat. I
never did figure out how she did it, but could only try to create the
right environment for her. Now I see she's left town. I wish her
well.</LD>

<LD>I was relieved to read that the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had
effectively shelved the Rem Koolhaas project. Frankly, board members
seemed more interested in showing that they and LACMA were hip and
cutting edge and, most important of all, could compete with the
Getty.</LD>
<LD>   I greatly prefer LACMA to the Getty. It is more accessible, and
its street-level orientation allows it to be an integral part of
daily life in the city. There are evenings for educators, jazz
concerts for the public, and loads of free programs for kids. Even
without the art, it is a true cultural oasis with something for
everyone. Art, of course, is at the heart of LACMA, and I would have
been devastated to miss years of traveling shows during the
construction, not to mention losing access to the permanent
collection.</LD>
<LD>   The Getty is a great place for out-of-town guests. But it has the
personality and feel of an airport or shopping mall. The corridors
and stairs and larger-than-life architecture dwarf the art they were
designed to showcase.</LD>
<TE>   LACMA won't win any architectural awards soon. But it's a very
serviceable complex. The money saved by keeping it would be far
better spent on new shows, programs and acquisitions -- to allow
LACMA to continue doing a great job, only better.</TE>

<LD>Nothing can change the simple fact that the joy which should
accompany the opening of Disney Hall has been seriously dampened by
the way that L.A. Philharmonic management has handled this price
issue. To go in one huge step from being among the more affordable
(in general manager Deborah Borda's contention) to one of the most
expensive orchestras was unwise. Surely, in retrospect, management
sees how this should have been done, if at all, over a few seasons.</LD>
<LD>   And then to have subscribers cough up for this huge increase at
holiday time (we must send in our requests by Jan. 15) and in the
middle of a huge economic downturn adds grievous injury to open
insult.</LD>
<LD>   The displeasure all this has engendered among the most loyal of
L.A. subscribers is wide and deep. Borda and her team had better
start thinking soon and well about how to address it.</LD>

<LD>Congratulations on publishing the "Star Trek" article ("Philosophy
Written in the Stars," Dec. 15) and for putting the word out there
about what we are doing here at Santa Monica College. Critical
thinking about popular culture and philosophical reflection on
television and film texts need to be a top priority in education
today.</LD>

<TE>   I went to see the latest "Star Trek" movie, "Nemesis," last night.
The plot is simple and typical: An "evil" leader is attempting to
persuade the Enterprise to join allegiance against the Alliance with
intentions to deceive all and gain total power. Of course, in the end
the good guys win.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, I started to realize that all of the actions of the "evil"
power mirrored our current administration and the U.S. military.
There it was on the silver screen -- trying to unilaterally go
against the "Alliance"; trying to placate Alliance nations with
insincere rhetoric (promises of peaceful intent); bullying smaller
countries; using power to gain access to natural resources (oil) and
gain (military presence) and, most important: continually choosing
force over peace.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, we now look like the bad guys we portray on the big screen:
the bully, the unsophisticated, the uneducated, the unlikable. The
Evil Empire.</TE>

<KH>BRIEF ENCOUNTER</KH>
<HD>Memories of a game mind</HD>
<DH>Jim Lange spent years with Chuck Barris, the game-show king
and self-proclaimed CIA assassin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Dutka</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jim Lange, who does the morning show on San Francisco's KABL-AM
(960), thinks of himself as a radio man. But to millions of
Americans, he'll forever be the host of "The Dating Game" and "The
New Newlywed Game" -- two programs created by game-show king Chuck
Barris, whose claim to have been a TV producer by day and CIA
assassin by night is a theme of "The Gong Show" host's 1984
autobiography, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind."</LD>
<LD>   Who was the "real" Barris in his prime? As "Confessions" becomes a
movie starring George Clooney (in his directorial debut), Julia
Roberts, Drew Barrymore and Sam Rockwell, Lange offers his take.</LD>
<LD>   Critics have called Barris "The King of Schlock," "The Baron of
Bad Taste," "The Godfather of Tabloid TV" -- a guy who took TV to a
new low. Is that unfair?</LD>
<TE>   Chuck was a crazy genius with a strong ego and desire to perform.
He'd walk across our set, Hitchcock-style, while we were saying
goodbye. He was also a TV pioneer, willing to try things others
wouldn't. In the mid-1960s, when "The Dating Game" came out, women
had to wait for a man to call. Having them make the choices appealed
to the female population, the target demographic. We also had the
first African American contestant, though never a "mixed" game.
Chuck's philosophy was that some people will do anything to get on TV
-- and others want to watch them. We were the first reality show,
paving the way for Howard Stern, Jerry Springer, "Big Brother."
Still, we dealt in innuendo, romance -- no swear words or off-color
stuff. I doubt Chuck would want to take credit for all the filth
that's on the air now.</TE>
<TE>   On TV, Barris' currency was humiliation. Off-camera as well?</TE>
<TE>   Though he let contestants make fools of themselves, Chuck liked
people and had a common touch. He was a caring guy who marched for
integration in Selma and was good to his employees -- down to "the
seven bandits," the lowest of the low [in the office]. Al Michaels,
the "Monday Night Football" announcer, was one. The bandits would
attend all our meetings, get company jackets and chaperon the winning
couple, traveling all over the world. You just had to be 21 years old
and make sure they didn't sleep with each other.</TE>
<TE>   While he was serving as a "Dating Game" chaperon in "fabulous
Helsinki" and "romantic West Berlin," Barris maintains, he was
actually conducting "company business" for the CIA, for whom he says
he killed 33 people.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck calls his book "an unauthorized autobiography," so he may be
taking liberties. It's all so strange. But, then, Chuck is a very
strange man -- a bit remote and fidgety, a loner with few friends.
He'd disappear for weeks, saying he was going to Europe, where his
daughter was at school. A murderer, though? Unlikely, though I can't
say it didn't happen. If he killed 33 people, he's the world's
greatest actor. All this is wonderful theater, a way of getting
recognition, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   Did you ever see the "con man" side of him depicted in the movie?</TE>
<TE>   Part of him was a gambler. Chuck had this game in which he'd cover
up his wristwatch and ask if you wanted to trade yours for his. You
didn't know if he was wearing a cheap one or a nice one -- he had
plenty of both. "Wanna trade?" he asked. Since he'd just gotten back
from Switzerland and mine was a worthless Timex, I agreed -- ending
up with a $1,000 Philippe Whatever watch.</TE>
<TE>   The movie ends with a mock TV show, "The Old Game," in which
"seniors" assess their lives. How do you think Barris would fare?</TE>
<TE>   There's a measure of contentment, I'm sure, and he certainly is
comfortable financially. When his shows went off the air, Chuck
bought the rights and resold them to local stations for syndication
-- very rare today. When we spoke six months ago, he was living in
New York's Trump Tower, spending a lot of time in southern France
playing boccie and sitting in cafes. Every so often, he'd come back
to put a show together. One, I'm told, had a group of gorgeous women
discussing world affairs -- a contrast to the pompous old men you see
on "Nightline." But, as far as I know, he hasn't worked in a while.
Unless, of course, he's a CIA agent.</TE>

<HD>China's Import Needs Make It as Much an Opportunity as a
Threat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An ancient Chinese proverb begins with the observation that "a horse
cannot gain weight if not fed with extra fodder during the night."</LD>
<LD>   In that same spirit, China's economy is putting on the pounds,
importing huge amounts of material from around the globe as it tries
to make the transition from socialism to capitalism -- all while
still being ruled by the Communist Party.</LD>
<LD>   The rise of China as an exporter is, of course, well established.
Over the last three decades, it has emerged as "the world's factory
floor," in the words of my colleagues Evelyn Iritani and Marla
Dickerson, who in October documented how China's explosion as a cheap
manufacturer is posing serious challenges to the economies of the
U.S., Mexico and other nations.</LD>
<TE>   But the flip side is that China -- with a population of 1.2
billion -- is gobbling up enormous quantities of goods produced by
other nations. Despite its image as demon exporter to the world,
China imports almost as much as it sends abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The recent news that China has become the world's largest importer
of steel underscores the point. China is, in fact, the world's
largest producer of steel, at roughly 175 million tons a year. And
yet it is importing 25 million tons annually to meet its
ever-expanding needs.</TE>
<TE>   "You should see all the building of highways and railroads, dams
and bridges in western China," says Richard Baum, a China scholar and
professor of political science at UCLA who traveled to the remote
reaches of the country this year.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line is that, with economies slow in Europe, Japan and
the U.S., China's headlong pace holds considerable promise for the
world.</TE>
<TE>   "China is the big story in the global economy in 2003 and in 2004
and in 2005," says Donald Straszheim, a Santa Monica- based economist
who advises institutional investors.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Straszheim believes that China's development in this
decade will be more significant for the world economy than even
Japan's meteoric rise after World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Not that China's path to capitalism is going to be smooth. Even
economists who foresee great growth in China's future worry about
"fault lines," says Charles Wolf of Rand Corp., the Santa Monica
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Wolf works with researchers from China and the U.S. in a
high-level study group that meets annually in Beijing or at Rand
headquarters here to work out solutions to looming problems for
China. Among them: energy, water, AIDS and the changing demands of
foreign investors, who last year poured more than $50 billion into
China's burgeoning economy.</TE>
<TE>   Another big question mark is how China will work out an estimated
$500 billion in bad loans at state-owned banks, remnants of an
earlier era.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, growing anger and impatience in Washington over the
U.S. trade deficit with China -- quickly approaching $100 billion --
could lead to demands that Beijing raise the value of its currency,
thereby reducing the country's exports and undermining its
development.</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite all this, the U.S. economy has as much to gain from
China's long march ahead as it does to lose.</TE>
<TE>   China, for example, surprised experts this year with surging car
sales. Philip Murtaugh, chairman of General Motors Corp.' s China
Group, estimates that 3.4 million autos have been sold in the
country, up 54% from 2001.</TE>
<TE>   GM, with partner Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corp., is
investing more than $100 million to acquire a fourth auto plant and
boost its production in China beyond the current 100,000 cars a year.
GM also sees business opening up in China for its finance arm, GMAC.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, China is becoming a huge market for legal,
financial and technical services.</TE>
<TE>   Morrison &amp; Foerster, a major California law firm, has just won the
contract to be the international legal counsel for the Beijing
Olympic Games in 2008. That means the firm will enjoy six years of
work negotiating sponsorships and contracts with suppliers and
international media, says Kelly Crabb, one of the Morrison &amp; Foerster
partners in charge of the assignment.</TE>
<TE>   When looking at China, a particularly important point to
understand is that, official Communist dogma aside, it is an
entrepreneurial economy. And that presents tremendous prospects for
another entrepreneurial economy: that of California.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Liang Lu, a UC Berkeley-educated American businessman, found
that out during visits to China in the last decade. He noticed that
monthly charges made cellular telephones expensive to use.</TE>
<TE>   Lu returned to Alameda, Calif., and with an investment from
entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Japan, founded UTStarcom Inc., which
makes limited-range "urban" cellular phones on which rates are much
less expensive. The result: a product with instant appeal to the
Chinese. The company's sales have rocketed to $960 million this year
from $187 million two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Another California firm, Lightconnect Inc. of Newark, has just won
a multiyear order from China's ZTE Telecommunications for a key
component of fiber-optic Internet networks.</TE>
<TE>   "Our business was down here," says Peter Clark, Lightconnect's
president, "so we went to China and presented to as many firms as we
could. It was marketing 101." The order should mean several million
dollars in revenue for Lightconnect, which has seen its annual sales
fall to $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Thuris Corp., an Irvine-based biomedical company that makes
diagnostic tests for symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, has entered a
collaboration with China's National Center for Drug Screening. Thuris
will test prospective remedies for Alzheimer's and share in
development of promising compounds.</TE>
<TE>   And this is merely the beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Andy Xie of Morgan Stanley points out that China's
industrial development so far has largely involved only the eastern
provinces, home to 338 million people. That's a bigger population
than that of the United States, but only one-fourth of China's total.</TE>
<TE>   During this decade, development will focus on the middle and upper
Yangtze River regions, where an additional 300 million people live.
"That will bring half of China's population into the global economy,"
Xie says.</TE>
<TE>   At present, China's economy has an annual output of goods and
services of about $1 trillion, making it roughly comparable to that
of California, which has only 34 million people.</TE>
<TE>   The inarguable fact is that what the world is witnessing in China
is not mere economics, but history -- and opportunity.</TE>

<HD>K2 Chief Racing to Consolidate</HD>
<DH>Richard Heckmann says this is the right time to create a
sporting goods giant and he's the right executive to do it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Heckmann has no problem leaving others behind.</LD>
<LD>   Once on an East Coast business trip, the then-chairman of USFilter
wanted to hurry back to California to make his son's baseball game.
When the water company's executives gathered at the airport for the
flight home, one manager was missing. Heckmann ordered the private
aircraft to take off without him.</LD>
<LD>   "He has left more than one division president behind for being
five or even just two minutes late," said Andrew Seidel, a key member
of Heckmann's team at Palm Desert-based USFilter and now the chief
executive.</LD>
<TE>   But it's not only on the tarmac where Heckmann waits for no one.
The 59-year-old moves equally fast in the business world.</TE>
<TE>   In less than a decade at USFilter, he completed 260 acquisitions,
turning the company from a tiny player with $17 million in sales into
a $5.5-billion industry leader by the time it was sold in 1999 to
French utility Vivendi for $6.2 billion. He walked away with more
than $120 million.</TE>
<TE>   Now, as chairman and chief executive of K2 Inc., a Los
Angeles-based sporting goods manufacturer, Heckmann wants to leave
the rest of the industry behind by gobbling up scores of smaller
companies to create a giant.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann's first move came Monday when he signed an $84-million
deal to acquire Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc., the 115-year-old
company that invented football shoulder pads and now supplies more
than half of the baseball players in the major leagues with their
fielding gloves.</TE>
<TE>   If the deal is completed despite the objections of Rawlings'
largest shareholder, baseball equipment will join Shakespeare fishing
rods, Olin skis, Ride &amp; Morrow snowboards and Tony Hawk skateboard
shoes on K2's product roster.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to lead the consolidation in the sporting goods
industry," Heckmann declared.</TE>
<TE>   His ambition is no less than turning K2, which reported a
$7.7-million loss on $595 million in sales last year, into a
profitable Fortune 500 company.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching Fortune 500 status "was the goal at USFilter from the
first day," Heckmann said. "It took us seven years to do it."</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't always the goal of K2, whose roots go back to a
post-World War II pool-contracting business in suburban Los Angeles.
For years the company was content to grow slowly, gradually expanding
its product offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann joined the board as a peacekeeper in 1997 when K2 was
beset by infighting and litigation. He also brought several board
members from USFilter, including UCLA business professor Alfred
Osborne Jr. and former Vice President Dan Quayle, and became chairman
in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann grew impatient with the pace of the company's growth. He
saw the sporting goods industry as fragmented and ripe for a roll-up
in just the same way that water filtration was splintered when
Heckmann and a group of investors took over USFilter.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Heckmann led a coup against Chief Executive Richard
Rodstein, forcing his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the sporting goods landscape and asked why aren't we
the company out there doing the consolidation," Heckmann said. "But
it takes a different type of executive to go out and consolidate an
industry than what we had."</TE>
<TE>   Rodstein did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to Heckmann's sense of urgency was the slumping stock
market and slowing economy. "We want to be doing this at the bottom
of the market rather than at the top," he said. "We didn't have any
time to waste."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fast Off the Mark</TE>
<TE>   Colleagues say Heckmann will get K2 moving quickly -- both
literally and figuratively. He plans to move the corporate
headquarters in March from an industrial section of Los Angeles to
Carlsbad. It will be nearer to his home in Del Mar, as well as to
other sporting goods manufacturers, making it easier for K2 to
recruit executive talent.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly his strength is at crafting a vision and communicating it
in a way that most people can gravitate to," Seidel said.</TE>
<TE>   But at the same time, "he could go pretty ballistic at times,"
Seidel recalled. "It was something that you got used to. He is
certainly an acquired taste for some people."</TE>
<TE>   As Seidel discovered during USFilter's merger binge, those who
didn't acquire the taste often found themselves in Heckmann's sights.</TE>
<TE>   "He has this wonderful theory," said Seidel, "that he calls 'shoot
the lead elephant.' When you do these acquisitions you have to decide
very quickly whether the management team is on your side or not.</TE>
<TE>   "We had situations where the managers of the company we had
acquired thought it was the reverse. I saw him shoot the lead
elephant a number of times."</TE>
<TE>   As Heckmann returns to the corporate jungle after a two-year
hiatus he is confronting a different place, especially when it comes
to the type of all-stock transaction that worked so well for
USFilter. "That was the '90s," Seidel noted, "when you had a lot of
room for error because equity prices were so high. But this is a
different environment now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Heckmann is convinced that snapping up a series of smaller
rivals and building a behemoth is the way to go. "If you are going to
deal with big retailers, they want scale," he said. "They want you to
advertise, they want help with their aisles, they want you to help
them sell more products."</TE>
<TE>   He also believes that scale in overseas manufacturing and
outsourcing will be a key advantage in the decidedly low-technology
business of making sporting goods.</TE>
<TE>   K2 has shifted all of its domestic production to 1 million square
feet of factory space in a Guangzhou, China, complex that includes
dormitories and food service for 6,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to look for companies that are either too small or too
slow to understand the advantage that comes with setting up
manufacturing offshore," Heckmann said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Synergy</TE>
<TE>   Finally, K2 won't consider an acquisition unless it sees a clear
advantage from shared manufacturing or shared distribution.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a team going to a retailer selling fishing rods, why
can't you also sell them basketballs or baseball bats?" Heckmann
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even before the Rawlings merger is closed, competitors are
challenging Heckmann's strategy.</TE>
<TE>   "You can become a jack of all trades and a master of none," said
Tony Palma, chief executive of Van Nuys-based Easton Sports, which is
a top brand in baseball and hockey equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Although Palma credits Heckmann with "a fabulous job of rolling up
the water filtration business," he questions whether the sane
techniques will work with balls, bats, skis and fishing gear.</TE>
<TE>   "Water is a homogeneous product; sporting goods is not," Palma
said. "There is no synergy between snow skis and baseball gloves.
Every sporting goods category is a separate and distinct business
with its own unique selling approach."</TE>
<TE>   Jesse Heald, chairman of Worth Inc. a Tullahoma, Tenn.-based maker
of baseball and lacrosse equipment, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Different sports have significantly different dynamics to them,"
Heald said. "That is why the industry is made up of a bunch of
smaller companies, each with their own technology, their own market
and their own sales expertise."</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann also will face a most formidable challenger: the
ever-more sedentary American.</TE>
<TE>   The sports equipment market is growing slowly at best, according
to SGMA International, the industry's trade association. Sales of
baseball equipment have not risen since 2000. Basketball sales are up
only slightly from two years ago. Football sales haven't budged since
1994, and volleyball sales have plunged 18% over the last eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of all sporting goods -- from bats and balls to running
shoes and fitness equipment -- fell 2% last year to $47.7 billion,
SGMA said.</TE>
<TE>   That compares with a 21% gain in the consumer electronics market
and a similar jump in box-office revenue for the nation's top 50
movies last year, Gregg Hartley, an SGMA vice president, pointed out
this year in a trade report.</TE>
<TE>   "Our real competitors are any companies that vie for leisure time
and entertainment dollars of American consumers," Hartley said.</TE>
<TE>   "People aren't turning to sports for fun the way they did a
generation ago," Hartley added, noting that television network
viewership of professional baseball, basketball and football has
declined during the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann acknowledges that the industry faces difficult economic
challenges, but says that to delay would risk K2 being left on the
tarmac.</TE>
<TE>   "The fun part is figuring out how to grow the business," Heckmann
said. "When K2 hits the Fortune 500, I hit the road."</TE>

<HD>Tenet Conference Honored Success</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Tenet's Aggressive Corporate Culture Fed Crisis, Insiders Say"
(Dec. 12), you described our national service excellence conference
in Las Vegas in February as an "extravaganza." But conspicuously
absent was any mention of why we held the conference, who attended
and what we were celebrating.</LD>
<LD>   Tenet hospitals have a lot of progress to celebrate these days. As
measured by extensive surveys, the satisfaction with our service is
up significantly among our patients, physicians and employees. In the
last two years, almost half our hospitals have achieved four- or
five-star status for patient satisfaction. This is a new, higher
standard that counts only those patients who rate themselves "very
satisfied" with their experience at a Tenet hospital.</LD>
<LD>   In addition, we have made significant progress in improving the
satisfaction of our employees and making Tenet hospitals the
preferred places to work in health care. The annual turnover rate for
nurses at our facilities has gone from 27% three years ago to less
than 21% today. In an industry that's experiencing a severe and
worsening shortage of nurses, that's impressive.</LD>
<TE>   The service excellence conference was a chance for 1,200 hospital
employees from 113 hospitals across the country to come together to
share their success stories and help their colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   While all the attention is paid these days to Tenet's billing
practices and supposedly "aggressive corporate culture," we're proud
to celebrate the very real accomplishments of our 114,000 employees
who, day after day, make sure every patient in our hospitals gets
great care and service.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Tenet Healthcare's gouging of Medicare and other insurance
constitutes more than "overpricing," it constitutes fraud.</LD>
<LD>   A year ago I had cataract surgery performed in one of Tenet's
hospitals, and when I asked for a statement I was shocked. I had two
eye drops delivered before surgery, and the pharmacy bill was
$2,223.90. I was awake at all times. They charged $134.90 for oxygen,
which I never had. For a period of 15 minutes in the operating room,
they charged $3,859.</LD>
<LD>   I feel that the executives at Tenet should be accountable for
their actions just as much as the top honchos at Enron and WorldCom.</LD>
<TE>   Charging insurers fraudulently for goods and services not
delivered is just as bad as deceptive accounting procedures.</TE>
<TE>   It's time that those responsible at Tenet are taken to task.</TE>

<TE>   "Tenet Shifting Its Formula for Reimbursement" (Nov. 29) says
hospitals raise retail charges to maximize stop-loss payments from
insurers, but the "increases hospitals get pale in comparison to what
insurers are getting from employers in premiums."</TE>
<TE>   And the insurers probably are complaining that they need higher
premiums to keep their investors happy.</TE>
<TE>   This is a game called "gotcha" -- and we, the people, are "it."</TE>

<HD>Getting Deep-Fried in the Burger Wars</HD>
<DH>McDonald's sales slow, profits fall as price cuts wreak
havoc on a saturated market. Can management reverse the slide?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After McDonald's Corp. disclosed more dismal news last week, Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. analyst Peter Oakes sent a note to clients saying that
when the fast-food giant's new top managers take over Jan. 1, he
expects them to announce that "everything is on the table."</LD>
<LD>   There was definitely no pun intended.</LD>
<LD>   Something has to change at the world's biggest restaurant chain.
McDonald's sales are flat, its profits are falling, its market is
saturated with rivals, and its stock -- a component of the Dow Jones
industrial average -- has plummeted to a seven-year low.</LD>
<TE>   McDonald's executive suite is in turmoil for the second time in
four years. Critics say its service is slowing and its food still too
fatty. McDonald's "dollar menu" has sparked a price war with
competitors that's eroding nearly everyone's earnings.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's said last week that, because of restructuring charges,
it expects a loss for the current quarter -- its first since the Oak
Brook, Ill.-based concern became publicly held 37 years ago. The
stock closed Friday at $15.75 a share, up 11 cents for the day, on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's is facing one of its toughest periods since Maurice and
Richard McDonald opened their first 15-cent-hamburger outlet at a San
Bernardino intersection 54 years ago this month. A few years later,
Ray Kroc, who supplied milkshake mixers to McDonald's, persuaded the
brothers to let him expand their fast-food concept across the
country. The rest is history, but the expansion that made McDonald's
an American icon is now a major burden. Having swelled to 30,780
restaurants in 120 countries, McDonald's is a lumbering behemoth
struggling to add to its annual systemwide sales (in both
company-owned and franchised stores) totaling $41 billion.</TE>
<TE>   It's a problem that's festered for several years. Despite
McDonald's rapid expansion and Americans' mass-migration from their
kitchens to fast-food restaurants, the company's performance keeps
sagging. In recent years, it has added items to its familiar menu of
Big Macs and Happy Meals, overhauled its food-preparation techniques
at great expense and slashed prices. Little has worked.</TE>
<TE>   Profit has dropped in seven of the last eight quarters. The only
reason sales are growing -- and barely at that -- is because of
McDonald's relentless opening of new stores. In the nine months ended
Sept. 30, sales at its U.S. restaurants open at least a year -- a key
gauge of retail growth -- fell 1.6% compared with the same period in
2001. Global same-store sales were off 2.1%.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's said last week that same-store sales still are falling,
down 1.3% in October and November. The company also said it would
take a $390-million charge to cover its plans for closing up to 175
restaurants, cutting as many as 600 corporate jobs and other
restructuring steps. That will produce the net loss for the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, McDonald's is still a profitable business excluding
that charge, and could earn more than $1 billion this year. But
that's down from a $2-billion profit in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What Next?</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts, franchisees and customers are divided over what
McDonald's should do first -- scuttle its cheap prices, improve the
taste of its existing fare, expand the menu further or improve the
quality and speed of its service.</TE>
<TE>   "In some cases I think the service has slipped," Kathy Belden of
Glendale said last week while eating at a McDonald's in Downey. The
restaurant, one of about 1,100 McDonald's in California, is the
oldest surviving outlet in the chain.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Tripplett, who owns seven McDonald's in the San Francisco
Bay Area and chairs the National Black McDonald's Operators Assn.,
said he hopes the price-cutting ends. "There's no profit in selling a
huge sandwich for a dollar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's last week said that its new chief executive, Jim
Cantalupo, a former CEO of McDonald's International who came out of
retirement, "is aggressively reviewing all aspects of the business"
and will comment further next month.</TE>
<TE>   The company declined to elaborate on its plans until then.</TE>
<TE>   But Cantalupo's task is further complicated because the whole
fast-food industry has gone stale. The $115-billion U.S. market will
grow an average of only 2% in dollar terms for the foreseeable
future, said David Rose, an analyst at JMP Securities in San
Francisco. That means that if anyone gains market share, they'll have
to take it from someone else.</TE>
<TE>   With its dollar menu, McDonald's sparked an "unprecedented" price
war that's wreaking havoc in the industry, Robert Nugent, chairman of
Jack in the Box Inc., said Thursday. The San Diego-based chain
slashed its profit estimates for next year, and said its same-store
sales for its fiscal first quarter ending Jan. 19 will drop more than
expected, by 2.7%. Jack in the Box's stock then plunged 20%.</TE>
<TE>   CKE Restaurants Inc., the Santa Barbara-based parent of the Carl's
Jr. chain, also blamed the price wars for a 5% drop in same-store
sales for its fiscal third quarter ended Nov. 4. Wendy's
International Inc. this month scaled back its earnings outlook,
though it has been gaining market share from McDonald's and others.</TE>
<TE>   Burger King, the No. 2 burger chain behind McDonald's, was sold by
parent Diageo a few days ago to a private investment group -- only
after the acquisition price was cut by more than a third, to $1.5
billion. The chain's value tumbled in part because relentless
fast-food discounting has eroded its profit margins.</TE>
<TE>   With the market growing slowly, the big chains are having to
wrestle for market share not only with each other, but with a growing
list of smaller competitors that trumpet their meals as fresher and
healthier, such as Quizno's and Panera Bread.</TE>
<TE>   Another California-based company, In-N-Out Burgers of Irvine, is
by most accounts still thriving. But In-N-Out is an anomaly in the
world of McDonald's and Burger King. It has only about 150 locations,
no franchisees and is family owned.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Management Shuffle</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's mounting woes prompted a shuffling of top management
this month. Jack Greenberg, the company's chief executive since 1998,
abruptly stepped down after making such changes as adding new menu
items and overhauling McDonald's kitchens to cook food to order.</TE>
<TE>   But his effort couldn't stop the company's slide. To succeed
Greenberg, McDonald's tapped the 59-year-old Cantalupo. It also named
Charlie Bell, president of McDonald's Europe, as president and chief
operating officer of the whole company. Bell, 42, has vast overseas
experience with McDonald's and is thought by many to be the heir
apparent for the CEO's job.</TE>
<TE>   Just how much change they bring remains to be seen. But one
problem they'll have to address quickly is McDonald's reputation
among consumers, noted marketing professor Claes Fornell at the
University of Michigan. His school publishes the American Customer
Satisfaction Index, a public-opinion survey, and McDonald's has
finished last among its peers every year since the poll began in
1994.</TE>

<HD>Widow Can Use Husband's Social Security Number</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: My 86-year-old mother-in-law has been using her deceased
husband's Social Security number since he died in 1978. She has
several certificates of deposit at a local bank as well as savings
accounts and a checking account. She has not filed taxes for the last
10 years or so based on advice from a tax advisor at her senior
center. In addition, her Medicare number, and I'm sure all her
doctors, have the wrong Social Security number. Where do we start to
try to correct this, or do we even need to do anything? I tried
e-mailing the Social Security Administration last week, but have not
heard from them. Can you point us in the right direction?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Lowell Kepke, deputy public affairs director at the Social
Security Administration, first wanted to apologize that the agency
didn't respond promptly to your e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Next, he wanted to assure you that your mom actually may be using
the right number for Social Security and Medicare purposes.</LD>
<TE>   If your mom became entitled to benefits as a widow on her
husband's record -- which is pretty common, given that women of her
generation often didn't have enough earnings to qualify for benefits
on their own -- then she would rightly use her husband's number, with
the letter "D" after it, as her Social Security claim number and her
Medicare number.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if she's receiving widow's benefits, there's
nothing she needs to do. If she's not receiving widow's benefits,
Kepke said, call the Social Security Administration at (800) 772-1213
to straighten this out. Social Security can issue a new Medicare card
if the number she's using is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   If she's using her late husband's number for those financial
accounts, then she probably should switch it to her own.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Late Payments Hurt Co-Signer's Credit Score</TE>
<TE>   Q: I am the co-signer of some student loans for my son. He has
made some late payments but I have never been notified or asked to
make a payment. Thus I was surprised to see the lender, Sallie Mae,
dinging me on a recent credit report. Is this right? How long will
that stay on my record? Anything I can do?</TE>
<TE>   A: You have a few options, which you probably won't like.</TE>
<TE>   First, though, the question must be asked: What did you think you
were doing when you co-signed the loans? Normally when you're asked
to co-sign it's because the borrower can't qualify for credit on his
own. That means the lender is looking to you to make good if the
borrower flakes. It's pretty much up to you to keep track of the
other borrower when you co-sign a loan because, as you've seen, you
suffer the consequences when he fails to pay.</TE>
<TE>   Late payments are among the kinds of negative items that can stay
on your credit report for up to seven years. The further behind he
gets, the worse the effect on your credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   So, on to your options. If this is a Sallie Mae Signature Loan,
your son could apply to have you removed as a co-signer -- but only
after he makes 24 on-time monthly payments, and only if his credit is
decent when he makes the application. You also could ask him to
consolidate or refinance the loans, which would remove you as a
co-signer -- but again, he'd need to get current and have good
credit.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, you're long overdue for a parent-son talk about the
importance of paying bills on time and maintaining good credit. If
worse comes to worst, you may need to take over the payments just to
protect your credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tapping Home Equity Can Be Serious Mistake</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm a single mom with four kids, $13,000 in credit card debt
and a car that's on its last legs. I owe about $75,000 on a home
that's worth about $100,000. I figured if I borrowed against the
equity in my home, or even got one of those loans for 125% of my home
equity, I could pay off the credit card debt, buy a $10,000 car and
put some money in savings, because we have none. My credit score is
excellent. Any advice you have would be appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   A: Here it is: Don't do it.</TE>
<TE>   Tapping all your home equity is a serious mistake. You'll leave
yourself with no financial cushion for an emergency. If home prices
decline, you could find yourself trapped with loans that exceed the
value of your house. If you had to sell, you either would have to pay
the difference to the bank or wind up with a trashed credit rating.</TE>
<TE>   Any time you borrow more than 80% of your home equity, you'll
typically face higher interest rates and fees as well.</TE>
<TE>   If borrowing 100% of your equity is bad, then you can see how
those 125% loans are even worse. You're not allowed to deduct
interest on the amount of a home loan that exceeds the value of your
house, and the rates on 125% loans tend to be outrageous.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, borrowing money to put in savings is a tad ridiculous.
You'll be paying much higher rates on the money than you could ever
earn in a savings or money market account.</TE>
<TE>   What you really need to do is stop using credit cards and start
living within your means.</TE>

<HD>IRAs Can Be Tapped to Help Pay Taxes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Drastic times sometimes call for drastic measures.</LD>
<LD>   Americans who realize that they've substantially underpaid their
2002 income tax -- usually because they had a major life change such
as a job loss, marriage or divorce during the year that threw off
their tax planning -- may want to do the unthinkable: Tap their
individual retirement accounts.</LD>
<LD>   Taking money out of an IRA before retirement usually generates
painful state and federal taxes and penalties that can eat up half of
the account's value. But in the right circumstances, an IRA can be
used to pay taxes, rather than trigger them.</LD>
<TE>   "This isn't something that the average person on the street would
know about," said Martin Nissenbaum, tax partner with national
accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young in New York.</TE>
<TE>   There are two little-known strategies that use a traditional IRA
or a Roth IRA to either reduce a tax bill or pay it with IRA
"withholding."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   IRA Distribution</TE>
<TE>   The first is a timing move that's aimed at eliminating interest
penalties for those who substantially underpay their taxes.</TE>
<TE>   The government requires individuals to pay income taxes throughout
the year, either through payroll withholding or quarterly estimated
payments. If those payments prove insufficient -- and the taxpayer
doesn't fall under certain "safe harbor" exceptions -- the IRS
assesses an interest penalty on the underpaid amount. The current
annual interest penalty is 6%.</TE>
<TE>   Because the payments are supposed to be made in installments
throughout the year, it's too late to send the IRS a check to make up
the shortfall. However, tax payments that are made through
withholding -- as opposed to just sending in a check -- are
considered to have been paid evenly throughout the year, even when
they're not, Nissenbaum noted.</TE>
<TE>   To create enough last-minute withholding to cover a big
underpayment, a taxpayer can request a distribution from an IRA.
Instead of having the check sent to the account holder, Nissenbaum
said, the money can be withheld and sent directly to the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   Custodians typically withhold 20% of IRA rollover distributions
for tax purposes when the account holder is taking the payment
personally. To have more than 20% withheld, all the taxpayer needs to
do is ask, Nissenbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   A taxpayer who had underpaid taxes by $10,000 could avoid $375 in
underpayment penalties by using this strategy. (Although the interest
penalty is 6%, the penalty is levied on just the underpaid amount,
which rises to the full $10,000 by the end of the year.)</TE>
<TE>   The catch: The taxpayer must put the exact amount of the
distribution back into the same IRA or into another IRA within 60
days to qualify for nontaxable IRA "rollover" treatment. After the
60-day deadline, the $10,000 is considered a taxable distribution,
triggering heavy penalties.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a taxpayer in the 30% federal bracket would pay
$4,000 in federal taxes and penalties -- 30% of the amount in tax and
10% in penalties. In California, state taxes and penalties would add
more than $1,000 to the bill. All told, this taxpayer would lose half
of the IRA's proceeds to penalties and taxes -- just to save $375 in
underpayment penalties.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to do this with an IRA, you have to make sure
that the custodian understands what you are trying to do and that you
get the money back in an IRA within 60 days," Nissenbaum said. "That
is absolutely critical."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking a Loss</TE>
<TE>   The other strategy for using an IRA to pay taxes requires a Roth
with money-losing investments -- not uncommon in today's market.</TE>
<TE>   Roth IRAs do not offer upfront deductions, but allow tax-free
withdrawals at retirement. Taxpayers who meet certain income
restrictions can contribute as much as $3,000 annually to the
accounts. Like traditional IRAs, investment income earned within
these accounts is tax-deferred. And losses suffered within the
accounts are not tax deductible.</TE>
<TE>   But if a Roth account is closed -- all of the principal is taken
out -- the account holder can write off any lost principal as a
miscellaneous itemized deduction, said Ed Slott, a New York tax
accountant.</TE>
<TE>   The caveat: Miscellaneous itemized deductions can be used only
once they exceed 2% of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. In
addition, they're a so-called preference item under the alternative
minimum tax system, which means taxpayers should do a careful
projection before closing the IRA to make sure they'll be able to use
the deduction, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the worst case, you could be out the IRA and unable to use the
deduction," Slott said.</TE>
<TE>   Complete instructions on how to recognize a loss on an IRA
investment are included in IRS publication 590, Slott said. The
publication can be downloaded from the IRS Web site at www.irs.gov.</TE>

<HD>Broker Deal May Leave Investors Wondering</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the second time in five years, the nation's biggest brokerages
have agreed to shell out $1 billion of their shareholders' capital to
extricate themselves from a major scandal.</LD>
<LD>   If this happened in another industry it would seem highly likely
that shareholders would raise a stink, wondering what kind of
managers were running these companies.</LD>
<LD>   But this is Wall Street, where the profits from conduct legal and
otherwise have been more than adequate to handle the periodic
mega-fine.</LD>
<TE>   In 1996 and 1997, it cost more than two dozen big brokerages and
their self-regulatory organization a total of $1 billion to settle
government and investor charges that they had long rigged Nasdaq
stock trading for their benefit.</TE>
<TE>   This time, the industry is accused of a much more elaborate scheme
in which the firms took advantage of an entire nation's fascination
with, and faith in, the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, federal and state regulators announced a deal to end
their probes of brokerage misconduct during the late 1990s bull
market in return for $1.4 billion in fines and other payments and the
industry's acceptance of potentially far-reaching reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Brokerage practices that regulators say were widespread at the
height of the bull market -- for example, attempts by fee-driven
investment bankers to bias the stock ratings of supposedly objective
research analysts at their firms -- will now be explicitly forbidden.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for "spinning," the term for brokerages' awards of
shares of hot initial public stock offerings to corporate executives
who just might, in turn, award lucrative investment banking business
to their benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   The government, led by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer and the
Securities and Exchange Commission, is making it clear that such
blatant conflicts of interest are intolerable in the securities
industry.</TE>
<TE>   More to the point, regulators are forcing the industry to step
back in time, to re-establish internal walls that were set up long
ago to guard against bribery and self-dealing in a business where
such risks are always extreme.</TE>
<TE>   Those walls crumbled at many brokerages in the 1990s, regulators'
evidence shows. They must be rebuilt, Spitzer said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "What used to be a conflict of interest is still a conflict of
interest," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a weary, and substantially poorer, public may be forgiven for
asking why practices that now seem so obviously wrong appeared to
attract so little government scrutiny during the bull market.</TE>
<TE>   One answer to that question doesn't make anyone happy, even though
it rings true: In a wildly speculative market where far more players
are profiting than are losing money, regulators have little incentive
to end the party.</TE>
<TE>   The public may not have known how much it was being cheated by
brokerage practices in the late 1990s, but millions of small
investors probably wouldn't have cared anyway, because their
portfolios still were ballooning as the market soared.</TE>
<TE>   The media also could be blamed for failing to raise enough red
flags about brokerage practices that, at a minimum, smelled bad.</TE>
<TE>   But the media doesn't have subpoena power, can't call grand juries
and isn't directly responsible for enforcing the nation's securities
laws.</TE>
<TE>   Was the SEC asleep at the switch? The agency has defended itself
by noting that it undertook a host of investor-protection initiatives
in the 1990s under former Chairman Arthur Levitt.</TE>
<TE>   David Ruder, who served as SEC chairman from 1987 to 1989 and now
is a professor at Northwestern University in Chicago, notes that
Levitt championed such issues as auditor independence in corporate
accounting and fair handling of small investors' online stock orders
by Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how much the commission knew or should have known
about pressures being put on analysts by the investment banking
side," Ruder said.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he said, "They certainly knew about the practice of
analysts never having a 'sell' recommendation" on the stocks they
covered.</TE>
<TE>   But Wall Street had a ready answer about analysts' unwavering
bullishness during the market's advance: The research wasn't flawed
-- it was reflecting the economy's new era of unlimited growth
potential. Who could measure the true magic of the Internet in terms
of what it would mean for the economy, the argument went. And it
sounded convincing enough to plenty of investors at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Once the business cycle reasserted itself in 2000 and 2001, and
money-losing technology companies began to careen toward insolvency,
the incessant "buy" recommendations from major brokerages finally
began to ring a bell with regulators.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the damage to many investors' portfolios was already
severe. It got worse by April when Spitzer released internal Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. e-mails showing that some of its analysts privately
disparaged Internet stocks while advising the public to continue
buying them.</TE>
<TE>   Merrill set the scene for what was to come by agreeing to pay a
$100-million fine. That became a basis for the fines that nine of
Merrill's rivals have agreed to pay to settle regulators' allegations
that they too engaged in deceitful practices aimed at keeping
fee-generating company clients and executives happy, at the average
investors' expense.</TE>
<TE>   As with Merrill, the rest of the industry isn't admitting or
denying that it did anything wrong. Nor will executives of the major
brokerages face removal.</TE>
<TE>   "This deal is going to save a lot of people from being thrown out
of the securities industry, which is what should happen," argues
Irving Einhorn, a lawyer and former SEC regional administrator in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Those concessions by regulators may puzzle or anger small
investors. If the scope of the alleged fraud perpetrated was so vast
as to merit a $1-billion-plus settlement, shouldn't some senior
executives go to jail, or at least be barred from the securities
industry?</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer, however, has made clear he isn't interested in destroying
the brokerage industry in order to save it. Just as some commercial
banks clearly are too big to fail because of the effect that could
have on the economy, the potential financial ruin of every major
brokerage could have dangerous implications for the financial system.</TE>
<TE>   If brokerage managements aren't going to be reshuffled because of
this scandal, and the fines the industry is paying are a relative
fraction of what the business can earn at its peak ($16.2 billion in
2000, according to the Securities Industry Assn.), then why should
investors believe that the firms will be serious about reform?</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street critics say the best hope lies in the structural
changes regulators are forcing on brokerages. For example, by
demanding that the firms make it more difficult for investment
bankers to interact with analysts, the opportunity to compromise
analysts' stock recommendations should be reduced, though certainly
not eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, if brokerages are forced to supply their investors with
stock reports from outside research firms, those investors may at
least have an opportunity to see opinions that can put their own
brokerage's views in better perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Even if all of this makes Wall Street a fairer place for investors
in the near term, the industry has shown again and again that the
potential for abuse is ever present -- a byproduct of capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, the only protection is aggressive government
oversight, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be an ongoing fear of prosecution," said Scott
Cleland, head of Precursor Group, an independent stock research firm
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Key Points of Agreement</TE>
<TE>   Highlights of the agreement between federal and state regulators
and 10 major brokerages:</TE>
<TE>   * The firms must insulate research analysts from investment
banking pressure that could taint their stock recommendations. They
must sever any links between research and banking, including the
tying of analyst compensation to banking transactions. Analysts no
longer will be permitted to accompany bankers on investor "roadshows"
for securities the firms are underwriting or on trips to pitch
brokerage work to clients or potential clients.</TE>
<TE>   * For five years, each of the brokerages will be required to
contract with at least three independent research firms to provide
stock reports to their investors, in addition to in-house research.
For each firm, regulators will name an independent monitor with final
authority to procure independent research.</TE>
<TE>   * Each firm will make publicly available its stock ratings and
price target forecasts for individual shares to allow for evaluation
and comparison of analysts' performance.</TE>
<TE>   * The practice of "spinning" of initial public offering shares
will be banned: Brokerages no longer can allocate IPO shares to
corporate executives and directors who are in the position to greatly

<LD>Regulators, Wall Street Firms Reach Settlement</LD>
<LD>   In a deal designed to restore investors' trust in Wall Street, the
nation's biggest brokerage firms will pay $1.44 billion to resolve
charges that they gave biased stock ratings, and pledged to
restructure the way they do business.</LD>
<LD>   But it is unclear how much the settlement -- one of the largest
ever won by regulators -- will do to compensate investors for losses
punish individual executives and analysts, and bring closure to a
year of market scandals.</LD>
<TE>   The firms allegedly misled investors by inflating stock ratings to
help their firms win investment banking business.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement negotiated by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer,
the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators calls for
10 firms, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First
Boston, to pay millions in fines, sever the links between research
and investment banking, and fund independent stock research for
investors that would complement their own analysts' work.</TE>
<TE>   In agreeing to the fines, the firms would neither admit nor deny
charges that they had misled investors.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Jack Grubman, the beleaguered former telecommunications
analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, settled with regulators for $15
million and a lifetime ban from the securities industry.</TE>

<TE>   Boeing's Spy Satellites Face Overruns, Delays</TE>
<TE>   A new generation of spy satellites being developed by Boeing Co.
is under intense scrutiny from Congress, which has raised concerns
that the supersecret program faces significant cost overruns and
delays, according to Capitol Hill sources.</TE>
<TE>   The potential problems with the nation's largest intelligence
project, most of it under development at Boeing facilities in Seal
Beach and El Segundo, could lead Congress to call for a major
restructuring of the effort, a source familiar with the discussions
said. The project's cost has been estimated at more than $25 billion
over the next two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the overruns, which could hit $600 million to $900 million
in 2003 alone, are unlikely to force Congress to cancel the program
or to seek another contractor to handle the work, a congressional
source said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Boeing beat out Lockheed Martin Co. to develop the spy
satellites. . The project, known as Future Imagery Architecture,
calls for creating a constellation of satellites equipped with
powerful telescopes and radar to gather clear and frequent images of
enemy troops in darkness or through cloud cover.</TE>

<TE>   EPA Issues New Rules on Farm Animal Waste</TE>
<TE>   The Environmental Protection Agency issued new rules on preventing
manure from livestock operations from polluting waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new EPA plan, which is less stringent than one proposed
earlier by the Clinton administration, the number of U.S. farms that
will be required to get special permits for disposing of waste from
cows, pigs and chickens will triple.</TE>
<TE>   But most states are likely to find themselves struggling with the
red tape generated by the rules. In California, the rules will be
overseen by a network of understaffed regional water quality control
boards.</TE>
<TE>   Agriculture has become the biggest polluter of U.S. waterways, and
these new rules are expected to reduce by 25% the amount of nitrogen
and phosphorus -- two of the major pollutants released by the 15,500
largest livestock operations, EPA officials said. Too much of these
elements can cause excessive plant growth that kills fish. and ruins
waterways for swimmers.</TE>

<TE>   K2 Set to Buy Rawlings, to Shareholder's Dismay</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles-based K2 Inc. said it will buy baseball equipment
manufacturer Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc. for $84 million in stock.</TE>
<TE>   The deal, which also includes the assumption of about $40 million
in Rawlings debt, would be the first for K2's new chief executive,
Richard Heckmann. He has an aggressive plan to turn the ski and
snowboard maker into a major sporting goods company by acquiring
other name brands.</TE>
<TE>   Heckmann faces opposition from Rawlings' biggest shareholder,
Daniel Gilbert, who recently made an all-cash bid for the company at
$8.50 a share, or about $69.1 million. Gilbert owns 15% of Rawlings'
stock.</TE>
<TE>   Rawlings Chief Executive Stephen O'Hara said the board of the
115-year-old company decided to accept the K2 offer because it agreed
with Heckmann's vision of creating a large, all-season sporting goods
firm.</TE>

<TE>   Murdoch Discusses New Bid for DirecTV</TE>
<TE>   Rupert Murdoch and John Malone are gearing up for a second run at
DirecTV, but this time as 50-50 partners, sources said, an unexpected
change that reflects their different agendas as they pursue the
nation's leading satellite TV provider.</TE>
<TE>   Top executives of Murdoch's News Corp. were to discuss a new deal
in New York with representatives of General Motors Corp., which owns
DirecTV through its El Segundo-based subsidiary, Hughes Electronics
Corp. Sources close to the companies said the preliminary meeting
would not cover such details as price and structure.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the first since News Corp., with $500 million in
financial backing from Malone's Liberty Media Corp., lost a bidding
war for Hughes a year ago to EchoStar Communications Corp. GM put
DirecTV back on the auction block after the EchoStar merger was
abandoned because of opposition by federal regulators.</TE>

<TE>   FCC Considers Easing Cable Ownership Cap</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission is considering easing the
national cable ownership cap to permit a single cable company to
control as much as 45% of the national pay-television market, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rule, which would replace a fixed 30% national cap
that was ruled unconstitutional in 2001, is being drafted by the
FCC's Media Bureau and is expected to be submitted soon to
commissioners. A formal FCC vote is not expected until next month.</TE>
<TE>   FCC staffers are leaning toward replacing the fixed 30% cap with a
more flexible rule in which mergers that give a cable company 30% to
45% of the market would be judged on a case-by-case basis, sources
said. That would mark a shift from other FCC rules that rely on fixed
limits.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say the flexible cap, if approved by the commissioners,
could provide a hint about how the FCC might approach broadcast
ownership rules that are expected to be revamped next year. Critics
fear the cap, if approved, would give cable giants too much control
over what Americans watch on television and how they connect to the
Internet.</TE>

<TE>   Southland Home Prices Defy Sluggish Economy</TE>
<TE>   An unexpected burst of sales boosted Southern California home
prices by 21% in November, the biggest year-over-year increase since
the peak of the last housing boom in 1989, according to new figures.</TE>
<TE>   The jump in the overall median price of new and existing houses
and condominiums sold, to a record $288,000, showed that Southern
California's housing market is still on a roll despite the gloomy
economy and the possibility of a war. Home prices hit new highs in
the region's most-populous counties -- from San Diego to Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   Total sales rose more than 12% to 25,601, according to DataQuick
Information Systems, which compiles the sales information from
property records. In November, the median price of houses and
condominiums sold in Los Angeles County rose 22% from a year earlier,
to $281,000. The median price in Orange County surged by almost 19%
to $383,000. Even in Riverside County, long considered a haven for
affordable housing, the median home price soared almost 19% to
$228,000.</TE>

<TE>   Russian Firm Acquitted in Digital-Piracy Trial</TE>
<TE>   In a blow to anti-piracy efforts, a federal jury acquitted a
Russian software company of violating U.S. law by selling a program
that picked the locks on Adobe Systems Inc.'s electronic books.</TE>
<TE>   ElcomSoft Co. of Moscow was the first company to be tried on
criminal charges under the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act,
which makes it illegal to break the locks on digital books, music and
movies, even for legal purposes. The San Jose jury rejected all five
charges, finding that the company did not intend to violate the law.</TE>
<TE>   Legal analysts said the verdict suggests that prosecutors will
have a tough time using the copyright act against technology
developers and hackers without solid proof that the defendants knew
they were breaking the law.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Judge Slashes Award in Smoker Case</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles judge slashed a record punitive damages verdict
against Philip Morris Cos. to $28 million, a hefty sum but a shadow
of the $28 billion originally ordered by the jury.</TE>
<TE>   Declaring the jury award to 64-year-old Betty Bullock, a longtime
smoker who suffers from lung and liver cancer, "legally excessive,"
Superior Court Judge Warren L. Ettinger ruled that $28 million "is a
reasonable sum to be awarded against Philip Morris in these
circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   But in his seven-page ruling, Ettinger denied two other motions by
Philip Morris: a request to either order a new trial or to discard
the jury's verdict and declare the company not liable. In rejecting
the motions, Ettinger said Philip Morris had mounted almost no
defense to claims that it had conspired with other cigarette makers
to conceal the risks and addictiveness of smoking.</TE>
<TE>   William S. Ohlemeyer, Philip Morris vice president and associate
general counsel, said the company will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Bullock, of Newport Beach, has the option of seeking a new trial
solely on punitive damages or consenting to the reduced award by
Friday.</TE>

<TE>   Cable, TV Companies Reach Deal on HDTV</TE>
<TE>   Cable operators and TV manufacturers struck a long-awaited
agreement designed to make it easier for consumers to get
high-definition television from cable, ensure their ability to record
most digital programs and preserve the value of older HDTV sets.</TE>
<TE>   The deal will open the door for cable-ready digital TV sets that
could deliver HDTV without a separate set-top box. This kind of
plug-and-play simplicity is crucial for digital TV, set manufacturers
say, because about two-thirds of U.S. homes rely on cable to deliver
their TV signals.</TE>
<TE>   The deal won't take effect, however, unless the Federal
Communications Commission adopts a regulation applying the agreement
to all cable and satellite operators.</TE>

<HD>Up to His Old Tricks</HD>
<DH>Hubie Brown, coaching again at 69, has led unlikely revival
in Memphis</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Markus</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Hubie Brown was never really away from coaching. As a television
analyst for the past 15 years, Brown coached just about every team in
the NBA. As the guest lecturer at clinics around the world, Brown
taught coaches how to coach.</LD>
<LD>   Still, when Jerry West called last month to see if Brown was
interested in coaching his own team again, the basketball legend and
first-year president of the Memphis Grizzlies was taken back by the
69-year-old gym rat's affirmative answer.</LD>
<LD>   "Yes, I was surprised," West said earlier this week from Memphis,
chuckling at the memory of their conversation. "He is really someone
I've always admired as a coach and a basketball mind. It's someone I
thought would be perfect for our situation."</LD>
<TE>   Considering the force of his personality, it's not shocking that
Brown's message has already gotten across. Considering the farce the
Grizzlies have been since their years in Vancouver, it's astounding
how successful Brown has been. They won 23 games last season.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis had won six of eight games after beating Milwaukee on
Friday night. And, despite an overall record of 8-12 since Brown took
over after the team started the season 0-8 under Sidney Lowe, the
Grizzlies have suddenly become competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had young teams, I've had older teams; you're only as good
as your players," Brown said. "Our success is because we're growing
every day. We're nowhere near where we can be."</TE>
<TE>   The second-oldest to ever coach an NBA game, Brown inherited a
team whose players average 24.6 years old. Several of the players
didn't even know that Brown coached 10 years in the NBA and two in
the old ABA.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of them were only 7, 8 years old," Brown said of his last
coaching job, a five-year stint with the New York Knicks that ended
16 games into the 1986-87 season. "They weren't even watching the
NBA. They were watching cartoons."</TE>
<TE>   Shane Battier said that the questions of a generation gap between
Brown and his new team were overstated.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't brought in to hang out with us at the mall," said
Battier, last year's top draft choice out of Duke. "He was brought in
to make us a better team. At the time, we hadn't won a game."</TE>
<TE>   It took the Grizzlies four games to win their first under Brown --
an 85-74 victory over the Washington Wizards -- and another 12 to
settle on a lineup. After moving Wesley Person to shooting guard, Pau
Gasol to power forward and Lorenzen Wright to center, Memphis won
four in a row, one shy of a franchise record.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning players with potential are always coachable," said Brown.
"They want to be taught. They want the edge. They want the
preparation. Losing players with potential get you fired in any
business."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from Person, the player who has prospered most in Brown's
system has been point guard Jason Williams. Known as a player who
shot his team out of games more often than not, and contributed to
Lowe's demise, Williams has an assist-turnover ratio of better than
3-1 for the first time in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been great," Brown said of Williams. "Since Day One, he
gives 100 percent. Practice. Games. He asks terrific questions.
Understands exactly what we're doing. He's only had one bad night, at
Utah, and that's because we lost two starters that morning."</TE>
<TE>   Said Williams: "When I heard they hired Hubie, I wondered how he
and I were going to get along. But it might have been the best thing
that has happened in my career. It's worked out because I've been
willing to listen and try to do what he wants me to do."</TE>
<TE>   If anything, the biggest adjustment Brown has had to make is
coaching games in which he has a vested interest. It's a lot
different than working as an analyst, which Brown had done for Turner
Sports and CBS and was planning on doing for the San Antonio Spurs
this season until West's phone call.</TE>
<TE>   "Teaching at practice, you do that like a bicycle, preparation,
all of that," said Brown. "The difficult thing is reconditioning your
mind to the NBA game, the pressure of the last three minutes because
we've been in so many close games. You have to condition yourself
mentally to get back."</TE>
<TE>   Drew Gooden, the team's top draft choice this season, said that
playing for Brown reminds him of the four years he spent at Kansas
under Roy Williams. Gooden wasn't aware of Brown's former life as a
coach.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been very impressed. He's not rusty at all," said Gooden.
"He knows how to organize a team, what to do in practice, how to get
along with a lot of different personalities. He's done a great job."</TE>
<TE>   Wizard Coach Doug Collins remembers hearing the news that Brown
was returning to the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked from the standpoint only that he had been out a
long time," said Collins, who returned to coach last year after a
three-year stint in television. "But I've never seen a better
clinician in my life. He's done clinics for me in Chicago. He was the
most incredible teacher I had ever seen."</TE>

<HD>Friedgen Carries On Despite Constant Pain</HD>
<DH>Aching back makes his life miserable, but football coach
hasn't let it keep him from leading Maryland to the Peach Bowl
against Tennessee.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Barr</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph Friedgen shuts his eyes, leans back and winces, the look on his
face speaking volumes. Sitting in an overstuffed red leather chair,
Maryland's football coach looks like someone for whom every physical
exertion is a struggle.</LD>
<LD>   From an aching back to a pain that occasionally shoots down his
right hip and into his leg, Friedgen is "not enjoying life right now
as far as just getting around." He uses a golf cart to make the short
trip from his office to the practice field because walking is too
difficult. He takes medication. He has worn a back brace. He is
considering acupuncture.</LD>
<LD>   For a 6-foot-1, 330-pound man who calls winning football games
"the best thing in life," this is the cost of business, and business
is very good.</LD>
<TE>   Coming off his second consecutive 10-victory regular season,
Friedgen has won as many games in his two seasons as his three
predecessors did in their tenures. And with a Dec. 31 date with
Tennessee in the Peach Bowl, the next challenge beckons, the next
chance to justify the ridiculous hours, the consuming lifestyle --
the next chance to win.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the diet that generated off-season conversation but
took a backseat as the season heated up.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the chiropractor's table that sits in the corner of his
office, awaiting his next regular therapy session.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind the two bulging disks in his back that have yet to
respond to treatment, or the stenosis, a narrowing of spaces in the
spine that creates pressure on the sciatic nerve in his lower back.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that cramming into an airplane seat -- a regular part
of the job -- leaves him in such discomfort that he couldn't sleep
for two hours after returning home at 4:30 a.m. from a trip to
Clemson.</TE>
<TE>   "I lay here in bed and there's this deep ache in my [bottom],"
Friedgen, 55, said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to get that fixed once the season is over because it is
killing me. It's not a lot of fun right now.... It's been bothering
me since in the spring. They tell me I need to exercise to make it
better, but it's tough to want to exercise when you have trouble
walking."</TE>
<TE>   The next step, Friedgen said, might be to receive a spinal-block
injection, something that usually is given to women just before
childbirth. If that doesn't work, Friedgen might try acupuncture.</TE>
<TE>   "What the hell?" Friedgen said, noting that just standing in the
cold weather often makes his back sore. "Might as well go through the
whole gamut, right? The witch doctor, whatever."</TE>
<TE>   The jar of organic peanut butter remains atop the mini-fridge in
his office and he continues to eat specially designed,
nutrition-conscious meals, but Friedgen makes it clear that football
is his top priority from the season's first practice to the bowl
game's final whistle.</TE>
<TE>   "We're into the crunch now," he said in early October, sheepishly
admitting that he ate a cold cut hoagie on the bus ride to West
Virginia and fried chicken and mashed potatoes on the ride home. "I
could gain a lot of weight between now and the end of the season. I'm
fighting it right now."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the season, Friedgen began developing pimples on
his face. He was told to use medicated pads designed to combat acne,
but those did not help, leaving him with what appeared to be a rash
where his glasses might rest on the sides of his nose.</TE>
<TE>   So as the team prepares for the Peach Bowl, Friedgen is trying to
find time to see a dermatologist -- no easy task when you spend 16
hours a day working.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a break from work might mean taking his focus off winning,
and for Friedgen, winning is what it is all about.</TE>
<TE>   "Best thing in life," he said. "I just like to win. I enjoy it. It
satisfies me."</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen shares that his oldest daughter, Kelley, is in law school
but undecided whether to practice law or pursue teaching. For the
elder Friedgen, whose job combines teaching with competition, the
allure of an arena in which winners and losers are clearly defined is
impossible to resist. After hearing his daughter's indecision, he
wondered, "How can you not want to be in the courtroom?"</TE>
<TE>   That is why he is in the office before 6 every morning during the
season after waking up moaning in pain. It is how he can spend nearly
1 1/2 hours studying 44 Virginia punts to try to detect a weakness.
When it is said that some people might find such work monotonous,
Friedgen said: "They don't do my job. That's my job."</TE>
<TE>   Friedgen is so focused on his team that more than a month into
last season, he had to ask directions to his daughter's high school.</TE>
<TE>   Although Friedgen's focus on football and his approach have not
changed, his players and assistant coaches say he has become a little
more flexible in dealing with the players. In particular, in the
middle of the season, the team made a key strategic change, nearly
eliminating traditional option plays because quarterback Scott
McBrien struggled to run them.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned to do what our players can do and not ask them to do
something they are not ready for yet," said Friedgen, who seems to
view his football players like pieces on a chess board, constantly
maneuvering for the best position. "Offensively, we've gotten better
since we simplified things, allowed some kids to grow. To me, it's a
little boring."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of whether it is boring, there is no questioning its
success. No coach in ACC history has won more games in his first two
seasons at a school. Before Friedgen arrived, Maryland had won 10
games in a season just four times, only once since 1955, and had
played in one bowl game since 1990. Last season, the Terrapins won
the ACC title and were invited to the Orange Bowl. This season, the
team went into late November with a chance to win a share of the
conference title and gain a Sugar Bowl berth.</TE>

<HD>Payoff Is No Joke</HD>
<DH>Golf's off-season exhibition circuit may be called the
'silly season' because it doesn't count, but it sure fills players'
wallets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The silly season is no longer just for fun.</LD>
<LD>   In the six weeks since the PGA Tour season officially ended at the
Tour Championship, there have been 11 tournaments around the world
with prize money topping $22 million.</LD>
<LD>   The total purse on the PGA Tour wasn't that high 20 years ago,
when the Skins Game was created and paved the way for the silly
season -- events that don't count toward the world ranking or history
but offer money that still spends the same.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of recharging their batteries, more players are reloading
their bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Montgomerie was in South Africa for the Nedbank Challenge,
competing against Ernie Els and Sergio Garcia. The next week he was
in California for the Target World Challenge, playing against Tiger
Woods and Phil Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   "To be invited to these events is a thrill," Montgomerie said.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't the only lure. Simply showing up was worth $150,000 in
Sun City and $130,000 at Sherwood Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, well, there is the thing about money," Montgomerie said,
breaking into a broad smile.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Couples knows that all too well. He has been ridiculed as the
"King of the Silly Season," and Couples laughs all the way to the
bank.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm one to realize the importance of some of these events,"
Couples said. "Obviously, winning it means you make some money."</TE>
<TE>   Couples played in only two PGA Tour events all summer. Then the
silly season arrived, and he played three times in three weeks,
pocketing $280,000.</TE>
<TE>   The joke is on those watching from home.</TE>
<TE>   "The people who make fun of it aren't playing it," Rich Beem said.
"I know, because I used to be the guy making fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   Beem's victory in the PGA Championship made him an overnight
celebrity and earned him invitations to four silly-season events.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Wendy's Three-Tour Challenge ($167,000) with Jim Furyk
and John Daly, won the Hyundai Team Matches ($100,000) with Peter
Lonard, then finished last in the PGA Grand Slam of Golf ($150,000)
and last in the Target World Challenge ($130,000).</TE>
<TE>   Do the math.</TE>
<TE>   With no heavy lifting involved, Beem cashed in for $547,000.
That's 18% of what he earned in 32 official tournaments worldwide
this year.</TE>
<TE>   And Beem didn't even finish in the top five on the silly-season
money list.</TE>
<TE>   First place went to Els, even though he played only once in the
off-season. Els won the Nedbank Challenge in Sun City, which is no
longer called the "Million Dollar Challenge" because the winner now
gets $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about the Big Easy.</TE>
<TE>   His $2-million payoff was more than half of what Els won during
the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   No one took advantage of the silly season quite like Mark O'Meara,
even though he has not won an official tournament since the 1998
British Open.</TE>
<TE>   O'Meara got into the UBS Warburg Cup because of his age (45). He
got into the Skins Game through a sponsorship deal (Toyota). He
played in the Target World Challenge because his best buddy is the
tournament host (Woods). He also played in the Shark Shootout.</TE>
<TE>   His tally in four events: $775,000.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a bad haul for a month of work, especially considering
that O'Meara made only $730,132 in 24 events on the PGA Tour this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Another big winner was Padraig Harrington, who had his best year
by earning $2.6 million, then made half that much in three unofficial
events.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Target World Challenge, finished 11th in South Africa
and tied for eighth with Paul McGinley in the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Woods didn't exactly suffer.</TE>
<TE>   He made $1,025,000 for seven rounds of golf: two at the PGA Grand
Slam, one at the Skins Game, and a real marathon -- four rounds -- at
his Target World Challenge.</TE>
<TE>   That computes to $8,134.92 for every hole he played in the silly
season, which is more than last-place money at most 72-hole events on
the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   Even Phil Mickelson got in on the act. He won $695,000 in three
events, despite hitting the ball all over the map in the first two
tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   The silly season isn't a complete joke.</TE>
<TE>   The variety of formats -- stroke play, match play, team events,
fathers and sons -- adds entertainment value. And some guys can build
confidence going into the new season.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Harrington, who withstood a back-nine charge from Woods
at Sherwood. There was nothing silly about that, even though it
doesn't count as an official victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I count it," the Irishman said. "Against Tiger? Yes. Against a
world-class field? Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Don't blame these guys for playing.</TE>
<TE>   Success in regular tournaments is what gets them into the silly
season, a century-old practice. In the early 1900s, players wanted to
win majors so they could play for big money in golf exhibitions.</TE>
<TE>   Today's silly season stars have earned the right to take free
money.</TE>
<TE>   More power to them.</TE>

<HD>JUST THRILLS</HD>
<DH>Harrison doesn't whine or showboat, he simply catches a lot
of passes</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Glauber</AU>
<BD>Newsday</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four reasons why Marvin Harrison is the least-hyped superstar in pro
sports:</LD>
<LD>   * He never whines about getting the damn ball. Ever.</LD>
<LD>   * He plays in a city that for all practical purposes lies in the
middle of a cornfield.</LD>
<TE>   * He would no sooner sneak a Sharpie into his sock to sign a
football after a touchdown than walk naked through downtown
Indianapolis. In a blizzard.</TE>
<TE>   * He never takes off plays during a game because he doesn't feel
like running hard. Are you insane? He doesn't even take a play off in
practice.</TE>
<TE>   The Indianapolis Colt wide receiver is the most underappreciated
player in sports because he doesn't complain like Keyshawn Johnson.
Because he doesn't showboat like Terrell Owens. Because he doesn't
dog it like Randy Moss -- on or off the field. And because playing
football in Indianapolis is about as attractive to Madison Avenue
executives as driving a cab. Even Wayne Chrebet has a higher profile,
and the only way he goes to the Pro Bowl is with a ticket. Harrison
on Thursday earned his fourth consecutive selection as a Pro Bowl
starter.</TE>
<TE>   Pop quiz: What's Harrison's uniform number? 19? 81? 84? Try 88.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, none of this seems to bother the 30-year-old Harrison.
He prefers a life of relative obscurity to one of shameless
self-promotion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's better if I'm a secret," he said. "I like that."</TE>
<TE>   Pssst. Harrison is one of the greatest receivers in NFL history,
in case you hadn't noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "He just flies under the radar," said New York Giant Coach Jim
Fassel, whose playoff hopes might hinge on whether the Giants can
stop Harrison today in Indianapolis. "He may be one of the most
underrated players in the National Football League."</TE>
<TE>   No, Jim. He is the most underrated player in the NFL. Outside the
cornfield, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   "Around here, he's certainly very appreciated," said Colt
quarterback Peyton Manning, whose presence is another factor in
Harrison's low profile. "In my opinion, he's the MVP of the league
this year. I think he needs to start getting some of that talk. I
wouldn't trade him for anybody else in the world. He's the best
receiver in the league."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers don't lie. Harrison not only has broken the NFL's
single-season receptions mark this season -- he's at 127 and
counting, having surpassed Herman Moore's record of 123 -- but he has
more catches in the last four years (453) than any other receiver.
Harrison also became the first receiver in league history with four
consecutive 100-catch seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "He does it all," said Giant cornerback Will Allen, who will match
up against Harrison for much of today's game. "Over the middle, deep
balls, whatever. He's a tremendous talent."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison came into the NFL in 1996, the same year Johnson, former
New England receiver Terry Glenn and Buffalo's Eric Moulds were
drafted. Harrison has surpassed them all, reaching 600 receptions
faster than any other player in NFL history. Yes, faster than Jerry
Rice.</TE>
<TE>   But Harrison doesn't really look the part. At 6 feet and a
gazelle-like 175 pounds, he appears almost frail.</TE>
<TE>   But his speed is exceptional (4.3 in the 40-yard dash), his
toughness is unquestioned (he has missed only four games in his
career) and his velvet-soft hands are a perfect match for Manning's
bullet passes.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is his mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I have really good recall of plays I have run in the past, and
Marvin does, too," Manning said. "We've had so many repetitions
together and so many situations that chemistry is the word for that
rapport with one another."</TE>
<TE>   Their relationship is so advanced that Manning often walks up to
the line of scrimmage, surveys the defense and shouts out a verbal
adjustment to Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   "San Diego '99!" Manning once yelled, referring to a play the
Colts ran against the Chargers in a 1999 game. Harrison immediately
adjusted his route.</TE>
<TE>   "Boom, he'll know right what I'm talking about," Manning said.
"Usually, it's a touchdown, and he remembers all his touchdowns. But
the fact that he has that recall and we can use that as a weapon is
an advantage for us."</TE>
<TE>   Harrison also has an uncanny ability to find open space regardless
of the defensive alignment he's facing.</TE>
<TE>   "He finds the open areas," Giant defensive coordinator Johnnie
Lynn said. "If you're playing zone coverage, he's going to try to run
through it and find a window. If you're in man-to-man, he's going to
try and run away from you."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants rely mostly on man coverage, even within their zone
defenses, so it's likely Allen will see Harrison for much of today's
game.</TE>
<TE>   But most teams haven't had a clue against Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   He is averaging nine catches despite facing double coverage on
many, if not most, passing plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a guy who's just going to go out there, week-in and week-out,
and do my job," Harrison said. "My teammates know what I can do, and
the players I play against know what I can do. That's pretty much all
I can ask for."</TE>
<TE>   And not the damn ball.</TE>

<HD>Best in Supporting Role</HD>
<DH>Kings didn't miss a beat when Jackson stepped in for
injured Bibby</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The cheer rises from the raucous Sacramento crowd whenever Bobby
Jackson makes another daredevil drive to the hoop or hits a difficult
three-pointer.</LD>
<LD>   "Bobby! Bobby!" echoes off Arco Arena's wooden floor in adoration
of the undersized journeyman guard who has become the powerful Kings'
most popular player. And he doesn't mind admitting he loves it.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody knows my name," Jackson said with a grin of disbelief.</LD>
<TE>   But nobody is cheering several hours before each game, when
Jackson shows up early to shoot hundreds of three-pointers and jump
shots in a ritual that would leave many players too tired to lift
their arms later that night. Sometimes, Jackson has no company but
work crews and his 12-year-old nephew, Chris, who lives with Jackson
during the season.</TE>
<TE>   In a profession loaded with hard workers, Jackson has an ethic
built on everything from his lack of size to his appreciation for
good timing.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's only because I love to play," Jackson said. "That's all
I want to do with my time. Just play basketball and take care of my
family.... They go together."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's energy hasn't gone unnoticed in Sacramento, where he
became an integral part of the Kings' rotation in his first two
seasons with the club. He finished second for the NBA's Sixth Man
Award last season for his work at both guard positions.</TE>
<TE>   But Jackson made his breakthrough this fall when point guard Mike
Bibby broke his foot in the exhibition season. Thrust into the
starting lineup for 26 games until Bibby returned on Thursday,
Jackson began the weekend averaging 20.2 points and shooting 50% from
the field -- an astonishing number for a small guard who does much of
his scoring from outside.</TE>
<TE>   He's shooting 39% on three-pointers, and he scored in double
figures in 26 consecutive games. He has shown all the resilience,
creativity and talent to be a consistent scorer in the world's
toughest league; as it is, he's just one cog in the Kings' offensive
machine.</TE>
<TE>   And most improbably of all, he loves his supporting role.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bobby played for any other team except us and maybe Dallas,
he'd be an All-Star," said King forward Chris Webber, who's in the
midst of a stellar season as well. "I can only think of a handful of
guards out there who are as good as him. People compare him to Allen
Iverson, and there's a similarity there.</TE>
<TE>   "People used to say he wasn't consistent, and now he's doing it
for us every single night. When he goes to the bench, there will be
no better sixth man in this league, either."</TE>
<TE>   Said Maverick Coach Don Nelson: "He's an All-Star-caliber point
guard. They haven't missed a lick since he's been in there. He
guards, he rebounds. He's terrific."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson needed 29 years to find his niche. He grew up poor in
North Carolina, where only his mother's influence kept him off the
streets. He didn't join a school team until his sophomore year in
high school, and he attended a remote junior college in Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson made it to Minnesota, where the Golden Gophers made the
Final Four in 1997 -- but his team also was involved in the massive
academic scandal that cost coach Clem Haskins his job. Jackson was
among the players accused of turning in papers written by a tutor.</TE>
<TE>   He was a first-round draft pick but was traded twice in his first
year in the NBA. He thought he had found a home during two seasons
with the Timberwolves, but they let him walk away in 2000 -- and he
landed in faraway Sacramento, where he quickly realized that for
once, he was in the right place at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was all leading up to this team," Jackson said. "All
those opportunities and the setbacks are all worth it now. This is a
great team, and we're all equals here. Nobody cares what you did
before. We're just trying to beat the Lakers and win a championship."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is listed at 6 foot 1, but he would need a phone book to
reach 6 feet without shoes on. He's a pesky defender and perhaps the
Kings' fastest player -- and he's also one of the cockiest, talking
steadily on the court and boasting about his team's prowess in the
media.</TE>
<TE>   The razzle-dazzle of the Kings' offense has toned down
considerably in the past year, but Jackson still provides enough
highlights to fill a reel. Sacramento's shortest player is an
accomplished dunker, and a night rarely goes by when he doesn't speed
past a defender and launch an acrobatic layup while flying into the
crowd behind the hoop. Last season, a woman kissed his bald head when
he landed on her lap in the front row.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson is fairly certain his minutes won't decline significantly
now that Bibby is back -- but even if they do, he says, he won't
complain. Coach Rick Adelman intends to give Jackson more minutes at
shooting guard with both the starters and reserves.</TE>
<TE>   "I just imagine having me and Mike on the floor at the same time,"
Jackson said. "We did that sometimes last year, but that could be
really tough for teams to defend. We're quicker than most of the
[shooting] guards in this league. They'll have to defend one of us,
and I don't know if they can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson went back to the bench Thursday night when Bibby returned
to the starting lineup, but true to his predictions, Jackson played a
big role.</TE>
<TE>   He and Bibby played side-by-side during three stretches of the
game, and Jackson scored 21 points -- though he also made a turnover
with 10 seconds left that helped San Antonio escape with an 83-81
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Though Bibby got a huge ovation when he was introduced with the
starters, Jackson also got one when he checked into the game, and he
was the center of media attention in the locker room afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a superstar now," veteran center Vlade Divac said. "What are
we going to do?"</TE>

<HD>Chilling Packer Playoff Edge</HD>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The freezing weather that consumes Green Bay each winter gives the
Packers a playoff advantage so obvious and unfair that it should be
changed someday -- no later than next year if not next month.</LD>
<LD>   The Packers almost never lose at home when the temperature slides
under the freezing point.</LD>
<LD>   The problem isn't the bitter cold as such. If it's a 17-degree
afternoon, it's 17 on both sides of the ball.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is that, year in and out, the Packers have experienced
more arctic-weather games than any opponent. And experience teaches.
That's what the Packers have demonstrated and what teams from Florida
have discovered on northern visits to places that aren't even as cold
as Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Wintertime Edge</TE>
<TE>   The suffocating heat of Florida occasionally gives the Miami
Dolphins an advantage at home too, but that's only in regular-season
games. The Packers' wintertime edge in the playoffs is so troubling
-- as evidenced by their winter record -- that it should be removed
by moving their playoff games to, say, Arizona, or even Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   It's cold in Chicago too, but not so impossibly cold as Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Those who live in Green Bay would be inconvenienced, true, by
trips to Arizona or Illinois. But every game's on TV.</TE>
<TE>   And Packer backers might also reflect on one other truth: As an
NFL town, Green Bay exists only by reason of the magnanimity of the
31 other NFL franchises, which have agreed to pool their revenues and
share many millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   That couldn't happen in baseball, in which the New York Yankees,
for instance, keep most of their millions and thus win most of the
time. For the privilege of NFL membership, Green Bay might consider
giving the other NFL members a fairer shot in the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Three-Team Race</TE>
<TE>   As a refugee from the Midwest, where I spent 21 winters, I can
testify that you never get used to winter weather, as the Packers
always say. But with experience, you do learn the nuances of
navigating the icy blasts of December and January.</TE>
<TE>   You learn what can't be easily done, and what you can do more
easily -- which helps either on the ice, if, for example, you're a
speedskater, or on a football field.</TE>
<TE>   Most significant, cold-weather successes automatically boost
cold-weather tolerance and confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, three days before Christmas, the Packers will have the
advantage in today's game over even the Buffalo Bills. It's cold in
Buffalo too, but the Bills who have never played in Green Bay will be
shocked by the way it is there.</TE>
<TE>   In the history of winter football in the Midwest, no other town
has ever had to call one of its games the Ice Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Three teams remain in the drive for home-field advantage
throughout the NFC playoffs: Philadelphia and Tampa Bay as well as
Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   And it's a given that there is a home-field advantage almost
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   But in December or January, the weather can make the biggest
difference, as it did last Sunday in San Francisco, where cold rain
and a cold wind gave a Wisconsin-like edge to the Packers. They felt
right at home. The fair-weather 49ers plainly never did. At the key
position, Brett Favre was obviously more comfortable in the
unfriendly elements than 49er quarterback Jeff Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   Final score: Green Bay 20, San Francisco 14.</TE>
<TE>   Another Dusty?</TE>
<TE>   Something else is amiss this year on the 49er team. It's hard to
put a finger on what that is, but it's clear enough that the talent
level in San Francisco is as high as, for instance, Green Bay's. The
49ers employ one of the league's best players, Terrell Owens, and
another good receiver, Tai Streets, plus a passer who can get them
the ball, Garcia.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, their one-two punch at running back with Garrison
Hearst and Kevan Barlow is the envy of most opponents, and their
offensive linemen seem comparable with most, as do their defensive
players.</TE>
<TE>   If the problem is on the 49er coaching staff, it is seated, most
likely, in the play-calling as directed by Coach Steve Mariucci, who
seems to get more conservative by the year. On a club with pass-first
personnel, San Francisco's running backs carry the ball too often on
first-down plays.</TE>
<TE>   Hearst and Barlow would gain more yards more often as
counterpunchers if Garcia and Owens initially established first-down
passing. Interestingly enough, following the lead of the San
Francisco Giants -- who wouldn't rehire World Series Manager Dusty
Baker last season -- the 49ers are dragging their feet this winter on
a new contract for Mariucci.</TE>
<TE>   They either know something or there may be something in the air
there.</TE>
<TE>   Has Bulger Healed?</TE>
<TE>   The main questions facing the St. Louis Rams, after their slim win
over faltering Arizona Sunday, 30-28, are whether quarterback Marc
Bulger is sound and whether he will do any more damage to his bad
hand in today's appearance at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   It was hard to tell in the Arizona game whether Bulger's injured
finger was well enough for him to be playing. The wound is on the
index finger, the most important digit a passer has for the science
of correctly directing a football. And next season, in order to make
another Super Bowl run, the Rams are going to need, first of all, a
completely healed index finger on Bulger's passing hand.</TE>
<TE>   If the bothersome ligament is re-injured, it could permanently
affect him.</TE>
<TE>   Two Passers Hurting</TE>
<TE>   Recent games also have provoked some doubts about Ram
physical-fitness supervision in general. At 6 feet 3 and 215 pounds,
Bulger doesn't appear to have the upper-body strength an NFL
quarterback needs.</TE>
<TE>   That's a problem easily fixed by physical-training experts.</TE>
<TE>   From this distance, it seems clear that both Ram quarterbacks,
Bulger and Kurt Warner, need some expert physical-training advice.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't true that Warner's lack of mobility in the pocket is
inbred and changeless. Of the two kinds of strength that physical
experts talk about -- overall strength and explosive strength -- it's
the latter that Warner must have, to get quicker into the pocket as
well faster out of the pocket on scrambles. And the experts can
improve any man's explosive strength.</TE>
<TE>   Wrong Advice</TE>
<TE>   By heeding the advice of talk-radio and national-TV talkers, the
Rams have, temporarily at least, reduced the efficiency of running
back Marshall Faulk. In no sense is Faulk a first-down runner against
an eight-man front. The talkers have all been wrong about that.</TE>
<TE>   They have all mistakenly attributed last winter's Ram defeat in
the Super Bowl to Coach Mike Martz's failure to run Faulk. And,
getting louder and louder, they've kept urging Martz to run him more
often this year.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that the Ram offense has not only slowed down but
has also basically lost Faulk to his injuries.</TE>
<TE>   A year hence, the Rams can only regain Super Bowl form with the
strategy Martz used to reach two of the last three NFL championship
games. This year, his critics seem to have forced Martz away from
that strategy, which has two principal parts:</TE>
<TE>   * Send the passer out to throw the ball on nearly every down.</TE>
<TE>   * Use Faulk as a once-in-a-while counterpuncher, varying the Ram
passing game with the draw plays and the other occasional plays that
have made Faulk a terror in St. Louis after an ordinary career in
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Five Guesses</TE>
<TE>   New England to beat the New York Jets by a touchdown on the
Patriots' new field at Foxboro. There is some danger that the
Patriots are looking past the Jets to the really big one next week,
Miami. But Bill Belichick is a coach who rarely lets such a thing
happen.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland to win by a point or two over Denver on the Raiders'
field. But it's never a surprise when the Broncos take out the
Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Green Bay by a touchdown over Buffalo in a classic Lambeau Field
confrontation of cold-weather teams, only one of which, Buffalo, ever
loses on winter days (sometimes).</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City over San Diego by a field goal at Arrowhead Stadium.
This is LaDainian Tomlinson's last chance this year to prove he's
more running back than Priest Holmes, whose hip injury is expected to
keep him sidelined.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee by plenty over Jacksonville at the Nashville Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   It's in the early stages, but this AFC rivalry could someday be
the biggest in the South.</TE>

<HD>NBA Success Should Be Slam Dunk for Johnson</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Wilbon</AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This isn't Bob Johnson's first expansion project. In fact, I'm
willing to bet the first one was more difficult, more stressful and
fraught with more risk than owning a new franchise in an established,
profitable, internationally acclaimed sports league. A little more
than 20 years ago, with then-wife Sheila teaching music at Sidwell
Friends, Johnson took out a $40,000 second mortgage on their house in
Northwest Washington to start a television network.</LD>
<LD>   Expansion basketball teams have been popping up with some
regularity since the 1960s. But while plenty of black businessmen
undoubtedly fantasized about starting a network that catered to the
specific interests of black folks, Johnson risked everything he and
his wife had. And he pulled it off.</LD>
<LD>   He started Black Entertainment Television, which later grew to
include a movie channel and a jazz channel. The hip-hop culture
wouldn't exist to nearly the degree it does now without BET beaming
it to every corner of America and forcing MTV to creatively react
with its own hip-hop programming explosion.</LD>
<TE>   Talk about an up-by-the-bootstrap story. Starting with nothing,
Johnson built an entertainment empire through sound business acumen
and practices and aggressive negotiations. He made his share of
enemies along the way. He was, and is, relentless in business and
probably had to be for the simple reason that he was a small,
independent operator in a ruthless and competitive marketplace, where
television and entertainment merged. Johnson's success with BET is
not unlike Ted Turner's success with CNN and TBS. And the thing about
self-made men is that you don't just lose all that passion and
stick-to-itiveness. Now, Johnson wants to pour himself into a
basketball franchise, as well as continuing his efforts to get a
Major League Baseball team for Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson once said that every time he had a personal audience with
NBA Commissioner David Stern, he would ask him, "David, when do I get
a chance to buy a franchise?"</TE>
<TE>   Before this goes any further, let me declare a conflict of
interest and feelings. Bob Johnson gave me my start in television, at
BET in the mid-1980s when the studio was tiny and still located in
Alexandria, Va. Long before the proliferation of sportswriters
talking on national TV, Johnson put host Charlie Neal at a sports
round table every Saturday afternoon for years and it included on a
rotating basis James Brown, Bryan Burwell, David Aldridge, Ralph
Wiley, Bill Rhoden, Glenn Harris, Roy Johnson and me. Bob Johnson
paid us, showcased us, and we all went onto bigger paychecks and
greater visibility. Doubtful any of us can repay him that debt of
gratitude.</TE>
<TE>   To look at BET now makes me angry or depressed. The network
recently announced it is eliminating most of its news division,
including a first-rate nightly public affairs show hosted by Ed
Gordon and its Sunday night show "Lead Story" and, incredibly, "Teen
Summit," which over the years has saved countless young lives.
Viacom, which bought BET from Johnson a couple years ago, didn't make
these cuts. "This was a decision Bob Johnson and I made," Debra Lee,
the network's president and chief executive, told The Washington Post
this week, clearing up the matter of who's responsible.</TE>
<TE>   It's a heinous decision. News, apparently, costs too much. So BET
is now the network of platinum-grilled rappers, provocatively dressed
women and all-night infomercials, but not news or pertinent
information. And to think we debate the cultural obligation of
27-year-old Tiger Woods. It's sickening to think of all the
fabulously talented producers, directors, reporters, technicians and
creative folks Johnson and Lee have let go through these kinds of
moves ... and of the void for discussions of worthy issues to and for
people of color, or anybody interested, in joining in.</TE>
<TE>   So I'm conflicted because I'm angry most days over what BET is
likely to become, but old enough to understand the fight Johnson had
to wage to get the network running, keep it running and make it
successful enough that he would change the face of television and at
the same time make himself a billionaire. Johnson, to the best of our
knowledge, is the only black billionaire in this country, which meant
he beat more odds than just about anybody.</TE>
<TE>   In an unfortunate remark, M.L. Carr, who with Larry Bird was
fronting the competing group to be selected by the NBA, said "there
is no affirmative action for billionaires." Johnson, who could if he
so chooses, bring aboard local investors in Charlotte, is at present
the one voice running the new franchise. The Bird-Carr group was
going to have more than a dozen investors, and still needed more
money.</TE>
<TE>   The NBA never did like the chaotic way seven people ran the New
Jersey Nets. Plainly put, Johnson by himself had more money,
apparently a lot more, than the Bird-Carr group.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Johnson's color goes unnoticed today. There are
a handful of black men in this country, including Eddie Gardner (the
founder of Soft Sheen Products), who owns a piece of the Chicago
Bulls; South Floridian Willie Gary; and Johnson. As Johnson said,
they all "stand on the shoulders of men like Jackie Robinson."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's owning the Charlotte franchise is going to immediately
impact the way black-owned enterprises and black investors go about
their business, personal and commercial. It will probably open the
eyes of black athletes, though a little more slowly. The imminently
qualified Johnson associate Ed Tapscott (a good friend) should have a
team to run, finally. In fact, if Abe Pollin really wants Michael
Jordan to stay in Washington and run the Wizards' franchise, and not
move back to his home state of North Carolina, he might want to
consider ways to lock up Jordan before Johnson gets a hold of him.</TE>
<TE>   Magic Johnson, who has been every bit the success off the court as
he was on, told Bloomberg News, "For the NBA to beat the NFL and
(Major League) Baseball [in having a black majority owner], it says a
lot about the owners and our great commissioner, David Stern."</TE>
<TE>   It also says a lot about a man, Bob Johnson, who starting from
scratch, was able to make things go his way to a degree that surely
leaves others with more resources quite jealous.</TE>

<HD>More Light for the Colorblind</HD>
<DH>Trent Lott's fall from grace could be a step forward for
the Republican Party.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Progress usually starts with an argument. But we don't get far until
we reach an agreement. For that reason, we can say "thank you" to
Trent Lott.</LD>
<LD>   By letting slip his bitter nostalgia for segregation and falling
on his sword, Lott pulled down the camouflage. Bigots suddenly have
less room to hide in American politics. The perfidious wink-and-nod
tolerance of bigotry in the Republican Party has been exposed and
denounced -- finally from within as well as from without.</LD>
<LD>   That's a step forward. As any shrink will tell you, overcoming
your troubles sometimes means squaring yourself with your past.</LD>
<TE>   In the 1960s, the Democratic Party came to its own moral reckoning
over racial injustice, the nation's greatest shame. The triumph of
the civil rights wing of the party over its segregationists turned
politics on its head. But it did not close the argument.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, although voting for the Civil Rights and Voting
Rights acts in Congress, soon made room for bigots and adopted the
coded language by which prejudice was given a veneer. Remember, Strom
Thurmond was one of those unhappy Democrats who stormed over and set
up camp with the friendly Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Now Lott has brought the GOP to its own moment of truth. And the
best, smartest and most foresighted among conservatives didn't duck.
In fact, they were among those leading the charge that brought him
down.</TE>
<TE>   What a switch. Just a month ago, the U.S. concluded midterm
elections that only served to harden the nation's philosophical
disagreements. Now the elements of the right have converged with the
left -- who could have guessed? -- on a truly important principle:
delivering race-baiting to the dustbin.</TE>
<TE>   The best thing that could happen to the nation is for high-minded
conservatives to continue to press ahead, particularly the young and
the reigning "neocons," or whatever they want to call themselves, who
supply a lot of the intellectual energy to the GOP. For beyond the
question of shoving Lott aside, they have opened the door for a real
moral house cleaning, not just the apologetic sweeping of dirt under
the rug.</TE>
<TE>   Back to business? This, friends, is good business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's quite simply about the soul of the Republican Party," says
writer Andrew Sullivan, who was early to conclude that Lott was a
"menace to the future" of the GOP.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Lott's fatal burst of candor touched off plenty of internal
fuming, self-pity, anger, hypocrisy and backstabbing among
Republicans. But writing in the National Review, editor-at-large
Jonah Goldberg noted the most salient fact: "To date, no reputable
conservative has come out in defense of Lott's remarks."</TE>
<TE>   I guess that itself was a sign of progress, if only to see
die-hard Lott apologists like Pat Buchanan disregarded as no longer
reputable.</TE>
<TE>   To my thinking, conservatives have a long way to go, maybe
impossibly far, to reconcile their claims of compassion with their
zeal for winner-take-all economic Darwinism. But if there really is
anything to their dreamy ideals about a colorblind society, we won't
know until the party breaks cleanly with those whose values were so
cogently expressed by the former Senate leader and the
segregationists of 1948.</TE>
<TE>   The answer to racial intolerance? Intolerance. Follow the path of
the Democrats: Drive it out of the party. Strike the Confederate
flag. Enough of the code-speak. Fumigate. This time, there is nowhere
for bigotry to go, except the fringe, where it richly belongs.</TE>
<TE>   Self-interest is a powerful motive in politics and can lead to
surprising places. Smart conservatives are aware that trying to
survive on the point spread of white voters is an increasingly shaky
proposition in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with lingering doubts ought to look in on California, where
conservatives pushed against immigration as a wedge issue a few years
ago. Many principled people ended up being tarred as bigots in that
effort, chiefly because they were found associating with bigots. And
now Republicans hardly fill the backbench in the state Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   What's wrong with America? This: Nearly half of the white
population thinks the country is going in the right direction and
nearly two-thirds of African Americans see it headed wrong. That's
according to a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's fall from grace is one of those rare things that we can all
agree is a step forward.</TE>
<TE>   And if it proves to be just the beginning of the GOP's return to
Lincoln, the shock waves won't take long traveling across the aisle
and rousing the Democratic Party from its torpor.</TE>
<TE>   Hasn't it been apparent for too long now that African Americans
deserve better than they're getting from what has become a one-party
system for them (90% went for Al Gore; two-thirds voted against
Lott)?</TE>
<TE>   All Americans rate the dignity of choices.</TE>
<TE>   That's something we could call real progress.</TE>

<HD>Powers That Be Should See the Needs of Frankie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frank del Olmo</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is good news and bad this holiday season regarding my son,
Frankie, and other children like him who have autism.</LD>
<LD>   Frankie is 10 now, and the good news involves his personal
progress against the neurological disorder that impairs a child's
ability to speak, learn and respond to people.</LD>
<LD>   The bad news involves political shenanigans that could deny many
autistic children the costly therapies my wife, Magdalena, and I
fought so hard to get for Frankie.</LD>
<TE>   I shudder to think how far behind other children Frankie would be
today were it not for the difficult odyssey our family began eight
years ago, when doctors diagnosed his autism and told us there was no
cure.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, we were so desperate to help our son that we didn't
dwell on what might have caused brain damage in an otherwise healthy
toddler.</TE>
<TE>   Instead we immediately contacted specialists and studied the work
done by autism researchers. This convinced us Frankie's situation
wasn't hopeless.</TE>
<TE>   The process of rewiring Frankie's brain has taken us from
behavioral therapies to specialized treatment for reading and hearing
disorders to gymnastics classes to help him become better
coordinated.</TE>
<TE>   When we realized Frankie could not function effectively in a
regular classroom, we home-schooled him with the help of my sister.</TE>
<TE>   Frankie returned to a classroom last summer, at a private school
in Sherman Oaks that specializes in the education and treatment of
disabled or emotionally disturbed youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Frankie can keep up with his classmates with the help of an aide,
but he is still easily distracted. But he genuinely likes school and
his teacher. He has even accepted the fact that he must finish his
homework before he can play video games -- although not without the
complaints of a typical 10-year-old: "Do I have to?"</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, Frankie is so close to normal that it is sometimes
easy to forget how far he's come. But the stories of other autistic
children remind me.</TE>
<TE>   Many more are being told, now that researchers have confirmed a
suspicion I had, that there are many more kids like Frankie than
anyone had realized.</TE>
<TE>   In October, UC Davis reported that the number of California
children with diagnosed autism increased nearly 300% between 1987 and
1998, an upsurge that is no statistical quirk.</TE>
<TE>   When we first learned of Frankie's autism, experts said one in
10,000 children had the disorder. Today, the estimate is one in 250.</TE>
<TE>   Some public health officials and politicians are pushing for more
research to find a cure, but others have cynically moved to protect
legally vulnerable rear ends.</TE>
<TE>   I refer to a recent effort by Eli Lilly &amp; Co., the giant
pharmaceutical company, to deflect hundreds of lawsuits by parents of
autistic children who suspect a Lilly-manufactured vaccine additive,
thimerosal, may be a culprit in the autism epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   Lobbyists for Lilly could not persuade Congress earlier this year
to enact legislation that would shift the autism lawsuits to a
federal vaccine-injury compensation program.</TE>
<TE>   Then last month, just hours before the final congressional vote on
the Homeland Security Act, U.S. Rep. Dick Armey (R-Texas) quietly
tacked two paragraphs onto the 247-page bill that gave Lilly what it
wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Armey says he acted on his own because protecting vaccine
manufacturers from costly lawsuits is a matter of national security.
"I did it and I'm proud of it," he said. Maybe he'd feel different
if, like U.S. Rep. Dan Burton (R-Ind.), he had a grandchild with
autism.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of children across the country were exposed to this
mercury-based preservative at a time when concerns about its health
effects were emerging," Burton told Congress in an unsuccessful
effort to have the thimerosal provision dropped. (For the record, we
are not involved in any lawsuits against Lilly.)</TE>
<TE>   Burton and others in Congress will try to revisit the issue when a
new Congress convenes in January, by which time Armey will have
retired. But excising the provision won't be easy, given that Lilly's
chief executive, Sidney Taurel, is an advisor to President Bush on
domestic security and a former Lilly executive, Mitchell E. Daniels,
is the White House budget director. The close ties between Lilly and
the White House make this old political reporter wonder if Armey
really was the prime mover behind the amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever answer finally emerges, for now I am grateful Frankie is
making progress. If only I could share my hope with the many other
parents just now embarking on the long journey to help their autistic
children. The road has just been made a little rougher.</TE>

<HD>First Step: Admit It</HD>
<DH>Only when the nation ends its denial will racism's hold be
broken</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michael Eric Dyson</AU>
<BD>Michael Eric Dyson, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, is author of "Race Rules" (Vintage, 1997) and "Open
Mike: Reflections on Philosophy, Race, Sex, Culture and Religion"
(Basic Civitas Books, 2003).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the reasons race continues to play such a huge role in the
culture is that we deny its persistence. When it comes to race, we
live in the United States of Amnesia.</LD>
<LD>   The nation thrives on whitewashing its bitter racial conflicts, or
at least baptizing them in the healing pools of revisionist
mythology.</LD>
<LD>   The Civil War wasn't fundamentally a conflict of color rooted in
slavery but rather a battle over political measures to unify the
nation.</LD>
<TE>   The Supreme Court isn't a politically motivated body of legal
opinion but a neutral, objective forum to adjudicate racial disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Affirmative action is not a provisional remedy for the vicious
history of racial discrimination but a set of public policies
designed to facilitate preferential treatment for unqualified
minorities.</TE>
<TE>   By these and other political and rhetorical maneuvers, the racial
status quo -- made up largely of conservative figures who opposed
crucial features of the struggle for racial equality, or neoliberal
pols uncomfortable with the claims of progressive antiracist
activists -- has managed to deflect responsibility for its role in
the perpetuation of policies, prejudices and practices it is now
supposed to resist.</TE>
<TE>   By rewriting the violent history of race in America, figures in
both staunchly conservative and weakly liberal camps are able to
appear as allies of racial justice while promoting beliefs and values
that severely undermine racial progress.</TE>
<TE>   The denial of our racial past, in some measure, means that we are
forever doomed to a battle over just how bad things are in our racial
present. If we can't agree -- and, really, tell the truth -- about
the history of race, we can't tell the truth about the politics of
race. The two are indissolubly linked.</TE>
<TE>   The politics of race involves disputes about the persistence of
racism; the role of race in deciding the distribution of social goods
like education and employment; the place of race in public discourse,
whether through presidential commission or informal debates; the
political will to address the most damning aspects of discrimination,
prejudice and bias; and the acrimonious argument over just how much
economic and social resources should be devoted to remedying our
racial miasma.</TE>
<TE>   Many whites feel that they -- which means the government, because
many whites identify themselves as "the nation" -- have bent over
backward for long enough to accommodate the patently unfair demands
of ungrateful and complaining blacks. Many blacks feel that measures
such as affirmative action are not the ceiling, but the ground floor,
of racial justice, and hence view reparations as the only viable
symbol of the nation's full commitment to bringing true racial
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, because race is America's original sin, there is still a
great deal of shame around its discussion that puts roadblocks in the
way of open and honest engagement.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, when it comes to race, what philosophers call a category
mistake is made: Americans often substitute private belief and
personal emotion for public policy and social practice. Many folks
were engrossed in discussion over whether Trent Lott was a racist,
based on whether he held prejudiced views about blacks, or whether he
harbored racial animus in his heart.</TE>
<TE>   Though such matters are important, they are not the most
determinative issues in relation to racial justice.</TE>
<TE>   Rather, structural features -- such as deeply ingrained beliefs
about race that have taken on a life of their own in the national
psyche and that inform practices such as racial profiling -- are much
more detrimental to our racial health.</TE>
<TE>   If we are to effectively combat the ongoing rule of race in
American life, we must not deny our racial past.</TE>
<TE>   We must tell the truth about the racial consequences of our
political and public policies, and we must look beyond personal
sentiment to social practice as a barometer of our racial progress.</TE>
<TE>   The resignation of Lott as Senate Republican majority leader
provokes a poignant question: How can an offhand comment topple one
of the most powerful men in America?</TE>
<TE>   The answer is no less paradoxical than the painful history of race
in our nation. What Lott's fate proves is that race still has a great
deal of potency in our country.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's downfall also suggests that the politics of race are
especially effective, and vicious, when we mask our true feelings and
make a scapegoat out of a figure whose political misjudgment ripped
the cover from beliefs that are widely held in his party and -- if
the truth be told -- in certain quarters of the Democratic Party as
well.</TE>
<TE>   If we think that we have solved our problem by replacing Lott, we
ignore the history and politics of race to our peril.</TE>

<AU>John Saito</AU>
<BD>John Saito is the former regional director of the
Japanese American Citizens League.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was only a teenager in 1942, but overnight I became the enemy of my
country. I was no longer the vibrant American boy with aspirations to
become a great athlete, but the enemy that sneakily attacked Pearl
Harbor. I couldn't believe the way the media had portrayed me.</LD>
<LD>   I was a student at Hollenbeck Junior High in Los Angeles. Posters
were placed on telephone poles throughout the Western Command of the
6th Army, which included California, western Oregon and western
Washington. They indicated that all people of Japanese ancestry,
immigrant and citizen alike, must assemble at designated areas to be
transported to unknown inland destinations. We could take only what
we could carry.</LD>
<LD>   On May 27, 1942, our family along with hundreds of other families
assembled at the 1st Street Bridge and, under armed military guard,
were placed on trains going to unknown destinations. We ended up in
Parker, Ariz., where most camp residents were held for the duration
of the war.</LD>
<TE>   Reading press reports of the arrests last week in Southern
California of hundreds of immigrants from predominantly Muslim
nations stirred up bitter memories of 1942.</TE>
<TE>   A new government order requires boys and men from 18 designated
nations, who are in the U.S. on temporary visas, to register with the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. The arrests -- allegedly for
immigration violations -- were made when the immigrants were
complying with this law.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, Japanese Americans were the targets of the racists who
wanted us out of our homes and placed in American concentration
camps. Our constitutional rights were ignored, and the thinking and
the power of the racists ran rampant over our lives. In a short time,
military orders sanctioned by presidential decree uprooted the lives
of more than 120,000 Americans of Japanese descent and legal resident
immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   The comparisons to what is happening today are not exact.
Registration is not internment. But is worse to come in this
post-9/11 atmosphere? Once again, innocent people are being rounded
up based on race and national origin.</TE>
<TE>   There are many similarities in how people of color and people who
don't look like the majority are treated in this country. In 1942, we
were at war with Germany and Italy. German Americans and Italian
Americans were picked up and locked up individually. Not so with
Japanese Americans. They were picked up and locked up en masse. Would
we have been interned if we looked like the majority population?</TE>
<TE>   In 1983, a presidential commission, after a lengthy investigation
of the internment of Japanese Americans in 1942, stated that the
reasons behind our internment were poor political leadership, wartime
hysteria and racial prejudice. Those three reasons seem to be
operating again.</TE>
<TE>   The actions being taken today against another group of people,
based on ancestry and place of origin, are repeating mistakes of the
past.</TE>

<HD>Lessons from the school of hardest knocks</HD>
<DH>'Gangs of New York' turns to a French Foreign Legion
veteran and martial artist for his personal fight experience.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Nero is taking a beating. First came the punches and kicks,
not at full force but still enough to send him staggering against a
concrete wall. Then a series of headlocks and grapplings, before
ending up on the floor now as Dominiquie Vandenberg sits across his
chest and calmly demonstrates the art of head-butting, the same
brutal act Daniel Day-Lewis delivers to Leonardo DiCaprio in "Gangs
of New York."</LD>
<LD>   They exchange casual words in French between twists and jabs. Nero
is a two-time world champion of knock-down karate and a jujitsu
expert, but today he is in a Hollywood garage-gym as the sparring
partner of Vandenberg, who worked as the technical fight consultant
for Martin Scorsese's epic of 1860s gang warfare in lower Manhattan.</LD>
<LD>   "These are the kinds of things I showed Leo, but old-style,"
Vandenberg says from the mat. In the months leading up to the 2000
production of "Gangs" in Rome, Vandenberg trained the actor in a
variety of violent techniques, re-creating such vintage styles as
French "old-style Savate," Irish bare-knuckle boxing and
"catch-as-catch-can," a "dirty" but effective form of modern
wrestling.</LD>
<TE>   "It's very basic," he says, as his partner again urgently taps the
floor to signal pain, "but it works."</TE>
<TE>   Vandenberg brought a rich history of real-life experience to the
job. The Belgium-born martial artist is a five-year veteran of the
Special Forces unit of the French Foreign Legion, and saw action in
Central Africa and other war zones in the early '90s. The scars that
DiCaprio's character reveals in "Gangs of New York" were based on
Polaroids of Vandenberg's own torso and the remnants of gunshots,
stabbings and other wounds.</TE>
<TE>   A European tabloid recently declared that Scorsese had hired a
"professional killer" to train DiCaprio, while England's Arena
magazine labeled him a "mercenary." Vandenberg shrugs off these
descriptions, but they were partly true. After his years with the
legion, he was a warrior for hire in Burma and Bosnia before turning
his energies to Thai kick-boxing and other martial arts competitions.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look back on it, and when I look at the pictures and look
at my face, it's like, 'Is that me?' Living here and working in the
movies now, it seems like it was a bad dream. But then a lot of the
stuff that I did made me who I am today. Each time you face death,
your perception -- everything in your life -- is so different. I
don't regret my background. I'm not going to hide it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done bad things, but never to people who were not bad
people," he adds, referring to what he says was his final assignment
as a "merc," hunting death squads on both sides of the conflict in
Sarajevo and for a client he won't identify. "The people that we were
dealing with were people who were killing kids and women and just
doing horrible things."</TE>
<TE>   By 1995, he had stepped away from all that to bring his
experiences to Hollywood, and has worked with the likes of Tim Burton
and Steven Seagal.</TE>
<TE>   Vandenberg, 33, has written a book of his experiences, as yet
unpublished. An aspiring actor and screenwriter, he also has a pair
of scripts in circulation. During the long "Gangs" shoot, he says, he
had to turn away opportunities to work on such films as "Planet of
the Apes" and "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   He now lives in a rented house, once the home of writer-director
and frequent Scorsese collaborator Paul Schrader, in the Franklin
Hills east of Hollywood. In preparation for the film, Vandenberg
drove to DiCaprio's house in the Hollywood Hills at least three times
a week for training, as the actor put on 20 pounds of muscle
weightlifting between fighting sessions.</TE>
<TE>   "He would bring his buddies up as dummies," Vandenberg says with a
laugh. "He had three or four of his good buddies from high school,
and he would just toss them around and beat them up. He was really
into it. It was a joy working with the guy."</TE>
<TE>   A chance to act</TE>
<TE>   After he was enlisted as the film's fight coordinator, Vandenberg
was recruited for several on-screen appearances, notably beside
DiCaprio as the Dead Rabbits gang marches toward a final
confrontation with the Nativists gang led by Bill the Butcher
(Day-Lewis).</TE>
<TE>   He was even given a few lines of dialogue, but those were among
the hours of footage cut by Scorsese in the final edit. He quickly
earned a reputation on the set as the production's only veteran of
actual knife fights and war zones, and as an ex-soldier who once
snacked on bats and insects in French Guyana.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first two months, people kind of avoided me," he says.
"They would sometimes come by the set when we were doing stuff, and
they were like, 'This guy is a psychopath!' I would be showing Leo
how to cut a guy's veins and stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the director of "GoodFellas" and "Taxi Driver" seemed
particularly disturbed. "I think it takes a lot to get Marty's hair
standing up," says Vandenberg.</TE>
<TE>   More realism was the director's goal. In a typical Scorsese film,
violence can be intense but always has consequences, says "Gangs"
stunt coordinator George Aguilar, who also worked with the filmmaker
on 1999's "Bringing Out the Dead." Vandenberg's role was central for
his "vast knowledge of certain styles of fighting, especially
old-time, 1860s techniques," Aguilar says, "the stances, the tactics,
and some of the weapons."</TE>
<TE>   Fight scenes were rehearsed extensively before shooting, aiming
for the kind of naked aggression epitomized by the film's opening
battle, says Aguilar. "It was a little disturbing, but fun at times
because you see 300 people fighting and then people get up and shake
hands and the dirt out of their clothes and you do it again."</TE>
<TE>   Before filming, Vandenberg choreographed several knife fights and
hand-to-hand combat on videotape, and Scorsese drew some of the
film's violent encounters directly from those tapes. The techniques
Vandenberg brought to the film were based on historical research and
his own experiences as a soldier and martial artist. He knew that a
typical street fighter wasn't about to employ flying karate kicks in
19th century New York.</TE>
<TE>   "It was fairly easy for me because I saw a lot of violence,"
Vandenberg says. "I know what it looks like and what it smells like.
The sweat smells different on someone who thinks he's going to die. A
real fight is not beautiful to look at. So you want to give it [room]
so the acting can come in, to make it cinematicIn real life, if
you're hammering someone, you're not going to say a line. You hammer
a guy until it's done."</TE>
<TE>   His house is sparsely decorated, just scattered Asian accents amid
weightlifting equipment and framed pictures of Steve McQueen, James
Dean and Bruce Lee. In his bookcase are volumes on Stanley Kubrick
and Samurai warriors, and boxing, as well as the title "Black Hawk
Down." Samurai iron miniatures decorate another shelf.</TE>
<TE>   An old military cap lies crumpled on a table as he pages through
an album filled with snapshots of him in action: jumping out of
airplanes, taking prisoners in Rwanda, firing automatic weapons, and,
more recently, arm in arm with Scorsese, DiCaprio and Day-Lewis.</TE>
<TE>   "When I show people these pictures, they go, 'Oh, what movie is
that from?' That's not a movie," Vandenberg says, beaming. "That's my
real life."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Aida," the title character goes through several severe reversals
of fortune. That pattern continued last week.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the NAACP Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch announced that
the touring musical had received 11 nominations for the group's
theater awards -- tying for second place in the list of shows with
the most nominations.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday, the "Aida" nominations were rescinded. It turns out
that the run of "Aida" at the Ahmanson Theatre played only six
performances in 2002, closing on Jan. 5. The rules of the Los
Angeles-based NAACP competition require nominees to have at least
eight performances during the period of eligibility, which began Jan.
1 and ended Aug. 31.</LD>
<TE>   "Aida" producer and Disney Theatrical Productions President Thomas
Schumacher said in a statement: "We are so honored to have been
nominated. We're sorry that because of the technicality, we're no
longer eligible. We celebrate all the nominees and winners."</TE>
<TE>   Of course Aida, the character, has seen darker days -- at one
point in the musical, she and her lover are buried alive.</TE>

Seven Dwarfs" at the Geffen Playhouse through Dec. 29.</LD>
<LD>   Singing live during performances are writer/director/star Debbie
Allen (Queen), Natalia Johnson (Pearl), Matthew Dickens (Ringmaster)
and Michele Morgan (Virtual Shirley), as well as the chorus of little
"Dwowns." But they are also backed up by their own voices on tape.
Vivian Nixon, who played Pearl earlier in the run, also sang live
with her own recorded voice.</LD>
<TE>   This is hardly an unprecedented practice, but it's often
associated with big extravaganzas such as "Phantom of the Opera." In
the smaller-scaled "Pearl," however, "some numbers require the kind
of movement that would preclude getting a good sound while out of
breath," said Geffen producing director Gilbert Cates.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with fooling the audience," he added.</TE>

<HD>It's official at Martha Graham</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Revving up for a whole new phase of its existence, the Martha Graham
Center for Contemporary Dance made official this week the working
arrangement that had placed longtime Graham dancers Terese Capucilli
and Christine Dakin at the head of the recently reconstituted Martha
Graham Dance Company. Capucilli and Dakin both now carry the title of
artistic directors of the company while remaining on the faculty at
the Graham school in New York.</LD>
<LD>   Also prominent in the center's plans will be Los Angeles-based
Janet Eilber, a former Graham principal who was the leading candidate
to be artistic director during the center's wrangles with Graham heir
and former company artistic director Ron Protas. Eilber will be
artistic director of the newly created Martha Graham Resources,
organized to license and stage Graham's works for other companies and
to preserve and make available a 76-year collection of sets,
costumes, audio and video recordings, photos and correspondence.
Eilber plans to stay in L.A.</LD>
<TE>   The center's legal conflicts with Protas culminated earlier this
year with a federal judge awarding ownership of most of Graham's
choreography and production materials to the center. A Protas appeal
is still in progress, but this new spate of center activity reflects
a desire for what executive director Marvin Preston calls "increased
public awareness and participation. Our goal is financial strength
and durability which will support a growing amount of artistic risk
taking."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An early Christmas present recently reached Liviu Marinescu, the new
chairman of composition and theory at Cal State Northridge.</LD>
<LD>   Marinescu, 32, found out he's one of 12 American composers to
receive a prestigious 2002 Fromm Music Foundation commission to write
a new work. Selected from a field of 150 applicants by a panel of
composers, Marinescu and the others each will receive a $10,000
commission fee, plus a subsidy for the ensemble performing the
premiere of the new work.</LD>
<LD>   "The award is not necessarily about me," Marinescu said. "It's a
validation of the kind of music that I write, that we young composers
write.</LD>
<TE>   "That means concert music that is intellectually stimulating,
aesthetically pleasing and emotionally fulfilling. Trying to find
that balance is probably the most difficult thing for us today."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Romania, Marinescu came to the United States eight years
ago at the invitation of Edwin London, conductor of the Cleveland
Chamber Symphony, which performed a number of Marinescu's works.</TE>
<TE>   Marinescu's music ranges from solo instrument sonatas to large
orchestral pieces and includes film scores and music for plays.</TE>
<TE>   For the Fromm commission, Marinescu said he plans to write a large
orchestral work lasting about 15 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He expects to finish the score within two years.</TE>

<HD>J. Lo's ethnic sleight-of-hand</HD>
<DH>Just like her 'Maid in Manhattan' character, the star slips
her 'Latin-ness' on and off at will.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Baz Dreisinger</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Applying the adage "art imitates life" to Jennifer Lopez's latest
commodity, her new film, "Maid in Manhattan," is wrong on two counts:
J. Lo's media-hyped rags-to-riches story is more myth than life, and
"Maid in Manhattan" is more fodder than art.</LD>
<LD>   Nonetheless, the film can't help but reference reality. It serves
up derriere jokes by the dozen as well as gratuitous shots of the No.
6 train (for which Lopez named her first album). It features J. Lo
making waves at the ball by way of a scandalous, cleavage-friendly
dress -- a dress not quite as scandalous as the J. Lo dress from the
2000 Grammys, but close enough.</LD>
<LD>   And the movie, which was No. 1 at the box office last weekend,
selling $18.7 million worth of tickets, revolves around a question
easily applicable to the real-life Lopez: Who's that girl? More
precisely, to what race or ethnicity does that girl belong?</LD>
<TE>   Plentiful shots of the Bronx's Jerome Avenue and a smattering of
Spanish last names drive home that Lopez's character, Marisa, is
Latina. But to Ralph Fiennes' character, who takes her for a hotel
guest instead of a maid, Marisa is "kind of Mediterranean looking";
to a jealous socialite at the hotel, Marisa is a blue-blood
Hamptonite.</TE>
<TE>   The film climaxes when Fiennes learns the truth about Marisa's
class and ethnicity (which, in typical Hollywood fashion, are
presented as one and the same).</TE>
<TE>   And here, you insist, lies the line between fact and fiction.
Could we possibly have any doubt as to Lopez's real-life origin?
She's "Jenny from the block"! She can be found "on the 6"! Her albums
feature Spanish tracks, and her videos showcase famous Latino 'hoods
(the South Bronx and Spanish Harlem). Doesn't all this make J. Lo the
poster gal for Puerto Rican America?</TE>
<TE>   Well, sort of. Although J. Lo's musical persona has her featuring
"B" -- for "Bronx" and "Boricua" (Spanish slang for Puerto Rican) --
like a scarlet letter, her identity as a movie star has been far more
indistinct. She's been Mexican ("Selena") and now Puerto Rican, but
also Italian ("The Wedding Planner"), generically "ethnic" ("Out of
Sight") and plain old white ("The Cell"). Like other famous Latin
actors -- Rita Hayworth, for instance -- Lopez has been a big-screen
chameleon.</TE>
<TE>   Such plays on race and ethnicity are a part of Hollywood history,
from Al Jolson's blackface routine in "The Jazz Singer" to Andy
Garcia's turn as an Italian mob boss in "The Godfather Part III." But
unlike earlier films, "Maid in Manhattan" seems intensely aware of
its ethnic commentary. Lopez is told that a good maid remains
invisible, a word echoed like a mantra throughout the film -- just as
it is in Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man," a novel about the way
people of color are at once hyper-visible and hyper-invisible. The
outfit Lopez wears upon meeting Fiennes, the one responsible for
passing her off as a high-class guest, as a white guest, is itself
white -- so starkly white that passersby comment on it, and Lopez
fears sullying it.</TE>
<TE>   The film, then, is self-consciously about passing from Latin to
WASP to Latin again -- a theme that runs through Lopez's film career
but also, I'd say, her real-life persona.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, she's marked by liberal use of tanning cream, an
"urban" clothing line and a proclivity for what she's described as
"ghetto fabulous" fashions. On the other hand, Lopez pulls off
European designers with the best of them, occasionally eases up on
the self-tanner, and -- I can't help but notice -- features a line of
boyfriends that gets lighter and lighter (Sean "P. Diddy" Combs,
Chris Judd, and now Ben Affleck).</TE>
<TE>   None of this is to say, of course, that "Latin" and "WASP" can be
defined in such superficial terms. But in the context of a public
persona, superficialities are all we have to work with.</TE>
<TE>   And the truth is, this public persona -- Lopez's tendency to slip
in and out of an ethnic role -- seems reflective of something larger.
While Lopez flip-flops between Euro and Latin, other pop culture
darlings -- Christina Aguilera and Raquel Welch, for instance --
learn Spanish for new roles or album tracks, visit their "homelands"
and -- voila! -- are reborn as Latina.</TE>
<TE>   These performers prove that ethnicity is not such a stable entity.
If "Latin-ness" can be taken on and off, sported for one film or
video shoot and then discarded for another, then how absolute can it
be?</TE>
<TE>   James Baldwin once declared that whiteness is America's greatest
invention and its most profound lie. He meant that racial categories
are not biological but social, that they shift from decade to decade,
century to century. The Jews and the Irish, for instance, were once
considered separate, nonwhite races but have since found their home
in the "white (but sometimes ethnic)" category.</TE>
<TE>   If we are now in the midst of another shift in such groupings,
then perhaps Hollywood trends, and even "Maid in Manhattan," reflect
a significant cultural change. And wouldn't this be a relief? It
would transform our -- well, America's -- J. Lo obsession from
prurient gossip to bona-fide cultural studies.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Rock's bright new day</HD>
<DH>Thanks to urgent, passionate bands, the future looks
exciting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A new train pulled into the rock 'n' roll station this year, and
anyone who didn't climb aboard missed a lot. This new music -- served
up by such bands as the White Stripes, the Strokes, the Hives and the
Vines -- reflected the passion and craft that made rock 'n' roll
worth caring about originally.</LD>
<LD>   It's easy for skeptics to say even the most modestly promising
band would be intriguing against the drudgery of a rock scene
dominated by such lifeless fare as Limp Bizkit and Creed.</LD>
<LD>   But there were lots of reminders during 2002 of rock 'n' roll
excellence -- thanks to acclaimed tours by such landmark figures as
Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney.
None of these concerts, however, was more thrilling than the series
of shows the White Stripes gave last summer in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   The Stripes' music is smart, witty, sensual, tender and explosive
-- rooted in the urgent blues of Robert Johnson and seasoned with the
independence and daring of a host of other influences that range from
Dylan to Johnny Cash. (The Stripes' "White Blood Cells" album isn't
on the Top 10 list below because it was released in 2001 and was
second only to Dylan's "Love and Theft" on that year's list).</TE>
<TE>   The best of the others in this movement, which draws heavily from
the urgency of punk and the tuneful raggedness of garage-rock, also
asserted themselves in ways that frequently captivate.</TE>
<TE>   What's encouraging about all this is that record executives are so
excited by these bands that they are searching the countryside for
more in the style. Twelve months ago, labels routinely passed over
these acts because they didn't seem to fit in with what was selling.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, some industry observers wonder if all this fresh energy
will spread to the mainstream. The test will be with new releases --
the first due in April from the White Stripes. The momentum from
"White Blood Cells" should be enough to give it a Top 10 entry onto
the charts. Then, it's up to the music. If it lives up to the promise
of "Blood Cells," the train will really pick up steam -- and the ride
will really get wild.</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hilburn's top 10 of 2002</TE>
<TE>   Eminem and Beck have little in common as recording artists except
for their sheer creative brilliance -- but that's enough to place
this odd couple at the top of my list of the year's most compelling
albums. Eminem is a public brawler, most commanding when he's
reacting with ridicule or wit to the hostility around him. Beck is
more a private person, touching us most deeply when he is trying to
make peace with himself and his surroundings. Ties aren't always
satisfying in rating favorites, but a tie in this case is the most
honest and fitting impulse -- a reminder of the ability of pop music
to touch us in such varied ways.</TE>
<TE>   1. Eminem's "The Eminem Show" (Interscope/Aftermath/Shady). When
this album was released in May, there was grumbling that Eminem was
repeating himself because many of the characters from his earlier
recordings are back. But the Detroit rapper brings a new
understanding and maturity to his subjects. In key moments, he says
goodbye to some demons, reaching forward with hard-earned optimism
and even gratitude. He can still rap with the fury of an angry pit
bull, yet touch us by sharing the soul-destroying ache of a youngster
abandoned by his parents. For all the controversy around Eminem's
unsettling images, he has always said the music is meant to inspire,
and that intent has never been more apparent than it is here.</TE>
<TE>   1. Beck's "Sea Change" (Geffen). For most of his first decade as a
pop figure, Beck kept a shield around his feelings. He wrote about
the disorientation of youth, but his primary weapons were irony and
wit, not confession. And he delighted in framing the songs in a
hip-hop energy that deflected even further the sense of personal
testimony in the music. In "Sea Change," the folk-flavored
singer-songwriter strips everything bare in an album so poignant and
naked that it may eventually rank with such haunting emotional
exorcisms as Joni Mitchell's "Blue" and Neil Young's "Tonight's the
Night." The songs, written after the breakup of a longtime
relationship, are so personal that Beck waited almost two years
before he felt comfortable sharing them on an album.</TE>
<TE>   3. Bright Eyes' "Lifted or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear
to the Ground" (Saddle Creek). There's always something exciting
about a young singer-songwriter who sees the world with fresh eyes
and is willing to swing for the fences. Conor Oberst, 22, sings with
a spirit that reminds you of Bob Dylan's early assault on the pop
consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   4. Norah Jones' "Come Away With Me" (Blue Note). There are lots of
great voices in pop, but few great singers. Jones has enough feel for
country that she can hook you with a Hank Williams song, then enough
sophistication that she can lure you with Hoagy Carmichael and Ned
Washington's "The Nearness of You."</TE>
<TE>   5. The Roots' "Phrenology" (MCA). This Philadelphia outfit has
been a smart, inventive, positive force in rap for years, but this is
its finest work -- a 77-minute celebration of hip-hop culture that is
philosophical without being preachy, fun without being frivolous,
warm without being soft.</TE>
<TE>   6. Ryan Adams' "Demolition" (Lost Highway). This North Carolina
native can be bratty and narcissistic, but his tales of desolation
and desire hit deep and hard, framed in styles ranging from
bittersweet pop to fearless blues.</TE>
<TE>   7. Bruce Springsteen's "The Rising" (Columbia). There is too much
generic material here to make it one of Springsteen's best albums,
but the eloquence and sincerity in the key post-9/11 reflections give
the album an undeniable power and comfort.</TE>
<TE>   8. Wilco's "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot" (Nonesuch). Jeff Tweedy and
mates combine folk, pop and ambient elements in a bold, original way
that captures marvelously the oppressive moments of melancholy and
self-doubt.</TE>
<TE>   9. The Hives' "Your New Favourite Band" (Poptones import). This
inspired update of '60s garage-rock exuberance is the 2002 album most
likely to put a smile on your face.</TE>
<TE>   10. The Streets' "Original Pirate Material" (Vice). In his
high-speed raps, Mike Skinner (a.k.a. the Streets) captures the
energy and anxiety of British youth with a wryness approaching Johnny
Rotten and an insight that recalls Pete Townshend.</TE>

<HD>Carefully, Glass goes Hollywood</HD>
<DH>The often controversial composer says he's choosy when it
comes to film work. Over the decades he's amassed an impressive body
of work. 'The Hours' is his latest.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no middle ground with Philip Glass. His musical trademarks
-- the cyclical phrases, the rapid arpeggios, the sparse melodies --
are hypnotic and haunting to some, irritating and monotonous to
others.</LD>
<LD>   In the movie world, however, the issue is a little more complex.
Because music is just one of several disciplines featured
simultaneously and our attention is rarely on the score itself,
Glass' music for films has tended to be less controversial. His music
for "Koyaanisqatsi" (1983) is a classic among modern documentary
films, and his Tibetan-influenced score for Martin Scorsese's
"Kundun" (1997) was Oscar-nominated.</LD>
<LD>   But Glass is not a film composer per se, someone who, like Jerry
Goldsmith or John Williams, is best known for his movie music. Glass,
like John Corigliano and Tan Dun, is a New York-based concert hall
composer who also has an active career in films.</LD>
<TE>   "I came to film writing fairly late, in my 40s," Glass said
recently, visiting Los Angeles to promote his latest film, "The
Hours." "But I started writing for the theater when I was in my 20s.
I'm on my 20th opera now. I've done a dozen ballets. So working in
theater, in dance, in opera -- all these categories are the same, in
that they depend on the interaction of four elements: text, image,
movement and music. I see film as a species of theater."</TE>
<TE>   Glass, 65, is so busy with other projects that he can afford to be
choosy about his collaborators. For documentary filmmaker Godfrey
Reggio, he has done five films in the last 25 years, starting with
"Koyaanisqatsi" and including, most recently, this year's
"Naqoyqatsi". He has scored documentaries for Errol Morris (including
1988's "The Thin Blue Line"). For director Paul Schrader, he did
"Mishima" in 1985. And he wrote the music for "Kundun" because of his
friendship with screenwriter Melissa Mathison -- and his passion for
the project impressed Scorsese.</TE>
<TE>   Glass finds L.A.'s atmosphere inviting, particularly among
composers. "This is a much more collegial community than the music
communities in New York, Paris and London," he says. "The new-music
world in New York is divided into camps. You have to wave a white
flag if you want to go across and talk to somebody. I don't have that
feeling when I'm here. These people will talk to each other, and I
like that."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount, distributor of "The Hours," is pressing hard for
Hollywood to pay attention. The film, which stars Meryl Streep,
Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore, has major awards potential and
appears a likely contender in several Oscar and Golden Globe
categories, including best original score.</TE>
<TE>   Glass' music for "The Hours" -- vastly different, stylistically
speaking, from the average Hollywood film score -- plays a key role
in bridging three interwoven tales from different decades, and its
presence is felt throughout the film, which is adapted from the
award-winning novel by Michael Cunningham. Written not for a standard
orchestra, but for piano and a large string section, it serves as the
connective tissue among the seemingly disparate story lines, yet
rarely comments on the action in any overtly emotional manner.</TE>
<TE>   According to "Hours" director Stephen Daldry, finding the right
music wasn't easy. "We had always wanted some sort of modal,
minimalist music," he says by phone from London, confirming that
Oscar winner Stephen Warbeck ("Shakespeare in Love") and composer
Michael Nyman ("The Piano") had taken stabs at it without success.
"We explored lots of different styles, different sorts of composers,
but we kept on coming back to Philip Glass."</TE>
<TE>   Glass' existing music accounted for much of the temporary score,
and "every time we didn't put Philip on, the film itself seemed to
reject the music," Daldry says. "What wasn't working was any music
that seemed to predetermine an emotional response to the scenes."</TE>
<TE>   So producer Scott Rudin asked Glass to look at the film and write
new music for it. "I looked at it and said, 'This is really good. I
want to do this,' " the composer says with a laugh. "It was a very
easy sell."</TE>
<TE>   What appealed to him was "the idea that a book can have a
tremendous impact on people's lives. It's about how art changes the
world."</TE>
<TE>   The film's unusual structure, thematically linking a despondent
Virginia Woolf in mid-1920s England to a confused housewife in
post-World War II Los Angeles to a depressed editor in the modern-day
New York literary establishment whose best friend is dying of AIDS,
also suggested to him that music would have "a special role to play."</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it would be a mistake to have different music for each
period," Glass explained. "My idea was that the music would serve as
a bridge to bring the three pieces together."</TE>
<TE>   Daldry felt that Glass' music struck all the right notes.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked very hard to make sure that the scenes themselves were
not sentimental, that there would always be a complicated emotional
reaction to the film," Daldry said. "With a traditional film score,
you would restrict the potential for a broad emotional response.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than just supporting, or accentuating, the emotional
rhythms that are already there, Philip creates another thematic
layer, so that the music provides at certain moments a subtextual
stream of consciousness that actually deepens the movie, where other
music would trivialize it. It allows a dialectic between the music
and the image that allows both to live and breathe."</TE>
<TE>   Not a Hollywood name</TE>
<TE>   Glass' relationship with Hollywood has been, at best, hit and
miss. A glance at his filmography shows a smattering of name
directors (Scorsese, Schrader, Peter Greenaway, Christopher Hampton),
the documentarians (Morris, Reggio) and a variety of other arty
types. He's not a Hollywood favorite.</TE>
<TE>   For "The Truman Show," director Peter Weir licensed several
existing Glass compositions, and although Glass wrote some new music
for the film, the bulk of the picture was scored by another composer.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who's going to do a chase movie or a hostage movie
doesn't automatically think of me," Glass says. "I don't get a lot of
calls for films like that. In fact, I don't get any," he adds with
another laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "I pick films that interest me, filmmakers that interest me, and
films that have quality to them," although he points out that such
decisions don't always guarantee works of art. "I've been fooled a
couple of times by what happened," he says, a reference to seemingly
odd choices like the score he composed for the 1992 thriller
"Candyman."</TE>
<TE>   Reggio has worked with Glass on film projects for 25 years;
"Naqoyqatsi" concludes a trilogy that examined the impact of
technology on civilization. In a rare partnership between director
and composer, their films featured no narration, only imagery and
music. "Naqoyqatsi" also featured cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma.</TE>
<TE>   Reggio, by phone from his home in Santa Fe, N.M., says he thinks
that the "minimalist" label that has dogged Glass for years is a
misnomer. He calls it "metamorphic music, music that freed the viewer
to go to his or her own place. I found it extraordinarily powerful,
the equivalent of having a spiritual or religious experience."</TE>
<TE>   So when planning "Koyaanisqatsi," Reggio decided, "What better
music to have than something that had ambiguity built into its form,
and the freedom to allow the listener to [decide] themselves what
this meant."</TE>
<TE>   Glass likes collaborating with other artists and, in most cases,
has not felt restricted by the precise musical needs of film or
battered by the usual Hollywood ego trips. In Tokyo while Schrader
was filming "Mishima," Glass asked the director where the music
should go. "He took the script, threw it across the table, and said,
'You tell me where it goes.' That was really nice."</TE>
<TE>   And on "Kundun," when Glass told Scorsese that "the music has to
be a doorway between our culture and the culture that's disappeared,
and I think I know how to do this," Scorsese simply said, "OK."</TE>
<TE>   Glass acknowledges that his style won't be right for every film,
although he points out that "within that style there's a fairly big
range, the difference between the music in 'Mishima' and 'Powaqqatsi'
[1988] or 'Kundun' and 'The Secret Agent' [1996]. The thing about
having a personal approach to music is, it's usually associated with
someone who has developed a musical personality and has something to
say. That's not a bad thing."</TE>
<TE>   Glass quietly concedes that he wouldn't mind winning an Academy
Award. It's not outside the realm of possibility, considering the
Oscar has gone to two "classical" composers in the last three years
(Corigliano for "The Red Violin," Tan Dun for "Crouching Tiger,
Hidden Dragon") and that the roster of past winners has included such
20th century musical luminaries as Aaron Copland ("The Heiress"),
Malcolm Arnold ("The Bridge on the River Kwai") and Erich Wolfgang
Korngold ("The Adventures of Robin Hood").</TE>
<TE>   "I was so happy to go to [the Oscars for] 'Kundun,' " he says. "It
was the year of 'Titanic.' I went there knowing that I couldn't win.
Then [the next year] I went to the Golden Globes, and we won for 'The
Truman Show.' And I said to the woman who eventually became my wife,
'You know, winning is fun. I like winning.' "</TE>

<LD>The year unfolded in translucent panes of alabaster that filtered
bright L.A. sunlight into sepia tones and turned a new building into
a cathedral. It whistled in from space, a composer's ear tuning ours
to the cosmos. Closer to the skin, it sang insistently: "The Story Is
in the Soil Keep Your Ear to the Ground."</LD>
<LD>   At its best, 2002 in the arts and architecture offered a
transformative vision. At its worst, it served up the mundane, the
unfulfilled promise. Our critics scan the year's offerings for both.</LD>

<HD>It's all coming back to her</HD>
<DH>For one critic, the best films -- or film fragments -- were
the ones that played over and over in her head.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the end, the films that made my list of favorites are the ones
that stayed in my head the longest. The truth is that yesterday my
top 10 list looked completely different; tomorrow it might be
somewhat, even radically changed since my favorites are continually
shifting place, jostling one another out of the way. My favorites are
the films that I carried around with me and continually replayed,
revisiting favorite scenes and talking them over obsessively with
friends.</LD>
<LD>   The other truth is that some of my favorite performances of the
year were in films that would never have made my final cut. There's
Viola Davis' shocking, nearly wordless brief turn in "Antwone Fisher"
and Raymond J. Barry as the lunatic who claims to have killed John F.
Kennedy in "Interview With the Assassin." There's Maggie Gyllenhaal's
beautiful loser finding herself in "Secretary," and Catherine Keener
taking possession of "Full Frontal" and the aptly titled "Lovely &amp;
Amazing." (You have to wonder why studios haven't rewarded this
terrific actress with big commercial parts. Does she scare them?)
Finally, and most powerfully, there is Daniel Day-Lewis' bloody
butcher redeeming Martin Scorsese from the folly and waste of "Gangs
of New York."</LD>
<TE>   These performances linger, as do these fragments: Matt Damon's
amnesiac spy in "The Bourne Identity" realizing that, like Keanu
Reeves in "The Matrix," he knows kung fu. The camera- man who loses
his nerve, and the shot, when the then-imprisoned Suge Knight comes
strolling toward him and director Nick Broomfield in "Biggie &amp;
Tupac." Ryan Gosling, nostrils flaring and biceps curled, making like
the young Robert De Niro in "The Believer." De Niro making like one
of the Three Stooges in "Analyze That." Warhorse Clint Eastwood
loping through the frame in "Blood Work." The boys and girls of Los
Angeles' endless summer swooping across the city's empty swimming
pools in "Dogtown and Z-Boys." The opening car chase in "The
Transporter" that, somehow, leads directly to the squirrel that's off
his nut in "Ice Age."</TE>

<TE>   Manohla Dargis' top films of 2002</TE>
<TE>   "About Schmidt." Alexander Payne's generous-hearted, soulfully
funny journey in and out of the American heart of darkness finds Jack
Nicholson, as a recently retired insurance man, giving his greatest
performance of the past two decades, proof that it wasn't the star
who got small -- it was his movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Blissfully Yours." Written and directed by a young Thai filmmaker
named Apichatpong Weerasethakul, this languidly paced idyll follows
two Thai women and an illegal Burmese worker out of the bustle of the
modern city and into a mysterious, lushly primeval landscape. The
movie screened at the AFI film festival.</TE>
<TE>   "Far From Heaven." Todd Haynes' magnificent obsessive elegy for
classic Hollywood melodrama elevates the writer-director to the upper
reaches of the country's filmmaking fraternity. Look for the DVD
version in which Julianne Moore's recently liberated housewife and
Dennis Haysbert's seductively earthy gardener find biracial beatnik
happiness in Greenwich Village.</TE>
<TE>   "Femme Fatale." This is the film in which Brian De Palma finally
stopped being so freaked out by women and decided to succumb to them.
Wildly entertaining (and wildly sexy), this mash note to the
pleasures of cinema and the beauty of the female beast not only marks
the director's best work in 10 years; it also stands among his
greatest accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "In Praise of Love." This sublime film from Jean-Luc Godard, one
of the art's true visionaries, opened in this country to some
critical hand-wringing about its anti-Americanism that has seemed all
the sillier (and shriller) in the months since. It's too early to
call it a masterpiece, but check in again in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Japon."Shot in breathtaking B&amp;W Super CinemaScope, this feature
debut from Carlos Reygadas traces a journey of a middle-aged Christ
figure whose voyage into the Mexican countryside becomes a meditation
on the ecstasies and terrors of the natural world. The film screened
at the American Cinematheque.</TE>
<TE>   "The Pianist." Roman Polanski's film lays bare the destruction of
European Jewry with devastating power and intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Piano Teacher." This film about a repressed piano teacher who
falls for one of her students isn't easy to like, but likability has
never been a requisite for art. German director Michael Haneke has a
needlessly cold, even clinical heart but all is forgiven whenever his
camera turns to Isabelle Huppert, whose gnashing fury turns the
teacher into a creature of both terror and pity.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Out." Beautifully played and woefully under-seen, this taut
emotional thriller about a middle-class Frenchman who pretends to
have a job long after he's been fired was inspired by a tragic true
story. Director Laurent Cantet has a sense of suspense that's worthy
of Hitchcock, and he brings to the film a deep, anguished morality
that's otherwise lacking in his protagonist's consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "Y Tu Mama Tambien." Director Alfonso Cuaron's exuberant, sensual
road movie is about the pleasures of turning on your mind as well as
your body, and is a perfect fusion of style and substance. The
director has been tapped for the next "Harry Potter" feature, which,
in light of the scorching hot menage a trois at the center of "Y Tu
Mama," should raise some fascinating possibilities for Harry, Ron and
Hermione.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, my cheat of an entry: "Minority Report" -- but only
until the scene in which Tom Cruise shoots the guy in the hotel room.
Darkly foreboding, the film opens exciting new territory for
Spielberg that it promptly slams shut once Cruise leaves the hotel
room, trading Samantha Morton's moist pre-cog for a dubious domestic
Arcadia.</TE>

<TE>   Why wasn't I "Swept Away"? The "Signs" were murky. "Storytelling"
too. "No Such Thing" was exactly that. "24 Hour Party People" was 24
too many. There's something programmatic about "Human Nature." I saw
the "Hollywood Ending" in the first act. "High Crimes" were clearly
committed. "Spider-Man" didn't swing. "Punch-Drunk Love" didn't
swoon. "Tadpole" flopped. "The Time Machine" broke. "The Cat's Meow"
wasn't. "Morvern Caller" made me holler. "We Were Soldiers" but
rarely men. "The Road to Perdition" went on and on. "The Sweetest
Thing" left a bitter taste. "One Hour Photo" never developed. "The
Rules of Attraction" only repulsed. "Frida" was paint by numbers.
"The 25th Hour" was long overdue. We never did get out of that "Panic
Room." "All or Nothing" but mostly nothing. None of those creeps
really "Talk to Her." "Adaptation" is the sincerest form of
self-flattery. The "Gangs of New York" just broke my heart.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Near and far, on a treasure hunt</HD>
<DH>Good Latin music still emanates from the expected places.
But some of the best is being made in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Agustin Gurza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the record business down sharply in 2002, some observers
suddenly seem depressed about the prospects of Latin music. Shakira
is the only one riding high, but she dyed her hair blond and changed
to English to get there.</LD>
<LD>   In good years and bad, however, finding the best Latin albums is
always a bit of a treasure hunt. Some great works, such as an
exquisite collection of trova tunes by Cuba's premier singer Issac
Delgado, aren't even released in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Others, such as the edgy ska-cum-candombe by Uruguay's feisty La
Vela Puerca, get released but not promoted.</LD>
<TE>   The big news of 2002 was right under our noses. More than half of
my top 10 Latin albums were made in the USA. These six entries by
exiles and immigrants, by West Coast Chicanos and East Coast Cubans,
mark a milestone, because U.S.-based artists are historically
overshadowed by their Latin American counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Chicanos had an especially strong year, led by the melodic,
thoughtful and committed Afro-jarocho fusion of Quetzal, a mature,
multicultural group from East L.A. And from Austin, Texas,
singer-songwriter Alejandro Escovedo recorded his gorgeous, evocative
music from the immigrant-themed play "By the Hand of the Father." Two
Miami-based artists also made memorable albums in 2002: Veteran
singer-songwriter Albita with her most rootsy and intimate work to
date, and Bacilos, a new trio with a smart and lyrical brand of
folk/pop.</TE>
<TE>   The year also gave us stirring new albums by three of the greatest
pop poets in the Spanish-speaking world -- Panama's Ruben Blades,
Spain's Joan Manuel Serrat and Cuba's Silvio Rodriguez. This lofty
troika alone offered a year's worth of soul-nourishing sounds. It was
especially gratifying to see the witty and insightful Serrat back in
top form.</TE>
<TE>   In his masterful, multicultural "Mundo," Blades delivers the best
album of his stellar career, a sweeping, spellbinding exploration of
global music. Another SoCal resident, percussionist Alex Acuna,
offered an uplifting, contemporary take on Afro-folk music from his
native land, featuring Lima's captivating criolla vocalist, Eva
Ayllon.</TE>
<TE>   Salsa did not have its best year in 2002. Even the Cubans were
uncharacteristically quiet, with rare exceptions such as flutist
Maraca's "Tremenda Rumba." By far the most arresting album arising
from the Cuban diaspora was the rap/rock/rumba fusion of Orishas, a
trio of Paris expatriates. Titled "Emigrante," it's bursting with
originality, passion and beauty.</TE>
<TE>   The same is true of the brilliant debut by Colombian
singer-songwriter Cabas, who offers by turns tender, satirical and
hopeful songs in a fluid cumbia-rock fusion.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>When's the next intake of breath?</HD>
<DH>Jazz ingenuity hits a lull, but some pleasures manage to
make their way into recordings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This was an exhale year for jazz, a period of relatively low energy.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, the summer's minimal jazz events at the Hollywood
Bowl were balanced by the announcement of promising new series of
jazz and world music at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2003. The
Southland's performing arts centers offered attractive, if not
especially innovative, jazz concerts, and (with a few exceptions) the
numerous clubs continued to present programs of familiar names.</LD>
<LD>   Similarly, the year's album releases reflected a high quality of
achievement without signaling any vital creative breakthrough.</LD>
<TE>   Here's my list of the 10 CDs from 2002 that I found most
compelling.</TE>
<TE>   Start with a pair of stunningly different vocal performances:</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Barber's "Verse." A career-defining collection of
original songs in which Barber creates an artful blend of lyrics and
music, framed in a literary perspective, for delivery as a jazz
performance. A remarkable accomplishment.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Krall's "Live in Paris." Recorded as part of a DVD/video
performance, this spirited outing reveals a spontaneous, jazz-alive
Krall too rarely present in recent albums.</TE>
<TE>   Next, two rapidly emerging piano talents:</TE>
<TE>   Jason Moran's "Modernistic." This 27-year-old displays
extraordinary versatility in a program reaching from James P. Johnson
to "Body and Soul" to John Cage-like piano-string manipulations.</TE>
<TE>   Renee Rosnes' "Life on Earth." Equally eclectic, Rosnes blends
world percussion with her jazz ensemble, persuasively taking jazz
across cultural boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   Add a group of releases from jazz veterans:</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Shorter's "Footprints Live!"  Shorter, energized by the
playing of pianist Danilo Perez, drummer Brian Blade and bassist John
Patitucci, produces his most inventive playing in years.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Holland's "What Goes Around." Despite relative inexperience
with writing for a large group, bassist Holland has put together a
set of material for a 13-piece band that resonates with the clarity
and improvisational inventiveness of his small group.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Hill's "A Beautiful Day." Pianist Hill also takes on a
large ensemble assignment, investing it with the edgy, avant-garde
adventurousness of his keyboard work.</TE>
<TE>   "Ray Brown, Monty Alexander, Russell Malone." What is apparently
Brown's last studio recording happily recalls his trio work with
Oscar Peterson, enhanced by the electric presence of Malone's
sterling guitar.</TE>
<TE>   And wrap it up with a pair of indefinable but exhilarating
outings:</TE>
<TE>   Jane Bunnett and Others'  "Spirituals and Dedications."
Enterprising saxophonist Bunnett, with the able assistance of Stanley
Cowell, Dewey Redman and others, shifts her allegiance from Cuban
music for an absorbing exploration of the spiritual roots of jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Gino Sitson's "Song Zin' ..." He's from Cameroon and can best be
described as a second-generation Bobby McFerrin, with added African
seasoning -- a creator of rhythmically mesmerizing vocal panoramas.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Time for a 'reality' check</HD>
<DH>As unscripted shows proliferate, authenticity becomes a
memory. If only TV copied documentary makers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>How much "reality" can America take? A heap of it, we were reminded
in 2002 as television went on another of its copycat binges, pouring
forth entertainment programs erroneously titled "reality." From
"Survivor" progeny on CBS to "The Osbournes" on MTV, at least the
glut is real.</LD>
<LD>   Excess is one of TV's most cherished traditions, with programmers'
zest for sending in the clones as an alternative to creativity
extending back to the 1950s. That era's prime time teemed with
westerns, 31 in the 1958-59 season alone. Quiz-show herds also
stampeded across the airwaves en masse during that decade, delivering
theater not unlike today's "reality" snake oil.</LD>
<LD>   Then, as now, many viewers embraced and thought of as extended
families the ordinary people who became celebrities while trying to
earn big bucks on TV. But just as some quiz shows turned out to be
rigged, today's "reality" programs are also not as authentic as
they're cracked up to be.</LD>
<TE>   "Unscripted," perhaps, but nothing more. That goes even for "The
Osbournes," whom devotees point to as providing the purest viewing
experience of the lot. Yet how much so? You try being real with
cameras in your face, TV cable at your feet and production crews
crowding your space.</TE>
<TE>   The ordinary can be extraordinary, however.</TE>
<TE>   That was affirmed decades ago by such documentary filmmakers as
the Maysles brothers (Albert and David) and Frederick Wiseman when
they pioneered a variation on cinema verite that shunned voice-overs
and supplementary visuals while entrusting the narrative entirely to
the camera and its subjects. Although every close-up camera alters
reality, theirs never seemed to trespass, and their films were
acclaimed as honest and straightforward.</TE>
<TE>   Compare that with today's gotcha, caught-on-tape, self-consciously
voyeuristic programs, and with newscasters being deployed as tawdry
peddlers on their behalf. To say nothing of footage molded into
entertainment under the pretense that its selective "reality" yields
sociological heft and insight into human behaviors. What a crock.</TE>
<TE>   Will all of this faux "reality" vanish in 2003? Sure, when the
Osbournes turn into the Osmonds.</TE>

<TE>   Howard Rosenberg's highs and lows of 2002</TE>
<TE>   From cable to consolidation, television has changed dramatically
through the years. Yet in some ways, it hasn't changed at all. It was
as bipolar as ever in 2002, for instance. Lots to praise, lots to
disparage, as the following balance sheet affirms:</TE>
<TE>   High -- "Monk." Terrified by germs, he avoids crowds and all
physical contact, showers three times a day, sterilizes his
toothbrush in boiling water and stores his socks in plastic bags.
He's also a neatness freak, unable to pass a crooked picture on a
wall without straightening it. Nothing on TV in 2002 generated more
fun than this witty, inspired sleeper of a USA Network series (rerun
on ABC) starring Tony Shalhoub as a severely obsessive-compulsive
detective, and Bitty Schram as his minder and source of moist
towelettes that he requires when halted in his tracks by
bacteria-driven panic attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Low -- "The Anna Nicole Show" on E! Entertainment. Was this former
stripper and Playboy Playmate really an imbecile or just playing one
on TV? A half-hour of her "reality" series passed like a half day.
The camera captured past-her-prime Anna Nicole looking like Moby-Dick
in drag while slurring her words and appearing as high (on something)
as her IQ was low. Moment to cherish? When someone mentioned suicide
bombers in Israel, a perplexed Anna Nicole wondered aloud: "Who's
killing Jews?" Although her show was never able to define itself,
"stupid" seemed to apply.</TE>
<TE>   High -- Actor-comedian Shelly Berman, still funny after all these
years, as Larry David's befuddled father in a wickedly brilliant
episode of HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm" that found him keeping from
Larry (with the best of intentions) the death of his mother. Son:
"Tell me, how's Mom doin'?" Father: "Well ... you know how people
do."</TE>
<TE>   Low -- "A Season on the Brink" was an utterly numbing account of
volcanic basketball coach Bobby Knight's 1985-86 championship season
with the University of Indiana Hoosiers. Even with Brian Dennehy
glowering and seething, this ESPN movie somehow managed to make
Knight tedious. There was anger. There was raging. There was
chair-throwing. All of it from viewers.</TE>
<TE>   High -- Ryan Gosling's striking work in "The Believer," a Henry
Bean film on Showtime. The script sagged in key spots, but never
Gosling's complex, chillingly persuasive portrait of a neo-Nazi
skinhead and Jewish anti-Semite whose soaring IQ and silver tongue
made him the most dangerous kind of twisted fanatic.</TE>
<TE>   Low -- "Monica in Black and White." There surely were reasons
beyond titillation that HBO's documentary unit decided to commission
and pay Monica Lewinsky for this tawdry number, which had her
answering questions from an adoring college audience in New York. But
can you think of one? The highlight of this one-hour-and-40-minute
video memoir -- which Lewinsky initiated -- was seeing her fight back
tears while claiming, "I would do anything to have my anonymity
back." Everything but remove herself from the camera.</TE>
<TE>   High -- "The Sopranos" finale. Although HBO could claim two other
stratospheric dramas in 2002 in "Six Feet Under" and "The Wire," this
season's "The Sopranos" season-ender was especially amazing. The
75-minute episode was a fitting, in-your-face reply to naysayers
who'd been insisting this year that the planet's most scintillating
TV series had lost its grip. On the contrary, here was mob melodrama
supreme, mingling dark humor with moral ambiguity in a climax that
had Tony and Carmela separating tumultuously, and James Gandolfini
and Edie Falco playing them perhaps more memorably than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Low -- Dead people talking. They would be the ones chatting up
James Van Praagh in "Living With the Dead," his self-glorifying
memoir that had Ted Danson getting upstaged by ghouls. This CBS
two-parter was so excruciatingly corny that it was almost good. When
Danson/Van Praagh encountered a crowd of walking cadavers in a
forest, for example, it was to die for.</TE>
<TE>   High -- The "Farm Boys" episode of "The Chris Isaak Show" on
Showtime. This horror flick send-up, with country rocker Isaak and
his crew trapped a couple of nights in a creepy old farmhouse full of
secrets, was hysterically, wheezingly hilarious. That included a
terrifying discovery by Chris' manager, Yola (Kristin Datillo), that
one of the farm family had been sneaking up to the attic in the dead
of night and making ... designer shoes. Cobbler, shmobbler, this
remains one of the funniest, most undervalued series on television.</TE>
<TE>   Low -- "The Crocodile Hunter: Graham's Revenge." Graham the croc
ended the hour in a state of relative passivity. Bummer. A more
appropriate ending to this unsavory NBC special would have had Graham
feast on Aussie buffoon Steve Irwin. In a sense, isn't that what
Irwin does to the animals he exploits and profits from while
promoting himself as their savior? Here he was again wearing the
mantle and mortarboard of Mr. Chips in the wild. His educational
message: Torment animals -- as Irwin does -- and they get mad.</TE>

<TE>   Disappointment</TE>
<TE>   My biggest disappointment of 2002 came when I learned I had been
deprived of a prime candidate for next year's "worst" list. That
happened this month when HBO pulled from its January 2003 schedule
"Animal Passions," its already postponed, long-awaited (by me)
documentary about zoophilia. You know, sex between us and those other
animals. As the promo says, it's not TV, it's HBO.</TE>

<HD>Silent Movie gets ready to hit the road</HD>
<DH>The L.A. theater's owner counts on a traveling show to
revive interest nationally in pre-sound era films.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Silent Movie Theatre is getting its act together and taking it on
the road. Beginning in 2003, the movie theater will be open only on
select holiday weekends and for private parties, weddings and
premieres.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Lustman, the theater's owner for the past three years,
will be touring the country with "The Silent Picture Show," a vintage
vaudeville and silent movie comedy presentation. Lustman opened the
"Silent Picture Show" this weekend at the Castro Theatre in San
Francisco and is booked to play in Chicago, Sacramento, New York and
Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "I have been planning this from Day One when I opened the theater
three-years-plus ago," Lustman says. "I wanted to establish the
theater in L.A. I wanted to build it into a show that could be
national and worldwide not only for the people who come to the Silent
Movie Theatre, but also to take it on the road. I knew I had to
establish the theater really firmly and get the publicity over three
years worldwide to make it a reality to go out on the road."</LD>
<TE>   The road show will follow the format of Lustman's movie
presentations every weekend at the theater. Lustman will open
performing his own tune "The Silent Picture Show." Then, accompanied
by the ukulele, Janet Klein will sing nice and naughty songs from the
'20s. Ninety-year-old Bob Mitchell will accompany on the organ a
program of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Laurel and
Hardy and Our Gang comedies and Felix the Cat cartoons. There will
also be silent-movie quizzes and giveaways.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to try to make our way around the country," says
Lustman says, but because of Mitchell's age, the tour will be spread
out so he won't have to be away from home for any long stretches.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to try to hit the major metropolitan centers of the
country first and then possibly try one of those bus tours that takes
you through smaller towns, a mom-and-pop theater chain tour."</TE>
<TE>   Lustman says that a major theater chain has approached him about
mass marketing his show -- "silent picture shows all across the
country being played at the same time in 20 cities at once, which
means I would distribute the show out there, hire an actor to present
and sing and a musician to go out and play and do that 20 times. That
is a whole other concept that is realistic, but for the first wave I
think it's more novel not to mass-produce this art form."</TE>
<TE>   The Silent Movie Theatre will reopen its doors in Los Angeles to
the public on Valentine's Day weekend with a show featuring Buster
Keaton's "The Battling Butler." It will be open for all major holiday
weekends during the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Tickets are already on sale, now that the word is getting out
that we are not programming every week," Lustman says. "The show will
involve more programming and more live acts prior to the show." And
prices will be going up from $9 to $15 for adults.</TE>
<TE>   Lustman plans to return to the regular schedule of 52 weekends a
year in 2004 -- "with more original programs and all the hits that
missed the first time around."</TE>

<HD>Top DVD releases of 2002</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The DVD industry has had a breakout year in 2002, and these are some
of the reasons.</LD>
<LD>   "Sunset Boulevard" and "Roman Holiday": With the original
negatives of these classics from the 1950s gone, Paramount and Lowry
Digital Images created beautifully restored new prints for these DVD
releases. The result is exquisite -- you've never seen either film
looking so crisp or radiant on the small screen. The discs include
documentaries, and for "Sunset Blvd.," commentary, script pages and
three minutes of footage from Billy Wilder's original opening, set in
a morgue.</LD>
<LD>   "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" (Platinum
series extended edition): You need a few days to immerse yourself in
this state-of-the art edition of Peter Jackson's acclaimed,
Oscar-winning first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien fantasy epic.
Included: Jackson's 3 1/2-hour director's cut, four commentaries and
six hours of extras.</LD>
<TE>   "Insomnia": Christopher Nolan's commentary elevates this suspense
thriller starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. He offers a unique
twist: presenting the film in the sequence in which it was shot, thus
offering rare insight into how movies are made.</TE>
<TE>   "A Hard Day's Night": This two-disc set of the 1964 Beatles
classic is a thoroughly joyful experience. Beatles historian Martin
Lewis spent 2 1/2 years putting the digital edition together,
tracking down the film's hairdresser, tailor and even the actor who
played the young boy who frolics with Ringo. Also included are
interviews with director Richard Lester, musical director George
Martin and producer Walter Shenson.</TE>
<TE>   "Monsters, Inc.": Disney and Pixar's delightful computer-animated
hit is an equally impressive two-disc DVD that includes tons of
extras, including a new animated short, "Mike's New Car."</TE>
<TE>   "Singin' in the Rain": The 1952 MGM musical has been restored to
its original Technicolor glory for this toe-tapping, two-disc set
that includes a rarely seen excised musical number and crackerjack
commentary.</TE>
<TE>   "Reservoir Dogs": This two-disc set of Quentin Tarantino's 1992
film noir includes tongue-in-cheek interviews, spoofs, delicious
commentary and a loving tribute to the eccentric late actor Lawrence
Tierney.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hustler": Robert Rossen's towering 1961 drama about a cocky
pool hustler played by Paul Newman finally reached the digital age
with a riveting DVD that included a comprehensive documentary,
picture-in-picture commentary with a trick pool player, and a
thought-provoking audio track.</TE>
<TE>   "The Vault Disney Collection": Disney's two-disc sets of its
classics "Old Yeller," "Swiss Family Robinson" "Pollyanna" and "The
Parent Trap" were beautifully restored and feature many nostalgic
extras.</TE>
<TE>   "Children of Paradise": Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert's
landmark romantic French epic from 1945 was served up in a gorgeous,
digitally restored two-disc set.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>They're in for pennies, not pounds</HD>
<DH>Local institutions are starved for cash, even with wealthy
benefactors sitting on their boards.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When trustee Peter B. Lewis pulled the plug on the excesses of
Guggenheim Museum director Tom Krens early this month, threatening
his termination if the institution's fiscal house was not put in
order, he had more than just the title of board chairman for clout.
Since 1993, insurance magnate Lewis has given $62 million to the
Manhattan museum, and he has pledged more than $150 million toward a
possible downtown building project.</LD>
<LD>   Quick: Aside from the posthumous bequest of cantankerous J. Paul
Getty to his own museum a quarter century ago, name one trustee at
any important art museum in L.A. who has ever shown anything close to
Lewis' philanthropic largess.</LD>
<LD>   Time's up. Stumped? Me too.</LD>
<TE>   Never known as bountiful givers, the boards at many of L.A.'s art
museums were especially self-satisfied with their philanthropic
mediocrity this year. There are individual exceptions (and ladies --
because most of you are ladies -- you know who you are). Still, 2002
will be grimly remembered as the Year of the Cheapskate Trustees.</TE>
<TE>   In a confidential draft that surfaced of a study commissioned last
year by the Southwest Museum, the board was blasted for its
collective failure to financially support its own institution, thus
putting a great collection in jeopardy. Fiscal grief at the Museum of
Contemporary Art brought the otherwise fine Warhol painting
retrospective to town -- the first time MOCA has scheduled a show for
the primary purpose of making money -- and was followed by
postponement of a big survey of '60s Minimal art to 2004. A
$25-million capital campaign sputtered at the UCLA Hammer Museum. And
the capper: The Los Angeles County Museum of Art shelved a
$300-million renovation plan that had made banner headlines just a
year before.</TE>
<TE>   It's not because these folks don't have money to give, difficult
post-Sept. 11 economy or not. According to Forbes' most recent list
of America's wealthiest citizens, just four locals who are or have
been trustees at area art museums together claim assets in excess of
$14 billion. Every one of them is richer than the Guggenheim's Lewis
-- most of them three times as rich.</TE>
<TE>   Typical art-museum trustees want their institutions to shine in
the international firmament. Ours do too -- but apparently they want
someone else to pay for it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Christopher Knight's notable developments for 2002</TE>
<TE>   In no particular order, these were the 10 most significant
developments in the art life of Southern California this year:</TE>
<TE>   "Ways of the Rivers: Arts and Environment of the Niger Delta."
Terrific objects, illuminating installation, refreshing viewpoint,
excellent catalog -- this UCLA Fowler Museum offering was the best
show of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Out." From an abundant array of strong gallery shows, Mike
Kelley's show at Patrick Painter Inc. dredged the swamp of modern
American adolescence to examine the fault lines crisscrossing
official culture and the counterculture. Kelley is among our most
important artists, and this was Kelley at his finest.</TE>
<TE>   "Evocations: Sharon Ellis, 1991-2001." Ellis' lush, oblique visual
essays on inchoate feelings and the passage of time made for a
concise, richly satisfying survey of paintings at the Long Beach
Museum of Art. We need more focused museum shows of L.A. artists.</TE>
<TE>   "Willem de Kooning: Tracing the Figure." He had the most facile
hand of any 20th century painter. The Museum of Contemporary Art's
gorgeous show of his pivotal drawings of women gave us the most
intimate examination possible.</TE>
<TE>   Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. The Catholic Church hasn't
been a significant art patron for a few hundred years, so
expectations were low for the art commissioned for the new,
architecturally significant cathedral. Unfortunately, those
expectations were met.</TE>
<TE>   "Axis Mexico: Common Objects and Cosmopolitan Actions." L.A.'s art
museums talk a lot about the vibrancy of Latin American culture, but
it was the San Diego Museum of Art that came up with "Axis Mexico," a
big, flawed but wonderfully ambitious survey of recent Mexican art.
(It's still on view, to March 9.)</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Warhol Retrospective." MOCA did a public service by bringing
the excellent European retrospective of Warhol's paintings to town on
the 40th anniversary of the L.A. debut of his Campbell's soup can
paintings -- despite the galling absence from the show of the soup
cans themselves, which New York's Museum of Modern Art rudely refused
to lend.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest Museum. The financially unsound Southwest Museum failed
to negotiate a successful partnership with the financially flush
Pechanga Band of Luiseno Indians, which could have provided an
unprecedented national model for enlightened Indian cultural
philanthropy. Instead, the Southwest is headed for merger with the
cash-rich, art-poor Autry Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Massacre of the Innocents." The world's richest art museum
finally hit the wall when the J. Paul Getty Museum failed to acquire
the most important Old Master painting to come up at auction since
the 1980s -- Peter Paul Rubens' "Massacre of the Innocents" (circa
1610). Party's over.</TE>
<TE>   Old Masters. There was a bumper crop of absorbing Old Master shows
around town: at LACMA, Bartolome Esteban Murillo's Spanish Catholic
devotional paintings; at the Getty, Pieter Saenredam's luminous
paintings of Dutch church interiors and Jean-Baptiste Greuze's
emotionally overwrought French drawings; and, at the Huntington, a
survey of British painting in American museums and George Romney's
aristocratic British portraits, which are some of art's first luxury
consumer goods.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disappointment</TE>
<TE>   "Keith Edmier and Farrah Fawcett 2000," which opened last month at
LACMA and remains through Feb. 17, is not a train wreck of a show.
It's too dull and ham-fisted for that. What makes it the worst pile
of the year is its context -- an art museum only too eager to
showcase a mediocre New Yorker and an amateur-hour Hollywood
celebrity, while barely giving the time of day to the immense
quantity of authentic artistic talent in L.A.</TE>

<HD>Practicing what he teaches</HD>
<DH>A longtime professor who nurtured estimable authors,
Frederic Tuten also turns out fiction that makes him a celebrity in
his own right.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Irene Lacher</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Frederic Tuten talks, the literati listen. Better still, they do
what he asks.</LD>
<LD>   When the novelist and longtime creative writing professor asked
Susan Sontag, Edna O'Brien and Donald Barthelme to teach
fiction-writing courses at his distinctly non-Ivy League school, City
College of New York, they did. More recently, when the personable
Tuten asked his friend Steve Martin to call an interviewer regarding
his latest novel, "The Green Hour," the phone rang minutes later.</LD>
<LD>   Diane Keaton puts him up when he's in L.A., one of the perks of
Tuten's gift for friendship. And when he directed City's graduate
program in literature and creative writing (he retired in 1995 but
hasn't cut the cord), he helped nurture a new generation of
bestselling writers, among them novelists Oscar Hijuelos and Walter
Mosley. But Hijuelos says emotional intelligence only begins to
explain Tuten's magnetism.</LD>
<TE>   "Frederic has always had a romantic vision of literature that's
quite infectious," says Hijuelos, who also picked up the phone at
Tuten's request. "I see all these young writing students who are
getting conned by writing teachers who are hucksters, and Frederic
isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Tuten's five novels may not have reached the rarefied
heights of some of those he mentored (although he did join Hijuelos
and Mosley on The Times' 100 Best Books of 2002 list). But in
literary circles, he is a celebrity of sorts. His "The Green Hour"
(W.W. Norton &amp; Co.) scored a three-page review in the New Yorker by
the godfather of postwar fiction, John Updike. And he was among a
small circle of people whom Martin asked for comment on the
manuscript for his upcoming novel, "The Pleasure of My Company,"
which will be published by Hyperion next fall.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the smartest guy I know," Martin says. "I really, really
like his work. I like that it's readable and erudite. It's what you
go to a book for or a play for. You go to a movie to be entertained.
You go to a play to be entertained and informed."</TE>
<TE>   Yet mainstream readers aren't going to Tuten's books, judging by
his relentless exclusion from the roster of household names in
culture and his abiding status as a writer's writer.</TE>
<TE>   West Coast infatuation</TE>
<TE>   Tuten is blissful. He's savoring a lunch of red meat at the airy
Maple Drive restaurant and recounting his rainy arrival in Los
Angeles a few days earlier. A tall man with close-cropped gray hair
and SoHo-friendly black glasses, he describes the city in nearly
mystical terms that doubtless failed to occur to that day's
beleaguered commuters.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very beautiful and haunting to see these buildings wrapped
in fog," he says. "They were lyrical. They were magical. And I'd
never seen Los Angeles that way. Ever. I thought, now I recognize it
as something that's familiar to my life."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, familiarity has a nasty habit of breeding contempt, and
Tuten is happier to be basking in the city's born-again sunshine,
which is elbowing its way into the restaurant. At 66, the lifelong
New Yorker is discovering that living at the center of the literary
universe isn't sufficient compensation to keep him there, and he's
contemplating an extended stay in L.A. Indeed, Tuten's new
infatuation with the West Coast is a departure after a lifetime of
looking toward Europe for his cultural cues.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the heroine of "The Green Hour," a stunning
redhead named Dominique, shares his Eurocentrism as well as his
passion for art. Some of Tuten's best friends are artists of the
boldfaced-name variety. New York magazine, which puts a lot of stock
in such things, admiringly noted that he's a regular in the Hamptons
enclave that includes such '80s superstars as David Salle and Eric
Fischl. (For his part, Tuten grumbles that he's sick of the Hamptons
and its monotonous population of rich people.)</TE>
<TE>   Tuten's best friend was Roy Lichtenstein, whom he still mourns
five years after the artist's death at 73. "We knew each other for 35
years," Tuten says. "We saw each other three times a week, if not
more. We were really deep friends, and he was the older friend and,
in a way, deeply wiser friend. You don't replace wisdom with youth. I
miss him immensely. And there are other friends over the years, one
by one going."</TE>
<TE>   Tuten grapples with the themes of art and death in the story of
Dominique, a brilliant art historian who pursues both scholarly
research and futile passion in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   She is helplessly bound to a revolutionary drifter and fellow
fiery redhead who loves her and leaves her and loves her again,
cruelly repeating the cycle over and over. (Dominique's flawed lover,
Rex, shares the name of Tuten's feckless father, who disappeared when
Tuten was 10.)</TE>
<TE>   Dominique fends off another suitor, the handsome, rich Eric, until
doing so strikes even her as pointless, and eventually finds
salvation in her love for a child -- Rex's love child with another
woman.</TE>
<TE>   Although death claims none of the characters prematurely, it is
nonetheless a constant presence. Dominique, a cancer survivor,
returns repeatedly to the disturbing inscription on one of her
favorite paintings by Poussin, "The Arcadian Shepherds," in which
Death says "et in Arcadia ego" (even in Arcadia, I am).</TE>
<TE>   "The Green Hour" refers to the slice of early evening when
"everyone in Paris went to the cafes to drown themselves in milky
green absinthe," Dominique says.</TE>
<TE>   Reactions to the book are mixed, ranging from glowing praise for
Tuten's artistry -- The Times' reviewer called him "an exceptional
writer [who] is frequently elegant and always intelligent in his
spiritual accounting" -- to disdain for Dominique.</TE>
<TE>   Novelist Carolyn See wrote in the Washington Post that she found
it "just hard to believe that again and again Dominique would choose
a Marxist blowhard over a handsome, wealthy, powerful, kind,
absolutely devoted man who wants to marry her and give her everything
in the world," and Updike chastised Dominique for her "vacillating,
unconsciously arrogant infatuation."</TE>
<TE>   Tuten defends his book like a father hen. "I think many critics
extrapolated their feelings about what they themselves would like
people to do in life. If you're with someone who isn't kind to you,
you should walk out. If someone betrays you, turn around. But that's
life. If you had said the drama fails, then I understand. But you're
really saying, 'Why would anyone in a sane mind want to reject a
wonderfully handsome attractive man who's in love with you who also
happens to be a trillionaire for someone who's not those things?'</TE>
<TE>   "But this is the point of the book. That's what passion is about.
That's what the unreason of life is about and that's what makes us
all interesting. We don't always make choices that are the best for
us, and that's what gives us our complexity and our tragedy."</TE>

<HD>Hey, it's not his money</HD>
<DH>The man who spent millions on foreign rights to 'Gangs of
New York' isn't too nervous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Lieberman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With "Gangs of New York" finally reaching theaters Friday, we checked
in with the man who has -- by the most tangible measure -- the
biggest investment in the film.</LD>
<LD>   That's not director Martin Scorsese, who first dreamed of making
"Gangs" in 1970, or the Weinstein brothers, whose Miramax Films is
distributing it domestically. It's Graham King, the English-born
chief executive of Santa Monica-based Initial Entertainment Group.</LD>
<LD>   Its purchase of foreign rights covered two-thirds of the estimated
$100-million-plus cost of the epic about New York's 19th century
Irish gangs, the most expensive Miramax movie to date.</LD>
<TE>   Although "Gangs" was King's first venture in top-dollar
foreign-rights bidding, he soon after won the rights for "Traffic"
and "Ali," and he is taking the leap into creating "product" himself,
co-producing "Aviator," about the early life of Howard Hughes. It
will feature one of the stars of "Gangs," Leonardo DiCaprio, and will
be directed by Scorsese.</TE>
<TE>   The Times caught up with King, 41, the weekend of the "Gangs"
premiere in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Sixty-seven million dollars for foreign rights?</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's a little bit more now. It started off at $65 [million]
and right now we're about $71 [million, with] interest over the three
years.</TE>
<TE>   Is any of that your own hard-earned money?</TE>
<TE>   No. It 's company money. And it's all money that we've already
covered in the pre-sale market.</TE>
<TE>   So if people think you must be nervous about your investment,
they're wrong.</TE>
<TE>   They're absolutely wrong. I was nervous for the first four weeks.
When I called my banker and said, "I want to put up $65 million for
the foreign rights to a movie," he said, "Maybe you should go and
sober up." Four weeks later, I went to my first film market, not
looking to sell the movie, the London Film Festival, and it was the
most exhausting five days of my life. I had buyers sleeping outside
my door. I had a Japanese buyer clutching my ankles walking down the
corridor. That was October of 1999. We were covered like six months
after we actually signed the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Who paid what?</TE>
<TE>   Japan paid me $16 million. The most they had ever paid for an
independent movie was $11 million for "The Mask." And all of a sudden
they're paying $16 million, which blew me away. I didn't want to go
out and sell the movie so quick because I didn't know if we had a
real movie at the time. Marty was still working on the script; Leo
was still hovering around the project. We didn't have any other cast,
and I remember calling Harvey, saying, "$16 million in Japan, how can
we turn that down?" But I thought Leo's people might get upset I'm
pre-selling his name. I remember in Cannes [five] years ago there was
a company selling "American Psycho" and they said [incorrectly] it's
starring Leonardo DiCaprio. We didn't want that.</TE>
<TE>   What other countries came through big?</TE>
<TE>   The French ended up coming in for like $8.5 million; U.K. for $6.5
[million]. I sold Latin America and Australia to a studio for a lot,
between $4 [million] and $5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Each?</TE>
<TE>   No, between them. I'm getting better numbers than I had hoped for,
and all of a sudden I'm on a plane and I read the script again and I
was so nervous: "What if this investment doesn't pay off?" The
hardest thing about my job is finding a project that will sell in
Sweden and Australia and everywhere in between. And it's very hard to
please the world.</TE>
<TE>   You can talk to Marty Scorsese for hours about the mythological
dimensions of his film. But you have suggested that other factors --
like violence -- are what sells it in your markets.</TE>
<TE>   Of course. The general person in the suburbs of Tokyo, or
wherever, wants to see, you know, Leo and Cameron [Diaz].</TE>
<TE>   Some people have spoken of there being a backlash against
DiCaprio, perhaps among young men, after his success in "Titanic."
Are you worried about that?</TE>
<TE>   I can only tell you, having just come back from Tokyo, you had 500
kids at the airport screaming for him. He's like an Elvis.</TE>
<TE>   Now if this film doesn't make all those millions back, those
distributors can't come back to you for a refund, we gather.</TE>
<TE>   Of course not.</TE>
<TE>   But you do have to you worry the next time.</TE>
<TE>   That's the biggest worry. My buyers are always going to judge me
on "Gangs of New York." Because that was the first big film that I
got involved with.</TE>
<TE>   Have you started selling your new one, "Aviator"?</TE>
<TE>   No. A few have asked to purchase the rights -- the Japanese in
particular. But it's too early in that game. I think we will in the
next four to five weeks.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Out with the odd, in with the new</HD>
<DH>Midriffs? Botox? They're so this year and so ready for the
trendy junk pile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mary McNamara</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last three letters of trend are e-n-d and here are a few that we
wish would take the hint:</LD>
<LD>   Headset cell phones -- Hands-free telecommunication makes plenty
of sense in the car, but all these people wandering around mumbling
to the air in front of them is way too "Fahrenheit 451" even for
Californians.</LD>
<LD>   Botox parties -- If you must self-mutilate, do it in the privacy
of your own bathroom like the rest of us.</LD>
<TE>   Exposed midriffs -- We don't care how post-post-post-feminist it
is: No bellybuttons at the office.</TE>
<TE>   Tree sitters -- Next, they'll be hiring tree nannies and asking
for federally funded tree-care centers. Remember when it was enough
just to hug them once in a while?</TE>
<TE>   Tip jars -- Begun as a collection plate for barristas, they now
show up wherever there's a cash register. Since when do you have to
tip someone for ringing up a newspaper and some Tic Tacs?</TE>
<TE>   SUV bashing -- It's righteous. It's boring. Just wait for war in
the Middle East and events to take their natural course.</TE>
<TE>   Saber rattling -- Mr. President, do it or don't do it, but stop
talking about it.</TE>
<TE>   "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" -- Nice movie, and certainly everyone
loves to see Lainie Kazan get work, but "Citizen Kane" it was not. So
enough already.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq's toe -- Yeah, and my hair hurts, but here I am at work
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick -- Finally, the most
photographed pregnancy has ended and the preternaturally ubiquitous
couple are nowhere to be seen. Not even the best personal trainer can
beautify sleep-deprivation. Now, if they'll just try for twins next
time.</TE>
<TE>   Mojitos -- Did Jagermeister teach us nothing? Never trust an
alcoholic beverage with a J not pronounced like a J.</TE>
<TE>   The chocolate martini -- It may taste delicious, but it is a sin
against God and nature.</TE>
<TE>   Homeland security -- Does Tom Ridge make you feel secure? More at
home? Can the guys in the mailroom stop opening our packages now?</TE>
<TE>   "Friends" -- We can suspend imagination and accept that none of
these attractive people, now in their mid-30s, is married to or even
living with anyone outside the original circle, but the fact that
they continue to live in the same apartments is pretty weird. Don't
they know interest rates are at their all-time lowest?</TE>
<TE>   Diane Sawyer celebrity interviews -- Oh, she has the sympathetic
nod down pat, but she can't even muster a shadow of the Barbara
Walters frown of deep and loving concern. Maybe it's the Botox.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's face lift -- OK, it's less disheveled than it was a
few years ago, but the mall at Highland is a bust and there's a Jamba
Juice and a Ross Dress for Less on Hollywood Boulevard. Why, if it
weren't for the mercifully persistent Marilyn and Yoda impersonators,
we'd think we were in Kansas anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Sick cruise-goers -- They say it was a virus; we say it was all
those chocolate martinis.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>A glimmer amid the bleak reality</HD>
<DH>Major works open to great acclaim, but economic and
security concerns redefine the world of architecture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Architecture is back. Or so one would think, given the vast number of
high-profile projects that have opened recently. This year alone,
major works by such architectural luminaries as Tadao Ando, Frank
Gehry and Steven Holl have drawn widespread public acclaim. Critics
have cited them as evidence of the profession's renewed creative
energy.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps even more encouraging, an emerging generation of young
architects, such as UN Studio and Greg Lynn, is beginning to get its
share of public recognition, and this group is broadening the talent
pool beyond the dozen or so celebrity names that are on every major
client's short list.</LD>
<LD>   Beneath the surface, however, the picture looks more bleak.
Economic woes after Sept. 11 and the shifting national mood have put
a number of major projects on hold. Security concerns have threatened
to transform some aspects of the public landscape into high-tech
fortresses, signaling the emergence of a new architecture of
surveillance and fear. And despite the best efforts of a few
visionaries, first-rate architecture has yet to have a meaningful
effect on how everyday people live. For the most part, it remains the
plaything of a small circle of relatively wealthy individuals.</LD>
<TE>   Nowhere have such contradictions been more evident than in the
continuing battle over the future of the ground zero site in New
York. When the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. unveiled a series of
preliminary design proposals for the site in July, the result was a
public outcry.</TE>
<TE>   The proposals looked like any conventional urban development. The
public wondered how the agency could take such a dull, bottom-line
approach to a project loaded with symbolic meaning.</TE>
<TE>   The agency has since gone back to the drawing board, hiring a
range of highly respected talents and asking them to come up with
more compelling visions for the site. It remains unclear, however,
whether the results will survive the Machiavellian political process
that has long been a hallmark of such large-scale developments in
America.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Nicolai Ouroussoff's events of 2002</TE>
<TE>   Below are some of the notable events that have defined the last
year in architecture -- a year that has seen it share of dramatic
turns.</TE>
<TE>   Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. The museum announced
the selection of New York-based Steven Holl to design a major
$300-million renovation and expansion of its dilapidated Exposition
Park home. Over the last two decades, Holl has established himself as
one of the country's most ingenious talents, with a series of works
whose awkward, poetic quality often attain a haunting power. His
Natural History Museum proposal, although still in preliminary design
stages, is loaded with promise.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles International Airport. With a $9.6-billion price tag,
the preliminary master plan for a redesigned LAX -- which would
require the demolition of the airport's central parking lots and the
creation of a new transportation hub miles from the main terminals --
is shaped almost entirely by security considerations. As a model of
how post-Sept. 11 anxieties are beginning to affect the built
environment, the plan evokes a new architecture of fear.</TE>
<TE>   Maslon House. The demolition of the Maslon House in Palm Springs
was a major blow to the cause of architectural preservation in
Southern California. Designed by Richard Neutra, a pillar of Los
Angeles Modernism, the house was an irreplaceable landmark -- an
exquisite composition of steel and glass. Its destruction now stands
as an emblem of how fragile that legacy can be.</TE>
<TE>   Pollari Somol House. Designed by two relatively unknown talents,
Robert Somol and Linda Pollari, on a limited budget, the house's
sleek, corrugated metal and concrete forms are a compact expression
of one L.A. couple's struggle to realize the great suburban dream in
an increasingly dense urban landscape. The kind of project that can
give even a jaded architecture critic hope for the profession's
future.</TE>
<TE>   Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Designed by the celebrated
Japanese architect Tadao Ando, the museum building proves that not
only can art and architecture coexist -- they also can feed off each
other. The building's ability to evoke a range of emotional
experiences -- without disturbing a sense of harmony -- makes it one
of the great museum spaces of recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Ground zero. No one could have predicted the public outcry that
resulted when the Lower Manhattan Development Corp. unveiled its six
original master plans for the site. But the result was a dramatic
turnaround in a process that was heading toward disaster. The agency
agreed to start over from scratch -- a rare instance when a
democratic public process was able to challenge business as usual in
the development world, and demand a higher standard of architecture
in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Weatherhead School of Management. Designed by the celebrated
architect Frank Gehry, the building at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland is not one of the architect's best works.
Nonetheless, its sensuous, undulating interior forms reveal a
creative mind that is never at rest.</TE>
<TE>   Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels. Austere, the cathedral is a
tough building to love when approached from the street. But once one
is inside, Jose Rafael Moneo's soaring, concrete forms create a
mesmerizing procession into a world of spiritual tranquillity. The
building's main worship space is a stunning addition to Los Angeles'
architectural landscape, and it stands as the city's greatest public
room.</TE>
<TE>   MOMA QNS. The Museum of Modern Art's temporary home in Queens,
N.Y., could be a fragment of Los Angeles dropped into Gotham.
Designed by Los Angeles-based Michael Maltzan, its warehouse-like
appearance and flowing entry sequence have an ephemeral quality that
evokes a world in constant flux, set in a suburban landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Rome Auditorium. Dubbed the "three turtles" because of the
bulging, shell-like exterior forms of its concert halls, Renzo
Piano's performing arts center opened this month in Rome. The project
marks the first major cultural monument built in the city since the
Fascist era -- a stunning achievement that adds another architectural
layer to a city already brimming with historical monuments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The one that got away</TE>
<TE>   A stunning design, a whopping price tag, a faltering economy, a
gutless board -- the combination can make for a disheartening
experience.</TE>
<TE>   When the board of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art announced
this month that it was abandoning its plans to build a $200-million
to $300-million museum complex by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, it
marked a stunning blow to the city's cultural future. Koolhaas'
design would have wiped away 37 years of muddled buildings and
additions, replacing them with a design whose conceptual clarity,
structural bravura and radical reworking of the conventional gallery
experience could have made it a model for museum design in the 21st
century.</TE>
<TE>   But LACMA couldn't come up with the dough. And rather than press
on with the design, the museum's board simply threw up its arms in
despair. The result is that Los Angeles' only encyclopedic museum
probably will remain a civic embarrassment for years to come -- a
confusing warren of galleries that does a severe disservice to the
art it houses.</TE>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In troubled, uncertain times, people regularly turn to tales of
hearth and home to find comfort, solace and diversion.</LD>
<LD>   So it's no wonder that in 2002, America so heartily embraced the
simple life and traditional values of the Osbournes.</LD>
<LD>   We saw triumph with the dinner at the White House (where President
Bush singled out Ozzy for his fine example to the youth of the
country, and Ozzy showed his vaunted sense of initiative by asking
Glenn Close for a Percocet). We shed tears at Sharon's colon cancer
diagnosis. We saluted helmeted Jack-boy's backyard war games (what a
little patriot!). We cheered perky Kelly's bubbly start of her own
singing career (she's the new Shirley Temple!). We learned more ways
to use the term #%*@ than we had ever dreamed of.</LD>
<TE>   The pop world did not lack figures doing deeds of dubious
distinction this year, but none were near as deserving of Pop Eye's
annual recognition as the true First Family of Rawk.</TE>
<TE>   Until Michael Jackson dangled his baby over a balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Rapper bites dog</TE>
<TE>   At the MTV Video Music Awards in August, Eminem was frightened not
by a dog, but by a dog puppet -- Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who
tried to get the rapper to call off his feud with Moby. Then Eminem
had the nerve to go on stage and refer to Moby as a "little girl"
before stating that he would "hit a man with glasses."</TE>
<TE>   In space no one can hear you lip-sync</TE>
<TE>   That's just one of the wonderful headlines left unfulfilled when
'N Sync's Lance Bass' bid to be launched into orbit was canceled by
the Russian Space Agency after the singer didn't come up with the
$20-million fee.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Jackson's baby almost took flight, too.</TE>
<TE>   Leave it to the Nuge</TE>
<TE>   When Bass was left at the launching pad, so to speak, Ted Nugent
proposed an alternate, and cheaper, adventure for the pop star. For
just $1 million, the Motor City Madman offered to take Bass on a
bow-hunting trek.</TE>
<TE>   "Bass needs to quit worrying about going into outer space and
embrace and celebrate life by learning how to kill his own food,"
said Nugent, who coincidentally was promoting a new cookbook ("Kill
It &amp; Grill It") and album.</TE>
<TE>   "A slab of flesh on the back of a deer is the finest source of
protein on the planet."</TE>
<TE>   Home sweet home</TE>
<TE>   For less than $30, you can read Kurt Cobain's private journals,
published amid some controversy this fall.</TE>
<TE>   But for just $95,000 you could have read the journals in Cobain's
childhood home in Montesano, Wash. That was the price the owners
settled on after failing to stir up satisfactory bids in an EBay
auction that set a starting price at $200,000, although there were
several prank bids for tens of millions.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was Eminem's childhood home, put up for similar auction
with a starting bid of $120,000. The price escalated to $12 million,
but after phony bids were weeded out, the price plummeted to $75,000.</TE>
<TE>   Wonder if either house has a good baby-dangling balcony.</TE>
<TE>   Will the real Bill</TE>
<TE>   Wyman ...</TE>
<TE>   Bill Wyman got a letter from Bill Wyman's lawyers in November
asking him to stop using the name. To clarify, Wyman, a longtime
music journalist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was sent a
cease-and-desist letter by attorneys for Wyman, the former Rolling
Stones bassist, threatening legal action and stating that the
former's use of the latter's name was seriously misleading and
unauthorized.</TE>
<TE>   The solution, the lawyers proposed, was that Wyman the writer use
a disclaimer with his byline to make it clear that he was not the
longtime musical partner of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Wyman the
writer wrote a satirical essay in which he mused that he might change
his byline to "Not That" Bill Wyman. Of course, he also noted that
"That" Bill Wyman was actually born William George Perks and didn't
change his name until 1964, three years after Wyman the writer was
born.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of names, it was Prince Michael II that Michael Jackson
dangled, not Prince Michael I, right?</TE>
<TE>   Facing the music</TE>
<TE>   The music business got tough in its fight against unauthorized
downloading and copying of recordings this year, with lawsuits,
attempts to classify downloaders as criminals and a "just say
no"-style media campaign. But satiric publication the Onion suggested
another culprit: radio.</TE>
<TE>   Spoofing the music business' campaign against Internet sites that
allow people to trade music files for free, the Onion had record
industry representatives shocked to learn that radio stations all
over the country allow people to hear music for free.</TE>
<TE>   Said one at a press conference, "What's the point of putting out a
new Ja Rule or Sum 41 album if people can just call up and hear any
song off the album that they want?"</TE>
<TE>   It's the devil you know</TE>
<TE>   You know you're in trouble when you make charges of racism only to
have them disavowed by Al Sharpton. That's what happened after
Michael Jackson, miffed by his record label's failure to make
"Invincible" another "Thriller," leveled such an attack at Sony Music
Chairman Thomas D. Mottola at a New York rally with Sharpton in July.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also referred to Mottola as "very, very, very devilish."</TE>
<TE>   Other devilish racists: the photographer who snapped shots of
Jackson's patchwork face on the stand in court (Jackson was being
sued by a promoter), the spider that bit Jackson's foot, preventing
him from testifying one day, and the architect who designed the
balcony from which he dangled his baby.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>The world learns some new steps</HD>
<DH>Latin Americans are setting the rhythm, from international
festivals to ballet's front ranks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lewis Segal</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Broadway dance diva Chita Rivera received one of the Kennedy
Center Honors on Dec. 7, her award set the seal on a year that
showcased Latinos in dance to an unprecedented extent.</LD>
<LD>   Highlighted by September's three-week Tierra Latina festival in
Lyon, France, an event that offered Europe a greater concentration of
Latino modernism than the continent had ever encountered, the trend
also reached local stages with new kinds of Latino involvement in the
Grand Performances summer programs at California Plaza downtown and
the series at the John Anson Ford Theatre in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   On other Southland stages, Latino activity proved equally
eventful. In an encore season, the New World Flamenco Festival at the
Irvine Barclay Theatre introduced artists exploring invigorating and
sometimes radical approaches to a traditional art, while such
companies as National Ballet of Spain and Noche Flamenca returned
with updated artistic agendas or repertory.</LD>
<TE>   Latino dancers also reached critical mass in a number of companies
not identified with Latino culture.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the choreography-challenged American Ballet Theatre,
which never seems more exciting these days than when such paragons as
Julio Bocca, Jose Manuel Carreno, Paloma Herrera, Angel Corella,
Joaquin de Luz, Stella Abrera, Herman Cornejo and their compadres
dominate the casting. Call it Latin American Ballet Theatre on such
occasions -- and be very, very grateful.</TE>
<TE>   In the first Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers film, "Flying Down to
Rio," a gringa asks plaintively, "What have these South Americans got
below the equator that we haven't?" Interesting question, even if we
ignore the innuendo and expand the frame of reference to embrace the
whole Spanish-speaking world.</TE>
<TE>   Your answer might differ from mine -- I think it's a commitment to
mastering state-of-the-art technique and style without diminishing
the passion that inspired a dance career to begin with. But whatever
the reason, the growing prominence of Latinos in dance could well
transform the art in the U.S. and, particularly, the Southwest during
the next few years. Some of us just can't wait.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Lewis Segal's best of 2002</TE>
<TE>   Here are the most memorable local dance performances of the year
from one aficionado's calendar, in chronological order.</TE>
<TE>   Philadanco  danced a Black History Month modern dance program at
El Camino College in February that probed beyond mere celebrations of
blackness to explore the uniqueness of African American identity.
Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's imaginative "Hand Singing Song" caused the
greatest stir by using handshakes and other gestures from the black
community as evidence of her people's deep creative impulse.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Marquez  had danced locally six years ago with National
Ballet of Spain, but this flamenco firebrand arrived at the Cerritos
Center for the Performing Arts and other local venues in March as an
international sensation -- and for once, the hype proved justified.
Fine proportions, sensitive musicality, magically expressive hands
and the knack for projecting every movement detail to the next galaxy
lent his dancing extraordinary impact.</TE>
<TE>   Moscow Stanislavsky Ballet arrived at the Kodak Theatre in June
unheralded and little known in the U.S., but it displayed a fresh,
incisive command of classical style. Although many of its innovations
had been plundered long ago by other companies, Vladimir
Bourmeister's 1953 version of "Swan Lake" proved the strongest
production -- startling for its surreal ballroom scene and the use of
the original score instead of the traditional cut-and-paste job.</TE>
<TE>   Mauro Bigonzetti's  "A Midsummer Night's Dream"  turned out to be
the most original and compelling dance drama of the year,
transforming Shakespeare's comedy into a daring contemporary
meditation on irrational desire. Boasting a rich commissioned score
by Elvis Costello, the ballet received its U.S. premiere in July at
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, danced by Italy's
accomplished, versatile and sensual Aterballetto company.</TE>
<TE>   Andres Marin  presented his controversial update of flamenco at
the Irvine Barclay Theatre in August, looking like a workman and
dancing with jackhammer force. In his 90-minute "Mas alla del Tiempo"
(Beyond Time), his deliberately roughhewn technique, curt stage
demeanor and grungy appearance seemed to defy tradition. Yet Marin
ultimately extended it by stripping away the excesses and mannerisms
that keep the art linked to the past.</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Marceau remains unchallenged as the poet of pantomime, and
his engagement at the Geffen Playhouse in August not only confirmed
his stature at age 79, but also set an imposing standard for the new
century. Every mime depicts invisible objects and human foibles --
although seldom with such mastery of gestural nuance. But who else
wordlessly reenacts the creation of the world or comments on the
corruption of art or physicalizes the duality of human nature?</TE>
<TE>   "Mare Tranquillitatis" created some of the year's most indelible
images on an outdoor platform stage in front of the Japan America
Theatre. Part of the World Festival of Sacred Music in September,
Hirokazu Kosaka's multidisciplinary tribute to the harvest moon used
pieces of paper sculpted by the wind to depict the impermanence of
all things, including the people watching this profound vision of our
place in the cycle of time.</TE>
<TE>   The Junebug Symphony is at once the name of a performing company
and its current production, both of them offering deeply whimsical
and poetic movement theater at UCLA's Freud Playhouse in October.
Brilliant 28-year-old gymnast James Thierree wrote, directed and
starred, fusing the hallucinatory theatrical style pioneered by
Eugene O'Neill (his great-grandfather) with the inspired physical
comedy of Charlie Chaplin (his grandfather).</TE>
<TE>   The Sean Curran Dance Company focused on tributes to the past in
an emotionally resonant modern-dance program at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre in October. The happiest piece depicted how vintage pop
culture transformed our images of ourselves, the saddest how the
memories of people no longer with us haunt our consciousness.
Ambitious concepts, imaginative choreography, memorable dancing:
Curran's reach proved masterly.</TE>
<TE>   The Cullberg Ballet made its local debut at UCLA's Royce Hall in
October, introducing one more radical "Swan Lake," this one by
Swedish dance iconoclast Mats Ek. From his barefoot, bald, contorted
swan corps to an ending in which the Prince chose the carnal black
swan instead of the virginal white one, Ek's version confounded
expectations and asked the audience to consider alternative insights,
plus a fresh, complex approach to Tchaikovsky dancing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disappointment</TE>
<TE>   Disappointment of the year: the Bolshoi Ballet in "La Bayadere" at
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in November. Arriving after
dancing other ballets in other cities, the company wasn't ready to
open, the production proved a dud and only one of the three casts
offered anything like the old Bolshoi excitement. Very expensive
Russian roulette.</TE>

<KH>MEDIA MATTERS / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>News gatherers stumble -- into newsmaker territory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's news media -- large and small, print and broadcast --
performed admirably, often heroically, in the immediate aftermath of
Sept. 11. Alas, unaccustomed as most of them are to such sustained
excellence, many stumbled so badly in 2002 that it would be even more
difficult than usual to list just the 10 worst journalistic moments
of the year. So here, in no particular order, is a purely arbitrary
selection of 10 among many such moments.</LD>
<LD>   1. CBS made it known that its eye would not tear up if Don Hewitt,
the creator and executive producer of "60 Minutes," retired -- or to
use the network's euphemism, "put a transition plan in place." Hewitt
is, after all, 80, which in television translates as "too old to run
a show that would attract the younger audience our advertisers
crave." On the other hand, 80 is a critical number in television; it
approximates the cumulative IQ of the network executives responsible
for much of what passes for entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   2. Associated Press executives, understandably proud of the global
news service's ubiquity, have long quoted Mark Twain's observation,
"There are only two forces that can carry light to all corners of the
globe -- the sun in the heavens and the Associated Press down here."
But in September, the AP fired reporter Christopher Newton for making
more leaps than Twain's celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras County.
Sometimes, AP said, he quoted nonexistent people from real
institutions. Other times, the people he quoted were real but the
institutions were fictional. In all, the AP said, it could not
confirm the existence of 45 people and a dozen organizations in
Newton's stories.</TE>
<TE>   Can we now expect AP executives to begin citing another Twain
quote as well -- "Man is the only animal that blushes. Or needs to"?</TE>
<TE>   3. A Washington Post story disclosed the lack of qualifications
and experience of the U.N. weapons inspectors in Iraq. For some
reason, the Post decided to tell its readers -- in the first
paragraph of that Page 1 story -- that one of the inspectors has "a
leadership role in sadomasochistic sex clubs." Why was that relevant?
Does it automatically disqualify him to search for nuclear weapons?
Personally, I'd love to see a whips and chains aficionado nosing
around Saddam Hussein's private haunts. Since Saddam seems both
sadistic and masochistic, maybe the inspector could lure him into a
little snuff action and save us all a lot of time, pain and money.</TE>
<TE>   4. More than 40,000 people showed up in April for an Israel
Independence Day Festival in Van Nuys that doubled as a rally to
support Israel during Mideast hostilities. The mayor was there. So
was the governor -- and many other dignitaries. The story got big
play in the local media. But the Los Angeles Times didn't publish a
word on the rally in the next day's paper.</TE>
<TE>   The explanation: "We didn't cover it because we didn't know about
it," one Times editor said. Huh? Traffic near the event was so heavy
that radio stations broadcast advisories, and the event was listed on
the City News Service "budget" that serves as a tip sheet for all
local media. I don't agree with angry Jewish leaders who saw this as
a deliberate slight by the paper, but it was an oversight of
monumental proportions. Next thing you know Trent Lott will say he
"didn't know about" Strom Thurmond's racist behavior.</TE>
<TE>   5. ABC wanted to replace Ted Koppel's "Nightline" with David
Letterman. Letterman ultimately declined, but had he accepted the
offer, ABC's next step no doubt would have been to give Peter
Jennings' job to Oprah Winfrey.</TE>
<TE>   6. The Seattle Times won two major national journalism awards for
a series of articles investigating the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center in Seattle. But less than three weeks before the
people who pick the winners of an even bigger prize -- the Pulitzers
-- were scheduled to vote this year, the Wall Street Journal
published an opinion piece by Laura Landro, attacking the Times
series.</TE>
<TE>   Landro had been treated successfully at the Hutchinson Center, so
she was not exactly an unbiased observer. But even if she could write
dispassionately, why didn't she write her story in the Journal right
after the Times series was published, in March 2001, instead of
waiting a full year and doing so on the eve of the Pulitzers?
Landro's Journal story was headlined "Good Medicine, Bad Journalism."
It should have been "Pulitzer Politics, Bad Judgment."</TE>
<TE>   7. When the Chicago Tribune fired longtime columnist Bob Greene
after learning that he had had sex 14 years earlier with a
17-year-old high school senior who came to the paper to interview
him, critics were divided over whether the punishment fit the crime.
But there was little disagreement over how the Tribune handled the
story. Badly. The paper announced Greene's dismissal in a brief story
that did not say just how old the girl was, just when the sex took
place, whether Greene wrote about her in his column, or just what
Greene's "inappropriate sexual conduct" consisted of.</TE>
<TE>   No self-respecting high school editor would have accepted so
incomplete a story, but such inappropriate journalistic conduct is,
alas, all too common when newspapers write about themselves.</TE>
<TE>   8. Virtually every time there's a big news story, I wonder if CNN
should be renamed SNN -- as in Saturation News Network. Or
Sensational News Network. Or Speculation News Network. The sniper who
terrorized the Washington, D.C., area in October gave SNN its latest
opportunity to wallow in wretched excess, and never was that more
apparent than on the day authorities arrested two men who, it turned
out, had nothing to do with the case.</TE>
<TE>   But before that was disclosed, CNN filled its air time with
experts who assured viewers, as Sgt. Maj. Erick Haney put it, "Well,
obviously, just common sense says ... that these are the two
suspects, without a doubt." In fact, Haney not only "knew" these two
men were suspects in the case, he knew why they'd surrendered ("I
believe they were just near exhaustion") and how they were responding
to interrogation ("I don't think they're going to shut up for days").
Too bad he didn't shut up.</TE>
<TE>   9. The Boston Phoenix, one of the better alternative newspapers,
provided the wrong kind of alternative to the mainstream media in
June when it published a photograph of the severed head of Daniel
Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was killed in Pakistan.
On its Web site, the paper also published a link to the video of
Pearl's execution.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Mindich, publisher of the Phoenix, said his decision to
share those two gruesome bits of photojournalism with Phoenix readers
"came from my gut, from my brain, from my heart." Really? I wonder
how his brain managed to convey that message, given where his head
must have been at the time.</TE>
<TE>   10. Even the New York Times -- the nation's best paper -- managed
to embarrass itself this year. The Times killed two sports columns
that disagreed with its editorial positions on the refusal by the
Augusta National Golf Club to admit women members. Times editors
ultimately relented and published the columns -- with minor editing
changes -- after a week of offering such lame explanations and
justifications for their original decision that they made "The dog
ate my homework" seem worthy of Diogenes.</TE>

<LD>L.A.'s party set -- a sequined subculture of wealth and philanthropy,
with a guest list heavy on celebrity -- played on this year, feting
everyone from Andy Warhol to Jeffrey Wigand. Brits Elton John, Liz
Hurley and Sting turned up for Barbara Davis' Carousel of Hope Ball,
to share a table with the hostess and Oprah. Even the gala opening of
the new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels met its boldface quota,
with Anjelica Huston and Rita Moreno delivering inspirational
readings.</LD>
<LD>   But for all its high-profile panache, the social scene was not
without its awkward moments. Billy Bob Thornton topped the "What Was
He Thinking?" list with his ode to marijuana during a benefit for the
American Heart Assn. Not to mention Elizabeth Taylor's tardiness in
extremis at a benefit dinner in her honor. Lakers owner Jerry Buss
brought the aforementioned Carousel Ball to a standstill when a
pinched nerve in his neck prompted a call to the paramedics. And
Reese Witherspoon held her head high as she hobbled into a
fund-raiser with a broken foot. (No questions, please.)</LD>
<TE>   Smokin' -- Only minutes before, the cardiologist-heavy crowd had
saluted tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand for his work
on behalf of smoking prevention. Then Billy Bob Thornton took the
spotlight: "I'm sorry, I wrote a song about pot," the actor-rocker
announced as he launched into "Smokin' in Bed" at an August benefit
for the American Heart Assn. "It's a tribute to my old buddies who
used to lie around and watch cartoons." Unbelievably, the crowd hit
the dance floor.</TE>
<TE>   Crime-busting pays -- There seemed no end to the parties for new
LAPD Chief Bill Bratton. Billionaires were falling over themselves to
welcome the city's head crime fighter, and the invites were so
plentiful, he said, "I actually lose track of the functions." During
one week in November, Bratton chatted with News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch on a 20th Century Fox sound stage, toasted his new Los Feliz
neighbors at the recently renovated Sowden House, then appeared as
guest of honor at back-to-back dinner parties hosted separately by
entertainment attorney Howard Weitzman and former chief executive of
Universal Studios and Viacom, Frank Biondi. "One of the great things
about the job of police chief is that you get to travel in so many
circles," Bratton said.</TE>
<TE>   XXX-rated -- The place to be on Halloween, L.A.'s favorite
holiday, was a 1,000-strong event funded by adult film giant Vivid
Video and co-hosted by hotel heiress Paris Hilton. The West Hollywood
party, populated by dozens of scantily clad adult film actors and
nude exotic dancers, drew industry types and an odd mix of
celebrities. "This is the only party where the porn stars dress like
lawyers," said Josh Etting, a writer for the WB's "The Jamie Kennedy
Experiment." And it was difficult to discern the real stars from
guests masquerading as them. The Lakers' Rick Fox was there as a
towering Santa Claus, Tori Spelling wore a midriff-baring satin
get-up, and Hugh Hefner and Mickey Rourke came as themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Wigged out -- Andy Warhol was L.A.'s guest of honor in May, the
month his retrospective opened at MOCA. There were several cocktail
parties celebrating the return of Warhol to the West Coast, but the
most memorable was hosted by the downtown museum at its loading dock
on lower Grand Avenue. It was an eclectic mix of the artist's old
pals (Ed Moses, Dennis Hopper), admirers (Paul Reubens, Charlize
Theron) and patrons, who milled among endless rows of Day-Glo
daisies, Candy Darling impersonators writhing on platforms, and
drifting silver pillows reminiscent of Warhol's 1966 installation
"silver clouds." Even the bartenders wore white Warhol wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Night shift -- In Hollywood, the awards season reaches a crescendo
by late March, climaxing on Oscar night with Vanity Fair's all-star,
million-dollar fete at Morton's restaurant. This year, the lucky
winners of editor Graydon Carter's popularity contest celebrated
Academy Award recipients Halle Berry, Denzel Washington and Sidney
Poitier, seemingly oblivious to the post-Sept. 11 contribution to the
evening: the county's bomb squad pacing the sidewalk outside with
German shepherds. John Cleese noted: "It actually felt as if
something shifted."</TE>
<TE>   Repeat performance -- He delivered the same zinger at more than
one benefit this year, but each time Jay Leno had his audience
howling: "I know what we can do about Osama bin Laden -- send over
Anna Nicole Smith. She'll get his money and he'll be dead in a week."</TE>
<TE>   Regally blond -- She had mysteriously broken her foot, and it was
the October weekend that her syrupy flick "Sweet Home Alabama" broke
box office records. Neither kept actress Reese Witherspoon from
hosting a benefit for the Rape Treatment Center of Santa Monica at
the Beverly Hills home of Ron Burkle. "It's a testament to her
character that she's here," "Friends" co-star David Schwimmer told
guests. Witherspoon wanted to support the luncheon because, as a
mother of "a 3-year-old girl, recent media attention on the sexual
abuse of children has been at the forefront of my mind," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Where was Bond, James Bond? -- Guests had hoped for a glimpse of
Pierce Brosnan and his primo Malibu digs when they attended an
October house tour on behalf of Hollywood Habitat for Humanity.
Sorry. The star was in Thailand promoting "Die Another Day," and the
property on the tour was his and wife Keely Shaye Smith's Malibu Pad
No. 2, a low-slung, casually furnished beach house. Their snazzy home
was up the road apiece. No matter. Guests sipped tea and sampled
canapes under a canopy on the beach as dolphins played in the sea.
"We call them Malibu reindeer, we see so many of them in December,"
observed one local.</TE>
<TE>   But can he dance? -- "I want to talk to you as a singer," Academy
Award-winning actor Kevin Spacey told the crowd gathered to honor
Phil Ramone, the legendary recording industry producer-engineer, at
the Mancini Musicale at UCLA's Royce Hall. "Phil and I have been
working for the past year on my preparation to play Bobby Darin in a
film," he said. And then, head cocked and fingers snapping, he broke
into an a cappella version of "I Found a New Baby" a la the '50s pop
idol. "Without Dr. Phil -- the real Dr. Phil -- I wouldn't have had
the guts to do that," Spacey said at the August fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Unfashionably late -- They'd anted up $2,500 per plate for the
chance to meet La Liz and dine on filet mignon and raspberry souffle.
The pre-supper martinis kept arriving, but not Elizabeth Taylor. And
by the time the legend showed up at the February benefit for the AIDS
Services Foundation and the Laguna Beach Art Museum, a few guests
were ready to see several of her. Finally, two hours late, with bosom
pal Michael Jackson in tow, she swept through the front door.
"Elizabeth, the party was last night," Merv Griffin deadpanned.</TE>
<TE>   Showstopper -- The Carousel Ball of Hope was just starting to kick
-- B.B. King was onstage belting out "Let the Good Times Roll" with
Kelsey Grammer -- when panic swept through the Beverly Hilton
ballroom. All eyes turned to the table just beyond that of Elizabeth
Taylor and Elton John, where Lakers owner Jerry Buss slumped, his
head on his chest. The music ceased and Grammer cried out from the
stage: "Is there a doctor in the house?" (As it turned out, the fuss
over Buss was unnecessary -- the man had suffered a pinched nerve in
his neck.) As Buss was placed on a stretcher and transported to a
waiting ambulance, John deftly lightened the mood. He looked at Liz
and said, "See, Elizabeth, what you still do to men?"</TE>

<LD>In a blur of bittersweet goodbyes, fans of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic celebrated the orchestra's final benefit gala at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion while anticipating its October opening just
a block away. "I've had great moments in this building, and we're
grateful for the foundations that were laid here -- but I don't think
we'll miss it when we move to the new Walt Disney Concert Hall,"
music director Esa-Pekka Salonen told the thousands gathered for the
historic "A Russian Winter Celebration" on Dec. 13. "It's about time
for us to get a custom-built concert hall. And to those generous
people who have made the Walt Disney Concert Hall possible, thank you
ever so much."</LD>
<LD>   Via a film clip, former music director Zubin Mehta -- who headed
up the orchestra at the opening of the pavilion in 1964 -- also
addressed the audience: "I cannot tell you how many memories I have
of this magnificent edifice.... The pavilion, in those days, was like
an acropolis in the middle of nowhere. Look what's happened to it
now!"</LD>
<TE>   Singer-actress Diahann Carroll welcomed concertgoers, among them
supporters who paid $1,000 each to attend the performance,
post-concert supper and auction, which grossed $650,000. "Celebrating
the final gala of the L.A. Philharmonic at the Dorothy Chandler --
the very thought brings mixed emotions," Carroll said from a stage
flanked with towering sprays of scarlet roses. "I was fortunate to
appear at one of the opening dedication concerts. What an occasion it
was. I was invited to perform by Mr. Nat King Cole -- can you imagine
that?"</TE>
<TE>   After the concert, which included violinists Sarah Chang and
Pinchas Zukerman performing Bach's Concerto for Two Violins in D
minor and the orchestra's ravishing rendition of Stravinsky's "The
Firebird," about 400 guests swept into the pavilion's Grand Hall to
enjoy a sit-down feast of Uzbek-style grilled lamb and fine wines.
"Tonight's performance is bittersweet. We've had many years in this
wonderful hall, and now we have a glorious new building designed by
Frank Gehry for Esa-Pekka Salonen," said philanthropist Andrea Van de
Kamp. Chimed Gehry, her dinner partner: "This is exciting for me. It
means we are one notch closer to the opening."</TE>

<HD>Can't keep He-Man down</HD>
<DH>Once viewed by children's advocates as toy makers' shill,
the cartoon hero is back, minus controversy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Solomon</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1983, a blond man raised his sword, declared, "I have the power!"
and transformed himself into the muscular superhero He-Man. Boys
cheered the animated series and children's advocates hit the ceiling.</LD>
<LD>   Twenty years later, a new version of "He-Man" is back on Cartoon
Network, and no one seems to mind.</LD>
<LD>   "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe" scored a big hit in
first-run syndication, winning a 16 to 18 share of children in the
2-to-11 age group. And in the stores, more than $500 million worth of
toys plus an additional $500 million in related merchandise was sold
by 1985.</LD>
<TE>   The program served as a lightning rod for watchdog groups who
complained it was just a 30-minute toy commercial. In 1983, Peggy
Charren, president of Action for Children's Television, said, "The
over-commercialization of children's television is worse than that of
adult television. A show composed of commercials is insidiously
horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Orme, president of the National Assn. for Better
Broadcasting, asserted, "The program was created to sell the product;
it wasn't created to entertain. Without the tie-in for Mattel, the
program wouldn't exist at all. It's pure commercialism right straight
through."</TE>
<TE>   Broadcasters, animators and toy companies responded with equal
vehemence. Dennis Marks, creative director at Marvel, replied,
"Wasn't the Disney show a huge promotion for Disneyland? And how is
animating GI Joe different from a guest on Johnny Carson plugging a
book or a movie? You can't condemn one aspect of it without
condemning the entire system. TV is one big promotion."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, where has all the controversy gone?</TE>
<TE>   The decision to revive "He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"
was at least partially a response to the continuing requests of fans,
says Sam Register, senior vice president of content development for
Cartoon Network.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a sort of grass-roots campaign to get 'He-Man' back
on," Register says. "We got letters, we got calls, we got e-mails.
Finally, we said, 'Let's look into this.' People between the ages of
23 and 29 or 30 who grew up on it are the hard-core fans who were
clamoring for it."</TE>
<TE>   "He-Man is one of those characters who survived even after we
stopped making toys. There are hundreds of Web sites for fans and
people who collect He-Man memorabilia," agrees Sara Rosales, Mattel
vice president of public relations. "During the '80s, He-Man was one
of the biggest brands here at Mattel, and there's a huge '80s retro
phenomenon in pop culture. So we thought we would release a new
He-Man line to commemorate the character's 20th anniversary."</TE>
<TE>   New generation, new look</TE>
<TE>   The characters have been redesigned for a new generation of kids.
Prince Adam has traded his familiar pageboy for a more tousled look.
He was never the sharpest sword in the armory, but the new Adam
sounds like a laid-back Valley dude. The original He-Man action
figure looked like a round-faced caricature of a bodybuilder; the new
version has a more chiseled face and sharply defined muscles, changes
that are reflected in the animation by Mike Young Productions.
(Filmation, the studio that did the original series, closed in 1989.)</TE>
<TE>   "Action cartoons, even when they're very successful, have a
shorter shelf life than comedy cartoons. When you replay even a
successful show, it may do well for a short time, but it doesn't hold
up against all the other stuff that's out there," says Register. "So
we not only had to update the stories to make them competitive with
what kids are currently watching, we had to change the look of the
characters and the style of the action to make them more compelling."</TE>
<TE>   Initially "He-Man" was drawing solid ratings on Cartoon Network.
Rosales adds, "The toys are selling phenomenally well; Castle
Grayskull, which is our big holiday item for the year, has been doing
well. So we think that the timing was right on the money to bring
He-Man back."</TE>
<TE>   Is the program still just a 30-minute toy commercial?</TE>
<TE>   "I think if you watch an episode, you don't look at it and say,
'This is a commercial for a toy.' These are nice little films," says
"He-Man" executive producer Bill Schultz. "But let's face it, there
isn't a successful children's show on the air that hasn't spawned
some sort of broad-based licensing program, right down to 'Blue's
Clues.' I think the tolerance comes from the acceptance that kids get
their entertainment from everywhere, and that tolerance will continue
as long as we remain responsible and produce a show you can watch
without feeling it's just a commercial."</TE>
<TE>   Like many other watchdog groups, Action for Children's Television
no longer exists. But Charren remains an outspoken advocate for
children's causes. Reflecting on differing reactions to the two
versions of "He-Man," she commented in a recent telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents were never that focused on the advertising itself or the
programs that were toy commercials; they were really concerned about
sex and violence," she concluded. "Today, there are lots of other
places for commercials to hit children -- and adults too.</TE>
<TE>   "Initially, it was something we only did to kids, because we were
afraid adults would turn off the shows. We didn't have program-length
commercials for adults, but we do now. In TV shows and feature films,
everything the actors touch represents a paid spot; there's
commercialism in schools now. I think that's much more objectionable
than 'He-Man' on TV."</TE>

talent thrives.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the surface, 2002 looked like a bad year for classical music.
Audiences were slow to return to theaters after Sept. 11 and the
economic downturn made fund-raising dicey. Hardly a week passed
without reports of another orchestra or opera company in trouble,
another major record label cutting back.</LD>
<LD>   In Chicago, Cleveland, Toronto, Pittsburgh and St. Louis, great
orchestras plunged millions of dollars in the hole. America's second
and third largest opera companies, in San Francisco and Chicago,
posted such severe deficits that they canceled or replaced some of
their most interesting prospects next season. As news of high-tech
billionaire Alberto Vilar's falling portfolio sank in, institutions
worldwide were forced to cope with the fact that this benefactor
would not be fulfilling pledges. One consequence: We waved goodbye to
Los Angeles Opera's much-anticipated import of Prokofiev's "War and
Peace" from the Kirov of St. Petersburg, Russia.</LD>
<LD>   But classical music is resilient. For all the institutional
headaches caused by red ink, the makers of music demonstrated that
they have in them the wisdom and vision to address troubled times.</LD>
<TE>   A wave of brilliant young music directors took charge in 2002,
from Simon Rattle at the Berlin Philharmonic to Antonio Pappano at
the Royal Opera in London to Franz Welser-Most at the Cleveland
Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   More important, 2002 proved an exceptional year for resourceful,
visionary, substantive work, the real sign of classical music's
nonfrivolous, optimistic, possibly even exuberant future.</TE>

<TE>   Mark Swed's notable events of 2002</TE>
<TE>   Ten musical happenings that went inspiringly right in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "Sun Rings." Terry Riley's empyrean masterpiece for the Kronos
Quartet, chorus, electronic sounds from outer space, and lavish
visual projections provided one wild ride at its University of Iowa
premiere, along with music of supreme beauty and spiritual impact. A
response to the Sept. 11 attacks and a comprehensive call for peace,
this cosmic, 95-minute string quartet is a whole new chapter in the
age-old quest for a music of the spheres.</TE>
<TE>   "The Transmigration of Souls." Composer John Adams' powerfully
understated orchestral work offered a sophisticated, meditative,
gratifying and non-manipulative Sept. 11 "memory space," an aural
cathedral for a new age. Commissioned by the New York Philharmonic to
open Lorin Maazel's first season as the orchestra's music director,
it also demonstrated that this often too-flashy conductor has a
profound side.</TE>
<TE>   "La Pasion Segun San Marco." Confirming the stunning response to
its premiere in Stuttgart, Germany, in 2001, Osvaldo Golijov's
"Passion According to Saint Mark" marched across America to huge
acclaim from Boston to Costa Mesa. An extraordinary exultation of
Latin American musical idioms, this recounting of Christ's last days
by an Argentine American Jew demonstrates a near universal appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "Saint Francois d'Assise." With a spectacularly produced U.S.
premiere of Olivier Messiaen's master work, the San Francisco Opera
overnight went from being one of America's least inventive major
companies to one of its most venturesome. And this was no one-night
stand for the organization under its new general manager, Pamela
Rosenberg; Messiaen's uncompromising sacred opera was followed by
insightful new productions of Janacek's "Kat'a Kabanova" and Handel's
"Alcina."</TE>
<TE>   Simon Rattle. In the most reported classical music story of the
year, Rattle assumed the music directorship of the Berlin
Philharmonic. On their wedding night, in the opening concert of
Thomas Ades' "Asyla" and Mahler's Fifth Symphony, the daring
conductor and great orchestra perhaps tried a little too hard. But
there can be little doubt that the match of this intrepid British
conductor with the gravitas of this great German orchestra will help
revolutionize symphonic music everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA International Theatre Festival. The hugely successful and
risk-taking festival inaugurated by David Sefton doesn't exactly fall
under the purview of classical music, but many of the undertakings
were so far-reaching in their genre-bending zeal that they couldn't
be musically ignored. Robert Wilson's "Woyzeck" provided exceptional
music theater, whereas Societas Raffaello Sanzio's "Genesi" and the
Wooster Group's "To You, the Birdie!" used music and electronic sound
in wildly imaginative new ways.</TE>
<TE>   Dmitri Shostakovich. For no particular reason, Shostakovich turned
out to be the composer of the year. His 15th String Quartet was the
subject of the illuminating "The Noise of Time," a collaboration of
the British troupe Complicite and the Emerson String Quartet at UCLA.
The Los Angeles Philharmonic's Esa-Pekka Salonen began his five-year
exploration of the Russian composer's 15 symphonies with revelatory
accounts of the first three. And the Kirov saved the day at Los
Angeles Opera with its gripping production of "Lady Macbeth of
Mtsensk," a replacement for Prokofiev's "War and Peace."</TE>
<TE>   John Cage.  2002 commemorated the 90th anniversary of the
composer's birth in Los Angeles and the 10th anniversary of his death
in New York. The highlights were composer-pianist James Tenney's
illuminating performances of Cage's prepared-piano classic Sonatas
and Interludes at CalArts and the MAK Center. British pop producer
Mike Batt made an ugly scene trying to cash in on Cage's famous
silent piece, "4'33"," but Margaret Leng Tan revived the spirit of
the seminal work by performing it in August at Maverick Hall, almost
50 years to the day after the work's controversial premiere in that
historic outdoor venue in Woodstock, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Field." At 88, composer Henry Brant probably thought he had
seen it all. But not a Pulitzer Prize. In a gesture that indicates
there is justice in this world, the Pulitzer music composition award
went to this Santa Barbara purveyor of spatial music for his
life-affirming "Ice Field." Commissioned by the San Francisco
Symphony, the work, in which instruments sing from the farthest
reaches of the concert hall, is so exuberant that the jury found it
irresistible even on tape.</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Concert Hall. Even though it's not yet completed,
Disney Hall is already making an impact downtown. The luminous steel
went up, and with it the glowing sense of new possibilities for Los
Angeles became, by year's end, palpable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disappointment</TE>
<TE>   The first Rachmaninoff International Piano Competition  in
Pasadena tried to invent itself as an important new talent show. It
had support on both the civic and the state level, as well as from
the Rachmaninoff heirs and the Kawai piano company. But it turned out
to be a clumsy and unimaginative competition, awarding its first
prize to a Russian banger, the second to a drab Japanese pianist and
no third at all. At the inept, musically insubstantial awards
ceremony, California's first lady and Pasadena's mayor shared the
stage with ostentatious sponsors, demonstrating just how gullible our
politicos can be when it comes to the arts.</TE>

<HD>A brief season for winter's tunes</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The calendar may say that winter began on Saturday, but really it
ends Wednesday, at least as far as winter songs are concerned. The
sleigh bells began jingling across endless ads on TV and radio, mall
Muzak, easy-listening stations and the like in mid-autumn, just about
the time the jack-o'-lanterns disappeared.</LD>
<LD>   But good luck hearing any of the popular songs about winter during
the actual season once Christmas is past.</LD>
<LD>   Granted, there's no reason to play "Silent Night," "O Come All Ye
Faithful" or even pop standards like "White Christmas" or "The
Christmas Song" once Santa returns to the North Pole. No argument
here. But there's nothing even remotely Christmas-y (other than
habit, expectation, custom) about songs like "Let It Snow," "Jingle
Bells" or even that most evocative of holiday season songs, "Winter
Wonderland."</LD>
<TE>   Even folks who don't celebrate Christmas -- especially here in
L.A., where temperatures in December can easily top 75 degrees -- can
enjoy the mental image of snow glistening in the proverbial lane. It
could, with a little imagination, be our winter anthem, the icy flip
side of "Summer in the City."</TE>
<TE>   Well, forget it, it'll never happen. Even before the decorations
are packed away for the year, the holiday music gets yanked out of
the CD changer and shoved back onto the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, right about now, no one really wants to hear, yet
again, about walking in a meadow and building a snowman called Parson
Brown, or rediscovering that Frosty the Snowman was a jolly, happy
soul.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe this year, just to break from tradition, someone will,
after a decent interval, put those strictly winter-related songs in
rotation.</TE>
<TE>   Just in time for a post-storm glimpse of those snow-capped peaks
shining above the palms.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Play it safe? Not here</HD>
<DH>New companies, established stages and familiar names

<AU>Lisa Fung</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a year of taking risks.</LD>
<LD>   In Los Angeles, theaters tested (and tested) the boundaries of
audience appetite for the avant-garde. CalArts' Center for New
Theater made a splashy debut with its nearly four-hour production of
"King Lear," directed by Travis Preston and starring an all-female
cast. The $450,000 production had been slated to take place at Walt
Disney Concert Hall amid the construction of the REDCAT (Roy and Edna
Disney CalArts Theater) space that will serve as home to the Center
for New Theater. But conflicts sent the production to a
30,000-square-foot warehouse in the hip Brewery Arts Complex in
downtown L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Across town, David Sefton created a season of bold, daring
productions with UCLA's first International Theatre Festival. Among
the offerings were Italy's Societas Raffaello Sanzio, with the
surreal horrors of "Genesi" and the solemn hallucinatory "Giulio
Cesare"; Heiner Goebbels' quirky Beach Boy-infused "Hashirigaki"; and
Compagnie du Hanneton's "The Junebug Symphony," with its
violin-playing roller-blader.</LD>
<TE>   Some smaller venues continued to embrace issue plays,
intentionally goading audiences and challenging them to become more
than just passive observers.</TE>
<TE>   Actors' Gang imported the post-Sept. 11 play "The Guys" with a
rotating cast of celebrities, as well as the anti-death-penalty play
"The Exonerated," which earned the playwrights an Ovation Award and
is now playing to sellout crowds off-Broadway in New York. And the
Evidence Room brought on more of its signature cutting-edge theater
with David Edgar's epic "Pentecost," as well as a series of biting
world premiere plays about Tinsel Town -- "Hot Property" by Justin
Tanner, "Hollywood Burning" by Michael Sargent, and "Cringe" by Peter
J. Nieves.</TE>
<TE>   A few shows tested their mettle here with pre-Broadway tryouts:
"Into the Woods" played to enthusiastic audiences at the Ahmanson and
"Imaginary Friends" premiered at San Diego's Old Globe.</TE>
<TE>   A number of new small companies quickly made their mark, among
them the Chautauqua Theatre Alliance, which opened quietly with Ray
Proscia's "Imitating Sam," and later joined forces with Taylor Negron
and Justin Tanner for a revival of Negron and Lawrence Justice's 1993
"Gangster Planet." Six youthful newcomers to L.A. burst onto the
scene as the Furious Theatre Company, staging U.S. premieres of
"Saturday Night at the Palace" and "Noise" at their space at the
Armory Center in Pasadena. And a group of stage and screen veterans,
including Mary McDonnell, Randle Mell and Max Mayer, launched a West
Coast version of the long-established New York Stage &amp; Film theater
company and called it -- what else? -- L.A. Stage &amp; Film.</TE>
<TE>   Several names familiar to Southern California audiences weighed in
this year, among them Neil Simon, who updated his 1965 "Odd Couple"
for a Geffen Playhouse production of "Oscar and Felix," and Richard
Greenberg with "The Violet Hour," written to inaugurate South Coast
Repertory's new Julianne Argyros Stage. These new or revised works
gave audiences a taste of something fresh without being too jarring.</TE>
<TE>   Did the year's risks pay off? Financially, not always. Creatively,
sometimes. The real payoff came in exposing audiences to new
adventures in theater.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Theater reviewers' notable shows of 2002</TE>
<TE>   So many productions, so little time. For this year's list, The
Times' 10 primary reviewers were asked to choose their favorite shows
and assess why they thought each was noteworthy. Of course, because
of the volume of productions that went up in the past year, no one
person could see more than just a small slice of the offerings. So we
acknowledge that this consensus list is by no means scientific. And
yes, there are 11 shows on our top 10 list -- there was a tie. Here's
the list, in alphabetical order:</TE>
<TE>   After the Fall, Fountain Theatre. Arthur Miller's deeply personal,
rarely produced play benefited from Stephen Sachs' insightful
staging. Powering the production were two of the year's best
performances: Tracy Middendorf's heartbreaking disintegration as the
Marilyn Monroe character and Morlan Higgins' portrayal of the guy
who's powerless to prevent it from happening.</TE>
<TE>   Big Love,  Pacific Resident Theatre. Love and independence, in
their myriad forms, were indelibly presented in Mel Shapiro's staging
of a Charles L. Mee play that turned a dusty Greek drama into a
bracingly contemporary comedy. And you have to admire any production
that makes such great use of overripe tomatoes, wedding gowns,
splattered blood and white wrestling mats.</TE>
<TE>   Big River, Deaf West Theater at the Mark Taper Forum. A genuine
watershed event, this electrifying "Huckleberry Finn" musical fused
American Sign Language with show-business savvy to unforgettable
effect. Jeff Calhoun's staging ingenuity combined with an
extraordinarily talented cast of hearing and deaf actors made this
show one of the most moving productions of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Crossings, Cornerstone Theater Company. In the refreshing,
emotionally direct "Crossings," Cornerstone tackled the subject of
the immigration of Catholic cultures to Los Angeles. The cracked and
peeling St. Vibiana's provided a mournfully beautiful backdrop for
these stories, presented in areas as varied as the church rooftop and
the inner sanctuary. Using representatives from immigrant populations
as well as professional actors, Cornerstone created a series of
magical, resonant moments about life in both L.A. and the greater
world.</TE>
<TE>   Into the Woods, Ahmanson Theatre. For this pre-Broadway
presentation, Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine cleverly reworked
their witty, fairy-tale musical, in part by giving it more of a
storybook feel amid lush, colorful sets. And the cow. Bringing the
cow to life gave new life to this revival.</TE>
<TE>   Marcel Marceau, Geffen Playhouse. What can you say about a mime?
If it's Marcel Marceau, quite a bit. Even at 79, this still-life
master artist proved that age is only a state of mind as he
unforgettably transformed a bare stage into poignant, nostalgic,
comedic and even epic universes of silent movement. His appearance at
the Geffen represented not just the chance to see a great mime, but
the acknowledged greatest mime in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Nickel and Dimed, Mark Taper Forum. How often do we see the
working poor represented on L.A. stages? Yes, the guilt factor may
have weighed in for the Taper audiences, but the characters'
struggles were presented in a style that maintained a sense of humor
even as it brought home their sense of desperation.</TE>
<TE>   Side Show, Colony Theatre. Nick DeGruccio's staging delicately
revealed this unusual musical's themes of family, career and learning
to be comfortable with being different. The show was impeccably sung
and acted, particularly by Misty Cotton and Julie Dixon Jackson as
Siamese twins Violet and Daisy Hilton.</TE>
<TE>   Times Like These, Padua Playwrights at 2100 Square Feet. John
O'Keefe's harrowing drama about star-crossed lovers pulverized in the
mechanism of Hitler's Germany offered dual statements on the extremes
of love and hate. Loosely based on a little-known tragedy of the
Holocaust, the two-character play captured a moment in history to
agonizing effect.</TE>
<TE>   Trainspotting, Seat of Your Pants Productions at Theatre/Theater.
This unflinching stage adaptation of Irvine Welsh's novel of
Edinburgh heroin addiction was in-your-face theater, literally. This
was theater-in-the-raw -- nudity, violence, profanity, body fluids.
Under Roger Mathey's masterful guidance, the marriage of poetry,
violence and scabrous humor was absolute, with the authentically
unintelligible ensemble committed to their marrow.</TE>
<TE>   War Music, Playwrights' Arena and Echo Theater Company at the Los
Angeles Theatre Center. Bryan Davidson deftly examined three
situations in which war and music intermingled, and director Jessica
Kubzansky created a dreamy production one would expect to see at a
much larger and better endowed theater.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disappointments</TE>
<TE>   The biggest disappointment of the year? It was a tie:</TE>
<TE>   Follies, Reprise! Broadway's Best at Wadsworth Theater. Even given
the concert format limitations, Stephen Sondheim's 1971 musical was
woefully mishandled and ultimately infuriating. Between Arthur Allan
Seidelman's non-direction and some staggeringly poor casting, the
show resembled outtakes from various STAGE benefits over the years --
only far less entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   The House of Bernarda Alba, Mark Taper Forum. Chay Yew's
adaptation infused urgency and passion into Federico Garcia Lorca's
dark drama of repression and obsession, but Lisa Peterson's stiff,
stylized staging leached all of that urgency and passion back out.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>
<HD>More risks, more voices</HD>
<DH>Whether from home or abroad, fresh and inventive films were
plentiful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's been a great year for high-quality Hollywood movies and for
foreign films.</LD>
<LD>   South Korean cinema is fresh and exciting right now but has yet to
break out of noncommercial and festival venues. Its highly touted
Oscar entry "Oasis," a tale of outcast lovers, may change all that.</LD>
<LD>   European cinema remains healthy, Iran continues to produce risky
-- politically and artistically -- pictures, and minority voices are
being heard in national cinemas the world over.</LD>
<TE>   With "Lan Yu," Hong Kong veteran Stanley Kwan set a heartfelt gay
love story against Tiananmen Square and its aftermath that had such
scope and meaning it was as relevant to straight audiences as gay
ones.</TE>
<TE>   On home ground, "Real Women Have Curves" and "Barbershop" emerged
as inspired, insightful ethnic comedies that included everyone in
their warm embraces.</TE>
<TE>   There have been so many exciting documentaries this year that it
would be hard to list them all, but in light of the current and
high-profile "Bowling for Columbine," such earlier 2002 releases as
"The Cockettes" or "The Kid Stays in the Picture" should not be
overlooked.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Thomas' best of 2002</TE>
<TE>   1. "Far from Heaven" and "The Good Girl": Audacious, fully
realized portraits of American wives in the process of
self-discovery, luminously played by Julianne Moore and Jennifer
Aniston, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   2. "Y Tu Mama Tambien": A bold coming-of-age road odyssey
traveling through the heart of contemporary Mexican society, culture
and sexual mores.</TE>
<TE>   3. "The Piano Teacher" and "Merci Pour le Chocolat": Isabelle
Huppert in full glory as a dangerously repressed piano instructor and
as a cool, collected Claude Chabrol villainess, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   4. "Ararat": Atom Egoyan's complex meditation on the Turkish
genocide of Armenians, circa 1915.</TE>
<TE>   5. "24 Hour Party People": A frenetic, innovative portrait of
storied Manchester rock entrepreneur Tony Wilson, played with wit and
passion by Steve Coogan.</TE>
<TE>   6. "Real Women Have Curves" and "Barbershop": The warmest, most
emotionally nourishing and all-embracing American comedies of the
year. The first boasts a career best for the formidable Lupe
Ontiveros as a tradition-bound Latina housewife and mother, the
second has Cedric the Entertainer's hilarious and controversial take
on African American icons.</TE>
<TE>   7. "Tully": A wrenching family drama, an example of the regional
film of such quiet power as to transcend its genre.</TE>
<TE>   8. "Safe Conduct": Bertrand Tavernier's sweeping, suspenseful
homage to those French filmmakers who held on to their integrity
during the Occupation.</TE>
<TE>   9. "Les Destinees": The traditional multigenerational family
chronicle is alive and well. Among other superb performances is yet
another from Huppert as a proud, unjustly rejected wife.</TE>
<TE>   10. "Chicago": The musical is also alive and kicking -- and was a
singing-and-dancing Richard Gere ever better?</TE>
<TE>   Honorable mention: "Lan Yu"; the amusingly kinky Japanese "Warm
Water Under a Red Bridge"; "Late Marriage," a ribald ethnic comedy
turned dark, a most atypical Israeli movie; and "Auto Focus," Paul
Schrader's darkly witty satire on shallow celebrity and compulsive
sex, with a brilliant Greg Kinnear as ill-fated TV star Bob Crane,
with Willem Dafoe as his creepy Pied Piper.</TE>

<KH>THE YEAR IN REVIEW</KH>

<LD>If a film critic is a kind of monarch, the despotic ruler of the
finite area of his or her opinions, the members of a film festival
jury are at the other end of the curve, interconnected parts of a
committee that must both compromise and be convincing if they are to
get their points of view across.</LD>
<LD>   So why was it, in looking back over the films of 2002 and coming
up with a 10-best list, surely the most absolute exercise of critical
power, that I kept thinking back to the rare compromise that the
Berlin Film Festival jury, of which I was a member, made this year:
It split the prestigious top prize, the Golden Bear, between Peter
Greengrass' "Bloody Sunday" and Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away."</LD>
<LD>   It's not because 2002 was a weak year for films; quite the
contrary. My preliminary list of possible 10-best contenders ended up
with almost 30 candidates, ranging from the subversive and
uninhibited "Lilo &amp; Stitch" and "Punch-Drunk Love" to the beautifully
controlled "Insomnia," from "Chicago," a splendid Hollywood musical
of the old school, to "The Cockettes," a charming and insightful
documentary about a musical troupe of a very different kind.</LD>
<TE>   Rather, I gravitated toward the Berlin split because of the
message it sent, both then and now. "Bloody Sunday" and "Spirited
Away" are superb films, but taken together, as a joint top entry,
they are considerably more than the sum of their parts. They are so
disparate in terms of subject and technique, such a cinematic yin and
yang, that they point out how vast a range the film medium can cover.
And because both are examples of the kinds of films that only
infrequently get made, they illustrate as well how unusual it is for
that range to be completely utilized.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two films, the kind of political cinema "Bloody Sunday"
represents is decidedly the rarer commodity. Its investigation of
Jan. 30, 1972, a day in which British troops killed 14 unarmed
civil-rights marchers in Londonderry in Northern Ireland, is so
meticulous that people who were there at the time marvel at its
accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   But "Bloody Sunday" is not waxworks filmmaking. It's a compelling,
gut-clutching piece of advocacy cinema that shows the power of real
events, dramatically conveyed. Working in the spirit of the classic
"Battle of Algiers," director Greengrass and his crew have re-created
that day with such potency that we feel as if we are there with the
marchers, experiencing the awful inevitability of history gone wrong.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Spirited Away," even if you think animated fantasy is an
area you're familiar with, Miyazaki's dark, strange but ultimately
joyous film is something completely different. The product of a
fierce and fearless imagination, able to enthrall the eye while
teaching the heart lessons about love and friendship, it underlines
how by-the-numbers so much nominally imaginative filmmaking actually
is. If more films broke from the pack the way these two did, every
year would be as promising as 2002 turned out to be.</TE>
<TE>   Following in the spirit of Berlin, I've split other (but not all)
of the 10-best slots between two films, sharing the wealth among
deserving pairs. "Don't be stingy, baby" were some of the first words
the famously silent Greta Garbo spoke on screen in "Anna Christie,"
and one could do worse than follow her advice.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Kenneth Turan's top films of 2002</TE>
<TE>   "Bloody Sunday" and "Spirited Away." See above.</TE>
<TE>   "Adaptation." If a bolder, more imaginative film emerged from the
risk-averse studio system, I don't remember it. Writer Charlie
Kaufman and director Spike Jonze have come up with a gleefully
disorienting film on how they couldn't make a film of Susan Orlean's
"The Orchid Thief," throwing in, just for the heck of it, an amusing
treatise on why and how writers write and the outlandish places where
inspiration makes its home.</TE>
<TE>   "The Hours." A beautifully emotional film taken from a Michael
Cunningham novel that felt all but impossible to transfer to the
screen. Yet top-of-the-line acting (Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep,
Julianne Moore), screenwriting (David Hare), directing (Stephen
Daldry) and composing (Philip Glass) have captured us unawares and
illuminated the delicate corners of inner lives.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers" picks up where the last film
left off and provides another jolt of thrilling epic filmmaking
fortified with heart and soul. The cast and crew seem to have
actually lived this story, and we are privileged to be along for the
ride.</TE>
<TE>   "Y Tu Mama Tambien." A sophisticated film masquerading as
something off the cuff, Alfonso Cuaron's Mexican road movie about two
teens and a woman in her 20s is outrageous without being offensive,
provocatively and unapologetically sexual and, best of all, alive to
the possibilities of life and cinema, in that order.</TE>
<TE>   "About Schmidt." Director Alexander Payne and writing partner Jim
Taylor, creators of "Election," have the most wonderfully exact eye
and ear for classic American idiosyncrasies. They've taken Jack
Nicholson and transformed him into an ordinary guy, a retired company
man who finds himself on a Winnebago-powered quest to make sense of
his life. Delicate and sly, graced by an impeccable Nicholson
performance, this is a movie that mixes humor and poignancy with
enviable skill.</TE>
<TE>   "Time Out" and "The Town Is Quiet." A pair of powerful French
dramas that take the stuff of everyday life and turn it into riveting
cinema. The first is Laurent Cantet's subtle and provocative
examination of the importance of work in the human equation. The
second is Robert Guediguian's intimate yet deeply ambitious
neo-realistic look at how a cross-section of Marseilles residents
deal with the desperate circumstances of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fast Runner." It's the rare film that deposits you
convincingly within a compelling, unfamiliar culture. Director
Zaharias Kunuk's extraordinary Inuit-language drama of the Arctic
North tells a story of elemental passions, of undying love and
corrosive lust. .</TE>
<TE>   "Lovely &amp; Amazing." Like the best of personal, independent
American cinema, Nicole Holofcener's all-but-indescribable take on
the complex emotional lives of a mother and her three daughters has a
rueful sensitivity to how quietly ridiculous our 21st century
existence can be.</TE>
<TE>   "The Quiet American" and "Road to Perdition." Without shouting
about it, this pair of exactly crafted and, well, quiet films shows
how satisfying those often underappreciated virtues can be. With
Michael Caine and Tom Hanks giving two of the best male performances
of the year, these were films that didn't need to raise their voices
to get their points across.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Disappointments</TE>
<TE>   While films that let you down are too much the stuff of a critic's
life to be worth dwelling on, failures of systemic nerve and skill
are different. I was disappointed that Americans are so starved for
emotional content that they chose the commonplace "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding" for their beloved, disappointed that the vaunted Disney
organization fought to acquire "Spirited Away" and then couldn't
figure out a way to market it, disappointed finally that we live in a
film world where there's nothing easier than making "Jackass" the No.
1 film in the country. As "Singin' in the Rain" insisted, "Dignity,
always dignity."</TE>

<KH>L.A.'S PARENT OF LAST RESORT</KH>
<HD>Wanted: a Head for Our Largest Household</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Five-year-old Armando has soft, curly hair and sleeps with Mickey
Mouse at his side. Leticia, his 3-year-old sister, sports pigtails,
cuddles Minnie and delights in mimicking the English words her
brother learns in kindergarten. They're sweet kids, and guess what?
They're yours -- although you pay Los Angeles County's Department of
Children and Family Services to do the parenting.</LD>
<LD>   As it happens, the Board of Supervisors is looking for a new
director for that department, someone to head what is, in effect, the
most enormous and beleaguered household in the nation. But anyone
brave or foolish enough to have responded to the county's ad for the
vacant post should peek inside a foot-thick set of accordion files in
the agency's crowded Santa Fe Springs regional office.</LD>
<LD>   This finger-smudged stack of multicolored folders contains the
lives of Leticia, Armando and their six siblings. And those lives,
fragile and at a dangerous moment of familial flux, offer a glimpse
into the agency that serves as uber-parent to the 50,000 county
children who, seldom through fault of their own, have wound up in the
public's care.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next two days we will follow Leticia and her siblings'
two-year odyssey into the county's labyrinthine child welfare system.
Clogged with the de facto orphans of sick, addicted or just plain
irresponsible mothers and fathers, the agency burns through $1.4
billion a year in other families' tax money as it struggles at a task
that must often seem impossible. Some of its obstacles, however, are
self-made: Too often it breaks up fraying families without first
trying the more economical approach of helping (and then badgering)
parents to do the job themselves; it keeps "yanked" children in its
Bermuda Triangle of bureaucracy twice as long as other counties,
shuffles them through an average of four homes, does less than it
might to help these kids negotiate childhood and adolescence and then
pushes far too many into adult life unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   In many ways, the story of Leticia and her smart, exuberant
brothers and sisters presents the agency at its best. Still, their
tale offers insight that could help the next director and the
supervisors do better at the county's most staggering and important
mission.</TE>
<TE>   Eight Lives on Paper</TE>
<TE>   To page through the binders that social workers have compiled on
Leticia and her siblings is to flesh out eight budding individuals,
ages 3 to 16, the progeny of at least six fathers and one mother.
Maria, now 42, was 14 years old and living in Durango, Mexico, when a
doctor first diagnosed epilepsy -- a problem she continued to wrestle
with after arriving, in 1983, in California, where she gave birth to
all her children.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the children describe the rented, two-bedroom Whittier
house they called home for much of their lives as woolly but warm,
with kids wrestling on the floor and incessant squabbling over
whether to watch the "The Simpsons" or play "Tony Hawk"video games.
For dinner, Maria or Javier, the two youngest children's father,
might cook enchiladas or tacos. They'd feed the little kids in one
shift before tracking down the others as they played in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   But outside the family, teachers and others were growing concerned
about the sorts of things to which kids can be oblivious: ragged
clothes, dirty faces, crashing grades. On Oct. 17, 2000, an
elementary school counselor called the county's child-abuse hotline.
Marisol, 10 at the time, still didn't have the eyeglasses she needed,
despite a teacher's repeated notes home. The counselor paid a visit
and found a foul-smelling house swarming with cockroaches and flies.
Maria complained that she was losing her mind.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next two years, concerned neighbors and teachers made at
least 17 more calls, and social workers began grappling with their
key question in trying to protect children: how forcefully to impose
the mighty power of the state on a struggling parent -- knowing that
wrong decisions too often prove tragic.In 1998, for example, the
county took in the children of Ronald Collins after a custody
dispute. Collins says he agreed to the temporary arrangement,
trusting the county to care for his children at a moment when he
couldn't. To his and his children's everlasting torment, their foster
father sexually abused Collins' son.</TE>
<TE>   But keeping children with their natural parents can backfire too.
In 1999, after allegations of neglect, social workers put toddlers
Breanna Lewis and her sister Joan in temporary foster care. The next
year, after agency attorneys neglected to bring the foster parents
and friends to court to report on continued brawling and depression
in the home, the biological parents regained custody. Just before
Christmas 2000, the girls' mother led them to the ninth-floor
observation deck of the Los Angeles County Courthouse. She shoved
them off, then jumped.</TE>
<TE>   It's unlikely that Leticia and her siblings knew of the agency's
failings as it entered their lives. Yet there they were, caught in an
unsettling limbo, between a mother who increasingly couldn't care for
them and a county that sometimes takes in children and plops them
into worse situations than they left. Meanwhile the agency was
chewing through its third director in 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   Call for a Superhero</TE>
<TE>   For years the massive bureaucracy's problems have overwhelmed it,
while the children it is charged with helping radiate out to
overwhelm other civic agencies. Rootless children bog down school
systems; neglected kids swamp public health clinics; system-hardened
youth exhaust police and flood the courts. None of which is
surprising, given how many of the children the county takes in were
previously raised by convicts, cokeheads, pederasts, drunks,
layabouts, losers and louses of every description.</TE>
<TE>   Into this breach step the county's 7,000-child welfare workers --
800 administrators and supervisors, a sadly small army of 2,800
clinical social workers, assorted clerical employees, outside
therapists and a director with the massive task of running the whole
show.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the supervisors dumped Anita Bock from that position,
angry that in her brief tenure she had not cut enough of the red tape
that makes social workers' hard job harder or the unacceptably long
two years most children in Los Angeles County spend in foster care.
Now every taxpayer has a stake in seeing that the board finds a
goal-oriented leader with a solid record of making sure children
failed by their natural parents are not again failed by the
government. Some of the supervisors, however, seem to view the
department as just another, yawn, county bureaucracy. They aspire
only to fill the director's position quickly from the national
management pool. That doesn't mean, however, that finding a superhero
of a leader would -- as other supervisors fantasize -- solve the
agency's myriad problems.</TE>
<TE>   What the agency really needs is a plan for getting its own
household in order, a director who can look into files like those of
Leticia and her siblings and find motivation to take on a superhuman
task and a Board of Supervisors ready to insist on the sort of
reforms that would make success possible.</TE>
<TE>   An Unhappy Holiday</TE>
<TE>   It was at Thanksgiving dinner, a year ago, that Leticia's family
wobbled into such trouble that social workers felt they no longer had
choices to make. Maria, who according to interviews and documents had
by now been diagnosed with depression as well as epilepsy, worked
only sporadically in restaurants or cleaning motel rooms. Javier, who
had a record of alcohol abuse and run-ins with the police, had moved
out. So the family crammed into an apartment with one of Maria's
friends.</TE>
<TE>   The woman was preparing the traditional Thanksgiving feast when
Javier showed up drunk. "You can't stay here like that," Maria
shouted in Spanish. The couple fought. The children cried. On Friday,
Maria wandered aimlessly through the neighborhood. That Monday, a
social worker showed up for a regularly scheduled visit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody says I'm crazy but I'm not!" Maria shouted. She pointed
at her temples and said her head hurt. She said she was numb. Then
she stopped talking.</TE>
<TE>   That afternoon, two social workers took Maria to County-USC
Medical Center. Others gently loaded the children into a white county
van. Even the older children joined in with Armando and Leticia's
sobbing as they stared out the windows. They were leaving the only
family they knew and had no idea of what to expect from the people of
Los Angeles, who had just, albeit indirectly, taken them under their
wings.</TE>

<HD>Why the polar bear has a black nose!</HD>

<LD>Do you know why the polar bear has white fur?</LD>
<LD>   Do you know why the polar bear has a black nose?</LD>
<LD>   Do you know why the polar bear lives in the Arctic?</LD>
<TE>   Well, here is a folk tale that tells why.</TE>
<TE>   A very long time ago, the polar bear lived with all the animals in
the forest. He was friendly, but he could not mind his own business.
He always told the animals how to do things. For his way was the
best.</TE>
<TE>   One day he smelled something cooking. He followed his nose. A
raccoon was boiling something in a pot.</TE>
<TE>   "What's in the pot?" Bear asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it any of your business?" Raccoon asked.</TE>
<TE>   "My nose tells me it needs salt!" Bear said. "Let me test it for
you."</TE>
<TE>   Before Raccoon could stop him, Bear plunged his nose into the hot
pot.</TE>
<TE>   "Ouch!" Bear covered his nose with his paw.</TE>
<TE>   "Your nose is as red as pepper," Raccoon said.</TE>
<TE>   Bear went away to hide his red nose. He rubbed it in the dirt.
Soon his nose turned as black as coal.</TE>
<TE>   "You stuck your nose in where it doesn't belong just one too many
times!" the animals said.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, dear!" Bear cried, "I must go away and hide my nose."</TE>
<TE>   Bear started walking north. It got cold. Snow fell. Everything
turned white. Bear walked on and on. Snow covered his coat. The only
thing that stuck out was his nose.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my!" Bear cried. "My nose is doomed to be like this forever."</TE>
<TE>   And so it was. To this day, the polar bear has a black nose and a
white fur coat, and he hides away in the north.</TE>
<TE>   The polar bear has only this to say: "If you stick your nose where
it doesn't belong, watch out! You may wake up with a nose like mine!"</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Black Leaders Caution Chief," Dec. 14: The sensitivity from
leaders and other people who have criticized L.A. Police Chief
William Bratton for describing the gang problem with words that
really describe the gang problem is regrettable. As a father, I am
not concerned about the language as long as the problem is resolved.
It seems that these leaders and other detractors care more about what
Bratton says than the high amount of deaths and the terror that these
gangs represent. What they have to keep in mind is that a cancer
cannot be cured with aspirin. Nor is Bratton a baby-sitter. On the
other hand, if they do not want to confront the problem or they have
a problem with Bratton's words, I say, as he said last month,
"control your kids." The city belongs to everyone, not to bad people
only.</LD>

<HD>Corporate America Wants Your Pension</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I just read John Balzar's Dec. 18 commentary, "Pension Fund Is About
to Go the Way of Your 401(k)," regarding President Bush's helping
corporate America reduce everyone's pension fund by saying they are
only trying to help the younger workers out. Has everyone in
Washington gone crazy? First we get raped by Wall Street and I lose
almost all value in my 401(k); then Enron and the rest of the energy
companies try to "game" the California energy system. A major health
industry provider is accused of defrauding the U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   The government is pouring trillions of dollars into a program to
shoot missiles out of the sky that anyone with a scientific
background (and backbone) has called bad science. The phone companies
are all but bankrupt, along with the airlines. Forget about Iraq....</LD>
<LD>   I end up getting laid off by a large soft-drink corporation after
working 14 long, hard years (losing my ability to accrue any more
pension benefits) because another company said it could do the work
for less expense. This second company then hires me and tries to get
me to falsify my paperwork, forcing me to quit. Now my elected
officials want to allow these corporations to drive the nail in
deeper?</LD>
<TE>   I must ask (after reading the Dec. 17 article in Business about
Bush's presence at a 1997 Enron party where there were jokes told
about accounting practices), has everyone in this country decided to
loot what's left? And people wonder why so many have given up voting.</TE>

<TE>   After reading Balzar's commentary on company pension funds, the
corporate connection (Enron, etc.) to the Bush administration and the
corporate greed that continues unabated, I have to wonder when and by
whom the preamble to the Constitution was changed from "We the people
... " to "We the corporations.... "</TE>

<LD>Jailing suspected Al Qaeda members captured in Afghanistan at
Guantanamo Bay is one thing, but taking American immigrants who
voluntarily report to INS offices and giving them a surprise trip to
the slammer is quite another ("Hundreds Are Detained After Visits to

also stupid. No other immigrant group will ever report voluntarily to
INS offices again, now that the feds have done this.</LD>

<HD>Why the Rush on Missile Defense?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bush: Missile Defense by 2004," Dec. 18: President Bush is at it
again. The big question is, who is going to shoot a missile at us?
Could it be China? Anyone been to China lately? They're raking in
billions in trade surplus from us. Why would they want to shoot a
missile at us?</LD>
<LD>   Who else is there? Tiny North Korea? We're going to spend billions
to defend against possible missiles from the boogeyman in North
Korea? Terrorists? Even if they had the ability to get a ballistic
missile and shoot it at us, why bother? There are so many proven,
low-tech, low-cost ways to bring us down, like smallpox, anthrax and
ebola. The alleged Washington-area snipers showed how one man with a
rifle can terrify our people and cripple our way of life. Who needs a
missile?</LD>
<LD>   Missile defense is really about payoffs to the defense industry.
If Bush wants to protect national security, he should do it by
spending the money to step up our vigilance against the low-tech
attacks that are sure to come.</LD>

<TE>   Thank you for your Dec. 19 editorial, "Missile Plan Doesn't Fly."
During the late 1980s, there was healthy international debate about
the Strategic Defense Initiative and all the related issues. Not now.
The executive order to deploy antimissile systems has implications
and consequences hardly even alluded to in any of the media.</TE>
<TE>   The serious issues that should be openly discussed range from
strategic to technical. For example, not only is the matter of
hitting targets in the presence of decoys a basic problem but so also
is the overall reliability of such systems. I hope that your remarks
will initiate thorough coverage and discussion of the proposed
system. A good beginning would be a complete, objective summary of
the test program on which the decision to deploy has been based.</TE>

<TE>   Propulsion, Caltech</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by the recent, failed missile defense practice run --
the third miss in eight rigged attempts -- Bush wasted no time in
ordering the program's immediate deployment. He cited unnamed "new
threats we face" -- presumably terrorists -- as justification for the
construction of the same Star Wars program he wholeheartedly endorsed
way back in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A flawed and expensive missile defense will not deter these "new
threats" any more today than the U.S.' vastly superior military
forces deterred the terrorists before 9/11.</TE>

<HD>We Can Blame Gov. Davis for Bad Budget News</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis Says Tax Hikes Likely as Shortfall Soars," Dec. 19: How
does a state "find" itself in a budget crisis of more than 30,000
million dollars? The amount is so enormous it's beyond comprehension,
and yet everyone seems to just go along with whatever the next number
is that Sacramento throws out. But where did this and all the
previous deficit figures in the tens of billions come from?</LD>
<LD>   Sure, there are protests against cuts, but that is nothing more
than allowing members of the public to think they have some say in
this fiasco. Politicians tell us programs must be cut and taxes must
be increased. Where did all that money go before? What programs were
so fat that they could eat up that kind of money? We can't be so
acquiescent. Show me the numbers!</LD>
<LD>   Diane Toevs</LD>
<TE>   Paso Robles</TE>
<TE>   I am appalled that Gov. Gray Davis says tax hikes are likely as
the budget shortfall soars to $34.8 billion. Just a short time ago,
California had excess money in the till. Before going to the
taxpayers, I feel strongly that Davis needs to first give pink slips
to the thousands of new employees he has hired in the last few years.
Then he needs to cut the budgets back to 1999 levels. There wouldn't
need to be tax hikes if the governor understood that two plus two
doesn't make nine. Why should the taxpayers bear this overwhelming
burden when it was the governor who got us into this mess?</TE>
<TE>   Susan Valerie Weight</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   Former legislator Steve Peace has been named Davis' finance
director (Dec. 19). Peace will always be remembered as the man most
responsible for the energy deregulation that led to the massive
price-gouging of California consumers. Nice choice, Gov. Davis. No
wonder you won reelection by such a convincing margin.</TE>
<TE>   Markel Tumlin</TE>
<TE>   San Diego</TE>
<TE>   The state should file for bankruptcy just as Orange County had to
do when it bungled the management of public money. That way the
bondholders would share in this debacle and not get a free ride at
the taxpayers' expense. Bonds pay interest, which in essence is a
risk premium, which every buyer of bonds knows. A "reorganization" of
the debt would save at least $14 billion, half of the shortfall. And
charge the top state budget brass with negligence and malfeasance.
Let's for once show these highly paid officials that they cannot
grant raises, increase staff and mandate benefits with reckless
abandon and impunity but will be held responsible for the management
of the taxpayers' money.</TE>
<TE>   Ivar Schoenmeyr</TE>
<TE>   San Juan Capistrano</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps Davis could make up the difference in the California
funding shortfall with a modest contribution from his campaign
finance surplus. This, hopefully, would not affect the pay increases
of the prison guards.</TE>

<LD>Re "Supervisors Object to Baca's Sales Tax Request," Dec. 18: Can you
put a price on public safety? According to the L.A. County Board of
Supervisors, you can. Its recent criticism of Sheriff Lee Baca's
proposal to place a half-cent sales tax on the ballot further conveys
its views on protecting the county.</LD>
<LD>   The concern of new funding not going to other law enforcement
organizations is preposterous. Crime is not contained within the
boundaries of a city. Less criminal activity in one area helps
another. The Board of Supervisors needs to get off its pedestal and
fund the Sheriff's Department adequately, or we can continue to
expect a rise in crime throughout the county.</LD>

<LD>I write with sympathy, as a gay man in his 20s, for the student who
was ejected from gym class ("Lesbian Teen Sues District for Bias,"
Dec. 18). She is at an age where she is only being introduced to her
sexuality and how different it is from the norm that is present in
her family and community. This is difficult and stressful at her age.
And to be treated with humiliation on the part of school officials
for a situation in which she made a good-faith effort to be honest
about her sexuality to a fellow student is not right. I hope school
departments across California and the U.S. learn from this episode
and demonstrate more sensitivity to their gay students.</LD>

<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>In the 19th century, it was a widely held belief among certain
European and American intellectuals that Catholicism and democracy
were irreconcilable. Ralph Waldo Emerson, for example, once
complained in a letter to Scottish historian Thomas Carlyle of
"Romish priests, who sympathize, of course, with despotism." This
seems an absurd assumption today, in a world where heavily Catholic
Christian Democratic parties are pillars of democracy throughout
Europe.</LD>
<LD>   It is equally absurd, though quite common, to assume that Islam
and democracy are incompatible.</LD>
<LD>   Take the case of Turkey, where a secular constitution has
transformed the country over the last 80 years into a functioning,
albeit deeply flawed, democracy. The country's recently held
democratic elections saw the victory of a party with strong Islamic
roots that is nonetheless committed to democracy and human rights.</LD>
<TE>   Iran, too, should be considered. The country's Islamic
constitution is obviously oppressive. But this same constitution
guarantees elections that, while not entirely free, are not a sham.
Elections are contested; women as well as men have the right to vote;
and, though all candidates have to be approved by religious
authorities, there are factions and nuances within the limited
discourse.</TE>
<TE>   President Mohammad Khatami has been elected twice against a
hard-line conservative establishment candidate and, because he stands
for a more open version of Islam, he was supported by young voters
and women. Parliamentary debates are lively, with issues of state and
religion openly discussed and voted on. In the last parliamentary
elections, the reformist factions received a majority. The unelected
conservative Council of Guardians still controls many aspects of
public life, yet politics are lively, disputatious and much more open
than just 10 years ago. Iran's careful support of the U.S. war on the
Taliban suggests how varied the world of Islam can be.</TE>
<TE>   Other examples -- Bangladesh, Indonesia, even Pakistan between
military dictators -- suggest that multiparty systems and elections
are not alien to the Muslim world.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it is a fact that in the heart of the Muslim world there is a
bloc of countries where not one is democratic and there has been no
real movement toward democracy: the 21 member countries of the Arab
League. Even the much-publicized October parliamentary elections in
tiny Bahrain -- a welcome development -- have been made irrelevant by
the king's parallel appointment of an unelected consultative council
whose powers equal those of the elected assembly. Not surprisingly,
the elections were boycotted by some parties, and the so-called
constitutional reform turned out to be mainly a sham.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab world encompasses a great variety of countries: Some are
poor, such as Egypt, Algeria, Sudan and Yemen, while others are
enormously rich, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates. They are small and large, populous and sparsely populated.
There are monarchies and military dictatorships, benevolent and
harsh. But none of their leaders was freely elected.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, at a time when regions of the world from Eastern Europe
to Latin America to sub-Saharan Africa to Southeast Asia have moved
toward democracy, there has never been anything comparable in any
Arab country. We have seen no Arab Mikhail Gorbachev, no Arab Lech
Walesa or Vaclav Havel, no Arab Solidarity Movement. No Arab
dictatorial regime has ever been overthrown by a popular uprising. No
Arab country has spawned a serious movement of opposition to the
(unelected) powers that be.</TE>
<TE>   Compare the following: A few months ago, an outspoken Iranian
academic, Hashem Aghajari, was put on trial and sentenced to death
for criticizing some tenets of Islam. Since his trial there have been
constant student demonstrations in Tehran and other cities. At great
personal risk, demonstrators have clashed with police. Reform
leaders, including even some from circles around President Khatami,
have called for quashing the sentence. After weeks of unrest, the
conservative legal establishment has now agreed to review Aghajari's
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   In Egypt, on the other hand, Egyptian sociologist Saad Eddin
Ibrahim was put on trial two years ago and sentenced -- twice -- to
seven years of hard labor because he dared conduct election research
and look into issues of women's rights and human rights for the
Coptic Christian minority. Criticism from abroad moved the government
to call for a new trial, but there has been no protest in Egypt. For
two years there have been no significant popular demonstrations
supporting Ibrahim, and few Egyptian intellectuals have voiced
criticism of the attempt to stifle a dissenting voice.</TE>
<TE>   As a 2002 United Nations Development Program report noted, "the
transfer of power through the ballot box is not a common phenomenon
in the Arab world." This democracy deficit is coupled with a weakness
of civil society, and an almost total absence of civil courage. It
has far-reaching consequences for women, among others.</TE>
<TE>   In Iran, despite the chador, women vote, and a woman is deputy
speaker of the Majlis, or parliament. In Saudi Arabia, on the other
hand, women are not allowed even to drive and cannot venture from
home without a chaperon. In countries like Egypt and Syria, the
situation is obviously different -- they are secular autocracies --
but women are nevertheless politically marginalized.</TE>
<TE>   This lack of a democratic culture in Arab countries still needs an
explanation, but until Sept. 11, it was not politically correct to
mention it. It is now finally getting both political and scholarly
attention worldwide, not because of a simplistic acceptance of a
"clash of civilizations" theory but for more practical reasons. The
democracy deficit in Arab societies has become a major issue for
global security.</TE>
<TE>   When people in Saudi Arabia and Egypt are deprived of freedom at
home, they are pushed to religious fanaticism as the only way to
express anger at their oppression. The 15 Saudi suicide-murderers of
9/11 were not poor or illiterate. They, as well as their Egyptian
leader, Mohamed Atta, were middle-class people, relatively well
educated. In an open society, they would be members of a legitimate
opposition. Denied other channels of dissent, they became terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Added to this is that, in some cases -- the Saudi one especially
-- official ideology focuses on depicting the West as pagan,
materialistic and hateful. In Egypt, where no criticism of the
government is allowed in the media, lambasting the U.S. (and Israel,
of course) is allowed, and even encouraged, to divert criticism from
the failures of President Hosni Mubarak's regime.</TE>
<TE>   Islam is not the enemy. But the lack of democracy in Arab
countries pushes people toward religious fanaticism and terrorism.
This major danger to world security must be addressed frankly and
openly.</TE>

<HD>Terrorists May Think: 'Vegas, Baby!'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Marc Cooper</AU>
<BD>Marc Cooper is a contributing editor to the Nation
magazine and an editor at LA Weekly. His book "Las Vegas, America"
will be published in 2003 by Nation Books.</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Pity poor Bill Young, the sheriff-elect of Glitter Gulch. He has yet
to formally take office and he's already being treated by the locals
as if he were the fictional Police Chief Brody of Steven Spielberg's
classic movie "Jaws."</LD>
<LD>   Just as Roy Scheider's screen character evoked local disdain for
suggesting his island beaches be closed during a profitable holiday
weekend because of a hungry man-eating shark, Vegas' new top lawman
drew a chorus of howls when he warned this month that Vegas was a
"prime target" for a terrorist attack. And in the event of such an
attack, Young said at a local gaming conference, "We are done as the
mecca of American tourism."</LD>
<LD>   Young, of course, ran right into the third rail of the Vegas
ethos: Never let uncomfortable realities interfere with the
mythologies that lure in a mind-boggling 35 million tourists a year
-- visitors who obligingly leave behind more than $20 billion. So
paranoid are city fathers about bad publicity that the police
department's commander for anti-terrorism said that even if an actual
terrorist act were prevented, "We won't be able to talk about it
because reports in the media will have an [economic] impact
themselves." And yet all these purely commercial fears aside, it's
dead obvious that Las Vegas is -- from a terrorist's point of view --
exactly what the military likes to call a "target-rich environment."</LD>
<TE>   Consider the lure: Eighteen of the world's 21 biggest hotels crowd
the Vegas Strip. A half-scale Eiffel Tower beckons. The 39-story,
glimmering, gold-faced Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino is but a few
hundred yards from the international airport. The 1,149-foot
Stratosphere Observation Tower -- the tallest structure west of the
Mississippi River -- sprouts like a giant stick-pin on a map. The
laser beam atop the Luxor Hotel -- itself a mammoth black glass
pyramid -- is so bright, it can be seen by orbiting spacecraft.</TE>
<TE>   Think about the symbolism. Here is an entire city predicated on
all that is antithetical and offensive to the fundamentalist mind.
Las Vegas is a pagan haven dedicated to satisfying all of the base
urges of godless infidels, a swirling neon metropolis of casinos,
strip bars and restaurants, with America's only legal brothels just a
short ride away over the county line.</TE>
<TE>   Don't think I'm giving anything away here to potential terrorists.
Remember that shortly before the attacks on New York's World Trade
Center and the Pentagon, five of the 19 hijackers met in a seedy
motel on the Vegas Strip. And as the recent terror attacks in Bali
and Kenya made clear, Al Qaeda has pleasure resorts firmly in its
sights.</TE>
<TE>   Yet nearly 100,000 visitors keep coming daily by train, plane and
automobile into this city that could be considered the next logical
terrorist target. This coming New Year, almost 100% of Vegas' 125,000
hotel rooms along the Strip will be filled, regardless of nightly
rates of $300, $400 or more. The Strip will be jammed with throngs
gathered to watch half a million dollars worth of fireworks go up in
an eight-minute display. Open seats will be scarce at the blackjack
tables as the minimum bet gets cranked up to $15 or even $25.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the events of 9/11 have barely dinged Las Vegas. Overall,
tourism is down 5% or less for the year. Local hotel and casino
operators who have been spoiled by two decades of uninterrupted
growth have panicked over this minimal fall-off. But what is more
amazing is that Vegas has been able to hang on to 95% or more of its
customer base. And during half a dozen reporting trips I have made
here since Sept. 11, 2001, the only reticence I hear comes from
tourists angered by airport security hassles, not concern that they
are possibly spending three-day weekends in the sights of Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Herein reside some clues about how Americans handle risk,
especially in the post-9/11 world. Even in less-turbulent times,
Europeans have used their leisure to explore more of the world, while
our entertainment-based culture has driven millions of Americans to
vacation by retreating from the real world. It is no accident that
the only U.S. "destination resort" that draws more annual tourists
than Vegas is Orlando, Fla. -- home base to Disney World and a jumble
of other theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   You could put a charitable spin on it and conclude that, by
flocking to Las Vegas in these jittery times, Americans are
consciously and bravely defying the terrorist threat. On the corner
of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue, in the shadow of the New
York New York Hotel and Casino's replica Statue of Liberty, an homage
to the Big Apple's martyred firefighters has flourished since 9/11.
Hundreds of T-shirts from other American fire departments have been
hung on the hotel fence and inscribed with messages of compassion.</TE>
<TE>   But this tiny corner of real remembrance on the Strip seems an
aberration, a contradiction to everything around it. This small
homage to the Fire Department of New York ultimately rings as hollow
as the phony half-scale Lady Liberty that watches over it. The
ongoing rush to Vegas is much more about forgetting, much more about
a collective denial, than it is about defiance and memory. And what
better place than Las Vegas to blot out the dreary realities of our
times? An ersatz environment with, seemingly, the Seven Wonders of
the World reproduced and compressed along the five-mile Strip, Las
Vegas exists only in the "eternal now," as one local academic puts
it. No calendars, no clocks, a town with no past and no future, and
hardly even a present. It's more a timeless, context-free adult
playground bounded only by your credit card limit or the number of
days off your boss will grant you.</TE>
<TE>   In running from the risk of Al Qaeda by jamming the same Strip
where its operatives partially met before the 9/11 attack, Americans
avoid thinking about any risks, except perhaps losing the mortgage at
the roulette table. Few lose that much. But some statistics show that
when Americans visit Vegas, they -- on average -- lose more than they
pocketed in last year's Bush tax rebate.</TE>
<TE>   But not to worry. As this troublesome year draws to a close, as
the threat of Al Qaeda remains haunting, elusive and undefined, as
dark clouds of war with Iraq gather overhead, the revelers along the
Vegas Strip will be paying little attention, if any, to the Homeland
Security office's yellow or orange alerts. For here in Las Vegas, on
any day or night of the year, there are only two colors that count,
and they are red and black.</TE>

<HD>The Media Bias Myth</HD>
<DH>Liberal? Conservative? It's not about ideology.  The real
battle is over the proper role of journalism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Neal Gabler</AU>
<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Say something loud enough and frequently enough and a good many
people will believe it is true. For decades, conservatives have
howled that most major TV news sources, including ABC, CBS, NBC and
CNN, and three major U.S. newspapers, the Los Angeles Times, the New
York Times and the Washington Post, have a pronounced liberal slant.
This year, former CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg hit the
bestseller lists with a book titled "Bias," which described the
liberal sins of network news, and conservative pundit Ann Coulter had
another bestseller with "Slander: Liberal Lies About the American
Right." As Goldberg put it, "The old argument that the networks and
other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that
it's hardly worth discussing anymore."</LD>
<LD>   So, how do you explain the "liberal" media's failure to rebuke
Sen. Trent Lott for the string of pro-segregationist pronouncements
that came before his infamous gaffe at Sen. Strom Thurmond's 100th
birthday party? Or the media's curious lack of interest in George W.
Bush's windfall at Harken Energy and indifference to his stonewalling
a Securities and Exchange Commission report investigating the
episode? Or their unwillingness to challenge Vice President Dick
Cheney on his cozy relationship with the energy industry while he was
drafting the country's energy policy?</LD>
<TE>   It sure doesn't sound like a liberal media. Rather, it sounds
downright conservative, which is what some liberals are saying. In
their view, the conglomerates that own most of the news media are
promoting their own interests, and those interests tend to be
conservative.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a third and more disturbing possibility in which both
sides have gotten it wrong. Looking at it philosophically rather than
ideologically, the real media war today isn't between liberals and
conservatives but between two entirely different journalistic
mind-sets: those who believe in advocacy, and those who believe in
objectivity -- or, at the very least, in the appearance of
objectivity. And what we are witnessing is not just a political
skirmish but a battle for the soul of American journalism.</TE>
<TE>   Most of us take it for granted that the media should be
disinterested, but for the better part of the history of American
journalism, this would have been regarded as idiotic. Throughout the
18th and 19th centuries, the press was not impartial, nor was it
supposed to be. Newspapers were published by political parties, or
their allies, with the express purpose of advancing an agenda; news
was almost always tinctured with opinion. The papers were principally
targeted at the party faithful, or at potential recruits, who read
them for incitement, just as listeners today tune in to Rush Limbaugh
or Bill O'Reilly to stoke their political fires. Put another way, a
newspaper provided ammunition, not information.</TE>
<TE>   The great newspaper war between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World
and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal, in the last decade of
the 19th century, showed how rabid a partisan press could be when
fighting for readers. But if this journalistic food fight represented
the apex of advocacy, it also marked the beginning of its end as a
media standard. During the Progressive era, middle-class reformers
aimed to bring rationality and high purpose to American life. One of
their central tenets was the idea of professionalization, and the
press was no exception. Schools of journalism were inaugurated and,
with them, the novel notion that journalism is a vocation, like
medicine or law, with its own rules and standards. One of its highest
standards was impartiality. From now on, reporters were to present
the news, not plead a case.</TE>
<TE>   This approach didn't take root immediately, and it was often
honored in the breach. Still, objectivity as a guiding principle did
become a mark of journalistic respectability, the standard that
separated real newspapers from tabloids, real reporters from hacks.
When radio and later television began to broadcast news, they strove
to adhere to the standard of objectivity. This was because the
Federal Communications Act of 1934 required that the public interest
be served in return for the use of the public's airwaves (and
impartial news was considered to be in the public interest), and
because the last thing the new media wanted to do was risk alienating
audiences. When they did broadcast opinion, it was labeled as such
and was segregated from the regular news. The anchormen at NBC or CBS
were seldom accused of bias back then.</TE>
<TE>   Today's conservatives scoff at the professed objectivity of
network news reporters and newspaper correspondents, often
brandishing a 1995 survey by the Roper Center and Freedom Forum as
their smoking gun. The survey showed that 89% of the journalists
polled voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, while only 7% cast a ballot
for George Bush. One problem with conservative interpretations of
this study is that they assume that politics trumps professionalism
for liberal journalists but not for conservative ones. Far more
likely is that, for both liberal and conservative journalists,
politics has roughly the same priority it has for any of us
regardless of profession. When there is bias, and it does exist, one
can chalk it up to the personal rather than the political, or to the
press' herd instinct for ganging up as long as doing so fits the
public temper at the time.</TE>
<TE>   The dirty little secret of network newscasts, and of most major
newspapers, is not that they are manned by liberal proselytizers. It
is that they are trying to attract the widest possible viewership, or
readership, and that doing so necessitates that they be as
inoffensive as possible. That is why investigative reports seem so
toothless, gumming away at government boondoggles or consumer fraud
or corrupt politicians that are unlikely to infuriate either the left
or the right.</TE>
<TE>   That is also why both network TV news and the major newspapers
seem so bland compared with cable news or the tabloids, unless they
can latch onto a story like Rep. Gary Condit's affair with an intern
who disappeared and was later found dead. The mainstream media prefer
to stay under the radar and out of the gun sights of critics, so what
may seem like liberalism to conservatives -- in its tolerance,
forbearance and embrace of the conventional wisdom -- and
conservatism to liberals -- in its support of the status quo -- is
really a strategy to keep people watching. It may be objectivity in
the service of ratings, but it is objectivity just the same.</TE>
<TE>   What is true for the networks and mainstream mass-circulation
newspapers, however, is not true for cable television, the tabloids
or the Internet. For one thing, cable is not restrained by the
Federal Communications Commission to serve the public interest. For
another, cable television news is "narrowcast": It appeals to a
relatively small segment of the population, and it must tailor its
approach to attract and hold its viewers. This tends to reward
advocacy of any sort, liberal as well as conservative. But it has
proved especially hospitable to conservatism, because conservatism is
much more lively than liberalism and that much more entertaining.
Also, conservatives are more ideologically unified than liberals and
thus enjoy listening to their ideas being reinforced. In short, cable
news networks like the Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNBC provide
advocacy in the service of ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, advocates disclaim that they are anything of the sort.
They assert they only seem partisan compared with the real
propagandists of the mainstream press. "Fair and balanced" is the
motto of the conservative Fox News Channel, where I appear as a
panelist on "Fox News Watch." The motto is just as disingenuous as it
sounds. The mainstream press is an easy target for advocates
precisely because it cannot take sides without surrendering its
impartiality, so it sits there and takes it. This permits the
Orwellian paradox of Coulter spewing some 200 pages of conservative
name-calling against liberals while contending that liberals are
always name-calling against conservatives, or the paradox of Coulter
complaining of liberal bias while appearing regularly on the very
networks she attacks.</TE>
<TE>   None of this would really matter much if the sides were equally
poised or if advocates would permit them to peacefully coexist.
Advocacy, after all, can be just as valuable, and is certainly just
as necessary, as objectivity.</TE>
<TE>   But there is no balance, and conservative advocates aren't
interested in coexistence. Cable television attracts only a fraction
of the viewers of the network news broadcasts; on their best days,
the aggregate audience for all the cable news networks is somewhere
around 3 million, whereas the network news broadcasts still get
nearly 30 million viewers a night.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, one would never guess this by the way the advocates have been
driving the news. Cable's influence is magnified exponentially by the
fact that its audience is more energized and its reports deeply
impassioned. It grabs attention while the networks and newspapers
studiously avoid attention. It makes news while the traditional
networks break news.</TE>
<TE>   Just compare Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings to
O'Reilly, Brit Hume, Chris Matthews and Kudlow and Cramer. Though he
calls his show a "no-spin zone," Fox's O'Reilly grills his guests,
smirks at their answers and shakes his head in disbelief when he
hears what he regards as a liberal opinion. MSNBC's Matthews was once
an aide to Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill, but he too plays the
cable game by roasting liberalism on a spit that spins as fast as a
jet turbine. Similarly, Hume on Fox can barely conceal his agony when
he has to report a criticism of President Bush. For these guys, Bill
Clinton and Tom Daschle, not Osama bin Laden and his ilk, are the
real threats to America.</TE>
<TE>   More important, since they are not playing by the same rules as
the practitioners of objectivity, the advocates are able to
intimidate the networks and newspapers. Lest they lend credence to
charges of bias, mainstream news outlets seem to be bending over
backward to prove they are not liberal and harbor no animus toward
the Republican administration, even though the political spectrum has
shifted so far right over the last decade that thinking once
considered centrist is now seen as liberal.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this intimidation may be the real objective of the
advocates. Though partisans on both ends of the political spectrum
seem to love journalistic bloodletting, they don't just want to bash
the media. They want to use the media's goal of objectivity to render
them even more feckless.</TE>
<TE>   It is hard to beat zealots when they are fighting with swords and
you are fighting with ploughshares. Already, the New York Times seems
to be indulging in more open partisanship with its crusade against
the exclusion of women members at Augusta National Golf Club. And
recent news reports on U.S. war plans against Iraq seem designed to
discourage action there.</TE>
<TE>   While no one should be writing an epitaph for the ideal of
objectivity, developments like these suggest that it is beleaguered.
Advocacy has all the advantages and objectivity little defense
against it, especially since nothing would satisfy the right-wing
advocates short of abject surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, this isn't just a triumph of conservatism. This is a
reversion to an old, old way of doing business, back when the press
wasn't a light but a bludgeon. And the losers aren't just liberals.
The real loser is the idea that the chief obligation of the press is
to tell it the way it is without fear or favor.</TE>

<BD>Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to Opinion,
is a senior scholar in the School of Policy, Planning and Development
at USC.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>There may be a new dynamic at work in the politics of crafting the
California budget, one hinted at in last month's gubernatorial
election. Then, Gov. Gray Davis carried almost all the counties along
the coast, while his Republican challenger, Bill Simon, took
virtually all of the rest of the state. Will there be an
inland-versus-coastal element, in addition to the usual clash of
interests and ideologies, in this year's budget battle?</LD>
<LD>   Before the election, Davis understood that closing the budget
gap -- currently estimated at $35 billion over the next 18 months --
would require politically painful choices. His slash-and-slam
campaign was largely designed to run out the clock beyond the
November elections. Now, he cannot avoid confronting the grim task
ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Most newly elected legislators, beneficiaries of term limits or
the game of political musical chairs inspired by them, are virtually
clueless about how to fix things. Freshman Assemblywoman Cindy
Montanez (D-San Fernando), 28, was 17 years old when the last major
fiscal crisis hit. First-time legislators attending Davis' special
budget session, roughly one-third of the lawmakers, acted like deer
frozen in the headlights of an oncoming truck convoy.</LD>
<TE>   Old Sacramento hands, in contrast, seem resigned. One decried "a
complete absence of a sense of urgency" in the legislative chambers.
"The Assembly will wait till January," predicted one Democratic
legislator. "We want to see the governor's budget [which must be
submitted on Jan. 10] before we commit political suicide."</TE>
<TE>   Ideology and arithmetic complicate matters. Closed primaries and
safe districts have sent to Sacramento conservative Republicans who
are firm in their antipathy toward anything that looks like a tax
increase.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic caucuses have vowed to protect social services by
spreading the pain; they want new revenue in addition to spending
cuts. Assuming they can keep their own members in line, they'll need
six GOP votes in the Assembly and two in the Senate to rack up the
two-thirds necessary for budget approval.</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy. Last summer, state Sen. Maurice Johannessen
(R-Redding), recently appointed Veterans Affairs secretary by Davis,
supplied the one GOP vote needed to pass the budget in the upper
chamber. He was termed out and replaced by anti-tax Assemblyman Sam
Aanestad (R-Grass Valley). Four GOP Assembly members who supported
recent Democratic budgets have been replaced by staunchly
conservative Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The three Republicans who captured Democratic seats Nov. 5, like
the lawmakers who were last year's budget rebels, represent inland
California.</TE>
<TE>   It was Democratic pollster Paul Maslin who first posited the
increasing political importance of inland California. This is where
the state's greatest growth is occurring. This is where the Latino
population is rapidly increasing. By 2010, Maslin said, if present
growth continues, inland California will cast as many votes as the
Bay Area and Los Angeles County combined. According to the Field
Institute, L.A. and San Francisco accounted for almost 50% of the
state's vote in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   These days, inland California voters tend to be more
anti-government and anti-tax and less loyal to the Democratic Party
than their coastal counterparts. They share many of the
characteristics of California's independent swing voters, who,
according to Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute of
California, "describe themselves as moderate to somewhat conservative
in their politics."</TE>
<TE>   That may change as more Latinos enter the voting rolls. According
to Baldassare, "Latinos are distinct in their strong and consistent
preferences for government spending. ... Their liberal positions on
fiscal issues stand in contrast to the state's white voters, who have
been inclined to take a hard line against spending and tax increases
since Proposition 13." For inland Republicans, this sets up a
potential collision between their party's ideology and their
constituents' priorities.</TE>
<TE>   How will these demographic and political shifts affect the budget
debate?</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent survey by the Public Policy Institute of
California, "Two of California's fastest-growing regions [the San
Joaquin Valley and the Inland Empire] ... have low and declining
incomes."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, those areas "have fewer resources" than other regions
"to successfully plan for and provide for population growth." State
budget cuts, and their trickle-down effect on local funding, will
exacerbate the crunch. Transportation, housing, education and health
care are in the budgeteers' cross hairs.</TE>
<TE>   Can GOP legislators who represent competitive inland districts
afford to hold out on raising revenues needed to finance programs
their constituents consider important? Will they risk the wrath of
Republican party activists for deserting their caucus' no-new-taxes
stand, or hazard the loss of support from constituents who believe
their quality of life to be threatened?</TE>
<TE>   At a recent hearing on health-care cuts, Assemblyman Robert
Pacheco (R-Walnut) acknowledged his need to "keep an open mind." He
didn't embrace tax increases, but he didn't flatly rule them out,
either.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, will Democrats representing coastal districts
commit the tax dollars of their constituents to government services
needed by inland California, when their party's urban strongholds are
hurting?</TE>
<TE>   Because of the unprecedented size of this year's deficit, everyone
will be affected by the budget cuts. The issue is who will get hit
the hardest. That will pit interest against interest, city against
city and county against county throughout the state. It is a recipe
for some serious legislative deadlock. Already, lawmakers are looking
to punt.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent press conference, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton
(D-San Francisco) brought up the possibility of placing an initiative
on the ballot that would link tax increases to specific programs. In
the next breath, he groused, "This is not a way to run government."</TE>
<TE>   But piling on more ballot-box budgeting may be the only way this
Legislature and governor can dig the state out of its fiscal morass.
And if the budget solution comes down to the ballot, it will have to
be one that appeals to those swing voters in California's interior.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being denied the chance to judge their leaders on this
critical issue during the 2002 campaign, voters could have the last
word in determining the direction of the state, how much we will pay
to get there and which Californians will foot the bill or pay the
price.</TE>

<AU>Walter Russell Mead</AU>
<BD>Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion,
is the author of "Special Providence: American Foreign Policy and How
It Changed the World."</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mobs are fighting in the streets of Venezuela, a country that sends
the United States as much oil as Saudi Arabia. A general strike is
paralyzing Venezuela's economy. While ineffective mediators from the
Organization of American States seek solutions, the country's
politics have broken down and its future could be up to the generals.</LD>
<LD>   For Americans under 40, the depressing events in Caracas are an
education: This is the way much of Latin America used to look.</LD>
<LD>   Rapacious elites, often descended from the Spanish colonizers,
pillaged countries, monopolized business opportunities and exploited
populations often descended, in large part, from the pre-Colombian
inhabitants of the region. Using their wealth and sophistication, the
elites charmed naive U.S. economists and diplomats with their good
manners and international culture as they reassured them about their
affection for democracy and free markets.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in shantytowns and impoverished farming communities,
the increasingly embittered masses seethed until, from time to time,
some charismatic figure emerged to channel their anger into a
political movement. Turning the masses against the upper classes,
sometimes with elections and sometimes without, the populist caudillo
crushed the old oligarchic parties and set up a regime that
concentrated power in his own hands.</TE>
<TE>   Meet the new boss, same as the old boss: Corruption and
incompetence under the populists often got so bad that the military
took control and ultimately turned the system back over to the old,
but still incompetent, ruling elite. Repeat as needed for 150 years.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, it looked for a while as if Latin America had broken
this old cycle. A generation of free-market economists was replacing
the old-business dinosaurs in controlling Latin American capitalism.
Foreign competition and investment were forcing the oligarchs to give
up their self-interested control over the levers of economic
management.</TE>
<TE>   Political competition among parties accepting the rule of law
produced more competent democratic political leaders. Better policies
got Latin America off the old treadmill of boom and bust, mob and
coup.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the "new" Latin America, like the "new" stock market of the
Internet boom, turned out to contain a lot of hot air. Argentina and
Venezuela, in particular, seem to have sunk to the worst of the Latin
past, as incompetent populists square off against crooked oligarchs,
with the armed forces looming in the background. Other countries also
look bleak: Peru, Ecuador and Colombia all teeter uneasily at various
distances from the abyss.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, things aren't this bad everywhere. Chile continues to
put the Pinochet years behind it; Mexico's newly democratic political
system is working reasonably well; Brazil's new left-wing president,
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, seems convinced that there are no populist
shortcuts to the solid, long-term economic progress that, alone, can
raise the living standards of Brazil's workers in a sustainable way.
Even where things are getting worse, rising education levels suggest
that, long term, Latin America will move haltingly forward.</TE>
<TE>   That long-term good news is of little help to a Bush
administration confronting a serious political crisis in one of the
largest oil exporters to the United States. From Washington, a city
deeply preoccupied by the war on terror and the continuing crisis
with Iraq, Venezuela is a deeply unwelcome diversion. Oil prices have
passed $30 a barrel and the oil industry in Venezuela has cut
production up to 70%. Worse, the United States has no attractive
policy options at this time.</TE>
<TE>   Let's not be fooled again. Neither side in Venezuela really merits
U.S. support. President Hugo Chavez is a Castro-hugging,
anti-American thug. If he consolidates his power, he will undermine
democracy in Venezuela in the name of his "Bolivarian revolution,"
while seeking ways to alarm, annoy and harass the United States --
and back the price hawks in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. There's also the possibility that Chavez could intervene
to further destabilize war-torn Colombia by supporting Marxist
guerrilla groups and drug cartels against the U.S.-aligned government
there.</TE>
<TE>   The Venezuelan opposition is more friendly to the United States,
but it is composed of the corrupt and incompetent leaders who failed
for more than a generation to harness Venezuela's oil wealth to a
development program that could meet the needs of the country's poor.
They attack Chavez in the name of democracy, but they want to rip up
the Venezuelan constitution by street riots and strikes, and they are
more than hinting at support for a military coup.</TE>
<TE>   In the Cold War, Venezuela would have been a no-brainer. We would
have backed the upper middle class and the elites against Chavez and
the reds. We didn't want another communist Cuba in the hemisphere,
and while backing a military coup might have given us a propaganda
black eye, Washington policymakers, except on Jimmy Carter's watch,
would almost certainly have seen it as the least of the possible
evils.</TE>
<TE>   Washington flirted with this approach earlier this year. With
Chavez promising to ship oil to Fidel Castro at concessionary prices,
and with Chavez supporters forming paramilitary groups modeled to
some degree on Cuba's Committees for the Defense of the Revolution,
the U.S. could not conceal its glee when a military coup temporarily
forced Chavez from office. The coup collapsed, and Washington, wiping
the egg off its face, backed down.</TE>
<TE>   The rise in world oil prices and instability in oil markets
because of concern over a possible U.S. war with Iraq, however, has
kept Venezuela on the front burner, and as domestic conflict mounted
in the country recently, the U.S. turned to the Organization of
American States to broker a compromise solution to the Venezuelan
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   So far, it's not having much luck. Neither Chavez's fans or foes
look ready to compromise. Worse still, Venezuela is a country of weak
institutions. Its constitution was introduced under Chavez and
appears increasingly impractical. The supreme court has a history of
subservience to political interests. The political parties are feeble
and corrupt. None of this will change quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome of Venezuela's crisis -- at the moment
anything from peaceful compromise to full-fledged civil war is
possible -- the lesson is, whether the United States likes it or not
(and the Bush administration mostly hates it), we have a lot more
nation- and institution-building to do in our hemisphere. Trade
treaties and bailouts by the International Monetary Fund aren't
enough.</TE>
<TE>   The OAS needs to have its institutional capacities improved and
its leadership strengthened. Countries like Venezuela -- and Ecuador,
Peru, Argentina and most of Central America -- need help to make
their judiciaries more transparent and independent, their journalists
more professional and their public administration more competent and
less corrupt in handling basic responsibilities of government like
education and social security.</TE>
<TE>   As this happens, more Latin American countries will continue to
move out of the chaos-and-coup lane of history into the fast lane,
where they can make real progress. Until then, the United States can
look forward to continuing crises in the hemisphere -- and can only
count on limited help from the OAS in resolving them.</TE>

<KH>ISRAEL</KH>
<HD>Is Unity Good for the Jews?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jo-Ann Mort</AU>
<BD>Jo-Ann Mort is national secretary of Americans for
Peace Now and co-author of the forthcoming book, "Our Hearts Invented
A Place: Can Kibbutzim Survive The New Israel?"</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>It's always been a point of pride: Put two Jews in a room, and you'll
get three opinions. But when it comes to Israel today, it's beginning
to seem like only one opinion is acceptable. You must blindly endorse
the policies of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's government, or you're
disloyal to the concept of Israel and the unity of Jews.</LD>
<LD>   There is a difference, though, between harmony born of genuine
agreement and harmony born of censorship. And there is a difference
between questioning Israeli governmental policy and questioning
Israel's right to exist. I worry that this current quest for
consensus silences the discussions necessary to dislodge Israel from
its current stalemate with the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon's ill-conceived unity government, which tried to unite
parties from both the left and right, was an example of this yearning
for harmony.</LD>
<TE>   But consensus can't be forced, as the coalition's recent
dissolution demonstrated. In the end, the unity government squeezed
the more-dovish Labor Party into right-wing Likud's mold, which put
the Laborites in the awkward position of participating in a Cabinet
alongside purveyors of the racist policy of "transfer" that espouses
the removal of Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip to make
room for Jewish settlers. The left bent so far toward the right that
it lost its identity and must now scramble to define itself anew
before voters go to the polls.</TE>
<TE>   Something similar has happened in the U.S., as the
consensus-oriented Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish
Organizations attempts to represent American-Jewish viewpoints and
support Israel. Too often, this translates into simply echoing Likud
politics. Consensus may be tidier, but it's not genuine. Give me the
good old days of disagreement.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is that being Jewish -- or for that matter being a
Zionist -- doesn't mean accepting an unalterable set of beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   There are areas in which unity among Jews is desirable -- in
providing, say, for those less fortunate or speaking out for those
without a voice. It is also vital for Jews to make clear the
importance of Israel's continuing existence.</TE>
<TE>   But if unity means dissolution of the diversity that has always
existed among Jewish communities around the world, then it is a
mistaken, even harmful, ideal.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of Jews feel, not unreasonably, under siege at the moment.
The latest intifada has revealed anti-Semitism in Europe, the Middle
East and elsewhere. The very right of Israel to exist has been
challenged. As Israeli author Amos Oz has noted, Israel is fighting
two wars right now. One is for its right to exist within secure
borders; the other is to define those borders.</TE>
<TE>   In the spirit of debate, let me state that I believe the first war
to be valid. The second, fought by a hawkish Israeli government that
seeks to hold on to the West Bank and Gaza through occupation of the
Palestinian population, is not. How one feels about the validity of
these two wars defines one's stance toward Israel today. But
considering the second war immoral doesn't make a person any less
pro-Israel than those who support the current Sharon policies.</TE>
<TE>   It's worth remembering that Zionism was born of two secular
strains, one left wing and socialist, the other much more
conservative and free-market oriented. Religious Zionism once fell
into the left camp. It wasn't until 1967, when Israel captured the
old city of Jerusalem and the West Bank, that the settlers' movement
became the prominent face of religious Zionism, turning it toward a
more right-wing messianism. Until the late 1970s, when then-Likud
leader Menachem Begin brought his conservative minority views to the
mainstream, socialist Zionism was dominant within the movement.
Although the early socialism of Zionism has yielded to a triumphant
capitalism, the vision of a humane state remains -- albeit, much
weaker than in its earlier years. It is this Zionism that is visible
in the current Israeli election campaign of Labor Party candidate
Amram Mitzna.</TE>
<TE>   The looming elections are crucial to Israel's future as a
democratic state, not simply in who wins but in what kind of dialogue
and debate Israelis -- and American Jews -- are willing to embrace.
In the United States, we understand that one can be a loyal American
and hold beliefs far to the left or right of the president. Israel
has always understood this too -- indeed, there has been much more
diversity of opinion among Israelis than in the organized American
Jewish community of late. But there is also a growing intolerance of
dissent in Israel.</TE>
<TE>   This intolerance, at its most extreme, led to the assassination in
November 1995 of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an ultra-right
Israeli Jew. But it crops up subtly in Israel every day. Key members
of the Israeli Knesset continue to call for prosecution of those
Israeli politicians who supported the 1993 Oslo accords, which laid
out broad principles of support for peaceful coexistence between
Palestinians and Israelis. Earlier this month, Israeli media quoted
secret service sources who said they cannot provide adequate security
to Mitzna in light of threats by Jews against him. Yossi Sarid,
leader of the even more dovish Meretz Party, goes nowhere without a
two-man security detail.</TE>
<TE>   Citizens there -- and here -- need to understand that supporting
Israel means supporting the right of the country to exist; It doesn't
mean endorsing every position of the prime minister and his party.
That's not how democracy works. Rather than applauding ourselves for
being democratic, American Jews need to face up to the
anti-democratic forces at work within Israel -- and within our own
communities.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get back to the time of two Jews, three opinions. You tell
me why you think Sharon's policies are the only thing that can ensure
the future of Israel, and I'll tell you how I think he's leading his
country into grave danger. We may not come to agreement, but we can
agree to disagree. The stakes are too high and the future too
uncertain for any of us not to be heard.</TE>

<HD>GOP Hope: a Push From Bush in '04</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Quinn</AU>
<BD>Tony Quinn is co-editor of the California Target Book,
a nonpartisan analysis of California legislative and congressional
elections.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The political divide in America runs right through California like an
earthquake fault. Coastal California is now perhaps the most
Democratic geography in the nation. The Republican Party has largely
ceased to exist in most of Los Angeles County and the San Francisco
Bay Area. But from San Bernardino County eastward, it is hard to find
any place Democrats did well in the 2002 election -- until you get to
Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   Gov. Gray Davis and the Democrats carried every state office for
the first time since 1882, but they carried few counties not touching
the Pacific Ocean. Unfortunately for Republicans, the vast majority
of Californians live in counties that border the ocean. So
overwhelming is the Democratic edge in coastal California, that one
has to ask: Is California still a two-party state?</LD>
<LD>   That question will be answered in 2004. If Republicans cannot
reverse the tide of the last four election cycles, it is hard to see
them surviving at all. And it is hard to imagine a successful
Republican push without the Bush White House doing what it did in so
many states this cycle: finding and funding the right candidates.</LD>
<TE>   Will the president's team make California a high-profile state in
his reelection? Practical considerations argue against a special
strategy for California. If President Bush wins a 49-state landslide
like presidents Nixon and Reagan in their reelections, California
will go with the tide.</TE>
<TE>   But if Bush must struggle to put together an electoral college
majority, he will certainly focus first on those states he narrowly
lost in 2000. A shift of just 17,000 votes in Oregon, New Mexico,
Wisconsin and Iowa combined would have moved those states -- and
their 29 electoral votes -- to the Bush column.</TE>
<TE>   The president needed to overcome a deficit of fewer than 200,000
votes to pick up Washington and Minnesota and their 21 electoral
votes. So a shift of 217,000 votes would have given him an additional
50 electoral votes. He would have to overcome a deficit of 1.3
million votes to win California's 54 electoral votes. Bush will do
just fine in inland California, as he did in inland Oregon and
Washington. But the eastern portions of our neighboring coastal
states are sufficient to offset the coastal Democratic strength in
Portland and Seattle; they are not in California.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal California is about the only region west of the
Mississippi River where the wealthy suburbs favor the Democrats. This
is because America also divides culturally along California's San
Andreas Fault. Upper-income coastal Californians favor abortion
rights and gun control and oppose offshore drilling more than wealthy
suburbanites in cities like Sacramento and San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   The architects of the modern Republican Party have combined social
conservatism, which appeals to lower- and middle-income white voters,
with economic conservatism, which appeals to white-collar and
upper-income voters. The most salient failure of the Democratic Party
this election cycle was with white voters of all economic levels: The
bubbas and the bankers voted Republican.</TE>
<TE>   Except in California. Here again, we are the great exception. The
last dozen years strongly suggest no one will win at the top of the
ticket in California who opposes abortion rights and the assault
weapons ban and favors offshore oil drilling. These are not issues
where Bush is on the California side. Yet, these also are not issues
the administration needs to stress. There is no imperative to force
oil drilling off the California coast. He gave his brother in Florida
a pass; he can do the same here. Democrats are loath to raise the
gun-control issue that cost them dearly in rural states in 2000. And
abortion will be fought in the courts.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Bush has proved a genius at disarming his critics; he
is no fire-breathing ideologue, nor is he the kind of Republican who
turned off California voters in the past. And none of the prospective
Democratic candidates has a base with California voters. There is no
guarantee the next Democrat will have the feel for California that
former President Clinton had, and this state generally turns down
preachy New England moralists (remember Gov. Michael Dukakis), which
could prove a problem for either Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of
Connecticut or Sen. John F. Kerry of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Two tests will show the seriousness of the Bush White House toward
California. First is an appeal to California's Latino voters, who are
with Bush on many cultural and social issues, if not economic ones.
The White House's fine-tuned political antennae will not have missed
the fact that the Latino turnout was one-third less in 2002, some
400,000 fewer voters, than in the 1998 governor's race. Many Latino
Democrats stayed home in 2002. Republican Bill Simon, who ran
probably the worst campaign ever for governor, still got a quarter of
the Latino vote, a Los Angeles Times Poll found. If a bad campaign
did that well, how much better might a good campaign do?</TE>
<TE>   Although liberal Latino activists will argue the point, there is a
growing Latino vote up for grabs in California, especially with the
rapid suburbanization of the Latino electorate and the growth of
Latino small-business owners who have less reason to feel comfortable
with liberal Democratic orthodoxy.</TE>
<TE>   The second test will be the Barbara Boxer Senate seat that is up
in 2004. While Republicans have made much noise about going after the
supposedly vulnerable senator, the fact is a serious challenge to
Boxer comes with a $30-million price tag, and state Republicans are
so broke they can barely rub two nickels together. Just a little
funding might have given them a statewide win or two in 2002, but the
money was never there.</TE>
<TE>   The White House came up with a brilliant strategy for Senate races
in 2002: picking the strongest candidate based on the demographics of
the state and then clearing the Republican field for that candidate.
That's how Norm Coleman in Minnesota and Elizabeth Dole in North
Carolina ended up as the nominees and eventual winners. That's
necessary for California. If the White House does not pick the
candidate and clear the field, the Republicans' electorate in a
closed GOP primary will nominate a garden-variety right-winger who
cannot raise money and who cannot win, as they proved for governor in
2002.</TE>
<TE>   The new great hope for the Republican future seems to be actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger, now mulling a race for governor in 2006. But
Californians like governors with political experience: Every governor
but one in the last 60 years already held statewide office. The
exception, Ronald Reagan, had years of experience in the political
arena, and faced an unpopular governor seeking a third term. Whatever
else can be said about Davis' popularity, he won't be running for a
third term.</TE>
<TE>   Schwarzenegger might be a more attractive Senate candidate against
Boxer, as he fits coastal California on social issues. Californians
like to experiment with their senators; another actor, George Murphy,
and folk hero S.I. Hayakawa won Senate seats their first time out, as
did Boxer, an obscure congresswoman before her "Year of the Woman"
win in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Will the White House pick and fund Schwarzenegger or someone like
him for 2004? The answer boils down to a simple question: Does the
White House believe America ends at the San Bernardino-Los Angeles
County line, or will it test the president's popularity all the way
to the Pacific's lapping waves?</TE>

<BD>Joshua Zeitz is a visiting assistant professor of
history at Brown University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"There are usually two general schools of political belief," Franklin
D. Roosevelt said in 1941, "liberal and conservative." Liberals, the
president continued, understood that "as new conditions and problems
arise beyond the power of men and women to meet as individuals, it
becomes the duty of the government itself to find new remedies with
which to meet them." Conservatives, he said, believed "that there is
no necessity for the government to step in."</LD>
<LD>   Rounding out his lecture on political theory, Roosevelt noted that
"the clear and undisputed fact is that ... at least since 1932, the
Democratic Party has been the liberal party, and the Republican Party
has been the conservative party."</LD>
<LD>   With those words, Roosevelt fundamentally reinvented the American
political lexicon.</LD>
<TE>   Before the Great Depression, the terms "liberal" and
"conservative" were rarely used to describe political ideology or
party politics. It was other things that divided the parties.
Electoral contests had pitted "individualists" against
"paternalists," "radicals" against "progressives." Then came the
1930s with their unprecedented policy crises, which prompted FDR to
manufacture new labels better suited to the politics of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Roosevelt didn't view the terms as value-neutral. Conservatism was
something to be shunned; liberalism was to be celebrated. Yet in the
60 or so years since the New Deal, Republicans have turned the tables
on the Democratic Party. They have embraced the word conservative,
turning a pejorative into a positive. And for at least 15 years,
Democrats have aided this effort by running fast from the liberal
tag. History suggests that there is another way.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic presidents haven't always quaked at the mere mention of
liberalism.</TE>
<TE>   Harry S. Truman insisted that it was the only truly effective
bulwark against communism. John F. Kennedy boasted that "liberalism
... seeks not only the negative challenges of communism and survival,
but the far more searching challenges of our own ideals." As
president, Lyndon B. Johnson freely described himself as a liberal
and argued that government could and should do "a lot of things" for
the public. Even Jimmy Carter, who was not beloved by the left wing
of his party, proudly characterized the 1976 Democratic platform as
"very liberal, very socially motivated."</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, given FDR's intention that conservative should be a
shameful label, Republicans gradually came to embrace the term.
Though he lost badly in his 1964 run for the presidency, Barry
Goldwater celebrated himself as a conservative and encouraged a
rising generation of party activists to do the same. In 1968, Richard
M. Nixon ran a campaign that gave further definition to this
conservative synthesis -- one that galvanized popular opposition to
taxes, inflation, government spending and regulation, and minority
rights.</TE>
<TE>   Although Nixon governed closer to the center than his rhetoric
might have suggested, his ideological heir, Ronald Reagan, captured
the White House in 1980 and completed a process that made liberalism
a near-expletive. "The masquerade is over," Reagan exclaimed shortly
before leaving office. "It's time to ... use the dreaded L-word; to
say the policies of our opposition ... are liberal, liberal,
liberal." His successor, George H.W. Bush, expressed the same
sentiment with equal vigor, if less clarity. "The liberals don't like
it when I talk about liberal," he taunted.</TE>
<TE>   And they didn't. Battered by their losses in 1980, 1984 and 1988,
most Democratic Party strategists began running from the term. Under
the spiritual guidance of the Democratic Leadership Council, the
self-styled centrist wing of the party, Democrats over the last 15
years have issued a subtle mea culpa for liberalism's mistakes and
excesses.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Clinton was a primary beneficiary of the strategy. Many
observers credit his rejection of the liberal label as a primary
factor in his 1992 presidential win. In a bid to salvage his
political fortunes after the Democratic party's monumental losses in
the 1994 election cycle, Clinton embraced the advice of his
ideologically ambidextrous guru, Dick Morris, who counseled
"triangulation." That is, by claiming the center for himself, Clinton
implied that congressional liberals and conservatives were equally
extreme. He banked on the electorate's seeming affection for
moderation, and his strategy worked.</TE>
<TE>   Aided by the likes of then-Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and his
archconservative supporters in the congressional class of '94,
Clinton was able to convince a critical number of Americans that
radicals on the conservative right were more immediately dangerous
than radicals on the liberal left.</TE>
<TE>   The president won reelection in 1996. But at his party's expense.</TE>
<TE>   He may have made voters leery of extreme conservatism, but he also
unwittingly convinced them that there is something fundamentally
wrong with liberalism.</TE>
<TE>   Triangulation was never a permanent fix, and in 2000 George W.
Bush threw the Democrats a curveball. He redefined conservatism.
Instead of running to the rhetorical center, as the Democrats have
done for more than 15 years now, he stood by the conservative label.
Moreover, he successfully made the case that conservatism could be
compassionate. It was safe, soft, embracing.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy worked. Public opinion surveys reveal that about
three-quarters of Americans agree that Bush is conservative. Yet on
the eve of his inauguration, at the height of partisan division over
the disputed 2000 election, a resounding 58% believed the new
president would "govern in a way that is truly compassionate."
Liberalism remains discredited. But conservatism is once again a
respectable tag.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats are now faced with two options: They can seek to redraw
the political landscape and invent a new rhetorical dichotomy, as
Roosevelt did in the 1930s. Or they can try to resuscitate
liberalism.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats have opted for the former strategy. They prefer the
term progressive to liberal and hope to sidestep the old Roosevelt
terminology altogether. The problem is, history suggests that the
winners dictate the terms only after they've gained critical
momentum. And right now, the Democrats are flailing.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the electorate is sensitive to the appearance of
redefinition. The news media and public alike belittled Al Gore for
abandoning Beltway blue in favor of earth tones. It seemed a telling
metaphor for his frequent ideological metamorphoses. Democrats run
much the same risk should they try to adopt new labels.</TE>
<TE>   A bolder strategy would be to reclaim the liberal tag. Just as
President Bush saved conservatism by making it "compassionate,"
Democrats could recoup liberalism by making it "common sense." They
could take a cue from Lewis Carroll's Humpty Dumpty, who explains to
Alice: "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean --
neither more nor less."</TE>
<TE>   On taxes, Democrats could say: If liberalism means that tax cuts
should be targeted to working Americans rather than the very rich,
then yes, we're liberals.</TE>
<TE>   On fiscal responsibility, Democrats could say: If liberalism means
managing government spending with the same discipline that families
manage their household budgets, then yes, we're liberals. They could
say: Bill Clinton, a common-sense liberal, balanced the federal
budget; Reagan and both Bushes, conservatives all, racked up the
largest budget deficits in the nation's history.</TE>
<TE>   On Social Security, Democrats could say: If liberalism means
guaranteeing a dignified retirement for senior citizens, then yes,
we're liberals. Common-sense liberals invented Social Security in the
1930s; conservatives opposed it. Common-sense liberals extended
Social Security to cover most American workers in the 1940s and
1950s; conservatives opposed expanded coverage. Conservatives want to
invest Social Security revenues in the stock market; common-sense
liberals want to shield Social Security from the vicissitudes of the
Dow Jones industrial average.</TE>
<TE>   On the environment, Democrats could say: For decades, the federal
government gave away millions of acres of land and billions of
dollars in precious metals, lumber and fuel to private interests.
Common-sense liberals like Roosevelt, Carter and Clinton insisted
that vital national resources like the Alaskan wilderness be
preserved for public, rather than private, use; conservatives still
want to allow private companies to exploit the public domain for
profit.</TE>
<TE>   The recent selection of liberal San Francisco Democratic Rep.
Nancy Pelosi as minority leader of the House of Representatives
suggests that the Democratic congressional caucus intends to
highlight its differences with the administration. If so, the party
might do well to embrace the liberal tag rather than hide from it.</TE>
<TE>   This is no easy task. It demands equal faith in the electorate and
the basic logic of the party's central ideas. But most of all, it
requires leadership.</TE>
<TE>   "The question," Alice tells Humpty Dumpty, "is whether you can
make words mean so many different things."</TE>
<TE>   "The question," he replies, "is which is to be master -- that's
all."</TE>

<HD>Sierra Madre: a small town and proud of it</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne Colby</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Picturesque Sierra Madre, at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains
between Pasadena and Arcadia, was founded as a ranching community in
1881. It soon became a vacation destination as well, with hotels,
sanitariums and resorts dotted among the citrus groves and vineyards.
Today, historic homes and a village atmosphere give Sierra Madre a
flavor of the past.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   Residents prize the strong sense of community nurtured by many
civic events. There are outdoor concerts and movies in Memorial Park
in the summer and much of the town turns out for the annual Fourth of
July parade.</LD>
<TE>   Volunteers construct the city's Rose Parade float in Sierra Vista
Park, which also houses a pool, recreation center and well-used dog
park. The March wisteria festival and art fair showcases a 1-acre,
108-year-old flowering vine.</TE>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   Visitors are struck by the quaint downtown's leafy boulevards,
historic storefronts, sidewalk cafes and dramatic mountain backdrop.
Shops, galleries, salons and service businesses line the intersection
of Baldwin Avenue and Sierra Madre Boulevard. Bean Town coffeehouse
(offering live music on weekends), Sierra Madre Playhouse and a
variety of eateries keep the streets bustling into the evening. A
recent $1-million-plus downtown renovation added new plantings,
benches and lighting. Key scenes in the original "Invasion of the
Body Snatchers" were filmed here.</TE>
<TE>   Insider's view</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre's roots go deep: It's not unusual to meet second- and
third-generation residents among the 10,600 inhabitants. The city's
proximity to the Foothill Freeway, Caltech, Art Center College of
Design, Jet Propulsion Laboratory and movie studios has attracted
newcomers, and there are some tensions over teardowns and other
development issues.</TE>
<TE>   A recent battle over construction of a private high school on a
prime canyon estate deeply divided the town. Anti-growth activists
won, contending the project would have brought more congestion, noise
and possibly the city's first traffic signal.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   People buy the town as well as the house when they purchase in
Sierra Madre, said Katie Orth of Webb-Martin Realtors. Because of the
city's desirability and its limited housing pool, homes can be
expensive, and buyers often have to settle for less square footage.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre protects its trees and historic homes. Permits are
required to remove or significantly trim some varieties of oak,
walnut and sycamore trees on private property during construction.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-four homes are classified as historic and need a permit for
visible remodeling work.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Three-square-mile Sierra Madre was developed by individual
homeowners, so on every block there's a wide range of housing prices
and styles, including Craftsman, Victorian, Spanish Revival, Mission,
ranch and traditional.</TE>
<TE>   Condos and townhouses, clustered in the flatlands on and around
Sierra Madre Boulevard, are in demand because of their lower prices.</TE>
<TE>   Hillside houses offer far-reaching views and command prices upward
of $700,000. The canyons are popular with artists and others who
enjoy the woodsy, eclectic ambience.</TE>
<TE>   Stock report</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre has 3,392 single-family detached houses and 1,521
multifamily units, according to 2000 city figures.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Most of Sierra Madre is within the Pasadena Unified School
District, whose schools typically ranked average or below average on
the 2001 Academic Performance Index. Only one of these schools,
Sierra Madre Elementary, is in town, although a middle school is
expected to open there in a couple of years. A small northeast
portion of the city falls into the Arcadia School District, which has
top-ranked schools. Many parents send their children to private
schools.</TE>
<TE>   On the market</TE>
<TE>   In mid-December, Sierra Madre had 34 single-family residential
listings priced at $271,000 to $1,252,000 and one condominium at
$279,000, according to Les Carroll of Dilbeck GMAC Real Estate.</TE>

<LD>Architect Harold Bissner designed this Italian Revival estate for a
physician and his wife in 1930, and now it has been restored, updated
and put on the market as one of the highest-priced homes in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The price of nearly $7 million is quite a contrast with its
initial building cost of $25,000, but that was a huge sum for a new
home in Depression-era California.</LD>
<LD>   About this house: Now that a team of artists, designers and
craftsmen have completed their work, the house has updated features
Bissner never imagined. Landry Design Group was the remodel
architect.</LD>
<TE>   Asking price: $6.95 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The house has seven bedroom suites in 7,684 square feet. The
lot size is about 32,100 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The master suite has two bathrooms and a fireplace, and
there are two guest suites, two home offices, a state-of-the-art
kitchen, a home theater and a gym with a steam shower, sauna and wet
bar. There is also a cabana with a kitchen and three-quarter
bathroom. The grounds have a 60-foot-long lap pool; a spa, a sports
court and a large-scale model railway system manufactured by
Lehmann-Gross-Bahn. There is also a basement and an elevator.</TE>

<LD>Catherine Bell, who co-stars in the CBS courtroom-military series
"JAG" as Marine Lt. Col. Sarah "Mac" MacKenzie, and her husband,
actor-producer Adam Beason, have purchased a Malibu home for just
under $2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The couple bought a five-bedroom, 4,800-square-foot home on
slightly more than 2 acres in the hills. The one-story home, built in
2000, has 6.5 bathrooms plus an infinity pool and Santa Monica Bay
and coastline views.</LD>
<LD>   The home also has plenty of parking for the couple's dozen or so
motorcycles. In 1999, when the pair was living in a three-story,
contemporary-style home in Sherman Oaks, they were reported to enjoy
moto-cross racing, water skiing and snowboarding.</LD>
<TE>   They were married in May 1994, on the second anniversary of their
first date. They met on the set of the 1992 film "Death Becomes Her,"
when Bell was Isabella Rossellini's body double and Beason was a
production assistant.</TE>
<TE>   Bell, 34, just finished shooting her first feature film, "Bruce
Almighty," a comedy starring Jim Carrey as a TV reporter who rages
against God, played by Morgan Freeman. Bell plays a fellow newscaster
in the comedy, which is due out in May.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Chertow of Pritchett-Rapf &amp; Associates, Malibu, represented
Bell and Beason in buying, area sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Buster's place</TE>
<TE>   brings top dollar</TE>
<TE>   A Beverly Hills mansion built in 1926 for comic actor Buster
Keaton has been sold for close to its $20-million asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers are Bill Guthy, co-founder of a TV direct-marketing
company, and his wife, Victoria Jackson, a makeup artist and
infomercial beauty queen, according to sources not involved in the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot home was sold by
developers John Bercsi and Christopher Bedrosian, who spent 2 1/2 years
restoring and refurbishing the property after buying it from the
estate of actress-turned-talk show host Pamela Mason.</TE>
<TE>   Mason lived there from the late '40s, when she bought the property
with her then-husband actor James Mason, until she died at 80 in
1996. Cary Grant and his then-wife, heiress Barbara Hutton, owned the
home in the early '40s.</TE>
<TE>   The 1.5-acre gated site includes a main house with a 50-foot-long
living room, a 42-foot-long kitchen and an up-to-date screening room,
where Keaton watched silent films and played billiards with such
stars as Tom Mix and Harold Lloyd. The estate also has a guesthouse,
cabana, 60-foot-long pool, gym, tennis court, tennis pavilion,
three-bedroom staff quarters and a 500-foot-long drive lined with
olive trees.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers, in their 40s, have other homes in the L.A. and Santa
Barbara areas.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, who already was marketing her own cosmetics line for the
mass market, joined with actor Rob Lowe and his wife, makeup artist
Sheryl Berkhoff, in 2001 to launch Lola, an upscale line of color,
skin and fragrance products.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson also wrote "Make Up Your Life" (Cliff Street Books), which
she subtitled, "Every Woman's Guide to the Power of Makeup."</TE>
<TE>   Guthy co-founded Guthy-Renker, which makes infomercials, in 1988.
The company has produced infomercials for such personalities as Tony
Robbins and Victoria Principal as well as Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt Rappaport and Loren Judd of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly
Hills, had the listing.</TE>

<TE>   Dr. Bruce Hensel, the Emmy-winning medical-health-science
editor-reporter for NBC's Channel 4 News, has listed his
three-bedroom, Pacific Palisades home at close to $3.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Hensel, who has owned the home for 16 years, is thinking about
moving to the Hollywood Hills to be closer to the NBC news studios in
Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   His Palisades home was built in 1951 by Robert Byrd, known for
designing and building homes with views of natural surroundings. On a
rock promontory, Hensel's 3,400-square-foot house has panoramic ocean
views. The rustic home also has a game or media room, a great room
with soaring ceilings, guest quarters, an updated kitchen, a stone
patio with a built-in barbecue, an infinity pool and lush
landscaping, including a garden path leading to a gazebo.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Freeman of Prudential California, John Aaroe division, in
Pacific Palisades has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   No more mornings</TE>

<TE>   Stephen Tobolowsky, who co-stars in "Morning's at Seven" at the
Ahmanson Theatre through Jan. 26, has listed his Spanish-style 1928
house in Valley Village at $549,950.</TE>
<TE>   Tobolowsky, a character actor, bought another home several years
ago, and since then he has used the Valley Village house as a place
for his friends to stay.</TE>
<TE>   The house has two bedrooms plus a guest room, a studio/office, a
sauna and three bathrooms. Tobolowsky restored the house and updated
its kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 51, may be best known for his role as an officious
insurance salesman in the comedy film "Groundhog Day" (1993).</TE>
<TE>   Lou Woolf at Coldwell Banker Previews, Sherman Oaks, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Laker home has</TE>
<TE>   its own court</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Laker forward Devean George has purchased a three-bedroom,
3,200-square-foot home behind gates in Manhattan Beach for close to
its $1.3 million asking price and has sold his nearby two-bedroom,
1,600-square-foot home for $575,000.</TE>
<TE>   The home he bought has a spa with a waterfall and a small
basketball court. The home he sold was remodeled.</TE>
<TE>   In his third NBA season, George has become a regular in Phil
Jackson's lineup.</TE>
<TE>   Last July, at 24, he signed a new contract to earn $13.5 million
in the next three seasons.</TE>

<KH>HOME BUYER MAKE-OVER</KH>
<HD>For many, a wait-and-watch attitude</HD>
<DH>An update finds some making the leap, others delaying the
dream in a tight market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Allison B. Cohen</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Editor's note: Every month we profile potential home buyers who are
uncertain about housing affordability, their credit or whether they
can buy on limited income with little savings.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Home Buyer Make-Over series started in 2001, we have
interviewed more than a dozen potential home buyers, and taken their
concerns and issues to mortgage banking and real estate experts
throughout Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Here's a look at a handful of those we profiled and how they are
doing:</LD>
<TE>   Kannyn MacRae</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, all Mar Vista renter Kannyn MacRae wanted was to
buy a house or duplex "west of the 405." At the time, the only thing
available in MacRae's $300,000-to-$350,000 price range was a
1,000-square-foot, three-bedroom, one-bath house in Redondo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   MacRae, 36, chose to wait, hoping he could afford more later.</TE>
<TE>   "I decided to save money, watch the market and do more research,"
said MacRae, a business unit manager with a computer accessories
company. Houses in the "$350,000 range were little closets and
falling apart."</TE>
<TE>   In a year and a half, MacRae was able to save an additional
$15,000 to $20,000 to help widen his options. "But I was really
cutting corners," he said. Finally, last summer, MacRae closed escrow
on a 1,000-square-foot 1924 California Craftsman west of the 405 in
Los Angeles for $420,000.</TE>
<TE>   But getting the house wasn't easy. MacRae lost out in bidding wars
on four other homes in Mar Vista and Venice. He managed to make the
purchase by beating out 17 initial bids because he had no
contingencies and was pre-approved for a loan. "There were 40 couples
[at the open house] with measuring tapes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A bachelor, MacRae said he worried that he would lose out to a
married couple. But because he was able to move quickly to meet the
seller's desired 30-day escrow, he succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Marie Griffin</TE>
<TE>   Last January, 37-year-old single mother Lisa Marie Griffin was
sleeping on the couch of her Yorba Linda condo. She had given up her
spacious master bedroom to a string of roommates to help pay her
$1,190 monthly mortgage payment. Tired of rude and demanding
roommates, Griffin and her teenage son, Nathan, wanted to go it
alone.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather eat beans first before I had another roommate,"
said Griffin at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Refinancing, a tactic that many homeowners have turned to in this
year of low interest rates, allowed her to recoup the lost rental
income.</TE>
<TE>   Griffin was able in August to bring her old interest rate of 7.5%
down to 6.75%, dropping her monthly mortgage to $1,037. The $153 a
month in savings is substantial to Griffin, who has worked for 12
years in maintenance at Disneyland and makes $23,000 annually. The
monthly savings allowed her to live without a roommate and even to
buy new carpet and shutters.</TE>
<TE>   The changes have provided Griffin social opportunities too. "I
have my living room back," she said. "I'm entertaining in the house
for the first time."</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Paul</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the April profile of Elizabeth Paul, who had
overcome bankruptcy to buy a home so she could become a foster
parent, the 40-year-old Palms Middle School teacher went into escrow
on a three-bedroom, two-bath home near Inglewood for $205,000.</TE>
<TE>   But during the home inspection, Paul discovered the house needed
major electrical, plumbing and roofing repairs that she was not
willing to take on, so she dropped out.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a huge amount of relief," Paul said. "[The house] was
going to be a money pit."</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, Paul unexpectedly relocated near her hometown in
Maryland to be close to her sick father.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a nagging feeling to come home to be with him," she said.
Two months later, her father died of lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Paul is hoping to inherit her father's four-bedroom house in
Hagerstown, Md., which sits on nearly one acre. Paul's father bought
the house -- a two-story brick with four-bedrooms and 1 1/2
baths--for $144,000 in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   While housing is much cheaper in Maryland, she said earlier this
month, "I miss Los Angeles, especially the weather. It was 10 degrees
this morning."</TE>
<TE>   Paul said her father's death and taking care of his home, three
dogs and his extensive garden will temporarily put her dreams of
being a foster parent on hold. "But I still very much hope to be in
that type of parent role someday."</TE>
<TE>   The Trautweins</TE>
<TE>   Paul and Mary Beth Trautwein, featured in June, love the
two-bedroom, 800-square-foot Venice bungalow they bought in 1999 for
$239,000. But the place has become cramped now that the couple has a
2-year-old daughter and Paul, a graphic designer and Web master,
works out of the home. If the Trautweins moved to get more space --
to the San Fernando Valley, for instance, where they could get more
for their housing dollar -- they would be leaving the beach
neighborhood they love. But staying and remodeling could be costly --
up to $150,000.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Trautweins were pre-approved for a $220,000 loan and
could make a nearly $200,000 profit if they sold their bungalow,
allowing them to look in the $350,000 to $450,000 price range, they
decided to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "We like Venice ... and our mortgage payments are within our
budget," said Paul, 39. The Trautweins opted for a $25,000 remodel to
help free up space in the house, including splitting a bathroom into
separate toilet and shower areas. The plan won't give them more
square footage, but it makes use of the space more efficiently. "It
should make living here more comfortable," Paul said.</TE>
<TE>   Angelo and Kathy Bell</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, escrow on a $179,900 Moreno Valley home for Angelo
and Kathy Bell came to a halt two weeks into the process when the
lender decided to back out because of credit issues.</TE>
<TE>   Not being able to move forward with their dreams of homeownership,
the Bells were devastated. They had hoped to host a family holiday
gathering this year at their new home.</TE>
<TE>   But, like many denied the first time, the Bells shopped for a loan
and were eventually approved for a $115,000 Wells Fargo three-year
adjustable rate mortgage with an initial rate of 7.5%. The catch: It
required the couple to buy in Los Angeles County and live in the
house five years.</TE>
<TE>   But in today's record-breaking seller's market, the Bells felt the
loan -- combined with a second for $35,000 from the California
Housing Authority -- would buy little. "In this market, our loan
would have gotten us a shack in the woods," said Angelo, 37. "We've
decided to wait a year or two."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, the Bells are saving. They traded their
$1,600-a-month Miracle Mile rental for an apartment nearly twice the
size in Bellflower for $950 a month. The apartment will give the
Bells some of the things they were looking for in a home: a room for
each of their daughters, Cimone, 1, and Israel, 3, and a small
backyard where they can play.</TE>
<TE>   Kathy, 30, has gone back to work. She's also enrolled in school to
help increase her earning power. Angelo, who makes $61,000 a year as
an information technology manager, has stepped up his part-time
computer repair business and has developed a credit-repair program,
which he is selling on the Internet and through online auction sites.</TE>
<TE>   The couple hopes to build their savings and eventually buy in
Cerritos, where the current median price for a home is $375,000,
according to Tom Mikalson with ReMax College Park Realty in Los
Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we're very happy right now and very confident in our
decision to wait," Angelo said.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Cici Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Cici Jr., 32, had done everything right to buy a home: He had
saved nearly $20,000 by living at home with his father and
stepmother, scrimped and saved on purchases and researched
neighborhoods and interest rates almost obsessively.</TE>
<TE>   Getting an approval for a $180,000 loan wouldn't be hard for Cici
with his excellent credit and cash at hand, but finding a home (he
was adamantly against a condominium) in that price range would be
difficult. While Cici had hoped to buy in the San Gabriel Valley or
Whittier, no homes or townhomes were available in those areas in his
price range. Properties he had looked at in La Puente, Norwalk and
Chino Hills were disappointing.</TE>
<TE>   Cici stayed with it, continuing to research neighborhoods and
checking out open houses.</TE>
<TE>   In September, he found a condo that he liked. But getting it was a
roller-coaster experience.</TE>
<TE>   Cici first made an offer on a condo in Duarte, only to lose out
because another bidder was willing to take on a longer escrow of 90
days.</TE>
<TE>   Then he lost out on a $175,000 two-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath townhome in
Whittier because another bidder was able to put down 20% as opposed
to his 5%. But three weeks later, Cici's real estate agent informed
him the winning bidder had lost his job and wouldn't be able to
secure the loan.</TE>
<TE>   "Then they offered me the house," he said, "which I readily
accepted." Cici was able to avoid paying private mortgage insurance,
or PMI, a monthly payment that protects the lender from possible
default by the borrower, by carrying two loans on the home. (PMI is
usually required on loans with less than a minimum of 20% down.)</TE>
<TE>   Cici's first loan was for 80% of the value of the house, or
$140,000 at an interest rate of 5.875%; the second loan was for
$26,250 -- 15% of the purchase price of the home -- at an interest
rate of 7.875% for 15 years. This type of dual loan program would
only require a 5% down payment.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Cici's monthly mortgage payment will be a comfortable
$1,200 a month on his approximately $40,000 annual income as a
project manager for a packaging company.</TE>
<TE>   Since the house closed escrow, Cici has been enjoying
homeownership and has even been on a shopping spree, spending about
$2,500 on appliances and cleaning supplies for his new place -- money
he spent out of his nest egg. "That was the whole reason I was saving
up money," he said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A lone bell tolled as dawn washed over the Ramakrishna Monastery in
Trabuco Canyon on a recent cool, autumn morning, summoning the monks
to their daily meditation, as it has every morning for more than 50
years.</LD>
<LD>   Wrapped in cotton robes, four men padded barefoot into the
compound's white brick shrine to begin an hourlong silent
contemplation in a windowless room illuminated by the glow of
candles. Outside, a fierce Santa Ana gale whipped through the
monastery's courtyard, chasing leaves and bending trees that seemed
accustomed to the assault.</LD>
<LD>   Once a solitary outpost with expansive views of only
chaparral-covered hills and deep ravines in this remote region of
Orange County's Santa Ana Mountains, the monastery's hilltop vista
now encompasses cluster after cluster of identical-looking tract
homes plunked atop the mountains like ill-fitting hats.</LD>
<TE>   Instead of the plaintive cries of coyotes at night, the monks say
they are more likely to hear the sounds of TV shows and slamming
doors wafting up to their rustic compound.</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Trabuco Canyon dwellers and developers are well aware of
the acute need for more housing in Orange County. The choice of this
rustic area for expansion is, however, a matter of great debate.</TE>
<TE>   The expansion also is the focal point of a 23-year battle and
current lawsuit filed on behalf of the Ramakrishna monks, who are
trying to reverse the county's approval last month of a 283-home
development  in the "monks' backyard," said attorney Ed Connor, who
represents the monastery.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is not just the development's potential effect on the
monastery, Connor said. "This project will eliminate 180 oak trees
that are older than county government here. One of the most important
wildlife corridors in Orange County will be wiped out."</TE>
<TE>   For more than 50 years, Trabuco Canyon, known for its equestrian
culture and quiet ways, was home to a smattering of hardy souls, as
well as the contemplative Ramakrishna monks and, at a neighboring
abbey, Roman Catholic priests. It also is the site of O'Neill
Regional Park, which is about 2,200 acres.</TE>
<TE>   The canyon, which abuts Cleveland National Forest, was frequented
mostly by leather-jacketed bikers, cowboys, upscale professionals and
musicians until 1968, when the upscale Coto de Caza development began
construction nearby.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, when the Ramakrishna Monastery was being established in
Trabuco Canyon, there were 2,200 homes within a 10-mile radius of the
religious compound. Today there are 85,900 homes, a quarter of which
were built in the last 10 years, according to La Jolla-based
DataQuick Information Services, which tracks such statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "It felt like the Queen Mary docked when the houses were built
just below us," said Swami Tadatmananda, 70, a 38-year resident of
the monastery. "With each new development, we get more and more
trespassing here."</TE>
<TE>   A long history</TE>
<TE>   The monastery was constructed in 1942 by Gerald Heard, the British
author and a disciple of Vedanta's Swami Prabhavananda, who
consecrated the monastery shrine in 1949. Originally called the
Trabuco College of Prayer, Heard established the compound with help
from author Aldous Huxley and other friends.</TE>
<TE>   The buildings were designed in the style of an Italian monastery,
with oversized bricks for the walls, orange-tiled roofs, a bell tower
and heavy beams in the main building. A statue of Swami Vivekananda,
Sri Ramakrishna's revered disciple, sits in a wind-swept courtyard
with a lily pond in front of it and a sweeping view of the valley
behind.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the college was to provide a place for prayer and
the study of Eastern and Western mysticism. In 1949, Heard deeded the
property to the Vedanta Society, which embraces a philosophy from the
ancient scriptures of India and is the foundation of Hinduism.</TE>
<TE>   The two monks and three lay brothers who reside there today seek
to remove themselves from worldly distractions and desires in order
to get closer to God, to "reach a transcendent place," said William
Divine, a lay brother and spokesman for the monastery.</TE>
<TE>   The society, which has temples in Hollywood and Santa Barbara, and
a center in San Diego, is supported by donations, book sales and
revenues from rental properties, said monk Lal Chand, 33, a former
UCLA physicist who now resides at the Trabuco monastery.</TE>
<TE>   Tall, soft-spoken Swami Tadatmananda, known as Tadat, and Asim,
78, a longtime Ramakrishna brother, recalled over a recent breakfast
in the monastery's kitchen the early days in the canyon, when the
surrounding land was open and isolated and cattle grazed in the area
that is now Rancho Santa Margarita.</TE>
<TE>   There was no San Diego Freeway, food was bought in the city of
Orange or at the general store down the road and residents commuted
by car for an hour on a small highway to Santa Ana or Anaheim, Tadat
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the most beautiful spot in the whole county," said real
estate agent Amy Richards, 62, who was raised in Silverado Canyon and
is among those who want to keep development to a minimum. "I wish we
could afford to buy up all the land around here and keep it the
same."</TE>
<TE>   Richards and other longtime canyon dwellers know from experience,
though, that the area's charm, coupled with nearby shopping, jobs and
toll-road access to the bigger cities in Orange County, will continue
to attract developers, who are having greater success with the county
in getting approval for projects in the once-secluded region.</TE>
<TE>   Huge development</TE>
<TE>   The newest residential development creating worry among the monks
and other canyon residents is Saddleback Meadows, a 230-acre property
that straddles a mountain in the heart of Trabuco Canyon. The site is
owned by California Quartet of Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   Although the developers have set aside 70% of the site for open
space, the proposed development is between the Ramakrishna monastery
and St. Michael's Abbey, a stone's throw from both sanctuaries.</TE>
<TE>   Rare and endangered species such as gnatcatchers, fairy shrimp and
cactus wrens inhabit the Saddleback wilderness area, which contains
vernal ponds, ancient live oaks and sage scrub.</TE>
<TE>   Saddleback Meadows also is the only remaining wildlife corridor
connecting thousands of acres of open space.</TE>
<TE>   To build homes on the Saddleback ridgeline, developers will have
to remove about 9 million cubic yards of earth for re-compacting,
which will disrupt the monastery and the Catholic abbey, according to
the two religious orders.</TE>
<TE>   While an expensive and labor-intensive process, grading is a
common practice in hilly areas and is effective in preventing
landslides, said Jeffrey Knott, assistant professor of geology at Cal
State Fullerton. Trabuco Canyon has been the site of landslides and
flooding.</TE>
<TE>   But the grading, which will slice off the mountaintop and require
the bulldozing and transporting of tons of earth, is in violation of
the county's Trabuco Canyon Specific Plan, opponents say.</TE>
<TE>   The document was adopted in 1991 to establish development
standards for the area and prohibits large manufactured slopes. It
also ensures that the canyon maintains its scenic, rural atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   The area approved last month for development has been the subject
of a protracted legal battle, dating back more than two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The first plan failed after the landowner went bankrupt.
Subsequent plans have been scuttled by years of lawsuits and one
attempt by development opponents to buy the land for a park.</TE>
<TE>   In 1984, the county approved plans for 705 mobile homes on the
land, and then in 1999, 299 homes. That decision was dismissed by the
courts after environmental studies were found to be inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal wildlife officials are worried that the new
development will impede wildlife movement and possibly eliminate the
corridor. But the corridor is under the jurisdiction of the county,
which approves of the project and believes it can be built with
little damage to the wildlife there.</TE>
<TE>   The developers maintain that they have worked diligently to modify
the project, to make sure the project has met federal guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some folks who, understandably, want to see things not
change, but we can't meet their goal," said Pike Oliver, a spokesman
for California Quartet. "I think, overall, that this plan does a good
job balancing the needs of men and the needs of nature. That's what
we have to do under the law."</TE>
<TE>   Connor filed a lawsuit two weeks ago challenging the November
approval of Saddleback Meadows. The suit claims that the development
is inconsistent with the zoning laws laid out in the area's specific
plan, Connor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ramakrishna Monastery, which deeded 240 acres of parkland to
O'Neill Regional Park, has vowed to take back the land if the
development goes through. A condition of the gift was that the
monastery not be disturbed by future growth there.</TE>
<TE>   The collision of suburban growth and rural canyon life in eastern
Orange County began in the 1970s with the Coto de Caza development
but exploded during the great building boom of the 1980s, when most
of the housing tracts went up in and around Trabuco Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   Coto de Caza, about three miles south of Trabuco, began with a
relatively modest plan of 200 homes and now is a more than 4,000-home
development with two golf courses and equestrian trails.</TE>
<TE>   Homes in Coto start at about $600,000 and run as high as $10
million. Until the 241 toll road was built in April 1995, the only
way into and out of Coto was by winding along rustic, tree-lined Live
Oak Canyon Road, through the heart of Trabuco Canyon. The onetime
45-minute trek to jobs now takes just minutes, said Bruce Thier, a
Trabuco Canyon real estate agent, making the area even more
attractive to buyers.</TE>
<TE>   Suburban life arrives</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santa Margarita, which broke ground in 1985 on Trabuco
"mesa" land owned by the O'Neill family, put nearly 17,000 homes and
shopping and commercial development within miles of the canyon. The
project brought suburbia practically to Trabuco Canyon's doorstep.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so close that the old cowboys in Trabuco Canyon can throw a
rock and hit civilization, but a block away it's a two-lane country
road," said Bob Phillips, a Rancho Santa Margarita real estate agent
and area resident.</TE>
<TE>   Santiago and Dove canyons sprouted smaller developments closer to
the monastery and the older Trabuco homes. The Santiago Canyon
Estates project, built in the mid-'90s, solidified resistance to
development, said Buck Panchal, an Orange County consultant to
builders.</TE>
<TE>   "The project looks like a cross between Robinson Ranch, which are
standard tract homes, and the canyon homes, with no fences and
rolling hills," Panchal said. "[The builders] tried to soften the
look, but canyon folks thought it looked like all the other
developments they don't like."</TE>
<TE>   The bikers and other locals who hang out at Cook's Corner, a
storied bar and grill with taped-up Naugahyde booths and sawdust
floors at the gateway to Trabuco Canyon, are resigned to the changes,
which they say have, in some respects, made their rural life a bit
easier.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an alcove mentality here," said Bob Johnson, who lives in
Portola Hills, one of the newer developments in the hills adjacent to
Trabuco. "We like living away from the city life, but the toll road
and El Toro Road let us get to Irvine and Tustin easily, and I don't
mind that."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Shounia, owner of the Trabuco Canyon General Store, bemoans
the traffic that development has brought but is happy for the
business.</TE>
<TE>   "It's peaceful here. Horses go by, dogs, it's neat," Shounia said.
"The development is good for me, but I don't want them to cut down
trees and flatten hills."</TE>
<TE>   At the monastery, meanwhile, the tiny population of monks and
brothers still performs daily routines of meditation and study. They
have vowed to continue their struggle to maintain their way of life.</TE>
<TE>   Asim, echoing the sentiments of the other monks, says they don't
oppose all development in the canyon; they would prefer a scaled-back
version that will not have as profound an effect on their sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Their attorney is cautiously optimistic about their chances of
reversing the Board of Supervisors' decision.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still in the fight," Connor said. "The boat's rocking, but
we have to climb out of the boat and walk across the water. We've
prevailed before, and we hope we will again."</TE>

<HD>New housing aids economy, coalition says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Inman News Features</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New housing construction contributes about $40 billion per year to
the California economy and creates an estimated 359,000 jobs
statewide, according to a report released last week by the Job-Center
Housing Coalition.</LD>
<LD>   The report, titled "The Economic Benefits of California's Housing
Industry," found that housing is among the largest contributors to
California's economy when the economic benefits of all housing
activities are taken into account.</LD>
<LD>   The housing sector as a whole contributes more than $257 billion
per year to the California economy and generates 821,000 jobs when
all facets of the industry are considered, including construction,
residential real estate transactions, expenditures of homeowners,
maintenance and operation of housing.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, the report found that every dollar spent on new
housing construction generates about $1.95 in total economic
activity.</TE>
<TE>   "These numbers are particularly astounding when you consider that
we're only building half the homes we actually need each year," said
Sunne McPeak, coalition co-chairwoman. For the last three years, the
coalition has sponsored state legislation aimed at removing many of
the hurdles to housing construction.</TE>

<HD>Miles to go before Eminem's house is sold</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former Michigan home of rap artist Eminem didn't command a high
sales price at the close of bidding on EBay last week as many had
anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   After previous reports of bids as high as $12 million, the
property failed to capture a single offer that met the $120,000
minimum. The house on Timken Avenue in Warren, Mich., which has been
in the rapper's family for 50 years, was Eminem's home before his
rise to stardom.</LD>
<LD>   The dwelling is said to be where the artist wrote much of his
early material. The singer continues to refer to the surrounding area
-- north suburban Detroit, Eight Mile Road and his experiences while
living there --in his music, as well as in his recently released film
"8 Mile."</LD>

<BD>From Times wire reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS has agreed to remove images that look like Re/Max International's
for-sale yard signs from its Oct. 10 episode of "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" before the television network rebroadcasts the
controversial episode.</LD>
<LD>   The two companies announced Monday that they settled a lawsuit
Re/Max filed against CBS and its parent company, Viacom, alleging the
"CSI" episode damaged the real estate company's reputation by
associating an unethical real estate agent suspected homicide with a
sign similar to its trademark red-over-white-over-blue signs.</LD>
<LD>   The show opened with a split-second glimpse of a for-sale sign
emblazoned with red, white and blue horizontal bands similar to
ReMax's design, a fictional name and the word "Realtor."</LD>
<TE>   CBS said any similarities to the Re/Max sign were inadvertent and
any negative reflection was unintentional.</TE>
<TE>   CBS a week earlier also issued an apology to the National Assn. of
Realtors for its alleged misuse of the term "Realtor" in the same
episode.</TE>

<HD>Lots of choices tempt for thrifty spring trips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Arthur Frommer</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Looking for a budget-priced spring vacation? Here is a potpourri from
which to choose:</LD>
<LD>   Skiing in the Alps can be cheaper than skiing in the Rockies this
year, with such budget-priced locales as Chamonix, France;
Interlaken, Switzerland; and Cortina, Italy. To learn what's
available, go to four Web sites: www.valhol.com, www.advonskis.com,
www.ski-europe.com or www.centralholidays.com.</LD>
<LD>   This spring and later in the autumn, the cost of renting a fully
equipped country cottage in England, capable of housing four people,
is often less than $500 a week. The stay can be economical --
especially if you take advantage of current low-cost transatlantic
air fares. To see photos of dozens of available cottages, log onto
www.welcome.cottages.co.uk.</LD>
<TE>   The French Riviera remains a top destination in winter and spring.
Though temperatures average 50 degrees, it's still pleasant, and the
grand avenues and tiny cafes regain their charm when they're not
thronged with tourists. Call France Vacations at (800) 332-5332,
www.francevacations.net, for a five-night stay in Nice, from December
to mid-March, for $769, including round-trip air fare on Air France
from Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Few Americans are aware that Canada has a low-cost airline called
Tango, which emulates Southwest Airlines, JetBlue and AirTran in the
low price of its tickets. And Tango, which is owned by Air Canada,
will let you book one-way flights at cheap rates. Contact Tango at
(800) 315-1390 or www.flytango.com</TE>
<TE>   If you have ever played a string instrument, you can get important
travel benefits by obtaining a membership in Amateur Chamber Music
Players, which has both national and international directories. When
you travel, consult the lists, find like-minded musicians at your
destination and enjoy a session of chamber music in which you also
pick up budget tips for enjoying the community. Many of the members
listed in the directory will lend you instruments, like a cello, to
play. Log on to www.acmp.net.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not a fan of frequent-flier programs, but since they're
apparently here to stay, you'll benefit by signing up for an
airline's program even if you use the carrier only occasionally.
That's because some companies grant awards for as few as 500 miles of
frequent-flier credits. A Web site called www.milepoint.com will
allow you to redeem as few as 500 airline miles for magazine
subscriptions, various household products and even for discount
purchases made on Amazon.com. When it comes to airline miles, don't
overlook the small stuff.</TE>

<HD>Germany's seasonal glow</HD>
<DH>Fueled by mulled wine and sausages, city Christmas markets
abound with good cheer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Frankfurt, Germany</DL>
<LD>All I ever want for Christmas is a flash of that intense openhearted
joy that sometimes comes during the holidays. But the Christmas
spirit is elusive. To catch it, you have to be in the right place at
the right time. So this year I went river cruising in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   After all, it's the country that gave us Christmas trees. With its
mighty medieval cathedrals, painted Adorations and Annunciations,
snug cobblestone hamlets and half-timbered houses, Germany looks like
an Advent calendar all year long.</LD>
<LD>   Yuletide celebrations begin in early December, when Christmas
markets take over the main squares of almost every village and town.
With them come craft, ornament and gift stalls decorated in silver
garlands and lights. There are child-dazzling merry-go-rounds and
miniature trains, life-size creches, carriage rides, costumed St.
Nicks, Handel's "Messiah" and oom-pah bands, laughter, carousing,
bratwurst and hot mulled Gluhwein, Germany's traditional Christmas
market brew.</LD>
<TE>   Christmas markets are as common in Germany as Fourth of July
fireworks in America. But to make things easy, I booked a seven-night
German Christmas market cruise on the Rhine and Main rivers from
Encino-based Uniworld. The company specializes in European river
cruising, a hassle-free way of sightseeing that Americans are just
catching on to. It recently announced such itineraries as the Danube
River from Budapest to the Black Sea and added two new ships,
scheduled to join the fleet next year.</TE>
<TE>   As on big cruise ships, the price includes meals, accommodations
and many activities. Uniworld's river vessels are smaller, more
casual and more intimate than oceangoing megaships; the price is more
modest; cabins and bathrooms have the same hair dryers, TVs and
safes, but are larger; and there are some practical additional
amenities such as laundry rooms. English is spoken by crew members
and tour guides, and the ships usually dock just a few blocks from
the heart of town.</TE>
<TE>   My cruise on the year-old River Princess was designed to please
inveterate Christmas shoppers as well as sightseers interested in
German history and art. It was to start in Cologne, head up the
fabled Rhine, turn east on the Main and the Main-Danube Canal and end
in Nuremberg. Along the way, there would be bus trips to popular
tourist destinations such as Heidelberg and, of course, Christmas
markets wherever we stopped.</TE>
<TE>   It was cold and rainy when I arrived early in the month at
Frankfurt airport, hardly beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
Cruise passengers connecting to a Cologne flight recognized one
another because most of us carried the red vinyl bags Uniworld had
sent with our travel documents. Some were already discussing Steiff
teddy bears and Hummel figurines. One fellow Uni- world traveler told
me she was such a Christmas buff that she had to have two trees in
her house for all her ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   When we disembarked in Cologne, a German woman I'd talked to on
the plane advised, "Don't drink too much Gluhwein. Don't spend too
much."</TE>
<TE>   A boatload of shoppers</TE>
<TE>   A bus transferred me and my tour companions to the ship, which was
docked on the Rhine close to the cathedral of Cologne. The city,
Catholic in the homeland of the Reformation, was rebuilt in the wake
of World War II bombing and is thus now largely modern. No tour was
planned there.</TE>
<TE>   I soon discovered that most of the passengers were experienced
travelers who never complained about jet lag, had booked tour
extensions in Vienna or Prague and definitely didn't need to have
their hands held. Right away people set off to explore Cologne on
their own, with maps or just the heaven-bent spires of the cathedral
as guides.</TE>
<TE>   The Dom, as it's called, was begun in the Gothic 13th century and
finished in the neo-Gothic 19th. It is all gables, turrets and flying
buttresses, so massive that it seems out of scale with the rest of
the city and prevalently dirty gray except in spots where it's been
recently cleaned.</TE>
<TE>   A Christmas market, composed of wooden stalls with electric
lights, occupied the square that borders the cathedral; another had
encamped in a square several blocks south. I poked around in both,
finding things I'd see later in other Christmas markets: costume
jewelry, Christmas ornaments, figurines, mobiles, little ceramic
half-timbered houses, candles, soaps, Polish teapots, African
baskets, mittens and hats, earmuffs that light up. It was all more
endearing than the stuff in malls, but nothing I needed.</TE>
<TE>   The food was another story: fat, greasy bratwurst, stewed
mushrooms, pretty cookies, Christmas fruit stollen, sizzling potato
pancakes called Kartoffelpuffer with applesauce garnish. And
Gluhwein. Every town has a slightly different recipe and serves the
drink in its own signature mug (which you can keep or give back for a
return of your deposit). The red wine-based brew is warming but none
too subtle; it reminded me of something I drank too much of at a
mixer in college.</TE>
<TE>   Slightly buzzed, I visited the Wallraf Richartz Museum, Cologne's
chief repository of medieval art. There, a Madonna painted about 1400
reminded me of a young Jodie Foster, and hell in Stefan Lochner's
whimsical 15th century "Last Judgment" looked like more fun than
heaven.</TE>
<TE>   I went back to the River Princess for the evening meal in the
dining room at the stern of the ship, which has fabulous wraparound
windows, red banquettes and starched napkins. The food came in three
courses, with several choices for each.</TE>
<TE>   That first night, I had a salad, veal steak and cheese plate;
another night, it was fish soup, roast duck and eclairs. Everything
looked better than it tasted, and the service was slipshod and
rushed. You had to refill your own water glass and decide on your
dessert at the beginning of the meal. No one, it seemed, minded too
much, because in other respects the cruise was a good value for the
price, chiefly because of the ship's amenities. The River Princess is
attractive and new, with a handsome lounge and piano bar up front, a
mid-section patio where coffee and cookies were always available, and
a roof deck and solarium for sun seekers and shutterbugs. The ship
also has a tiny health club, with a sauna and four workout machines.</TE>
<TE>   However, the cabins are the best thing about the River Princess,
large enough for two, with showers designed so you don't bruise your
knees and elbows when you move. All the cabins are the same size and
decorated in a smart minimalist style. But the window sizes are
proportional to the price of the chamber, with floor-to-ceiling
windows on the top deck, waist-to-ceiling windows in the middle and
shoulder-level windows just above river level on the bottom. The beds
have European duvets and are comfy nests at night as the ship cruises
smoothly through inland waterways. That's where I was the next
morning when the Australian cruise director, David Singleman,
announced over the P.A. system that we were entering the most scenic
part of the Rhine River. So I ran up to the top deck, where the sun
was coming out for the first and only time during the trip, to find
the River Princess passing ruined castles on cliffs near the towns of
St. Goar and St. Goarshausen. At this point the Rhine narrows
dramatically and turns past Lorelei Rock, where, according to German
legend, a crooning maiden lures sailors to their death.</TE>
<TE>   We spent the day docked in the hamlet of Rudesheim, where the
north-south-flowing Rhine turns abruptly east, producing a warm
microclimate conducive to grape-growing. There we had a group tour of
Siegfried's Mechanical Musical Instrument Museum, with its whimsical
antique player pianos and music boxes, and then we were let loose on
the town's bustling Christmas market.</TE>
<TE>   Right away I had some Gluhwein, which has a slightly pruney taste
in Rudesheim, bought a pretty blue bottle of plum brandy at a booth
and was charmed by three teenage girls in Santa hats who couldn't
restrain themselves from singing "Jingle Bells" (in English) as they
strolled through the market.</TE>
<TE>   When the stalls on High Street petered out, I found a wine shop
where I tasted at least a dozen Rieslings, priced between $6 and $10
a bottle, before buying an assortment of six. (Later, at an efficient
German post office, I sent the box -- for about $25 -- to relatives
in Brussels. It reached them, undamaged, in a matter of days.)</TE>
<TE>   River Princess passengers reconnoitered that night for a specially
arranged dinner at a local inn. The owner and his wife plied us with
a delightful Riesling from the family vineyard while we showed each
other the treasures we'd bought at the market. Most were Christmas
bric-a-brac, but a man from Cleveland who collected Steiff bears had
found one from a limited edition. It cost him about $100, and it was
wearing a Rudesheim medallion around its furry neck as if it were the
town mayor.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, docked in Mainz, about 20 miles downriver, we
prepared for a half-day bus trip to the romantic university town of
Heidelberg. There a local guide took us through the ruined castle
above town and pointed out the home of Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi
on the far side of the Neckar River. But Heidelberg didn't seem to
look its best in gray winter weather, and the Christmas market there
was disappointingly small.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the ship, we learned we couldn't get on the Main River
because the water was too high for the River Princess to pass under
low bridges. Later, I discovered this happens occasionally on German
river cruises, notably last summer when two Uniworld ships headed in
opposite directions on the Danube were forced to stop at the same low
bridge. Instead of turning around and retracing their routes, they
exchanged passengers, who were thus able to carry on with their
cruises as planned.</TE>
<TE>   A change of plans</TE>
<TE>   There was no such ingenious solution to our dilemma. Nevertheless,
most passengers were understanding, even though we wouldn't be able
to get to Wertheim, Wurzburg and Bamberg on the Main and Main-Danube
Canal. The diversion also made our scheduled bus trips to the walled
medieval town of Rothenberg and the city of Nuremberg longer than
originally planned. They became grueling 10-hour affairs, with six
hours spent on buses and barely enough time left to shop and tour.
Still, in Rothenberg I walked the ramparts and bought ornaments at
the Kathe Wohlfahrt store, part of a chain of German Christmas shops
open year-round. I also visited the town's Museum of Medieval Crime,
which showcases such instruments of punishment as thumbscrews, racks,
head trusses and chastity belts.</TE>
<TE>   In Nuremberg, shopping briefly yielded to modern history as we
drove past the parade ground where Hitler held massive Nazi party
rallies. The once handsome old city was the spiritual heart of the
Third Reich, so it was virtually leveled during World War II. Still,
a small historic section remains, where the Christmas market was
centered. It turned out to be one of the biggest and best we visited,
great fun to roam and noted for its Christmas Lebkuchen cookies.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the long bus trips, the cruise diversion had
compensations, beginning with an unscheduled overnight in the pretty
Romanesque cathedral town of Speyer on the Rhine, south of Mainz.
There I toured the museum, which had a special exhibit on toy trains
and gangly-armed mohair Steiff bears. I ate a bratwurst that was so
long it stuck several inches out of its round bun, drank Gluhwein and
then started some serious shopping. I'd come with a list of German
products that are expensive in the U.S., like FinnComfort shoes
(about $200 here) and Dr. Hauschka skin cream (about $20 per ounce at
my L.A. beauty supply store). In shops along Speyer's pleasant main
street I found both for half the U.S. price.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of the cruise we managed to get on the Main River,
but only as far as Frankfurt, which also had a Christmas market, of
course.</TE>
<TE>   But I spent my happiest hours there at an evening concert in a
Carmelite church that now houses the city's archeological museum. The
program featured Elizabethan choral works sung by a small choir,
their voices echoing into the building's lofty rafters.</TE>
<TE>   When they got to William Byrd's "Teach Me, O Lord," a hot current
ran up my spine and lodged someplace in the vicinity of my heart. It
wasn't the aftereffect of the Gluhwein I'd had at the market. It was
the Christmas spirit, which, when you finally get it, is just as
transporting in Germany as it is at home.</TE>

<HD>Mountain trekking may trigger asthma attacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathleen Doheny</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Asthma and adventure travel may not be a good mix, according to
Israeli and U.S. researchers.</LD>
<LD>   The team evaluated 203 patients with asthma before and after
adventure trips, including 147 who went on a high-altitude trek.
Eighty-eight of the travelers reported asthma attacks; more than
three-quarters of those who had attacks were high-altitude trekkers.
About half the travelers who suffered an attack said their asthma
worsened during the trip, and 32 said they had the worst attack of
their life on the trip. Eleven classified the attack as
life-threatening.</LD>
<LD>   Those who trekked and exerted themselves intensely were more
likely to have had an attack. Those who used their inhalers three
times a week or more before the trip were also more likely to have
had attacks during travel. A frequent need to use the bronchodilator
shows that the asthma is not well controlled, says Yoav Golan, an
assistant professor of infectious diseases at Tufts University School
of Medicine in Boston and one of the authors of the study, published
Nov. 25 in the Archives of Internal Medicine.</LD>
<TE>   Those travelers who used the bronchodilators frequently and
exerted themselves while trekking were even more likely to have had
an asthma attack.</TE>
<TE>   "People with asthma should make sure their asthma is optimally
controlled, especially if they are going to trek," Golan says. "Many
who trek don't exercise regularly at home." High altitude can
complicate the situation. If necessary, treatment should be
intensified before a trip. Trekking should be discouraged until the
asthma is under control.</TE>
<TE>   Last-minute gifts</TE>
<TE>   If you need a gift to help a loved one travel healthier:</TE>
<TE>   Bose QuietComfort headphones promise to drown out wind noise and
other aircraft sounds, soothing the nerves and making it easier to
hear the in-flight music or movies. (The headphones can be
substituted for those supplied by the airline.) They cost $299 and
are available, among other places, at Magellan's, 1006 Wilshire
Blvd., Santa Monica; (310) 394-9417, www.magellans.com.</TE>
<TE>   Support socks, $9.85 a pair, can keep the circulation going at
40,000 feet. From Magellan's.</TE>
<TE>   The Air Stepper travel exercise cushion can be placed under the
seat in front of you to give your feet and legs a workout. It's $10
from Distant Lands, 56 S. Raymond Ave., Pasadena; (800) 310-3220,
www.distantlands.com.</TE>
<TE>   Eagle Creek comfort seat cushion is inflatable and helps support
shoulders and the back on long plane and train rides or can plump up
a skimpy hotel pillow. From Distant Lands, $30.</TE>
<TE>   East-west sleep problems</TE>
<TE>   Sleep disturbances differ depending on whether you are traveling
east or west, according to a study of 10 academic faculty. The study
was published in August in the International Archives of Occupational
and Environmental Health.</TE>
<TE>   Subjects took trips of less than seven days to Japan or to Europe
from the U.S. and Canada. Sleep disruptions persisted for eastbound
travelers until the second day after return. Westbound travelers had
no substantial disruptions in sleep, but they took a longer nap after
their return, and they woke up later until the fifth day after
returning.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Like other researchers, these found that westbound
travel overall may be easier to tolerate than eastbound. Short-term
travel causes sleep problems during travel and at home after visiting
destinations east of home. It causes a delay in the timing of sleep
at home after going west.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers suggest that being aware of the pattern of problems
can help travelers ease recovery by rearranging post-trip work
schedules to accommodate disturbed sleep patterns.</TE>

<HD>Happy trails trace an Oakland park</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John McKinney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sprawling across the hills of Oakland is Anthony Chabot Regional
Park, almost 5,000 acres of preserved land that includes a tranquil
lake for canoeing and fishing and 31 miles of hiking and riding
trails through eucalyptus groves and chaparral-cloaked slopes.</LD>
<LD>   Out-of-towners often pronounce Chabot to rhyme with "rabbit," a
population of which bounds through meadows here. But the correct
pronunciation is sha-BO. Anthony Chabot was a hydraulic engineer and
entrepreneur who developed the water system for Oakland and other Bay
Area locales. The wealth that water brought allowed him to become one
of Oakland's biggest philanthropists.</LD>
<LD>   He created the lake that bears his name by constructing an earthen
dam across San Leandro Creek in 1874. For nearly a century, anglers
could only dream of the huge trout and bass rumored to lurk in the
reservoir. When Lake Chabot was opened to fishing in the 1960s, the
rumors proved true.</LD>
<TE>   The trails explore a diversity of habitats. One of my favorite
places is the park's long, grassy valley and the ridges to the east
and west.</TE>
<TE>   Grass Valley, as it had been called, is fading. Before becoming
parkland in 1942, grass dominated the scene, but brush has been
invading. Experts have offered various explanations: Cattle trampled
young growth. Fire prevention stopped beneficial burn-offs and
subsequent regrowth. European grasses have replaced hardier native
varieties.</TE>
<TE>   It's still a pleasant trek. To get here, follow Interstate 580 in
Oakland to the 35th Avenue exit. Take 35th east until it becomes
Redwood Road. Three miles after crossing Skyline Boulevard, the road
reaches the park's Bort Meadow Staging Area on the right side of the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Walk south on signed Grass Valley Trail for a mellow, 1 1/2-mile
ramble to Stone Bridge. Here you intersect Brandon Trail.</TE>
<TE>   Some hikers head south to connect with Chabot's crazy quilt of
trails above the lake. You, however, should turn north on Brandon
Trail for a pleasant walk along the west side of Grass Valley.
Explore Bort Meadow or have a picnic on your return to the trail
head.</TE>

<HD>To get holidays off the ground, prepare for stormy weather</HD>
<DH>Airline compensation policies differ when flights are
delayed or canceled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>'Tis the season for ... weather-related flight cancellations. Weeks
before this first official day of winter, passengers felt its icy
hand when storms stranded thousands at East Coast airports.</LD>
<LD>   Heavy air travel compounds such delays. "Holiday seasons are
always tough," says David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers
Assn., a passenger advocacy group. "If something happens, there's no
room on another airline to accommodate you."</LD>
<LD>   If a storm delays or prevents your flight, your airline may be
helpful -- or not. No federal law requires airlines to get you on
another flight within a specified time, put you up in a hotel or
otherwise accommodate you if foul weather delays or cancels your
flight, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. The
carriers' written policies typically disavow responsibility for
problems caused by factors beyond their control, including weather
and labor strikes.</LD>
<TE>   The airlines may help you anyway, as Nelda Lockamy of Greensboro,
N.C., learned when bad weather turned her weekend getaway into an
ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Lockamy, traveling with her husband, sister-in-law and
brother-in-law, spent the night of Dec. 4 at the Charlotte, N.C.,
airport after an ice storm and power failure canceled their US
Airways flight to Miami, along with scores of other flights.</TE>
<TE>   US Airways worked with the American Red Cross to supply cots,
coffee, juice and bagels to about 3,000 passengers stuck at its hub
airport. "People fought over the cots," Lockamy says. She went
without.</TE>
<TE>   The Lockamys had a special problem: They needed to catch a cruise
out of Miami at 4 the next afternoon. When it became clear they were
going to miss the boat, the airline put them on a nonstop flight to
the next major port, Nassau, Bahamas, and paid for an overnight at
the Wyndham resort there. The Lockamys joined the four-night cruise
on its second night.</TE>
<TE>   The airline was "very gracious," says Lockamy. "They did it at no
additional cost."</TE>
<TE>   The Lockamys, however, incurred some costs, especially because
Nelda's luggage was missing for most of the cruise.</TE>
<TE>   "We did end up spending several hundred dollars on meals, taxi
fares and clothes," she says. Fortunately, she and her husband had
travel insurance. When I talked with her, they were poring over the
forms to see what was covered.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines are not always as helpful. Dan McGinnity, a travel
insurance executive, told me that when Chicago area thunderstorms
canceled his Friday afternoon flight from O'Hare to Newark, N.J., an
airline agent made no offer of compensation and told him: "You'll be
leaving Sunday morning."</TE>
<TE>   "I stood in his face until I got a different answer," McGinnity
said. He got on a flight that day.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, persistence can pay off when rights and
responsibilities are so vaguely defined. Several airlines told me
they react to weather delays on a case-by-case basis.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't always go by the book," says US Airways spokesman David
Castelveter. "We want our employees to be empowered to make the right
decisions." The airline's Charlotte station manager made the call to
provide food to stranded passengers, he adds.</TE>
<TE>   After the Dec. 4 storm, US Airways said it would allow customers
whose flights were canceled to rebook without penalty Dec. 5 and 6
for travel within seven days. It didn't charge a rebooking fee, but
customers had to pay any fare difference between the original and
rebooked flights, Castelveter says.</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines customers traveling to or from storm-affected
states had until Dec. 7 to rebook without penalty. They didn't owe
any difference in fares unless they upgraded, spokesman Todd Burke
says.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines generally say they try to book you on their next
available flight. If they don't have room, they may put you on
another carrier, at no cost to you. Most, but not all, major airlines
have agreements to do this.</TE>
<TE>   If no such arrangement is made and you approach another airline to
rebook on your own, you may have to buy a new ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have a nonrestricted ticket, say on American Airlines, we
would accept that but not a more restricted ticket, like a
nonrefundable," says Castelveter. "Nonrefundable" refers, of course,
to the low-fare, advance purchase tickets that many leisure travelers
favor.</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines told me they wouldn't accept a ticket from another
airline, regardless of the fare you were traveling on, in this
situation; others declined to say what they would do. Southwest has
no interline pacts, so if it can't accommodate you, you'll have to
buy a ticket on another carrier. (You can fly standby on your unused
Southwest ticket up to a year.)</TE>
<TE>   So it may be wise to buy a full-fare ticket on a major airline if
stormy weather is likely. Some other suggestions from experts:</TE>
<TE>   Book a nonstop flight so you're less apt to be trapped between
destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Sign up for flight notification alerts. Some Internet travel
sellers and airlines will notify you by pager or cell phone if your
flight is canceled. That gives you a jump on making alternate plans.
(Visit their Web sites for details on how to register.)</TE>
<TE>   Buy insurance. Many travel insurers sell policies that cover
hotels, meals and other expenses if your trip is canceled or delayed
by weather. They may also reimburse you if you must buy a new plane
ticket or miss part or all of a cruise because your flight to the
embarkation point is late. Premiums typically are 4% to 8% of the
trip cost for bundled policies that include these coverages. Be sure
to read the fine print because provisions vary.</TE>
<TE>   Call your travel agent, if you used one. Although US Airways paid
for Nelda Lockamy's Nassau stay, a travel agency found and booked the
hotel for her.</TE>
<TE>   Pack a toothbrush, a change of clothes and some food in your
carry-on. Lockamy, an experienced traveler, says she didn't do this
because she figured her flight out of Charlotte would be "a straight
shot to Miami."</TE>
<TE>   Don't forget to take along patience and a sense of humor too. They
can be your best allies in this uncertain season.</TE>

<HD>The unsung charms of La Paz</HD>
<DH>Tourist development may have bypassed this star-crossed
Gulf of California city, but marine treasures await adventurers just
offshore.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Brass</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>La Paz, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Uunder the beachside palapa of La Posada de Engelbert, a
bougainvillea-covered inn owned by crooner Engelbert Humperdinck, the
leathery bartender shrugged when asked about modern La Paz.</LD>
<LD>   "La Paz used to be the place to go, and Cabo San Lucas was
nothing," said Mario Carrasco, who has been mixing drinks and
entertaining La Paz visitors with his baritone voice for 27 years.</LD>
<LD>   Before La Posada, Carrasco sang the old songs and served
margaritas at the Grand Baja, a hundred yards down the beach. Once a
center for the yachting community, it is now a burned-out shell, its
twin 11-story terra-cotta towers covered with graffiti, windows
broken, the roof collapsed on the once vibrant nightclub Caracol
Coco.</LD>
<TE>   "In Cabo they build a new hotel every week. Here, nothing,"
Carrasco said.</TE>
<TE>   The prosperity of Cabo San Lucas is only the latest twist in the
saga of La Paz, for centuries the center of commerce and culture in
the relatively untamed desert regions of southern Baja California.
The city's history is laced with dramatic turns of fate and fortune,
flirtations with glamour and wealth, all revolving around its role as
guardian of a huge bay, a legendary oasis guarding the south entrance
to the Gulf of California (known in Mexico as the Sea of Cortez).</TE>
<TE>   English and Dutch pirates once patrolled the entrance to the bay,
hoping to pounce on Spanish galleons laden with treasures from the
Orient. Four hundred years later, La Paz was developing into the
pearl capital of the world when the oysters disappeared in the 1940s,
victims of overharvesting or a mysterious disease, depending on which
story you believe.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent trip, I came across the sun-bleached remains of
thousands of huge oyster shells strewn across a beach on an
uninhabited island off the coast, a vivid reminder of the riches once
yielded by the sea.</TE>
<TE>   I've visited La Paz three times in the last three years, each time
discovering new evidence of the tides that have shaped the city.</TE>
<TE>   La Posada, where Carrasco tends bar, is a throwback to the days
when John Wayne and his cronies flew to La Paz for fishing trips.
Cabo may draw hordes of spring breakers, but La Paz is still a place
where grizzled sailors swap stories over bowls of fresh fish stew and
cheap tequila.</TE>
<TE>   On a Saturday night, the Malecon, the main drag along the bay, is
dominated by young couples dressed in their Sunday best, chastely
holding hands and enjoying the warm breeze off the bay, a few
grabbing a kiss in the shadows of the street lights. There is no Hard
Rock Cafe or Planet Hollywood on the Malecon. Nor is there McDonald's
or Starbucks. La Paz is a place forgotten by the international
franchisers.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is there a golf course, which is one reason some travelers
prefer Cabo. There has been a plan for many years to build a course
on the north end of La Paz, but there are few signs of progress, even
as new golf courses sprout like ivy along the coast in Cabo. The lone
sign of new development on the Malecon is the stark glass and metal
Hotel Seven Crown, which stands out like a Palm Pilot in a Bogie
movie. The main drag is still dominated by the Old World styles of
Hotel Los Arcos and Hotel Perla, the oldest in the city, which offers
an open-air restaurant perfect for sipping a cerveza and watching the
passing world.</TE>
<TE>   A lure for adventurers</TE>
<TE>   More than anything, La Paz is a working city, home to universities
and the state government. Ferries run daily between the city and
Topolobampo and Mazatlan, making La Paz a primary connection between
Baja and the mainland. In another flirtation with riches, La Paz was
once a duty-free zone, and the ferries were crowded with the families
of wealthy ranchers and businessmen from the mainland. However, as is
often the case in La Paz's history, the law changed, and new resorts
in Puerto Vallarta and Zihuatanejo lured mainland travelers, once
again snatching the dreams of La Paz businessmen.</TE>
<TE>   But the elements that have attracted centuries of explorers and
adventurers remain an integral part of the city's life and culture.
First and foremost is the Gulf of California, inspiration to John
Steinbeck and Jacques Cousteau, a twinkling mirage in the middle of
the area's blistering heat, which usually hovers around 90 from March
through October.</TE>
<TE>   La Paz is still considered a sportfishing port, rivaling the
better-publicized Cabo and the legendary east cape of Baja, just to
the south of La Paz. During the prime fishing season from May to
September, almost every boat returns with marlin and dorado.</TE>
<TE>   For non-fishermen, the sea is an aquarium filled with exotic life.
Several large desert islands, home to crystal-clear coves, provide
unique and fertile breeding grounds for marine life. The coves and
reefs harbor stories, mysteries and generations of sunken ships.</TE>
<TE>   My wife and I discovered one of La Paz's legendary spots on our
first trip. We booked a half-day snorkeling excursion, expecting
little more than a pleasant outing.</TE>
<TE>   In a panga, one of the long, narrow fishing boats that are a
staple in Baja, we skimmed across the glassy bay toward Isla Espiritu
Santo, a 14-mile-long wasteland pocked with secluded coves. As we
passed through the bay, we saw splashes in the distance. Moving
closer, we realized the splashes were caused by manta rays jumping
toward the sky, a mysterious ritual often seen in the area.</TE>
<TE>   After about two hours, we approached a collection of barren rocks
jutting out of the water, covered with birds. The sounds of barking
drew our attention to the isthmus connecting the two main rocks,
where we could see dozens of sea lions squabbling and sunning
themselves. The rocks are Los Islotes, home to a seal rookery
protected by the government. Donning our snorkeling gear, we hopped
into the clear water of the bay, where we were soon joined by a dozen
playful seals, clearly accustomed to the daily invasion of tourists.
The seals would dive to the bottom and shoot toward the surface,
teasing us and our cameras.</TE>
<TE>   On the way back to La Paz, we pulled into one of the coves on
Santo, where we ate lunch on the hot sand, our feet cooled by the
water slowly lapping onshore.</TE>
<TE>   Not for the resort crowd</TE>
<TE>   The trip was a vivid lesson that La Paz rewards travelers willing
to make an extra effort to explore. It is a staging area for trips to
secluded islands and the surrounding desert, not a destination for
lying out on sandy beaches. For the resort crowd expecting wide
stretches of glistening sand, the beaches around La Paz will be
disappointing. Bahia de La Paz is notoriously polluted, and the few
accessible beaches near the center of the city are often crowded and
covered in trash on weekends.</TE>
<TE>   The most developed beach is Tecolote, on a windy point about 30
minutes outside town on the peninsula of Pichilingue. It is the
closest Baja gets to the Riviera. Small palapa restaurants with
plastic chairs on the beach serve nachos and cold beer.</TE>
<TE>   Just to the west of Tecolote is Puerto Balandra, where the desert
heat beats down on a shallow bay of cool water, far removed from the
industrial side of the city. Balandra is home to Mushroom Rock, which
has spawned a thousand postcards. Situated at the mouth of the bay,
the mushroom-shaped formation is perched precariously on a thin spire
that appears barely able to support the larger rock.</TE>
<TE>   On a Sunday afternoon, the parking lot for Balandra is often
strewn with litter, and locals have pulled speakers out of their
trucks and set them on the beach to play music.</TE>
<TE>   But my wife and I visited the bay early on a weekday morning,
using a taxi to make the 30-minute drive. The driver dropped us off
and promised to return in two hours, a common practice.</TE>
<TE>   We had the cove to ourselves, free to wade through the shallow
water in the cool morning air. We wandered the beach, collected
shells and took our pictures next to the rock formation without
seeing another soul. Our taxi returned just as the crowds started
arriving.</TE>
<TE>   Taxis are part of the adventure in La Paz. On the way back from
Balandra, the driver suddenly pulled off onto a dirt road and
screeched to a stop. Leaping out with an un momento, he strolled over
to a taco stand to pick up his lunch, leaving us waiting in the back
of the car.</TE>
<TE>   A rental car changes the experience in La Paz, offering the
opportunity for your own quick stop at a roadside taco stand and the
freedom to explore the stark desert landscape surrounding the city.</TE>
<TE>   The most common day trip is to Todos Santos, near the west coast
about an hour's drive from La Paz. The dusty village's popularity for
American travelers is a bit mystifying, because its lone claim to
fame appears to be the large number of American expatriates who have
settled there. Many people miss the main draw, a variety of secluded
beaches nearby, accessible only by dirt roads, where some of the
world's best surfers work on their moves.</TE>
<TE>   On my most recent visit to La Paz, a trip to the rugged Pacific
Coast was not on the agenda. I was just passing through for a few
days on my way to sailing on the Gulf of California with friends.
During the day we lived at the pace of a culture steeped in the
traditions of siesta, wandering the streets before the afternoon heat
shut down the city. At night we ate seafood in the open-air
restaurants and drank cold beer.</TE>
<TE>   There were few hawkers on the streets, none of the relentless
selling found in most Mexican resort cities.</TE>
<TE>   One morning we drove down the dirt roads paralleling the bay near
La Posada. We came out on a small beach where an abandoned sailboat
lay on its side a few hundred yards offshore, run aground in a storm
many months ago. Wandering over to the wreckage, we tried to imagine
the owners and the past adventures of the scuttled boat.</TE>
<TE>   On our way back we stumbled on El Serpentario, a reptile farm in
the midst of a residential neighborhood, just a few blocks from La
Posada de Engelbert. It is home to a wide assortment of turtles,
lizards and snakes, as well as "spiders, scorpions, centipedes and
other arthropods," a brochure assured us.</TE>
<TE>   The center was empty on a weekday, except for a few bored-looking
attendants. We explored the tidy exhibits, tortoise ponds to lizard
pits.</TE>
<TE>   La Paz may not feel like a boomtown anymore, but it is still a
place of mystery and adventure.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Susan Spano's article "Island Crime Problems Point to
Trouble in Paradise" (Oct. 20): I have made St. Croix my vacation
destination every January for the last 14 years, staying at a small
hotel just outside Frederikstad.</LD>
<LD>   At our hotel we are always cautioned about not venturing into town
on foot after dark. I also have friends who live on the island
year-round, and they say crime has gotten worse because of some
locals who target restaurants outside resorts.</LD>
<LD>   How sad it is that visitors have to watch their backs and that a
small handful of island residents are succeeding in undermining the
one vital industry that remains on the island: tourism.</LD>

<LD>"Florida's Treasure Islands" (Dec. 1) brought back wonderful
memories. I lived on Sanibel Island until I was 13, doing my best to
emulate Bud Ricks of the "Flipper" television series. Now, 24 years
after my unwilling departure, I visit as often as possible while I
plot a permanent return.</LD>
<LD>   Although writer Susan Spano had a good experience on Captiva and
at Sanibel's western end, I have always found the island's eastern
end to be more authentic and charming, with the best beaches and
swimming.</LD>
<LD>   The area from Lindgren Boulevard east to the lighthouse includes
Old Town Sanibel (www.oldtownsanibel.com) and a cluster of more
intimate hotels than are found elsewhere on the islands.</LD>

<LD>Having taught air traffic control in China for five years, I
understand and enjoy China. Arthur Frommer's advice to limit your
first trip to Beijing, Xi'an and Shanghai ("China Amazes, and the
Journey Keeps Getting Easier," Dec. 8) is right on the money.</LD>
<LD>   There is so much to absorb in those cities that you will not get
the full effect by trying to do more. As he advised, visiting the
Shanghai Museum is a must; it is wonderful.</LD>
<LD>   However, Xi'an has an almost equally excellent museum, the Shaanxi
Provincial History Museum. And in Beijing, please include the Silk
Alley, the Pearl Market and the Dirt Market. You won't be sorry.</LD>
<TE>   I believe the world will be very surprised at the China they see
during the 2008 Olympics.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I thoroughly enjoyed "On the Wild Side of Life in Dominica" (Dec.
15). I have visited 17 Caribbean islands, and I feel Dominica is an
untouched jewel. I hope that not many people discover this wonderful
place. It was fascinating to see a destination that is not on many
tourist lists.</LD>
<LD>   I wish writer Barbara Noe had written more on the Carib Indians.
Dominica is one of their last Caribbean strongholds. We enjoyed
seeing where they lived and brought home one of the beautiful baskets
they make.</LD>
<LD>   Any ride you hire to take you on a tour is really an experience --
kind of like being in the Le Mans auto race.</LD>

<LD>U.S. hostel group changing name, Web site</LD>
<LD>   Hostelling International-American Youth Hostels is changing its
name and Web address Jan. 1 and raising membership fees for the first
time in about a decade.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit group, which runs more than 100 hostels in 33
states, will be known as Hostelling International-USA. Dropping the
word "Youth" reflects the fact that half its members are at least 26
and 15% are 55 or older, spokesmen said. Its Web address,
www.hiayh.org, will change to www.hiusa.org.</LD>
<TE>   The international hostelling movement, founded early in the last
century in Europe, originally focused on helping students travel
inexpensively. But other age groups have since joined. The U.S.
affiliate dates to 1934.</TE>
<TE>   Also starting Jan. 1, new members age 18 and older will be
eligible for $8,000 worth of insurance for travel emergencies abroad.
The insurance is free, but you must sign up for it. Annual
memberships will be $28 for ages 18 to 54 (up from $25), and $18 for
ages 55 and older (up from $15). Memberships will continue to be free
for youths younger than 18 and for groups of 10 or more. (202)

<TE>   Warhol portraits of rich, famous headed for Vegas</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are on sale for "Andy Warhol: The Celebrity Portraits,"
running Feb. 7 to Sept. 7 at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art at the
Bellagio resort in Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The exhibition offers depictions of more than 50 celebrities done
by the late Pop artist over three decades, including Jacqueline
Kennedy, John Lennon and singer Michael Jackson. Liza Minnelli
narrates the audio tour.</TE>
<TE>   The works draw on the private collection of Jose Mugrabi and his
son Alberto. They were not part of the recent Warhol retrospective at
downtown L.A's Museum of Contemporary Art. Tickets are $15 for
adults, $12 students. Call (877) 957-9777 to order.</TE>
<TE>   Three airlines cancel $100 standby fee</TE>
<TE>   Some airlines have backed off plans to charge a $100 same-day
standby fee for holders of nonrefundable tickets starting Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   United, American and Continental canceled the fee plans. United
said it was responding to customers asking for "simpler and easier"
travel. As of the Travel section's deadline Tuesday, US Airways, the
first to announce the fee, was "studying the matter" but hadn't
canceled it, a spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   The fee was part of a series of new restrictions several airlines
announced in August and September on nonrefundable tickets, which
typically carry low-cost, advance-purchase fares popular with leisure
travelers. In most cases, to be able to reuse such tickets if they
can't make their flight, customers must notify the airline before the
flight or by midnight on the scheduled date of travel and rebook.</TE>
<TE>   You'll need to check each airline because policies differ. For
instance, Delta already charges $100 for same-day standbys on
nonrefundable tickets; on Jan. 1 it plans to start providing a
confirmed seat for a $100 fee in lieu of standby in that situation, a
spokesman said. Northwest never matched rivals' standby fee plans.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of cruise illnesses up in 2002, CDC says</TE>
<TE>   There were 21 outbreaks of gastrointestinal illnesses reported on
cruise ships visiting U.S. ports through Dec. 2 this year, compared
with seven in all of 2001, the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention reported. The figures "might reflect an actual
increase" in incidence of Norwalk-like virus or result from better
surveillance and testing, it added.</TE>
<TE>   Last Sunday, Carnival's Conquest returned to New Orleans after a
Caribbean cruise on which about 260 people got sick, the Associated
Press reported. It was disinfected and sailed again.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's Note</TE>
<TE>   The Internet travel seller Orbitz, www.orbitz.com, has added a
"hotel matrix" feature to its searches, matching hotels against their
distance from an address or city. This allows travelers to determine
whether they might save money or get a higher-class hotel for the
price of a lower-class one by going farther out.</TE>
<TE>   DEAL OF THE WEEK</TE>
<TE>   Thailand for less than $1,000</TE>
<TE>   You can spend 10 days in Thailand for less than $1,000, including
air fare, on the Affordable Thailand tour offered by Crown Travel, a
Naugatuck, Conn.-based travel agency. The price includes round-trip
flights between Thailand and LAX on Korean Air; hotel stays in
Bangkok, Chiang Mai and other stops; all breakfasts and one dinner;
motor-coach transport; and guide services. Prices begin at $999 per
person, double occupancy, for select departures in March, $60 more
for departures later in the spring and in fall. Airport departure
taxes, about $90, are extra. (800) 853-6453 (reservations),

<LD>A$260-million resort opening on New Year's Day in San Diego County is
beginning to look a lot like Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The 397-room Barona Valley Ranch Resort &amp; Casino has 2,000 slot
machines; 52 gaming tables with blackjack, poker and other pursuits;
VIP high-roller sections; five restaurants and a food court; and a
theme decor based on Native American culture and 1930s-era California
ranches. There's even the requisite wedding chapel by the lake.</LD>
<LD>   The Vegas touches are not surprising because the development was
crafted by Bergman, Walls &amp; Associates, architects of the gambling
city's Caesars Palace, Paris Las Vegas and Mirage resorts.</LD>
<TE>   The owners are the Barona Band of Mission Indians, who have run a
casino for about eight years and a highly regarded 18-hole public
golf course for nearly two years on their 7,000-acre reservation
northeast of San Diego, about 12 miles south of Ramona off California
67.</TE>
<TE>   The new resort-casino is next to the golf course; the old casino,
less than half the size of the new one, is being shut down.</TE>
<TE>   The design is a tribute to the Barona Indians who bought the land
in 1932. The casino is fashioned after a barn, with bales of hay in a
silo and a 20-by-20-foot fieldstone fireplace in the center. Five
statues of Native American figures by Denny Haskew stand at the
entrance.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, the casino's core customers have been local. With the
new resort, the owners hope to draw visitors from along the West
Coast up to the Pacific Northwest and east to Arizona, said
spokeswoman Jennifer Barry.</TE>
<TE>   Will it draw from the Las Vegas market too? "Definitely," Barry
said, although she added quickly: "It's not a replacement for Las
Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   The resort lacks two key Vegas ingredients: a showroom and, for
now, a liquor license (pending with the county). But it does offer
what it calls "jackpot dining," a holdover from the old casino.</TE>
<TE>   "You order from the restaurant menu, and they roll out a cart with
a little vase with flowers and linen to your slot machine or game
table," Barry explains.</TE>
<TE>   Room rates begin at $79 per night on weekdays, $129 on weekends.
There are 33 luxury suites priced from $250 to $1,000 per night.

<HD>Find out what to buy where -- and then go for it</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dashboard hula girls, cuckoo clocks, tribal war masks, stuffed
kangaroos -- maybe there's a place in heaven for all the junk we
bring back from trips. Until then, much of it ends up in the basement
or Goodwill bin.</LD>
<LD>   But in a charming antiques shop overlooking a Venetian canal, how
do you stop yourself from buying that gorgeous Murano glass
chandelier? It's expensive. It might look odd in your dining room.
And you have no idea how you'll get it home. But there are traveler's
checks rattling around in your wallet, and you've never seen anything
like it.</LD>
<LD>   There's no foolproof way of ensuring you'll cherish everything you
buy on the road. Too often, things that seem wonderful in Turkey or
Germany look like well-traveled kitsch after they pass through
customs. On the other hand, the urge to find something special is
strong and real.</LD>
<TE>   A wise woman once told me that you don't regret the things you
buy, even if they turn out to be useless; you regret the things you
pass up. What, for instance, was I thinking when I failed to buy a
Navajo rug at the Crown Point Auction last year in New Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   When I first started traveling, I was too cheap to buy anything.
Now I know that shopping is one of the great rewards of travel. So my
advice is not to err on the side of caution. At the same time, there
are certain principles to remember when it comes to travel shopping:</TE>
<TE>   Uniqueness. Avoid mass-produced gewgaws, no matter how cute.
They're impulse buys. The more you spend on them, the more holes in
your travel budget. Instead, look for one or two slightly
bigger-ticket items that would seem singularly beautiful or useful
regardless of their origins.</TE>
<TE>   If you must buy knickknacks, earmark them as presents for family
and friends. That way the gifts will end up in someone else's
basement.</TE>
<TE>   Immediate usefulness. If there's something you need on the road,
you will probably need it and use it later. I've had good luck buying
things that way: a fisherman's sweater I still wear, purchased one
chilly spring on a bike trip through County Clare, Ireland; a black
carry-on bag I use all the time, acquired at a department store in
Helsinki when the strap of my old one gave out.</TE>
<TE>   Fearless buying. I admire people who have the nerve to make big
purchases on the road. My sister bought a huge antique wooden chest
in China and carpets in Turkey. She's successful because she shops
with friends and colleagues who are experts on particular items or
gets references from them about reliable shops that will ship her
purchases home.</TE>
<TE>   Getting big-ticket items back to the U.S. can be problematic.
Common sense tells travelers to avoid mailing items in countries
where a postcard sent to the U.S. takes a month arriving. But I had
no qualms about sending a half-case of Riesling from a post office in
Germany to relatives in Belgium. It reached Brussels intact in days.</TE>
<TE>   Another approach to buying big, expensive items is to take a card
from the shop instead of bagging something on the spot. Then you can
decide once you get home if you really must have it.</TE>
<TE>   Avoid buying anything you don't know in your heart you want. If
you waffle, it's a sign. Better to leave the Venetian chandelier in
the shop.</TE>
<TE>   Research. There are things to buy wherever you go. Instead of
falling under their spell, find out before you leave home what's
worth buying.</TE>
<TE>   A good travel buy is something you won't find elsewhere or the
real thing that is knocked off in other places. That could mean silk
pajamas in China, rugs in Morocco or quilted cotton bedspreads in
Jaipur, India.</TE>
<TE>   It also makes sense to think about the things you buy at home that
come from other places. They may cost less in the country where
they're produced. I made a list before I went to Germany last month
and came home with a pair of German Finn Comfort shoes and Dr.
Hauschka face cream for half the price charged in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Decor. Your home reflects your fundamental taste. On the road,
keep a picture of it in mind. If your house is mid-century modern,
don't be seduced into buying a Duncan Phyfe table. I call the style
of my home Foreign Service Eclectic, which means that just about
everything fits in.</TE>
<TE>   Gifts. I remind myself of whose birthday is coming up before I
leave home, and I do my Christmas shopping all year on the road.
Presents from far away are distinctive, and buying gifts is a good
way to indulge your passion for shopping.</TE>
<TE>   Simplicity. Some of the best things I ever brought home for myself
or loved ones cost little or nothing. I love colorful Mexican
matchboxes, soap from French grocery stores, greeting cards in
foreign languages. After my recent visit to Sanibel Island in
Florida, family and friends got shells I collected on the beach. At
Lake Tahoe I gathered the huge pine cones I always put around my
Christmas tree.</TE>
<TE>   There will be fewer white elephants from faraway places in your
closets if you follow these guidelines. Of course, there are always
exceptions. I have a hula girl on the dashboard of my car. Every time
I go over a bump, her pink grass skirt jiggles and I'm back under a
palm tree in Maui.</TE>

feet down a cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail in desert country near
Green River, Wyo. Her husband, Bob Duke, frantically called for help.
A family outing gone tragically wrong -- or so it seemed. One man, a
hard-drinking, small-time drug dealer, doubted Duke's story. But with
his reputation, who would believe him?</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   GREEN RIVER, Wyo. -- Butch Brauburger had never seen his son so
upset. Tears were streaming down Roger's face. There was a look of
terror in his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Calm down, son, the father said.</TE>
<TE>   But Roger was a blubbering mess, ranting incoherently about guilt,
about how he should have said something years ago, about how more
lives were in danger.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what to do, Dad," he sobbed. "Tell me what to do.
I'm lost."</TE>
<TE>   It was late at night on Jan. 3, 1999, and at first the father
thought that his son had been drinking.</TE>
<TE>   But the more Butch Brauburger listened, the more he realized that
Roger was deadly serious -- and that his son's life was in danger.</TE>
<TE>   There's only one thing to do, the father said. You have to go to
Mont.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mont Mecham, 53, is a grizzled veteran lieutenant with the Green
River Police Department, a formidable presence with his tough
exterior, searing blue eyes and the neck brace he wears like a badge
of honor.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad day on the job," he growled, describing the night five years
ago when a burglary suspect shot him through the throat and left him
for dead.</TE>
<TE>   He's had nine surgeries since then, and still doctors can't figure
out how to fix the nerve damage that leaves his back in constant
pain, his arms stiff and ice cold.</TE>
<TE>   Mecham knew Brauburger and Bob Duke. His son, now a cop, had gone
to school with them. As kids, the three sometimes hung out in
Mecham's basement. Nice kids, Mecham thought. Roger was a bit of a
hell-raiser, but the others had turned out OK.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Mecham had been bothered by the deaths of Liana and
Erik Duke. Too many things didn't add up. It didn't make sense for a
family to be out on the cliffs in the first place. No parents in
their right minds would allow a child to run around up there.</TE>
<TE>   "Two bodies, one eyewitness, no forensic evidence," he said. "It
wasn't right."</TE>
<TE>   But Mecham couldn't investigate because the case fell into the
jurisdiction of the Sweetwater County sheriff's department. Frankly,
he told friends there, they could have done a better job.</TE>
<TE>   About a week after the deaths, out of curiosity, Mecham drove to
the end of Lost Dog Trail. He crept to the edge and peered over the
ridge where the bodies had fallen.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in the wind and the dust, looking down the cliff face, he
was sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking at the murder weapon," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I need to talk to you as soon as I can," Brauburger said. "I've
got something super-scary to tell you."</TE>
<TE>   It was the day after Brauburger had talked to his father. Over the
telephone, Mecham could hear the terror in Brauburger's voice.</TE>
<TE>   Mecham drove to the construction site where Brauburger was
working. In the police car, Brauburger poured out his story.</TE>
<TE>   His old friend, Bob Duke, had been calling him from Houston, he
said. At first, it was just small talk about work, and what he and
his brother Mike were up to. But lately, the talk had turned ugly.</TE>
<TE>   Duke had run out of the $60,000 insurance money from his wife and
child's deaths and, with his brother, had hatched a plan to make a
lot -- fast. They just needed a few details wrapped up: alibis, a
driver. And could Roger get them a silencer?</TE>
<TE>   At first, Brauburger told Mecham, he went along with the
conversations because he didn't know what else to do. Sure, he told
Duke, he could get a silencer. What was the plan?</TE>
<TE>   In the police car, Brauburger sputtered out the words as if he
still couldn't believe what Duke had told him:</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I'll pay you $20,000 to kill my parents.' "</TE>
<TE>   Go on, Mecham said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought, Oh my God he's serious. He killed his wife and child,
and now he is planning to murder his own parents."</TE>
<TE>   Mecham looked at him sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "Slow down," he said. "How do you know he killed his wife and
child?"</TE>
<TE>   Duke told me that he was looking for a hit man this time,
Brauburger said, because, as he put it, "I've done family before and
I didn't like it."</TE>
<TE>   Shaking, Brauburger then told the veteran cop the secret he hadn't
dared tell anyone in years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It was the summer of 1996. Brauburger had been hanging out with
Duke, watching movies, talking crazy hit-man talk for laughs, as
they'd done while growing up. Suddenly, Duke turned to him and said,
"Would you kill my wife and child for $15,000?"</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger laughed it off. Who's worth more, he joked, the wife or
the kid? But Duke persisted, Brauburger said. A few days later, he
laid out a detailed plan.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger could go to Duke's apartment on Idaho Street and hide
behind a shed where Duke would leave a .22-caliber Ruger rifle. Then,
during a family barbecue, Brauburger could shoot the wife and child
in the head, shoot Duke in the leg, spray a few neighborhood kids and
make his getaway. Duke would pay him with the insurance money he got
for Liana and Erik.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him he was nuts," Brauburger said. "I said if he was that
unhappy, he should get a divorce."</TE>
<TE>   I can't do that, Duke told him. My parents would hate me.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks later, Liana and Erik were dead.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger's face was full of panic as he turned to Mecham.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew right away it was no accident," he said. "But I didn't
know what to do."</TE>
<TE>   "Why didn't you go to the police?" Mecham asked.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was incredulous.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my word against Bob's," he said. "Who would have believed
me?"</TE>
<TE>   Mecham knew that Brauburger had a well-documented history of using
drugs and selling marijuana.</TE>
<TE>   But he had never been in serious trouble, and he swore that he was
finished with drugs now. He was about to get married and start a
family.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger Brauburger was certainly no angel," Mecham said later. "But
people don't go to angels to kill their parents."</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger had just enough of a past to be credible.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have to wire you," Mecham told him. "We need to
get this on tape."</TE>
<TE>   "No!" Roger cried. "If Bob gets word, I'm a dead man."</TE>
<TE>   Mecham rolled his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to do?" he snapped. "Let Mom and Dad die, like
the wife and kid?"</TE>
<TE>   That night, police taped a call between Roger Brauburger and Bob
Duke. The conversation rambled. The details were vague. But a date
for the killing was set, just three weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough for Mecham to believe everything that Brauburger had
told him. The next day, Mecham drove 273 miles to Cheyenne and played
the tape for the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger, stocky and tattooed, with a wispy goatee and small
eyes behind thick glasses, sat at the round table in his father's
kitchen. He stared anxiously at the phone on the wall. There was
nothing to indicate that it was wired to a recording device, but the
cops swarming around the tiny house were reminder enough.</TE>
<TE>   His heart beat wildly; beads of sweat broke out on his forehead.
He didn't feel right, and he was sure that his voice didn't sound
right.</TE>
<TE>   It was noon on Jan. 8, 1999, and Brauburger was about to place the
fourth recorded call to Duke in three days. Everyone -- the cops, FBI
and Brauburger himself -- sensed that this call would be the last.
They had too much to lose if Duke got suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   The previous calls had gone well -- chillingly well.</TE>
<TE>   Duke talked about setting a date for the murders, about using a
.22-caliber rifle, about the need to get into the house when both
parents were out because his father had a gun, about the need for
both Duke brothers to have alibis.</TE>
<TE>   He talked about money: $20,000 if Brauburger did the job himself,
$5,000 if he acted as a driver for someone else.</TE>
<TE>   Police and the FBI were satisfied that they had enough to arrest
Duke on conspiracy charges for plotting to kill his parents. But they
wanted more. They wanted him to mail something -- a key or money --
physical evidence to strengthen their case.</TE>
<TE>   Even more, they wanted Duke to say something on tape to implicate
himself in the killing of his wife and child.</TE>
<TE>   The calls had been making Brauburger increasingly uneasy. Just the
day before, Duke had asked Brauburger, "You're not talking about
this?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Brauburger had replied. "No, I haven't said a word to no
one."</TE>
<TE>   But the question made police nervous too.</TE>
<TE>   They assigned extra patrols around the homes of Duke's parents and
the Brauburgers. And they staked out Duke's Houston apartment, ready
to burst in at a moment's notice.</TE>
<TE>   In the little kitchen in Green River, the air was thick with
tension.</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger took a deep breath and dialed the Houston number.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, what's up?" he asked Duke.</TE>
<TE>   They bantered a bit about work, and then Brauburger got to the
point.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey," Brauburger said. "Uh, is there any way we can make it look
like an accident, like you did with your wife and child?"</TE>
<TE>   There was a moment of silence. Then Duke exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "Dude, I did not do that.... "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, I thought you said you did that."</TE>
<TE>   "No!"</TE>
<TE>   The cops signaled to him to stay calm. They shoved handwritten
notes across the table, but Brauburger was too distracted to read
them. Oh God, he thought. Bob's on to me. I'm a dead man.</TE>
<TE>   The cops were thinking the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no doubt in my mind that someone was going to get
killed unless we could stop it," Mecham said later, "either the
parents or Roger."</TE>
<TE>   It was time to make their move. Trembling, Brauburger listened
over the phone as FBI agents and police burst in on Duke in Houston.
He heard Duke cry out. In the background, a dog barked.</TE>
<TE>   Then the phone went dead.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests were all over the news in Texas and Wyoming. Bob Duke
was charged in federal court with conspiracy to use interstate
telephone lines to plot his parents' killings. Mike Duke was charged
with failing to report the plot. (The brothers declined to be
interviewed for this story.)</TE>
<TE>   Brauburger was elated. That night, he hit the bars and then drove
through the desert, whooping it up in a beer-soaked reverie.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he could move on. He could forget about the past, the
friendship with Duke, the guilt and torment of the past few years. He
had done the right thing. He had prevented more killing.</TE>
<TE>   It's over, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   But a new ordeal was about to begin.</TE>

<LD>THE STORY SO FAR</LD>

feet down a cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail in desert country near
Green River, Wyo. Her husband, Bob Duke, frantically called for help.

<TE>   From Associated Press</TE>
<TE>   This story is based on extensive interviews with investigators
from the Green River (Wyo.) Police Department and the Sweetwater
County Sheriff's Department; prosecutors; the FBI; witnesses,
including Roger Brauburger and his family; relatives of Liana and
Erik Duke, and jurors. It also drew on court testimony and evidence
submitted in both the federal and state cases, including FBI tapes of
conversations between Bob Duke and Brauburger, the coroner's report,
photographs of the scene and of the autopsies. Research included
attendance at the trial and the sentencing as well as visits to the
cliff at the end of Lost Dog Trail. Duke and his family refused to be
interviewed.</TE>

<LD>Shawn Boyd's story has changed so much in a little more than a year.
All it lacks now is a happy ending.</LD>
<LD>   The case of the wayward councilman and two related tales point to
the need for active measures to make sure Orange County's
officeholders keep public service at the forefront.</LD>
<LD>   In September 2001, Boyd, then a Seal Beach councilman, was accused
of voting seven times on city business despite a clear conflict of
interest. He also failed to reveal his financial connection on state
financial forms that are filed under penalty of perjury. His problems
all involved his deals with the owner of a mobile-home park and his
votes to use city-backed bonds to underwrite the purchase of the park
by a nonprofit group.</LD>
<TE>   Boyd's first story: He'd never actually received money from the
owner, so he didn't have a conflict. He was just working on pending
deals, none of them having anything to do with the mobile-home park.
"Nobody makes any money until the deal closes," Boyd said. He had
gotten legal advice that his actions were within the law. Besides, he
was entitled to make a living.</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, prosecutors filed documents showing that Boyd
actually had received quite a bit of money: $104,000. Not
surprisingly, Boyd lost his council seat in the March 2002 election.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd's next story: He'd been unfairly tainted by scandal. "Some
people believe you are guilty until proven innocent."</TE>
<TE>   Boyd's current story: He's guilty.</TE>
<TE>   This month, Boyd pleaded guilty to a felony conflict-of-interest
charge. He was fined nearly $50,000 and is barred for life from
seeking public office.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said Boyd had helped the owner of the mobile-home
park by telling him the city had more funding available. Suddenly,
the owner raised his asking price for the homes. It also turns out
the city wasn't the only one Boyd kept in the dark. He neglected to
tell state tax collectors and was convicted of state tax evasion as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Boyd's story is still missing an apology for his crimes.</TE>
<TE>   His case is unpleasantly similar to that of former Huntington
Beach Councilman Dave Garofalo, who repeatedly voted on city matters
that involved companies that were advertising clients of his
publishing company. He, too, said he'd been acting within the law.
Garofalo resigned and was fined, sentenced to community service and
banned from public office.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach Mayor Wayne Baglin pleaded not guilty to similar
charges this month. He represented the sellers in a real-estate deal
with the city when he was councilman. The case against him is murkier
than the others, though his financial dealings were at least
unseemly. Baglin revealed his financial conflict and abstained from
the council vote. He thinks his actions were legal. And, like Boyd,
he defends his right to make money.</TE>
<TE>   Enough already. Yes, public officials are entitled to make a
living. But they must understand that they're not as free to make
business deals as a private citizen is. By running for office, and
thus taking the public's purse strings in their hands, they give up
certain financial privileges. They cannot accept large gifts from
just anyone. They cannot blend their personal affairs with government
business. And if they cannot live with those restrictions, they
should remain private citizens.</TE>
<TE>   A little education is in order to combat an apparent outbreak of
legal ignorance among Orange County's public officials. How about
orientation sessions for the newly elected on their rights and legal
obligations? Afterward, they would sign a form saying they understand
the law now. And then the public might hear the end of these stories.</TE>

<LD>Light-fingered Winona Ryder wouldn't be allowed in this exclusive
Newport Beach ladies group. Not enough remorse. Too many prescription
drugs.</LD>
<LD>   Otherwise, she fits the bill: a woman who lifted a whole bunch of
store goodies that she had the money to buy.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit Alternative Sentencing Program runs a 12-step-type
group for shoplifters, many of whom are sent to the program much as a
drunken driver might go for alcohol treatment. The offenders must be
financially secure, not because the three-month program costs $400,
but because of the Winona Factor. The thieves -- 90% of them women --
easily could have afforded the stolen items. They stole not for greed
but because of a dark need within.</LD>
<TE>   How can you tell the difference? Nancy Clark, director of the
program, says shoplifters whose problems are psychological rather
than financial react to their crimes with shock and shame. They're
apt to steal things they can't use, such as too-big clothes.</TE>
<TE>   What Clark's clients don't do is deny they committed the crime.
That would eliminate Ryder. Clark said she also doesn't admit people
who have drug or alcohol problems. In addition to 400 hours of
volunteer work, Ryder was sentenced to drug counseling after being
found with several prescription pain drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Clark might not be ready to welcome Ryder to her program, but
she's grateful the actress brought this problem out in the open.
Women with a similar dark secret have been phoning Clark in droves.
They want to be stopped before they're arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Bravo for them and for a program that helps them and society.</TE>
<TE>   But it's troubling that financially comfortable people who can
take advantage of Clark's program are getting a break in their
sentencing. The women in Clark's program steal because of the thrill
of getting something for nothing. But that doesn't make their crime
any less serious. There are no equivalent programs for people who
steal out of need.</TE>
<TE>   Progressive as the program is, it also needs to build a track
record. Several hundred clients have passed through the shoplifters
group during the last five years, but no one has kept statistics on
whether it reduces repeat crimes.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to develop some data. Kleptomania can be as tough to
beat as alcoholism, Clark said, especially since it's hard to avoid
tempting situations. Almost everybody has to go shopping sometime.</TE>

<HD>Familiar Clause Takes a Toll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It takes a big magnifying glass to go over toll-road agreements.
That's what Riverside County officials discovered recently when they
fine-combed a deal that would allow the Orange County Transportation
Authority to buy the 91 Express Lanes.</LD>
<LD>   There in the small print appeared language similar to an egregious
clause in an earlier agreement involving the toll lanes. That clause
can prevent any public improvements to the Riverside Freeway that
might affect the toll lanes. In other words, it commits the travesty
of tying the public's hands so taxpayers can't improve their own
transportation system.</LD>
<LD>   The ironic part is that OCTA wants to buy the lanes to overcome
the old clause that Caltrans agreed to several years ago, so Orange
and Riverside counties can make the needed improvements. The
legislation allowing the purchase actually bans non-compete clauses.</LD>
<TE>   So what's this wording in the new purchase deal that would keep
Caltrans from interfering with OCTA's ability to bring in toll
revenue? Though OCTA denies it, this clearly looks like non-compete
language. Caltrans improvements to nearby roadways could pull people
off the toll roads and thus interfere with OCTA's income.</TE>
<TE>   What happened is that the OCTA ran into the same problems other
toll-road owners have experienced: Investors want some guarantees the
toll road will bring them good returns. They don't want better
freeways for the public interfering with revenue.</TE>
<TE>   That's an understandable way to get toll roads financed, but it's
not good public policy. Even the less-restrictive non-compete clauses
for Orange County's other toll roads fail to serve the public's best
interest. Those clauses would force the state to repay toll-road
agencies for any losses incurred because of publicly financed freeway
improvements. It's not the job of California motorists and taxpayers
to provide warranties for bond investors.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside County officials want anything that looks like a
non-compete clause removed from the purchase deal. If not, they'll
stall the buyout.</TE>
<TE>   That no-improvements clause created hellish conditions for
Riverside County commuters. If roads between the two counties aren't
improved, the Orange County economy will pay a steep price as well,
as employers move plants closer to their workers.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides want this to work out and probably will find a
solution. But it took Riverside County's careful look at the deal to
uncover the troubling language, and that shouldn't have happened.
Good for them for getting out that magnifying glass.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Recall Moves: More Games by Lopez</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Group Sues to Block Lopez Recall Election," Dec. 13:</LD>
<LD>   Nativo Lopez, the incompetent and deceitful Santa Ana school board
member, continues the campaign to derail his recall election set for
Feb. 4. His previous attempts, such as trying to have the school
board approve $30,000 of taxpayer money to investigate the matter,
was rebuked by his colleagues after the district attorney did not
find any wrongdoing. A month ago, he convinced his cronies on the
board, Sal Tinajero and John Palacios, to approve a resolution asking
the legislators to launch an investigation into the matter.
Apparently, that request is not going anywhere. Our legislators have
much larger issues to deal with, such as the huge state budget
deficit.</LD>
<TE>   So the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund comes
to his rescue; Lopez replies that he was not aware that the lawsuit
was being drafted. Those of us who have been following his behavior
find it difficult to believe. The plaintiffs' allegations that they
were misled by the petition circulators due to their limited English
skills is a farce. How did these plaintiffs pass their citizenship
exams? They have to demonstrate how to write, speak and read English!
Also, they could vote not to recall Lopez at election time to correct
their error. Of course, I and thousands of Santa Ana residents fed up
with Nativo Lopez will vote to recall him Feb. 4 and hope he will get
the message.</TE>

<LD>Re "Yorba Linda Seeks to Rescind Development Vote," Dec. 5:</LD>
<LD>   On one hand, we have property prices skyrocketing in Orange
County, presumably due to a dearth of housing in the face of
increasing population. On the other hand, we have the Yorba Linda
City Council trying to stall the development of about 1,000 homes.
Does that make sense?</LD>
<LD>   We have to wake up and realize that the only way to stop paying
over $700,000 for a house in Yorba Linda is to build more homes, at
whatever cost. All other environmental issues can be dealt with if
development proceeds cautiously and conscientiously.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, the "Unintended Lesson of the Year" award certainly has to go
to MALDEF.</LD>
<LD>   Citizens of Santa Ana distributed petitions to recall a school
board member because of his support of bilingual education. Now
MALDEF is complaining that the petition wasn't fair because the
Latino citizens of Santa Ana aren't proficient enough in English to
understand the political process.</LD>
<LD>   So is this MALDEF's official position?: 1. Deemphasize learning
English by pushing bilingual education; then, 2. Complain and file
frivolous lawsuit because Latino citizens are not sufficiently
learned in English to participate in the political process.</LD>
<TE>   And MALDEF can't see the lesson here?</TE>

<HD>Fishy Doings Behind Big Development Plan</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County planning staff gave a big present to Rutter
Development by way of endorsing its 162-unit development plan in the
Silverado Canyon area.</LD>
<LD>   This plan, which requires major rule changes for developing the
canyons and valleys, calls for the removal of more than 1,000 oak and
sycamore trees and would allow for major changes in the grading
guidelines within the Foothill Trabuco Specific Plan. The specific
plan is the "rule book" or guideline for development within the
canyon area encompassing more than 6,000 acres of Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Imagine mass grading and the removal of oak and sycamore trees
surrounding the lands behind Cook's Corner, north on Santiago Canyon
Road and east up Live Oak Canyon Road. That is just what the county
staff is suggesting by endorsing this development plan, even though
the residents of the canyons chose to live here with the
understanding that the Foothill Trabuco Specific Plan, which was
adopted by the county and made law in 1991, would protect the area
from exactly this type of outrageous threat.</LD>
<TE>   The interesting question at this time: What did the county staff
negotiate with Rutter Development and its consultants to allow for
the amendments necessary to the Foothill Trabuco Specific Plan to
support this application? Were these concessions analyzed in the EIR,
and was the public noticed of any concessions or behind-the-scenes
deals made?</TE>

<HD>China's Production May Improve as Japan's Did</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "China's Next Challenge: Mastering the Microchip," Oct. 22:</LD>
<LD>   Letter writer Don Sheehan is doubtful that China will produce
anything more than "old" technology, naively believing that we will
always make better and cheaper models.</LD>
<LD>   I recall my experience in the '60s as I repaired cars as a way to
make money to make my way through college. My own vehicle was a 1951
Chevrolet 6-cylinder pickup. I remember seeing one of the first
Toyota trucks and lifting the hood. What I saw was a fairly precise
reproduction of the engine in my Chevy truck (which was old at the
time) and thought much the same as Sheehan, that Japan was going to
merely copy our technology.</LD>
<TE>   Anyone who is aware of what has happened since then will surely
see that now Toyota and other foreign car makers are on the cutting
edge with vehicles that include a hybrid, while American car makers
are still making huge SUVs that continue this heroin-like addiction
we have to consuming oil.</TE>
<TE>   I watch carefully what I buy and don't buy anything made in China
if I can avoid it, not because I don't think it is good technology
and getting better, but because I know that they have no respect for
the environment and are treating their workers like slaves. Of
course, I am also worried about the people in my own country, where
CEOs and politicians are selling out their own country to make money.
Don't these people have children and grandchildren? If I buy things
made in another country, I investigate the source as much as I am
able.</TE>

<LD>Dana Parsons' column "Jurors Lead the Way on the Issue of the
Mentally Ill" is a perfect example of how the public's thinking
regarding mental illness surpasses our antiquated policies in
treating them. As juror Lee Jarvis said, "Unfortunately in our
system, we don't do anything for the mentally ill."</LD>
<LD>   Orange County may eventually stem some of its needless tragedy
enumerated in Parsons' column when and if it implements Laura's Law,
AB 1421.</LD>
<LD>   This legislation, signed by Gov. Davis in September, establishes a
court-ordered, intensive community treatment program for patients who
currently go through repeated jailing and hospitalizations without
staying in treatment after they are released to the community.</LD>
<TE>   Steven Allen Abrams would have been a perfect fit for treatment
envisioned in AB1421 before he killed two children in a preschool
playground.</TE>
<TE>   Establishing AB 1421 will take political will by the Department of
Mental Health and the Board of Supervisors. The board will have to
pass a resolution implementing the law, and the department will have
to set in place -- as a priority -- a service infrastructure for
those who are often difficult to serve.</TE>

<LD>Re "YWCA in Orange to Unveil Plan to Keep Chapter Open," Dec. 15:</LD>
<LD>   The YWCA of Central Orange County has two large pieces of property
estimated to be worth nearly $3 million. Why wouldn't the board of
directors restructure their debt to pay off outstanding bills and
then develop a plan to financially stabilize the organization? It
would be like a homeowner with $5,000 in credit card debt deciding to
give away the house as long as the new homeowner promises to pay off
that debt. If Executive Director Shannon Tucker believes that the
organization has "outstayed our welcome," maybe she and the rest of
the directors who do not believe the YWCA has a place in our
community should step down.</LD>

<TE>   Let me get this straight. YWCA board President Diana Gentry and
Executive Director Shannon Tucker have spent the last 10 years
driving their organization into the ground financially. Now the
community is supposed to go along with letting them hand over $4
million worth of property, free, to an organization that offers no
local control? I haven't seen the details of Arianna Barrios' plan to
save the YWCA, but it has to beat Gentry and Tucker's giveaway plan.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Population Bomb Isn't What You Think," Nov. 17:</LD>
<LD>   Letter writer Robert T. Lynch must live in a world without facts
and certainly without reason. Sperm counts are going down, not
because of abortion but because there are too many people producing
and consuming too many toxics.</LD>
<LD>   Unemployment is going up, not because of abortion, but because the
greedy of the world are now more greedy, the power hungry seek more
power and the CEOs corrupted the process beyond comprehension.</LD>
<TE>   Tulare County, which produces more agricultural goods than any
county in the U.S., has more than 11% of its population looking for
enough food to eat each day.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of this economic disparity is not abortion, but sadly
because humans are just not very nice ... and there seem to be too
many of them on the planet already. There will come a time when one
will have to have a license to procreate, providing proof that love
and nourishment, food shelter and clothing as well, will be there for
the newborn. I think the sooner, the better.</TE>

divert $2.1 billion in taxes away from public services and into the
pockets of big-box retailers, hotel chains, car dealers and team
owners. That's 10% of property taxes squandered on corporate welfare,
including [San Diego's] $30-million seat guarantee to Chargers owner
Alex Spanos.</LD>

<LD>Re "O.C. Gang Task Force Disbanding," Nov. 26:</LD>
<LD>   As someone active in Anaheim's Gang/Drug Task Force in the early
1990s, it makes no sense to me to read about the closing of the
Regional Gang Enforcement Team, especially with the increasing gang
difficulties in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   I would encourage Orange County residents to get behind their
police chiefs, city council members and the Board of Supervisors to
continue aggressive measures against gang activities. With proper
focus and resources, this is one public problem that we can and must
win.</LD>

<LD>Re "Study Finds No Link Between MMR Vaccine and Autism," Nov. 7:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for a fair and balanced presentation regarding the
Danish study in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. about the
measles-mumps-rubella vaccine causing autism.</LD>
<LD>   At last, a news article presents those who believe vaccine injury
is real, especially Dr. Bernard Rimland, as an answer to the "party
line" hacks like Dr. Jay M. Lieberman who shudder that children may
not receive all 35 shots to protect them from such calamities as
rubella or hepatitis B.</LD>
<TE>   My son developed autism after the MMR shot 10 years ago. Today he
is cured and attends public school in the eighth grade. The diagnosis
of autism is on a medical doctor's chart, and "autism-cured" is also
in writing on a medical doctor's chart. After a TV talk show several
years ago on which my wife and Dr. Lieberman spoke about the MMR
vaccine-autism issue, I overheard Lieberman snidely remark, "We don't
really know if [my son] had autism." Well, doctor, it has been a few
years, but just so you know, he did once and doesn't now. He was
cured by my wife through the knowledge of the cause of the autism --
effects of the MMR shot, specifically the rubella portion and not
necessarily the thimerisol preservative (mercury).</TE>

<LD>Re "Tech Jobs Become State's Unwanted Big Export," Dec. 12:</LD>
<LD>   So the decline in high-paying technology jobs has left California
much worse off in terms of income than the rest of the country and is
a big reason the state faces a $30-billion-plus budget deficit.</LD>
<LD>   Do some research on the 600,000 immigrants allowed into this
country on the H-1B temporary visa. Many were allowed into the
country who were not qualified for high-tech jobs. This would be a
good time to make sure they are deported immediately to open up jobs
for those collecting unemployment. The best way of locating these
immigrants would be the DMV.</LD>
<TE>   According to the news, the H-1B visa was a bipartisan move to help
the high-tech industry keep labor costs down, in return for political
donations.</TE>

<LD>Re "Is a Law Unjust? One State May Allow Juries to Decide," Oct. 30:</LD>
<LD>   Your article regarding the "jury nullification" amendment in South
Dakota points to the increasing frustration felt by citizens,
including this reader, with the criminal justice system and the
enforcement methods of the police and courts.</LD>
<LD>   Here in Huntington Beach, the police are well known for their
aggressive enforcement of such innocuous "crimes" as street sweeping
violations, motor vehicle violations (keeps the riff-raff out of
town) and unnecessary speed traps, all of which serve little purpose
other than to act as fund-raisers for the city and keep the police
hierarchy happy. An acquaintance of mine from Australia recently
commented about how California is too "rules oriented and
restricted," meaning we enforce so many laws, often petty, that we
limit our personal freedom.</LD>
<TE>   I have had several encounters with police over the simple act of
walking my dogs. I once had a park ranger in Costa Mesa berate me for
not having my dogs on a leash -- at 7 a.m. in a wilderness park. I
got so frustrated that I stopped visiting the park.</TE>
<TE>   I've had similar, frustrating encounters at the Santa Ana river
jetty in Newport Beach. Likewise, I've had numerous incidents over
the years with police over speed traps and street sweeping
violations, which afterward left me feeling like I had just been
mugged.</TE>
<TE>   The last time I checked, the government was of the people, by the
people and for the people. So let us decide what laws we want and
whether or not they are just.</TE>

only result in leaving an individual less capable.</TE>
<TE>   What if you had a child with bad manners? Do you tell him to alter
the way his primal mood circuits operate? Or would you just give him
a prefrontal lobotomy and turn him into a vegetable? The fields of
psychiatry and neurology have yet to offer a workable solution to the
problems mentioned in the article.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Debt to Police Beyond Salary," Nov. 3:</LD>
<LD>   This article quickly developed into a misguided and inaccurate
anti-gun project. Roger Von Butow lists two experiences with guns. In
the first, he follows the sounds of gunfire to a cluster of citizens
saying, "How could this happen?" The reality that armed aggression
can happen anywhere is the primary reason a great many good, ordinary
citizens choose to arm themselves.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. John Lott, a senior research scholar at Yale University Law
School in a study with the University of Chicago, discovered that
guns are used five times as often to prevent as to commit crimes.
Thirty-one states now have laws allowing qualified citizens to carry
concealed firearms for self-defense. These states have enjoyed lower
levels of violent crimes than the general population. Mass public
shootings fall dramatically in states that pass such laws. Common
sense will tell you why.</LD>
<TE>   If I were a burglar, a rapist or a child molester, I would be the
most anti-gun person on the planet. Armed citizens are the greatest
occupational hazard for the career criminal. More than a dozen
scientific studies on both sides of the gun-control issue have
revealed that average Americans use guns to defend themselves against
criminals at least 1 million times every year, most of the time
without having to fire a single shot.</TE>

<HD>Paradoxically, a Holiday Like Pioneers Had</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christina Anthony</AU>
<BD>Christina Anthony is a freelance writer in Newport
Beach.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a daughter of Virginia, I long to return for the holidays. The
Appalachian mountains are home to my great-aunt, grandmother,
parents, sisters and nephews. But I am a Californian now, and going
home for Christmas poses some challenges. So I've decided, by letting
the airline's deadlines for decent fares and seating slip away, that
we will not make the trip. Although it hurts to miss out on
cornbread, ham biscuits and my good-natured family, the logistics,
and the risks, of air travel will keep me and mine in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   When pioneers moved west long ago, they knew they might never see
their families again. Letters, often a shared piece of precious paper
whose reply was sandwiched between the sender's lines and mailed
back, often took months to receive. Entire families grew up
subsisting on old memories and the few news items that reached them
via letters or travelers. Back then, moving a country's breadth away
often meant lifetime separation.</LD>
<LD>   I never dreamed I would experience a problem with distance. In my
public relations career, I thought no more of taking a flight than
driving from Los Angeles to San Diego -- less, actually. My family
would always be there in Virginia for me to visit, and I went home
often, at least twice a year.</LD>
<TE>   Now, though, I'm not only a daughter. I am a mother. My son, newly
5, is a child of beaches and freeways, not pine forests and roads
blazed by frontiersman Daniel Boone. As a young native of the Golden
State, he enjoys holiday tables laden with chips and salsa, soy sauce
and rice, in addition to turkey and dressing. Gatherings
traditionally synonymous with snow and ice are now celebrations
gilded with sun and sand.</TE>
<TE>   Always, I've brought him to my family's home for Christmas, but
now, at the age when memories really begin to take hold, he will not
be going.</TE>
<TE>   I've asked myself, Why not? He loves to fly, and my husband, whose
parents are gone, rarely returns to his native state. But I have my
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   My mechanically fascinated son, who could work the coffee maker
when he was 3, and recently shocked his baby-sitter by starting up
her car and trying to drive it away, is insatiably curious and
energetic.</TE>
<TE>   An airport delights him, firing all his neurons simultaneously, so
that the prospect of corralling him through long lines and possible
delays, plus a layover in Atlanta, is exhausting. Also, when I look
at his happy on-board face while he questions the flight attendants,
I feel terrible guilt at exposing him to the risks. Mechanical
failures, weather conditions, wind shear, ice on the wings, Martians
coming down from the sky ... none of the selfish reasons for putting
him on a plane can quell the fears that leap to mind.</TE>
<TE>   All this pleasure costs around $750 per family member, times
three. It's expensive to fly into a small airport for the holidays.
As late fall slid quietly by and I dithered over the decision, prices
merely climbed to unaffordable levels.</TE>
<TE>   I do admit, however hatefully and irrationally, that the terrorist
threat hovering over the U.S. has added the final weight to the other
burdens. I don't believe we would be in real danger, but there is
nothing rational about fear. Had I been a pioneer woman, I could have
shot the bandits or wild animals threatening my child. But given the
chance, I would have caved in and left the West, to raise my child in
a safer place. With shame, I realize that if a difficult and vaguely
threatening airplane trip can dissuade me from traveling, I would
have handled the journey in a covered wagon pretty badly.</TE>
<TE>   So we'll stay here for the holidays, in breezy, glossy Newport
Beach. My son will help us choose a tall tree from a nearby lot,
while I'll try not to think of the time in Virginia when I chopped
one down, lashed it to my minibike and dragged it home to my mother.
On Christmas, we'll visit our neighbors, take a ride on the Balboa
Island ferry and drive out to the mountains for a day.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent visit, my mother taught her grandson to make
cornbread, and because he's demanded it daily ever since, it will be
on our holiday table. It won't be Virginia-style, since I don't have
the proper black cast-iron skillet, but it will be her California
version, made in small cakes just right for a grandchild's hand, and
he will like it just fine.</TE>

<LD>The Triple Celebration on Dec. 7 of Hanukkah, Advent and the end of
Ramadan at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in Newport
Beach was a refreshing moment in a world racked by religious hatreds
wrapped in geopolitical grievances. Jews, Christians and Muslims
prayed, sang and ate together, even as the God of all three faiths
was weeping over the global bigotry and violence that pit
religionists against one another in so many places. Some examples:</LD>
<LD>   * A few prominent evangelical Christians recently hurled false and
hurtful epithets against Islam's founder, Muhammad.</LD>
<LD>   * Egyptian television just finished airing a 41-part series,
"Horseman Without a Horse," based in part on the "Protocols of the
Elders of Zion," a completely debunked 1890s canard claiming that
Jews have a master plan to take control of the world.</LD>
<TE>   * Two years ago the Taliban, the Islamic zealots then ruling
Afghanistan, blew up a pair of magnificent rock statues of the Buddha
at Bamian.</TE>
<TE>   * Christians have been attacked several times in the past year in
Pakistan; anti-Semitism has returned with a vengeance to Europe,
especially France.</TE>
<TE>   Add to these abuses the current persecution of Sudanese Christians
and animists by that nation's Islamist government, and China's long
suppression of Tibetan religion and, more recently, of evangelical
Christians and the Falun Gong movement. These are tragic situations
with echoes of the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Armenian and
Bosnian genocides, and the Holocaust -- to name just a few of the
evils wreaked upon one religious tradition by another.</TE>
<TE>   What might be done to stem this torrent of inter-religious abuse?
Here is an 11th commandment that the adherents of all religions ought
to consider: Do not speak or act with malice toward another's
religion. The commandment does not rule out reasoned criticism of the
actions of followers of other faiths. When one religious group
terrorizes another, when clergy abuse children sexually, or when TV
preachers dupe senior citizens with bogus appeals for funds, the
media, society at large and other people of faith need to speak out.</TE>
<TE>   The commandment is buttressed by the Golden Rule, which in one
form or another is common to all religions. If you're going to
criticize the belief or practice of another faith, do it with charity
and a consciousness of how you would like to be critiqued. Put
differently, speak about somebody else's religion only in the way you
would if he or she were present.</TE>
<TE>   In the third century BC, the great Indian philosopher-king Ashoka,
a convert to Buddhism who spread his new faith to Sri Lanka and
elsewhere, said, "The religious persuasion of others should be
respected in every way," adding, "Let all listen to one another's
dharma [teaching]."</TE>
<TE>   The Koran, so often maligned as a war-mongering scripture, also
puts it well: "And do not dispute with the People of the Book [Jews
and Christians] except in the best way, unless it be with those of
them who do wrong [presumably, those who persecute Muslims]."</TE>
<TE>   A principal reason that an event such as the Triple Celebration
could happen in the shadow of Sept. 11 and the war on terrorism is
the First Amendment's guarantee of religious freedom. We live in a
land where no one faith is privileged, where all can compete equally
for followers in the free marketplace of religious ideas. That
competition has largely been fair and uninhibited and has benefited
the various religions and the nation. Jews, Catholics, Protestants,
Muslims, Buddhists and other faith communities all have charitable
organizations that aid the poor and suffering both here and abroad.
It is a holy vying for souls that might not have been so vigorous
without the shared knowledge that the other major religions were also
seeking to care for the less fortunate.</TE>
<TE>   One of the nastiest violations of the 11th commandment is
intra-religious bigotry. James Madison was moved to fight for
religious freedom in Virginia and then the nation as a whole by the
scene of an Anglican clergyman horsewhipping a Baptist for preaching
in his home state. There has been a remarkable period of cooperation
and respect among Christians since the 1960s, but the work is not
complete; the same is true of intra-Jewish relations.</TE>
<TE>   Members of various faiths obviously disagree on matters of
religious truth, and the 11th commandment does not negate public
discussion of theological differences. What it does rule out is
stereotyping, sweeping generalizations and half-truths. The antidote
to such prejudice is unbiased study of other faiths and dialogue with
their adherents. If the world's faithful viewed an attack on any
religion as an attack on their religion, how much more peaceful the
planet might be.</TE>

<HD>These 2 Instructors Receive Plenty of Bravos</HD>
<DH>The Ventura County teachers -- married to each other -- are
nominees for the prestigious Southern California arts award.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thousand Oaks teacher Kristi Colell is up for a prestigious award in
arts education, but she swears she would be just as happy to see the
honor go to her competition.</LD>
<LD>   The other Ventura County nominee for the Los Angeles Music
Center's Bravo Award?</LD>
<LD>   Colell's husband of 34 years, Bruce, who teaches music at
Camarillo High School.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great honor," said Kristi Colell, 59, an art teacher at
Newbury Park High School. "To be a nominee is awesome. To win is
exceptional."</TE>
<TE>   The annual Bravo Award, worth $2,000, is given out each March to
one art instructor in Southern California. This year's pool of
nominees includes 32 art, music and film teachers from Ventura, Los
Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   The Colells -- a dynamic teaching duo who have co-written
musicals, performed for the pope and taken students all over the
world for arts competitions -- have been up for the award together
three times.</TE>
<TE>   This year, he was nominated by Camarillo High School Principal
Sylvia Jackson, and she by a fellow Newbury Park High School teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Colell, 62, is best known for his California Jazz Girlz
choir at Camarillo High, a group of nine young women that has won
national awards for its precise harmonies and "doo-bop-doo-wops."</TE>
<TE>   The all-girls choir evolved from an extracurricular club he
started in 1991. He met with the girls every Monday night and at
lunch twice a week for a decade, in addition to teaching a full load
of classes, until the school endorsed the enterprise as a music class
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Colell, known affectionately around campus as "Doc" because
of his PhD in music education, still arranges all the music for the
group.</TE>
<TE>   Taking jazz songs -- such as Duke Ellington's "It Don't Mean a
Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" -- he maps out the notes in a way
that gives range to a choir made up entirely of soprano voices.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to sing very complex things perfectly," Bruce Colell said.</TE>
<TE>   He gives the girls voice lessons before school, hosts more
rehearsals on his lunch hour and leads them in 45 concerts a year at
schools and around the community. Last week, the singers left on a
two-week trip to China, where they are performing at school
assemblies as part of a cultural exchange between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   The teacher's dedication doesn't go unnoticed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're like his whole life," said Camarillo High senior Krissy
Blickenstaff, 18, a member of the choir for three years.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent school day, the assembled Jazz Girlz agreed that Bruce
Colell is, by far, the best teacher any of them has ever had.</TE>
<TE>   "He's such an amazing musician," said Claire Davidson, 16. "He
makes up harmonies for us on the spot."</TE>
<TE>   "It's totally 'Mr. Holland's Opus,' " added Trine Lassen, 17,
referring to the movie starring Richard Dreyfuss as a beloved music
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   On Newbury Park High's campus, similar accolades are voiced about
Kristi Colell.</TE>
<TE>   "She really cares about the students and wants us to excel," said
senior Elaina Heathcote, 17, who is in Kristi Colell's advanced art
class. "At the same time, she lets you be free with your mind and
think for yourself."</TE>
<TE>   "She has the talent, and she explains everything so you can
understand it," said Cambria Griffith, 18. The art student then
points out her teacher's eclectic outfit: pinstripe pants and
suspenders, black stockings and platform flip-flops.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at her -- how could you not love her? She's such a
character."</TE>
<TE>   In between teaching classes at Newbury Park High, Kristi Colell
spearheaded an effort to build the school a performing arts center,
putting on seven plays a year for 10 years to help raise money for
the cause.</TE>
<TE>   The $2.1-million theater finally opened in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Getting it built, she said, "brought home the fact that the arts
are important in the community."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their dedication to the profession now, neither of the
Colells started out with a burning desire to teach. In fact, both
said they did it to pay the bills while they chased their own dreams
in art and music.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Colell wanted to write movie scores in Hollywood; Kristi
Colell wanted to become a watercolor painter in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they each landed -- separately -- at Channel Islands High
School in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   When they bumped into each other one day in the copy room, Bruce
Colell said he immediately told one of his friends, who was a
counselor at the school, "I'm going to marry that girl."</TE>
<TE>   They have lived in Camarillo ever since, raising three daughters
there. They also stay active in their church's choir, which performed
for Pope John Paul II in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   As for the Bravo Award, the Colells are hoping for a tie. But it's
fair to say neither of them will be disappointed if the other nabs
the award.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a good art teacher and a good drama teacher," Kristi Colell
said. "But Bruce -- he just gives the world to his students. I don't
know of any other teacher who deserves it as much as him."</TE>
<TE>   Funny, her husband says the same thing about her.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Planning Crisis Recalls '94 Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH>Some critics say the same flaws have arisen in the agency's
losses of $1 million a month. 'It's deja vu all over again,' says
Moorlach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A department suddenly bleeding millions of dollars. County
supervisors blindsided. Finger-pointing over who should have known
what and when.</LD>
<LD>   This has been the scene at the Orange County Planning Department,
which has lost $8 million over the last six months and in the last
two weeks has laid off 20% of its staff and proposed hefty increases
in building-permit fees.</LD>
<LD>   To some officials, the situation bears a troubling resemblance to
a calamity that county officials hoped was just a bad memory: the
1994 bankruptcy.</LD>
<TE>   That collapse, caused by risky investments by then-Treasurer
Robert L. Citron, resulted in a dramatic remaking of Orange County
government that was supposed to emphasize audits, the hiring of a
tough chief executive officer and stricter oversight of far-flung
departments.</TE>
<TE>   Now some wonder whether these reforms really worked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's deja vu all over again," said county Treasurer John M.W.
Moorlach, who raised concerns about Citron's investments before the
bankruptcy and was later appointed to replace him.</TE>
<TE>   "You find yourself asking the same questions: How did the money
disappear so fast? Where was the internal auditor? Where was the
budget analyst? There are so many lines of defense that it seems
inconceivable."</TE>
<TE>   Both the Board of Supervisors and top county executives came under
harsh criticism after the bankruptcy for not monitoring Citron
closely. In fact, supervisors often praised the treasurer for the
high returns he got on the public's money. They later discovered he
was using risky investment schemes that resulted in a $1.67-billion
loss.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach and others said the same failures are apparent eight
years later in the Planning Department.</TE>
<TE>   The planning director, Thomas B. Mathews, frequently won accolades
for the efficiency of his shop and his ability to balance the
interests of developers and environmentalists. But as the economy
cooled in recent years, revenue from building permits dropped
dramatically. Instead of cutting costs, planners predicted an uptick
in development that never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the Board of Supervisors made an emergency allocation
of $8 million to keep the department afloat. But by this month, the
department had exhausted the money and was losing up to $1 million a
month. The latest blow came Friday, when a judge ruled that the
department misspent $12 million, requiring officials to come up with
money they don't have to set things straight.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews, 57, announced his retirement last week.</TE>
<TE>   William Popejoy, the former business executive brought in to run
the county after the bankruptcy, questioned why top county officials
-- notably County Executive Officer Michael Schumacher -- didn't
intervene earlier, and why they didn't question the Planning
Department's rosy forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   "His office should have brought this to the attention of the
supervisors early on," Popejoy said. "Mike's responsibility is to
raise red flags with the supervisors and then go to the department
and start to squeeze. It's a problem of accountability. And frankly,
the buck stops with the CEO."</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher, who wouldn't comment for this story, unveiled a
recovery effort for the Planning Department last week that included a
full audit, a new interim director and the development of more
accurate forecasts.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some supervisors said they were blindsided by the problems
at the Planning Department and still believe they don't have all the
facts.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole thing should have been stopped months ago and
rectified," said Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Cynthia P. Coad.
"The community needs to stay on top of this."</TE>
<TE>   To some officials, the reforms made after the bankruptcy might
have exacerbated the problems in the Planning Department. To make the
county run more like a business, the supervisors in 1995 created the
position of CEO and ceded it much of the oversight of county
departments. Now the CEO -- not the supervisors -- directly oversees
budgeting, hiring and firing.</TE>
<TE>   The setup, which was designed to depoliticize the bureaucracy,
left department managers with more autonomy and less direct
oversight, said Shirley Grindle, a longtime campaign-finance
activist.</TE>
<TE>   Tricia Harrigan, who monitors board meetings for the League of
Women Voters, said the supervisors now face a critical choice: Either
they take back greater oversight of county departments or demand that
the CEO do more.</TE>
<TE>   "This looks to me like a failure of the CEO system," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Moorlach said the bankruptcy has focused so much attention on
investment issues that other issues go unchecked.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have the majority of your police force focusing on one
house, the burglars are going to go elsewhere," he said.</TE>

<CX>   Planning department -- Two stories in the California section about
the Orange County Planning Department's financial problems contained
inaccuracies. An article Saturday incorrectly reported that the
department may have to place $10 million in planning fees into a
special fund until a judge rules whether the money was properly
spent. In fact, the money will be put into the fund permanently if a
judge rules that it was spent improperly. A story Sunday reported
incorrectly that a judge has ruled that the department misspent $12
million from a fund containing building permit fees. The judge has
not yet ruled on the issue.</CX>

<LD>Police were puzzled in their investigation of a double murder at a
North Long Beach home: Gunfire was reported there Saturday morning,
but officers discovered the two victims had died hours earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Long Beach Police Sgt. Paul LeBaron said evidence at the home
indicated Richard Smith, 19, and Kendall Adams, 19, both of Long
Beach, had been slain long before the 9 a.m. telephone call reporting
shots fired at the home in the 800 block of East South Street.</LD>
<LD>   LeBaron said both victims had multiple gunshot wounds, and the two
are believed to be related.</LD>

<HD>New Clerk Already on the Clock</HD>
<DH>Daly takes the job three weeks early, partly because of the
year-end rush of property deals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Seema Mehta</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly took office three weeks early, becoming
the county's clerk-recorder last week through special appointment by
the Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Daly, whom voters elected to the post in November, will be sworn
in Jan. 6. But supervisors voted 3 to 1 Tuesday to appoint Daly
interim clerk-recorder until he officially takes office.</LD>
<LD>   The department handles vital county documents, including birth
certificates, marriage licenses and records of property transactions.</LD>
<TE>   The position was held by Gary L. Granville until he died in
February. Clerk of the Board Darlene Bloom had been doing both jobs
ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said a number of factors drove his desire to take office
early. They include an annual year-end rush of property transactions,
proposed state legislation that could change how the county uses
electronic systems and effects of the state budget deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anxious to begin making decisions," he said. "It's a small
part of county government, but to the real estate industry and people
who use the department, it's very important."</TE>
<TE>   Daly said he hopes to build upon Granville's accomplishments.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to honor the standards set by Mr. Granville in terms of
customer service and efficiency and innovation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew Gary before he was elected and I heard him talk about
changes he wanted to make. And, by golly, he made them. He was very
committed, very focused. There's no question that he made a
difference."</TE>
<TE>   One major change that Granville pushed through was the merger of
the clerk's department and the recorder's office in 1995. Other
California counties go further by combining their registrars of
voters and assessors with the clerk-recorder's office.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said he too would "be mindful of potential cost savings and
efficiencies that might come about via consolidations."</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious target for merger would be the beleaguered county
registrar's office, which failed to tally nearly 8,000 absentee
ballots in the last election, delaying the certification of results.
The registrar has been embarrassed by a series of errors in recent
years, including incorrect sample ballots, mislabeled candidates and
political parties, improper Vietnamese translation, missing fiscal
analyses in voter pamphlets and precincts running out of Spanish
ballots on election day.</TE>
<TE>   Daly said he will have to study the offices more before deciding
whether he favors a merger.</TE>
<TE>   Daly won his early appointment from a divided board.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Supervisor Cynthia P. Coad, in her last meeting before
her term ended, voted against the appointment. She called the move a
"sweetheart deal that flaunts public policy" by allowing Daly to take
office early and collect three additional weeks of pay and a month of
health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "This unnecessary action is tantamount to a gift of public funds,"
she said. "The fact that the clerk-recorder-elect would even consider
accepting such a gift does not bode well for the future management of
the department."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Tom Wilson and Jim Silva said they saw no problem in
allowing an elected official to fill a vacant position, and
Supervisor Chuck Smith added that he wanted to give Bloom a respite
in time for the holidays.</TE>

<HD>A Field Trip to Magic World of the 'Nutcracker'</HD>
<DH>A Malibu performance society sows creative seeds for kids
who might otherwise miss out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Julie Tamaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nancy Amezquita, a second-grader from Oxnard, was brimming with
visions of shimmering snowflakes fluttering to life and a rugged
nutcracker soldier springing to action.</LD>
<LD>   That's just what the folks from the Malibu Ballet and Performing
Arts Society had hoped.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a chance to bring dance into the lives of children from
all walks of life," said Lisa Simon, program director for a
performance of "The Nutcracker" staged for 900 schoolchildren. "It
allows them to be inspired by dance, even if they don't have the
opportunity to try it themselves."</LD>
<TE>   Simon is one of dozens of volunteers who help the nonprofit
society stage ballets and other dances to educate the public,
especially schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to parents, many volunteers are like Simon's
11-year-old daughter, Sarah-Jayne -- youngsters who want to share
their passion for dance with other kids by performing or helping with
productions.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteer Emma Ritchie, 15, who studied ballet for five years,
helped craft a written version of "The Nutcracker" story so children
watching the ballet for the first time would be able to follow the
action.</TE>
<TE>   The booklet, which was illustrated by two other students, tells
the tale of Tchaikovsky's ballet, in which a young girl named Clara
receives a wooden nutcracker as a Christmas gift and dreams that
night that the doll has come to life. Together, Clara and the
Nutcracker Prince defeat a wicked Mouse King and tour a collection of
magical places. Clara wakes from the dream a young woman.</TE>
<TE>   Emma's mom, Denise, another parent volunteer, recruited Sandy
Reisz, manager of the Malibu Starbucks, to edit the text and more.
Reisz, accompanied by several dancers in costume, traveled to schools
chosen to attend the abridged version of the ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Reisz read key scenes to the children while the dancers
demonstrated ballet positions.</TE>
<TE>   "A ballet, to a child who has never seen one before, might be
confusing," said Reisz, as she waited to give her presentation to a
gym filled with second-graders at Manzanita Elementary School in
Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   "It's following a story only through music and movement, so I get
to teach them a story they'll see in a different art form."</TE>
<TE>   "Being able to share what I love with kids to make them happy is
an extraordinary thing," added Emma, dressed in the red satin jacket
she would wear the next week when appearing in the ballet's tea
dance.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, appearances like the one staged for the
schoolchildren allow the dancers to gain more experience performing
before an audience. Many of the students also have danced at
fund-raising events staged by other nonprofits that raise money for
cancer and cystic fibrosis research.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful of what it's like to raise money, they performed for free.</TE>
<TE>   "We've found in our fund-raising that the major problem is that
you spend money to make money," said JoAnna Jarvis, who founded the
society 24 years ago and serves as its artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   The society operates on a budget of a little more than $100,000 a
year from private individuals and others.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the volunteer hours that Reisz and 10 other Starbucks
employees spent working on "The Nutcracker" will result in a $1,000
grant from Starbucks to the society.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine University offered the use of Smothers Theater for the
two performances and buses to take schoolchildren from Los Angeles
and Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Corral, Nancy's teacher at Marina West Elementary in
Oxnard, described the free bus rides as a rare luxury, given tight
school budgets.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of them are from low-income families and they don't get
much of a chance to travel outside of Oxnard -- or Ventura County,
for that matter," Corral said.</TE>
<TE>   When the ballet began, eyes widened and jaws dropped open as an
ornate Christmas tree quadrupled in size.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the nutcracker sprang to life and led an army of toy
soldiers outfitted in red satin jackets and white satin pants and
armed with red wooden swords. The battle against throngs of dancing
mice ensued.</TE>
<TE>   A chorus of oohs and ahs filled the auditorium as an ensemble of
candy cane dancers -- girls dressed in white leotards covered with
rings of red sequins -- took the stage with props that appeared to be
red hula hoops. Moments later, a troupe of glittering human
snowflakes, wearing white bodices and tulle skirts dotted with
crystals, glided about on their toes.</TE>
<TE>   A flurry of artificial snowflakes then began to fall. More oohs
and ahs.</TE>
<TE>   "It was beautiful," said Nancy, who had seen "The Nutcracker" once
before. "My favorite part was when the girls with the white dresses
came on. They looked like snowflakes."</TE>
<TE>   "They were very quiet, so they must have liked it," said her
mother, Gloria Amezquita, who attended the performance with Nancy's
class.</TE>
<TE>   After the 30-minute program, Jarvis fielded questions: How did the
Christmas tree grow? How old were the dancers? And how was the
Nutcracker Prince able to slip out of his mask without leaving the
stage?</TE>
<TE>   A key detail confounding another child concerned the candy cane
dancers. They showed they could dance, but did they know how to
hula-hoop?</TE>
<TE>   The lead candy cane dancer, Emmanuelle Stahler, quickly tossed her
hula hoop around her neck and began to twirl -- filling the theater
with more oohs, ahs, cheers and applause.</TE>

<HD>Computer Lab Offers Training to Youths</HD>

<LD>The technological lifeline for many an American teenager -- Internet
chat rooms, buddy lists, downloading MP3s -- is still a novelty for a
group of high school students who only recently learned how to
navigate the World Wide Web.</LD>
<LD>   "There are really teenagers out there who do not have access to
computers," said teacher Kathy Masaoka of the All People's Branch of
Central High School, a small continuation school in the Los Angeles
Unified School District.</LD>
<LD>   "When people say the digital divide is no longer a problem, that
is not absolutely true."</LD>
<TE>   But after seven weeks of computer training through a program
offered by the Little Tokyo Service Center, seven of Masaoka's 15
students not only learned about search engines and high-speed DSL
lines, they also created their own Web sites and earned enough
computer credits to satisfy a graduation requirement.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that computers have reached deep into our world, but it's
something I don't have at home," said Jose Sotelo, 16.</TE>
<TE>   "In this class, they really took time to show us how to use
computers and all the information available to us."</TE>
<TE>   Masaoka and co-teacher Tony Osumi operate their one-classroom
school at All People's Christian Center near downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   They have only one computer with Internet access that is "nearly
useless" because the modem is so slow, Osumi said.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers had to find a way for their students, all youths who
left or dropped out of regular high schools, to earn 10 computer
credits to meet Los Angeles Unified's graduation requirements.</TE>
<TE>   And they knew it wasn't going to happen on their one antiquated
computer.</TE>
<TE>   This year, they joined in a partnership with the Little Tokyo
Service Center, less than two miles from their school, to use its
computer lab to teach the needed skills.</TE>
<TE>   The center received a $15,000 grant from last year's Times Holiday
Campaign to launch the program, which they hope to continue for
another year.</TE>
<TE>   "Think of everything that goes on with your computer at work, at
home and at college," Osumi said. "That world has not been open to
them until now."</TE>
<TE>   The Little Tokyo center on East 3rd Street provides social
services, counseling, translation and transportation services for
Japanese Americans, Asians and Pacific Islanders, as well as the
diverse communities of central and downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The computer lab is well used at the center by senior citizens and
youths who live in the nearby affordable housing units.</TE>
<TE>   The computer banks and study kiosks also provide a comfortable
room for supervised after-school programs.</TE>
<TE>   During this holiday season, The Times is featuring programs that
have benefited from the Holiday Campaign.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50 groups shared the $653,000 collected last year.</TE>

<HD>Operator of Homeless Shelter Indicted</HD>
<DH>Rev. Toney Chisum Jr. is accused of fraudulent billing. He
blames an error that was corrected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jocelyn Y. Stewart</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One day three years ago, FBI agents showed up at a homeless shelter
at 87th and Broadway armed with a search warrant. They also visited a
homeless shelter on Western Avenue. And another on Norton Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   By day's end, the agents had carted away records from the shelters
run by the American Philanthropy Assn., a community service
organization with a long history of assisting the poor.</LD>
<LD>   Last month, the Rev. Toney Chisum Jr., president of the
philanthropy association, was accused in a federal indictment of
conspiracy to unlawfully obtain more than $500,000 from the federal
government, a charge the pastor denies.</LD>
<TE>   The indictment accuses Chisum and a former staff member, Terry Lee
Rhodes, of making false claims to the government, false statements
and theft of government property -- the $245,000 that the association
shelters received from the city homeless authority from 1996 to 1998.
Chisum is out of jail on $25,000 bond. Rhodes, who had been homeless
and managed all three shelters, has posted bail of $10,000 and also
denies the charges.</TE>
<TE>   How a small-time shelter operator in South Los Angeles ended up
the target of an FBI investigation baffles Chisum and his supporters.
They say an innocent mistake -- a billing error -- has given birth to
a nightmare.</TE>
<TE>   The alleged crimes date to 1996, when Chisum participated in the
Winter Shelter Program. The program, administered by the Los Angeles
Homeless Services Authority, operates with federal money and provides
free emergency shelter on the coldest and wettest nights of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Shelter operators must log the number of homeless people provided
room and board. They are reimbursed by the homeless authority based
on the number of names on the logs.</TE>
<TE>   According to the indictment, Chisum instructed Rhodes to submit
fraudulent logs.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a variety of issues, some relayed to us by clients,
that led us to alert the federal government that this agency should
be investigated," said Mitchell Netburn, executive director of the
homeless authority.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment says the shelter charged some winter shelter
participants and submitted names of fictitious people.</TE>
<TE>   The log stated that a woman with the initials D.D. and her four
children resided at an American Philanthropy Assn. shelter in January
and February 1997. A resident with the initials L.B. allegedly stayed
at the shelter for free in February 1998.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, prosecutors allege, the two women paid. The log also
includes the names of a Michael Pierce and Jarka or Jaka Peel,
allegedly fictitious shelter users.</TE>
<TE>   Chisum learned of the allegations in letters sent to him by the
homeless authority in 1999, he said. He searched his records and
discovered a problem. In addition to taking part in the free Winter
Shelter Program, his group runs a shelter program for which it
charges a nominal fee.</TE>
<TE>   Service providers said the practice of charging among smaller
shelter operators is common.</TE>
<TE>   Two residents who were in the Winter Shelter Program were billed
in error, Chisum said. "When we discovered that, we admitted that and
we wanted to make restitution," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to Chisum, a $2,000 overpayment was taken out of future
reimbursements from the homeless authority, which then ended its
funding of American Philanthropy Assn. programs.</TE>
<TE>   Until the FBI agents showed up three years ago, Chisum said, his
staff thought the matter was resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "What did we do to deserve this?" Chisum asked. "Was the
[accusation] strong enough to have the FBI go to ... all our shelters
and get access to all our papers? Twenty-five years in the community
doing service and they drag our name through the mud."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Andrew Cowan said the investigation was
sparked by the very people that Chisum purported to help.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the homeless people complained to the Community
Development Department, and they contacted the FBI," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chisum's attorney, William Grayson, declined to comment and
advised the pastor to cease conversations with reporters.</TE>
<TE>   In the community he serves, Chisum, 66, is well known for helping
needy people and for working hard to keep his shelters open. The
Crenshaw resident is also pastor of New Direction Christian Church,
which is next to one of his shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. James Mays, a former commissioner with the Los Angeles
Homeless Services Authority, said the pastor has motivated scores of
homeless women to turn their lives around.</TE>
<TE>   "Rev. Chisum knows the streets," Mays said. "He knows the
situation and he uses the inspiration of religion to fortify the
young ladies."</TE>
<TE>   Boxing promoter Don King was so impressed with the shelter's work
that during a visit he wrote the association a check for $100,000,
Mays said. The shelter now bears his name.</TE>
<TE>   For some service providers, the case sheds light on the
difficulties faced by those attempting to provide shelter for the
needy in South Los Angeles. Shelters are often ill-funded, and those
that receive assistance must suffer through long waits for
reimbursement checks, advocates said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very difficult program to run," said Godfrey Ekeke.
"That's the reason I withdrew -- they don't pay on time."</TE>
<TE>   Since losing Winter Shelter funding, Chisum has continued to
operate. "We have never stopped serving," he said.</TE>

<HD>Tijuana Uses Judges to Fight Police Corruption</HD>
<DH>The city adds jurists, employs night court to rein in
overzealous and crooked officers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anna Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TIJUANA</DL>
<LD>Many of this border city's police officers have a notorious history
of teaming up with drug dealers, accepting bribes and intimidating
tourists.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders have tried to combat corruption in the past by firing
officers and raising salaries.</LD>
<LD>   In their latest attempt to rein in overzealous and crooked law
enforcement, city officials have moved to separate the police and
judicial departments.</LD>
<TE>   The initiative by Mayor Jesus Gonzalez Reyes is designed to stop
police from meting out justice in the streets and to prevent officers
from having undue influence over the outcome of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez also has increased the number of courtrooms so cases can
be heard more quickly, and has given judges new powers that allow
them to mediate neighborhood disputes before they evolve into more
serious problems.</TE>
<TE>   Though Tijuana's city judges have been around for a decade, only
last year did they become truly independent from police officers,
when Gonzalez moved them out of the public safety department and put
them under new management.</TE>
<TE>   Human-rights activists say city judges may have helped reduce
extortion and bribery somewhat because they question the word of
police officers. But most judicial watchdogs say much more needs to
be done.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an important effort, but it's not enough," said Victor
Clark, a professor and director of Tijuana's private Binational
Center for Human Rights. "Corruption is still a major problem. How do
you break the vicious circle of corruption of the policemen who are
linked to all these activities?"</TE>
<TE>   Clark said he has heard of police officers threatening judges,
many of whom are young and do not have much experience with city
government.</TE>
<TE>   There are 56 judges working in 16 courtrooms throughout Tijuana.
Nine of the courts are open all night. The judges' hours are
especially helpful for tourists who cross the border to dance and
drink at Tijuana's bars and end up under arrest, police officers
said.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, "if the judge was out fishing, we waited," and so did
the suspects, said Tijuana Police Officer Ricardo Acosta.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Alejandro Mendoza's courthouse is a one-room office next to
the city jail, sparsely decorated with not much more than a desk and
a few chairs. Just before midnight on Friday the 13th, a long line of
suspects waited to see him. Posted on the wall was a list of their
rights, including the rights to make a phone call and to receive
necessary medical care.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza called each suspect, one by one, into his informal
courtroom, where Officer Francisco Silva Garcia explained the
arrests. Mendoza rattled off a list of questions to three men accused
of possession of marijuana paraphernalia: Do you use drugs? Do you
drink? Why did you have the paraphernalia? Who sold you the
marijuana? Have you been arrested before?</TE>
<TE>   After hearing their cases, the judge released two and ordered one
to pay a $42 fine or serve 36 hours behind bars. Mendoza also fined
several other men, including one arrested for disorderly conduct.</TE>
<TE>   If judges kept traditional hours, Mendoza said, several hundred
people arrested for minor crimes would be waiting through the weekend
for court Monday morning. "The people know if they are falsely
detained, they will be released as quickly as possible," said
Mendoza, who works from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. every other night.</TE>
<TE>   Not all officers have adjusted to judges who doubt the legitimacy
of their arrests. Officer Acosta said the system can undermine their
authority. "You try to do a job, and it can become a little
troublesome if the judge releases somebody," he said.</TE>
<TE>   To be a judge, applicants must have law degrees and five years of
legal experience and must pass an exam. The judges rule only on minor
crimes such as disturbing the peace and urinating in public. They
refer felony cases to the state district attorney's office. Judges
also mediate neighborhood disputes and resolve traffic ticket
appeals.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Alejandro Cachu Ortiz, who is stationed at the courtroom
closest to the United States, said crime in Tijuana has increased
since the U.S. beefed up its border patrol in recent years. Mexican
nationals who continue to arrive in the city from elsewhere now
become stuck and often steal or sell drugs to support themselves,
Cachu said.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Le Venant Martinez spent Friday the 13th patrolling
downtown, cruising past bars such as Tropical and Lucky Lady and
watching for fights and drunks.</TE>
<TE>   About 9 p.m., he drove to a canal that divides the U.S. and
Mexico. The spot known as "no man's land" is infamous for its heroin
addicts and dealers. As Martinez sped up in his patrol car, several
men took off running, barely visible against the darkness. The ones
left were the migrants, waiting for the right time to try crossing
the border.</TE>
<TE>   About 2 a.m., several officers rushed to the scene of a collision
of two taxis. One driver was traveling the wrong way on a one-way
street and crashed into another who was stopped alongside a curb with
two passengers. The passengers were taken to a hospital and the
wrong-way driver was arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Later at a courtroom near the center of town, the driver nervously
rocked back and forth on his feet in front of Judge Juan Manuel Perez
Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   Perez asked a few questions and then ordered the driver to an
adjacent doctor's office, where he failed a sobriety test.</TE>
<TE>   Deciding the suspect likely faced more than a misdemeanor, Judge
Perez sent the case to the district attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   Just before 3 a.m., Acosta arrived at Perez's courtroom with two
American teenagers, who were picked up during a scuffle at the Aloha
Bar on Avenida Revolucion. Acosta said the teenagers were disobeying
officers' orders, a minor crime that could result in an $84 fine.
After speaking with the youths, Perez decided not to fine them and
then asked Acosta to escort them to the border.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said that Americans often get drunk and out of control in
the city, but that he wasn't sure what had happened in the case of
the two youths. He decided it was easiest just to send them home,
saying tourists need to be more respectful when they visit Tijuana.
"We're trying to do a hard job here. Help us out," Acosta said as
they returned to his patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   Perez said police bring an average of 130 people to his courtroom
each night, including about 10 Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Mendoza said that he knows the system isn't perfect, but
that he and the other judges are trying to make sure people are
treated fairly. "And it's better if we're on the job 24 hours a day,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Frederick Knott, 86; Wrote 'Dial M for Murder,' 'Wait Until
Dark'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elaine Woo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frederick Knott, a playwright whose short but admirable string of
credits included two long-running Broadway shows -- "Dial M for
Murder" in 1952 and "Wait Until Dark" in 1966 -- died of undisclosed
causes Tuesday at his home in New York City. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Knott wrote only three plays, but all were successful.</LD>
<LD>   "Dial M" was a thriller about a woman who slowly comes to realize
that her husband is plotting her death. It was an immediate hit in
London, then ran for 552 performances on Broadway, with Maurice Evans
in the lead. Director Alfred Hitchcock turned it into spine-tingling
cinema two years later with a cast led by Ray Milland, Grace Kelly
and Robert Cummings.</LD>
<TE>   "Wait Until Dark" ran for 373 performances on Broadway before
moving to the London stage for an even longer engagement. The
Broadway production starred Lee Remick as a blind woman pursued by
criminals who think she possesses a doll concealing a cache of drugs.
Her performance earned a Tony nomination. In the 1967 movie, directed
by Terence Young, Audrey Hepburn played the woman while Alan Arkin
was the lead henchman who terrorized her.</TE>
<TE>   Knott's third play, "Write Me a Murder," also reflected his
fascination with homicidal themes. Revolving around a writer and her
lover who plot a murder, it ran for 25 weeks on Broadway in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   Knott, the son of Quaker missionaries, was born in Hankow, China,
in 1916. Sent to England for his education, he graduated from
Cambridge University in 1938, then served in the Royal Artillery
during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he was struggling to make a living as a
screenwriter when he decided to try his hand at writing a play. He
gave himself a year to write one, but took 18 months instead and
wound up nearly broke. The end result, however, was "Dial M for
Murder," whose suspense turns not on what the murder plan is and who
will execute it but whether it will actually work.</TE>
<TE>   "I was always intrigued with the idea that somebody would plan a
crime, and then you see that everything doesn't turn out right,"
Knott, who won an Edgar Allan Poe Award for the play, told the
Baltimore Sun in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "You can plan a murder in great detail and then put the plan into
action, and invariably something goes wrong and then you have to
improvise. And in the improvisation you trip up and make a very big
mistake."</TE>
<TE>   But when Knott shopped the manuscript around to theatrical
managers, he got only rejections. He was ready to lock it away in a
drawer when a friend told him the BBC was hungry for new material.
The BBC wound up producing Knott's play for television, where it was
seen by London producer James P. Sherwood.</TE>
<TE>   Sherwood had just lost a play, but still had a theater to fill.
After just three weeks of rehearsal, he opened "Dial M" in London to
rave reviews. It set off a bidding war among American producers, and
Hollywood also called.</TE>
<TE>   Knott wound up selling the film rights for only $2,800. Hitchcock
was chosen to direct, and invited Knott to Hollywood to adapt the
play for the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years later, "Dial M for Murder" is still performed around
the world, a standard of summer stock and school plays.</TE>
<TE>   After "Dial M," Knott did not intend to write another suspense
play. "I don't want to get into a rut," he told an interviewer in
1952 after "Dial M" opened on Broadway. His muse was stuck on murder,
however.</TE>
<TE>   But he basically hated writing and wrote only for the money, his
wife, Ann Hillary Knott, told the New York Times. He had plotted out
in his mind two other plays -- one about an elderly couple confronted
by a gang, and the other about a brothel. But he never committed one
word of either play to paper, despite numerous offers of advances
over the years.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife, Knott is survived by a son, Dr. Anthony
Frederick Knott of Kayenta, Ariz., and two grandsons.</TE>

<HD>Political Parity Is Growing for Ventura County Latinos</HD>
<DH>Elected officeholders have more than doubled since 1990 as
the area changes from a white farming region to racially mixed
suburbia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than two decades ago, the City Council in the farm town of
Fillmore adopted a resolution declaring English the official
language, angering many in the mostly Latino city. Today, most
council members are Latino, and the resolution has been wiped off the
books.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen years ago, not a single school board in Ventura County had
a Latino majority, despite Latino enrollment in some districts
topping 50%. Now a quarter of the county's 20 school boards are
mostly Latino, and a quarter of all school board seats countywide are
held by Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard City Council had just one Latino councilman in 1990,
even though half the population in the county's largest city was
Latino. In a historic shift of power earlier this month, voters
installed a Latino majority on the panel for the first time in the
city's 100-year history.</LD>
<TE>   These are the latest measures of the march toward political parity
for Ventura County Latinos, who since 1990 have pushed for greater
representation on city councils and school boards.</TE>
<TE>   The recent election brought new Latino council seats in Fillmore,
Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Thousand Oaks. Latinos also picked up school
board seats in Ojai, Oxnard, Camarillo and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the number of Latino officeholders has more than
doubled since 1990 -- from 16 to 38 -- as the county continues its
transformation from a white farming region to a racially mixed
suburban area.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows that the Latino community itself is becoming
more involved in the electoral process," said Ventura resident David
Rodriguez, California vice president for the League of United Latin
American Citizens. "But I also think it shows that Latino elected
officials have broad constituencies and have been able to win support
from Hispanic and non-Hispanic voters."</TE>
<TE>   That growing political clout has taken root across the state and
nation.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana City Council gained its first Latino majority in the
November election, two decades after the city's Latino population
achieved majority status.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, Latinos now make up about one-fifth of the 120-member
Legislature, picking up half a dozen seats last month. Across the
country, voters elected an additional 13 Latino state lawmakers,
while adding three Latinos to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates say they were able to win not only by mobilizing Latino
support but by making their case to a broad cross-cultural audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just another aspect of my being a candidate," newly
elected Ojai school board member Pauline Mercado said of her Latino
roots. "Just like my being a volunteer, my being a mom and my being
an educator."</TE>
<TE>   Although she had been active in the community, Mercado had never
before run for political office. But as the mother of a 12-year-old
daughter and a professor of education at Cal State L.A., she believed
she could contribute to the school system.</TE>
<TE>   Like other newcomers, however, she says that her candidacy was not
about advancing a so-called Latino agenda. It was about pursuing
interests -- good schools, capable students -- important to the
community as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to look for common denominators, and I think the
largest common denominator for me is being a parent," Mercado said.</TE>
<TE>   While more Latinos are finding their way into office, community
leaders say more needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   There is still not a Latino in Congress, the state Senate or the
Assembly representing Ventura County. And no Latino has been elected
to the county Board of Supervisors since Adolfo Camarillo held a seat
near the turn of the last century.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Casillas, dean of economic development and community
initiatives at Oxnard College, said the political landscape for local
Latinos is much as it was in south Texas decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   In big cities and small towns, Latinos made up overwhelming
majorities but held few elected positions. That changed when they
took political power into their own hands by launching voter
registration drives and running their own for office.</TE>
<TE>   "The gains we have made in the political arena are a reflection of
the desire on the part of Latinos and Latino leaders to establish
some self-determination," Casillas said.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean it's all about separatist politics where
Latinos are trying to take over the universe. It just means Latinos
are finally starting to lead themselves and their communities."</TE>
<TE>   Often when Latinos talk about leading their communities, talk
turns to the 5th District supervisorial seat held by John Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   Under threat of a lawsuit by a voting-rights coalition, the
boundaries of Flynn's Oxnard-area district were redrawn in the early
1990s to make it the only one of five with a Latino majority. But no
Latino has come close to toppling the venerable politician, whose
hands-on, door-to-door approach to campaigning and problem-solving
has won him solid support.</TE>
<TE>   Still, recent clashes between Flynn and some Latino leaders may
foreshadow the bare-knuckle political brawl likely to erupt should
Flynn choose to run for an eighth four-year term in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn has feuded publicly with Oxnard Elementary School District
Supt. Richard Duarte and Rio Elementary School District Supt. Yolanda
Benitez. Both supported Flynn's Latino challenger in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Flynn has butted heads with Irma Lopez, the wife of
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez and an influential Democratic fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez filed a police report last summer accusing Flynn of verbally
threatening her at a Democratic Party barbecue. He later upset Latino
leaders by saying Lopez "won't be happy until she sees a sea of brown
faces in every political office in west Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   Among those mentioned as potential challengers to Flynn are
Benitez, Manuel Lopez and Ventura County Community College District
trustee Art Hernandez, who won reelection last month to a seat that
represents much of the same area as Flynn's district. Benitez says
she won't run, while Lopez and Hernandez are noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Flynn eventually apologized for the "brown faces"
comment, he has denied threatening Lopez and holds to his belief that
she and a handful of others want to fill his seat with a Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn hasn't committed to seeking another term. But if he runs
again, he expects Latino voters to continue to support him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about that group," Flynn said of his detractors.
"My decision to run or not [depends] on whether or not I feel I've
done my job."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than anything, the 5th District rift may end the myth
that Latinos are a homogenous group. Latino leaders say too many
people still believe that Latinos are a single-minded voting bloc,
when in reality they are as varied in their backgrounds, political
views and voting habits as other Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, newly elected Pleasant Valley Elementary School
District trustee John Alamillo.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in predominantly white Camarillo, the 42-year-old
general contractor said he focused little on his roots, even though
his grandparents were from Mexico and his father was involved in
cultural affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really put that much thought into it," Alamillo said.
"I've never really seen myself as fully part of the Latino
community."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, newly elected Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Claudia Bill-de
la Pena said she won her seat by running on a slow-growth,
environmental platform.</TE>
<TE>   "Cultural background or ethnic background shouldn't matter," said
Bill-de la Pena, who recently learned she was only the second Latino
to hold a council seat in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think voters in Thousand Oaks made their decisions based
on my last name," she said. "I think they voted for me based on my
qualifications."</TE>
<TE>   That can be a difficult balancing act.</TE>
<TE>   Some Latino leaders believe their qualifications are more likely
to be called into question and that Latino candidates have to be more
qualified than their rivals to win office.</TE>
<TE>   But Fillmore Mayor Evaristo Barajas said he believes that is
changing, especially as more Latinos prove they can do the job.</TE>
<TE>   Barajas, who was elected to the council in 1996 three decades
after moving to Ventura County from his native Mexico, was among
those who led the effort to abolish the city's anti-Spanish language
resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In an ironic twist, he said an effort is now underway to provide
all materials at City Hall in English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was inevitable that change would happen," Barajas
said. "In this last election [which gave Latinos a council majority],
there was no mention of race. It was all about who was the most
qualified candidate. It just so happened that one of the most
qualified candidates was Latino."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Changes in the halls of power</TE>
<TE>   Latino representation on Ventura County city councils has steadily
risen from three in 1990 to 11 today. But there are still no Latino
members of the county Board of Supervisors.</TE>

<HD>Area Latino Political Clout Grows</HD>
<DH>Elected officeholders have more than doubled since 1990 as
Ventura County changes from a white farming region to racially mixed
suburbia.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Fred Alvarez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than two decades ago, the City Council in the farm town of
Fillmore adopted a resolution declaring English the official
language, angering many in the mostly Latino city. Today, most
council members are Latino, and the resolution has been wiped off the
books.</LD>
<LD>   A dozen years ago, not a single school board in Ventura County had
a Latino majority, despite Latino enrollment in some districts
topping 50%. Now a quarter of the county's 20 school boards are
mostly Latino and a quarter of all school board seats countywide are
held by Latinos.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard City Council had just one Latino councilman in 1990,
even though half the population in the county's largest city was
Latino. In a historic shift of power earlier this month, voters
installed a Latino majority on the panel for the first time in the
city's 100-year history.</LD>
<TE>   These are the latest measures of the march toward political parity
for Ventura County Latinos, who since 1990 have pushed for greater
representation on city councils and school boards.</TE>
<TE>   The recent election brought new Latino council seats in Fillmore,
Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Thousand Oaks. Latinos also picked up school
board seats in Ojai, Oxnard, Camarillo and Santa Paula.</TE>
<TE>   Taken together, the number of Latino officeholders has more than
doubled since 1990 -- from 16 to 38 -- as the county continues its
transformation from a white farming region to a racially mixed
suburban area.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it shows that the Latino community itself is becoming
more involved in the electoral process," said Ventura resident David
Rodriguez, California vice president for the League of United Latin
American Citizens. "But I also think it shows that Latino elected
officials have broad constituencies and have been able to win support
from Hispanic and non-Hispanic voters."</TE>
<TE>   That growing political clout has taken root across the state and
nation.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana City Council gained its first Latino majority in the
November election, two decades after the city's Latino population
achieved majority status.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, Latinos now make up about one-fifth of the 120-member
Legislature, picking up half a dozen seats last month. Across the
country, voters elected an additional 13 Latino state lawmakers,
while adding three Latinos to Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates say they were able to win not only by mobilizing Latino
support but by making their case to a broad cross-cultural audience.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just another aspect of my being a candidate," newly
elected Ojai school board member Pauline Mercado said of her Latino
roots. "Just like my being a volunteer, my being a mom and my being
an educator."</TE>
<TE>   Although she had been active in the community, Mercado had never
before run for political office. But as the mother of a 12-year-old
daughter and a professor of education at Cal State L.A., she believed
she could contribute to the school system.</TE>
<TE>   Like other newcomers, however, she says her candidacy was not
about advancing a so-called Latino agenda. It was about pursuing
interests -- good schools, capable students -- important to the
community as a whole.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you have to look for common denominators, and I think the
largest common denominator for me is being a parent," Mercado said.</TE>
<TE>   While more Latinos are finding their way into office, community
leaders say more needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   There is still not a Latino in Congress, the state Senate or the
Assembly representing Ventura County. And no Latino has been elected
to the county Board of Supervisors since Adolfo Camarillo held a seat
near the turn of the last century. Jaime Casillas, dean of economic
development and community initiatives at Oxnard College, said the
political landscape for local Latinos is much as it was in south
Texas decades ago.</TE>
<TE>   In big cities and small towns, Latinos made up overwhelming
majorities but held few elected positions. That changed when they
took political power into their own hands by launching voter
registration drives and running their own for office.</TE>
<TE>   "The gains we have made in the political arena are a reflection of
the desire on the part of Latinos and Latino leaders to establish
some self-determination," Casillas said.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't mean it's all about separatist politics where
Latinos are trying to take over the universe. It just means Latinos
are finally starting to lead themselves and their communities."</TE>
<TE>   Often when Latinos talk about leading their communities, talk
turns to the 5th District supervisorial seat held by John Flynn.</TE>
<TE>   Under threat of a lawsuit by a voting-rights coalition, the
boundaries of Flynn's Oxnard-area district were redrawn in the early
1990s to make it the only one of five with a Latino majority. But no
Latino has come close to toppling the venerable politician, whose
hands-on, door-to-door approach to campaigning and problem-solving
has won him solid support.</TE>
<TE>   Still, recent clashes between Flynn and some Latino leaders may
foreshadow the bare-knuckle political brawl likely to erupt should
Flynn choose to run for an eighth four-year term in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn has feuded publicly with Oxnard Elementary School District
Supt. Richard Duarte and Rio Elementary School District Supt. Yolanda
Benitez. Both supported Flynn's Latino challenger in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, Flynn has butted heads with Irma Lopez, the wife of
Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez and an influential Democratic fund-raiser.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez filed a police report last summer accusing Flynn of verbally
threatening her at a Democratic Party barbecue. He later upset Latino
leaders by saying Lopez "won't be happy until she sees a sea of brown
faces in every political office in west Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   Among those mentioned as potential challengers to Flynn are
Benitez, Manuel Lopez and Ventura County Community College District
trustee Art Hernandez, who won reelection last month to a seat that
represents much of the same area as Flynn's district. Benitez says
she won't run, while Lopez and Hernandez are noncommittal.</TE>
<TE>   Although Flynn eventually apologized for the "brown faces"
comment, he has denied threatening Lopez and holds to his belief that
she and a handful of others want to fill his seat with a Latino.</TE>
<TE>   Flynn hasn't committed to seeking another term. But if he runs
again, he expects Latino voters to continue to support him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried about that group," Flynn said of his detractors.
"My decision to run or not [depends] on whether or not I feel I've
done my job."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps more than anything, the 5th District rift may end the myth
that Latinos are a homogenous group. Latino leaders say too many
people still believe that Latinos are a single-minded voting bloc,
when in reality they are as varied in their backgrounds, political
views and voting habits as other Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, newly elected Pleasant Valley Elementary School
District trustee John Alamillo.</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in predominantly white Camarillo, the 42-year-old
general contractor said he focused little on his roots, even though
his grandparents were from Mexico and his father was involved in
cultural affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "I never really put that much thought into it," Alamillo said.
"I've never really seen myself as fully part of the Latino
community." Likewise, newly elected Thousand Oaks Councilwoman
Claudia Bill-de la Pena said she won her seat by running on a
slow-growth, environmental platform.</TE>
<TE>   "Cultural background or ethnic background shouldn't matter," said
Bill-de la Pena, who recently learned she was only the second Latino
to hold a council seat in Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think voters in Thousand Oaks made their decisions based
on my last name," she said. "I think they voted for me based on my
qualifications."</TE>
<TE>   That can be a difficult balancing act.</TE>
<TE>   Some Latino leaders believe their qualifications are more likely
to be called into question and that Latino candidates have to be more
qualified than their rivals to win office.</TE>
<TE>   But Fillmore Mayor Evaristo Barajas said he believes that is
changing, especially as more Latinos prove they can do the job.</TE>
<TE>   Barajas, who was elected to the council in 1996 three decades
after moving to Ventura County from his native Mexico, was among

resolution.</TE>
<TE>   In an ironic twist, he said an effort is now underway to provide
all materials at City Hall in English and Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was inevitable that change would happen," Barajas
said. "In this last election [which gave Latinos a council majority],
there was no mention of race. It was all about who was the most
qualified candidate. It just so happened that one of the most
qualified candidates was Latino."</TE>

<HD>'Hank' Luisetti, 86; His One-Handed Shot Ruled</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Angelo "Hank" Luisetti, the three-time All-American from Stanford who
revolutionized basketball by popularizing the running one-handed
shot, has died. He was 86.</LD>
<LD>   Luisetti died Tuesday in San Mateo, said his companion, Nancy
Gommeringer. He had been ill with an unknown ailment for four months,
she said.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-foot-2 forward changed the sport when he introduced his
running one-handed shot to Madison Square Garden during a Dec. 30,
1936, game against Long Island University.</LD>
<TE>   Stanford ended Long Island's 43-game winning streak -- and
Luisetti brought the beginning of the end for a game defined by the
traditional two-handed set shot.</TE>
<TE>   "He has to be considered one of the innovators of the modern game
of basketball," Stanford coach Mike Montgomery said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery said he first heard of Luisetti when he was 10. His
father, who had played against Luisetti in college, told him that
Luisetti was the "greatest player ever to play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Other West Coast players had worked on the one-handed shot, but
Luisetti honed it best in competition.</TE>
<TE>   He learned his skills on the playgrounds of San Francisco,
developing the then-unusual one-handed style to hoist the ball over
taller players. "Shooting two-handed, I just couldn't reach the
basket," Luisetti once said. "I'd get the ball, take a dribble or
two, and jump and shoot on the way up.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't jump and shoot at the height of my jump, the way they do
now," he said. "I'd let the ball go right near my face. I'd push and
shoot, off my fingertips."</TE>
<TE>   Luisetti was a three-time first-team All-American selection at
Stanford, from 1936 through 1938. He was named the Helms Athletic
Foundation Player of the Year in 1937 and 1938. Inducted into the
Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959, he was selected for the inaugural
Pac-10 Hall of Honor in March 2001.</TE>
<TE>   He also became the first college player to score 50 points in a
game, when Stanford beat Duquesne 92-27 on New Year's Day 1938. That
single-game scoring record still stands at Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   His teammate, Phillip Zonne, remembered that game Saturday in an
interview with Associated Press. The fellow forward recalled vividly
the strategy he and Luisetti had employed: a forward-led full-court
press.</TE>
<TE>   "We did something differently. Luisetti and I would go down the
court and meet the two guards who were bringing the ball up the
court," Zonne said. "They were so confused at one point that one of
the guards handed [Luisetti] the basketball."</TE>
<TE>   After his collegiate career, Luisetti played on amateur club
teams, including the Phillips 66ers and St. Mary's Pre-Flight. He
also coached the Stewart Chevrolets to the Amateur Athletic Union
championship in 1951.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Gommeringer, Luisetti is survived by his son,
Steven, of Sacramento, his daughter, Nancy, of St. Louis, and several
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>'Friends' Keep Bond Alive for 10th Season</HD>
<DH>NBC will pay as much as $10 million an episode -- the
highest price ever for a half-hour show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton and Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Friends" will return for a 10th season in a deal in which NBC will
pay as much as $10 million an episode -- the highest price ever for a
30-minute show, and a sign of just how desperate the network is to
cling to the hit comedy.</LD>
<LD>   NBC will likely lose money on the tentative new deal. But the
network couldn't afford to let the sitcom get away before it finds a
substitute that would enable it to continue domination of Thursday
nights. Its "Must-See TV" slates on Thursdays over the years have
included "The Cosby Show," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld."</LD>
<LD>   Even though the six-member cast and the network had publicly
announced that this season likely would be its last, the
behind-the-scenes courting had already begun.</LD>
<TE>   And when Jennifer Aniston and others began expressing sadness at
the end of the show, with a few cast members hinting that they might
want to continue a bit longer, the network pounced.</TE>
<TE>   The tentative deal with Warner Bros. is for 18 new episodes;
that's fewer than the 22 NBC had been seeking, but it's a compromise
that was acceptable to the network and the cast members, who have
begun pondering life beyond the sitcom.</TE>
<TE>   Aniston, in particular, was reluctant to commit to a full season
because she wants to start a family with husband Brad Pitt, according
to a person familiar with the negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Cast members, who already earn $1 million an episode, are not
expected to get raises, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   A Warner Bros. spokeswoman confirmed, "We have a tentative
agreement," but declined to comment on any specifics. NBC officials
also declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The deal marks the end -- at least for now -- to one of the
season's most anticipated decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The cast has been questioned endlessly about whether this season
would truly be the last.</TE>
<TE>   The close-knit cast members -- Aniston, David Schwimmer, Courteney
Cox Arquette, Matt LeBlanc, Lisa Kudrow and Matthew Perry -- talked
about future acting opportunities but never seemed truly ready to
give up the show for good.</TE>
<TE>   And that was good news for NBC.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is that there is no way of putting a price tag on
"Friends."</TE>
<TE>   It is television's most-watched sitcom, and draws the highest
viewership overall among the young adults most prized by advertisers.
It also gives the network a built-in platform from which it can
promote other series.</TE>
<TE>   The return of "Friends" now means that ABC, CBS and Fox will have
to wait at least another year before they can start to give NBC real
competition on Thursdays.</TE>
<TE>   "If they lose 'Friends,' then they're much more susceptible -- not
only to losing Thursday night, but slipping versus the other networks
on an average weekly basis," said Stacey Lynn Koerner, an analyst at
Initiative Media, the media-buying arm of Interpublic Group of Cos.</TE>
<TE>   For NBC, the race is now on to develop a replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Although the hospital comedy "Scrubs" has shown some recent
momentum, it is not considered a sure successor to "Friends."</TE>
<TE>   "Will &amp; Grace" appears to have reached its peak, and none of NBC's
other comedies is strong enough to anchor the night.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, some top executives at rival networks had long speculated
that the curtain would not come down on "Friends" in May because the
series is far too valuable to NBC and Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Although the "Friends" deal is unprecedented, it echoes the
$500-million agreement in 2000 that enabled NBC to keep "ER" on its
schedule for three more years, continuing one of TV's most-watched
dramatic series at least through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the success in bringing back "Friends," NBC and Warner
Bros. are not out of the money woods yet.</TE>
<TE>   Still looming is the renegotiation for the Emmy-winning political
drama "The West Wing," which is expected to be another costly deal
for both of them.</TE>
<TE>   The "Friends" deal underscores the widening gap between
television's haves and have-nots.</TE>
<TE>   Though certain hit shows generate large license fees, the networks
try to make up that cost by programming greater numbers of
inexpensive "reality" shows such as "Fear Factor," "Amazing Race" and
"Survivor," which are far cheaper to produce.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's not likely that the record sum "Friends" commands will
drive up the price for renewals of other hits.</TE>
<TE>   Networks tend to own most of their hit shows, while "Friends" is
produced by Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Under the tentative agreement, the network will pay Warner Bros.
an estimated $10 million per episode in licensing fees, an increase
from the current $7 million, said an insider familiar with the
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   NBC is paying the extra millions to cover Warner Bros.' production
costs, which are estimated to be more than $9 million an episode,
including cast members' salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Even though "Friends" can command an average of $450,000 per
advertising minute, that still amounts to only about $7 million per
episode.</TE>
<TE>   The studio had previously been making up the difference by selling
the episodes into syndication, but those deals are not expected to be
extended because the costs are simply too high for local stations.</TE>
<TE>   Under the complicated syndication arrangement currently in place,
stations, including groups such as Tribune Co. -- which also owns the
Los Angeles Times -- already pay an aggregate $4 million an episode
for the so-called first cycle of reruns.</TE>
<TE>   They will pay about 40% less for a second cycle of reruns that
they have already committed to, beginning at the end of 2004. But if
they agree to take a 10th year of episodes, the second cycle will be
delayed for 18 months into 2006, meaning they will be paying an extra
40% per episode during that period, something they don't want to do.</TE>

<HD>Seeking Chinese Support for Arts</HD>
<DH>Cultural institutions are wising up to untapped wealth in
San Gabriel Valley.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Pringle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In old-money Pasadena, the Pacific Asia Museum needs new money --
Chinese American money. So new thought has been given to the old
horse in the lobby.</LD>
<LD>   The horse is a chest-high clay sculpture that graced the tomb of a
Han dynasty nobleman about 2,000 years ago. Agnes Gomes, the museum's
marketing director, worried that the steed might cause some
prospective Chinese donors to bridle -- and close their checkbooks.</LD>
<LD>   "There are people who say tombs shouldn't be opened," Gomes
explained.</LD>
<TE>   But Meher McArthur, a Pacific Asia curator, put Gomes at ease.
McArthur said she was careful to do her homework on tomb exhibits and
learned that they were well received by Chinese patrons, in this
country and in China.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard that they've disturbed anyone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Asia Museum and the Pasadena area's many other
cultural institutions -- a bounty that rivals those of major cities
-- are becoming more attuned to Chinese sensitivities. With a tight
economy pinching donations from dividend-dependent foundations, the
museums, orchestras and theater companies are hungry for fresh
sources of generosity. And the wealth flowing into the San Gabriel
Valley, like its population, is increasingly Chinese in origin.</TE>
<TE>   Gone are the days when the art showcases and performance groups
could limit their appeals to railroad barons and dowagers with
Mayflower pedigrees. Endowment hunters for venues such as the
Huntington Library now find themselves cold-calling folks with roots
in Hong Kong or Taipei.</TE>
<TE>   It's been slow going. Fund-raisers have barely cracked the door to
Chinese philanthropy. Some say they just recently wised up to the
bottom-line possibilities in the area's shifting demographics.</TE>
<TE>   Replica of Palace</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Asia Museum seems a natural draw for Chinese
benefactors. It occupies a scaled-down 1924 replica of a Manchu
palace -- the only one of its kind in America -- and its Pan-Asian
collection has won acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   But fewer than 20% of the museum's 1,200 members are of Chinese
heritage, Gomes said. The Pacific Asia is trying to recruit more
Chinese Americans for its board -- three of the panel's 30 trustees
are Chinese -- and has stepped up efforts to coax contributions from
well-to-do immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "We just haven't had the participation of the Chinese community,"
Gomes said as she walked through the museum's arched breezeway into a
courtyard lush with bamboo and primrose. The Pacific Asia's upturned
roof looks across Los Robles Avenue to a California Pizza Kitchen and
the giant pit of an office tower under construction.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Nicholson, who traded in Far East art and artifacts, built
the mini-palace as a combination gallery and home. She deeded it to
the city of Pasadena in the 1940s and it later housed the Pasadena
Art Museum. It became the Pacific Asia Museum in 1971.</TE>
<TE>   Before movie-industry green brought manors to Beverly Hills, the
deep-lawn sections of Pasadena were the roost of numerous affluent
Angelenos. Many were industry captains from the Midwest and East who
retired here. They had a taste for the refined and their fortunes
seeded a world-class playground of culture.</TE>
<TE>   The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens
opened in 1928, the year after the death of its founder, railroad and
real estate magnate Henry E. Huntington. That was roughly when the
Pasadena Symphony debuted and the Pasadena Playhouse moved into its
Spanish-style theater.</TE>
<TE>   Later came the Pasadena Museum of History, Norton Simon Museum,
Pasadena Pops Orchestra, California Philharmonic and, last summer,
the Pasadena Museum of California Art. The list goes on.</TE>
<TE>   All but the Norton Simon, which was lavishly endowed by the late
industrialist whose name it bears, are prowling for loose wallets.
And all have relatively few Chinese members and donors, despite the
huge influx charted in the 2000 census.</TE>
<TE>   The San Gabriel Valley's Asian American population jumped by 54%
in the 1990s. About a quarter of the region's 1.7 million people are
Asian, mostly ethnic Chinese, whose numbers have grown the fastest.
Half a dozen cities in the valley -- including flush San Marino, the
Huntington's address -- have Asian majorities or pluralities.
Pasadena, with its population of 134,000, is 10% Asian, up from 8% in
1990.</TE>
<TE>   Investment Capital</TE>
<TE>   A steady infusion of investment capital from Taiwan and China has
mirrored the census trend. So has the rapid expansion of San Gabriel
Valley business and real estate holdings controlled by Chinese
Americans. There is no precise estimate of what that totals, but
economists and banking officials put the sum in the tens of billions
of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   Which is enough to cue the muse of Gillian Bagwell, artistic
director of the Pasadena Shakespeare Company. "I would love to access
the Chinese community, but I'm not sure I would know how," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Underwriting "Macbeth" is not a high priority for Chinese
philanthropists, although it could be, said Jessica Chao, who has
studied Chinese giving as project director for the New York-based
Coalition for New Philanthropy.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese benevolence follows patterns seen in many immigrant
groups, Chao said. Newcomers send money first to their native
countries to help relatives, and then donate to mutual-aid societies
on these shores.</TE>
<TE>   As the immigrants settle in, their giving becomes more mainstream.
That is true in the San Gabriel Valley, where Chinese-owned
corporations and their executives are known to contribute liberally
to United Way and other large charities.</TE>
<TE>   But none of the Pasadena-area cultural enterprises has landed the
Chinese sponsor who could finance a big-ticket exhibition or extend a
concert season. Chao said such largess could come if institutions did
more to engage Chinese Americans individually.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone who knows philanthropy knows that the best way to get
people to give is to get them involved," Chao said. "You have to
invite them in as advisors."</TE>
<TE>   Among those yet to be invited is Li-Pei Wu, chairman of General
Bank. "The Pasadena organizations haven't approached me," Wu said
with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   The Taiwanese-born Wu, a Glendale resident, is celebrated in
Chinese American circles as a soft touch, having committed millions
to a range of causes. His bank's assets have swelled from $6 million
in 1980 to $2.6 billion today. "We are eager to commingle," he said.
"We are eager to be invited."</TE>
<TE>   Also eager are Andrew and Peggy Cherng, owners of the South
Pasadena-based chain of Panda restaurants. Though the couple
occasionally take in the Pasadena Symphony or visit the Huntington,
their philanthropy goes mostly to the United Way, hospitals and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't really been tapped by the cultural institutions," said
Peggy Cherng, who was born in Myanmar (formerly Burma) and reared in
Hong Kong. "We have to know what their mission is about."</TE>
<TE>   The Cherngs started with a single Pasadena restaurant in 1973.
They now preside over a chain of 500 eateries that generate annual
revenue of more than $300 million.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Cherng, who was born in China, said building the business
has left scant time for enjoying the arts, so he hasn't thought much
about giving to them, an experience he suggested is common among
first-generation Chinese entrepreneurs. "One of these days, I want to
do more," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In June, he finished a stint as co-chair of a United Way campaign
that raised $66 million. "But it's a little harder [to give to the
arts] because the other needs are more urgent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cherngs have heard from the Huntington, which sought a
donation for its Chinese garden project. They are weighing the
request.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really about relationship-building," said George Abdo, a
Huntington vice president. "We are trying to make those connections
with the Chinese community."</TE>
<TE>   Abdo was strolling through the garden site, lifting an umbrella
against the rain. Grading had begun for the first phase of the
12-acre garden. Earthmovers rested in a muddy lake bed.</TE>
<TE>   A $10-million bequest from businessman Peter Paanakker, who died
in 1999, got the garden underway. It is envisioned as one of the
largest classical Chinese gardens outside China, bright with lotus
flowers, but the Huntington needs millions more to complete it.</TE>
<TE>   School Programs</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, the Pasadena Symphony hopes to drum up Chinese
interest by hosting programs in Chinese-dominated schools. The
Pasadena Pops has appealed to Chinese-owned companies for support, so
far without success. The California Philharmonic and Pasadena Museum
of History have yet to zero in on Chinese prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "We really need to reach out to them," said Andre Vener,
philharmonic president. "The percentage of them donating to us versus
the percentage of them living in the area doesn't match up."</TE>
<TE>   That's also the case at the Museum of History, ensconced in the
Feynes Beaux Arts Mansion on Orange Grove Boulevard. Docent Pam
Yerkes, a Chinese American, directed a tour, her footsteps echoing on
the original 1906 wood floors.</TE>
<TE>   Walking past Finnish and Italian chandeliers, a 15th century
Spanish chest, and paintings by Southern California impressionists,
she found a single Chinese piece: a dragon-tapestry fireplace screen.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that there is much Chinese history here in
Pasadena," Yerkes said. "Back then, there were restrictions on where
the Chinese could live."</TE>
<TE>   She said it is hard to involve newer generations of Chinese in the
museum. "How do you get folks interested in something they have no
ties to?" she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Zee knows how Yerkes feels, but she is optimistic. Zee is
outreach coordinator for the Pacific Asia Museum, and her task is to
enlist more Chinese immigrants as members and donors.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of us didn't know we could come to this museum and share our
culture," said Zee, a Chinese native. "We have great potential to
reach those people."</TE>
<TE>   As for the ghostly horse in the lobby, Zee said, it didn't bother
her a bit.</TE>

<HD>Muslims Condemn INS Detentions, Say USA Patriot Act Went
Too Far</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cara Mia DiMassa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Participants at a Muslim American conference called on the
Immigration and Naturalization Agency Saturday to terminate its
registration program and stop "deceptive tactics that frighten
law-abiding members of the community." And they asked the INS to
disclose the number and locations of people who were detained last
week while trying to register.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 people, packed into the ballroom of the Long Beach
Convention Center for the Muslim Public Affairs Council's annual
conference, approved a one-page resolution that also calls on the
U.S. Congress to hold special hearings on the detentions and on what
they call overreaching powers of the USA Patriot Act, which was
passed last year in reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The INS registration program, mandated for people from Iran, Iraq,
Libya, Sudan and Syria who are in the United States on temporary
visas, led to the detention on immigration violation charges of as
many as several hundred, some of whom had nearly completed the
process for legal residency, friends and relatives of the detainees
have said. A second registration for male visa holders from 13
countries, including Afghanistan, Eritrea, Lebanon, North Korea and
Yemen, is scheduled for early next month.</LD>
<TE>   Aslam Abdullah, editor of the Minaret, a national Islamic magazine
based in Los Angeles, likened the detentions to those of Japanese
Americans during World War II. "As citizens of this country," he said
before introducing the council's resolution, "we cannot allow our tax
dollars to be used by the people who are employed by us to cloud the
founding principles of the nation."</TE>
<TE>   Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council,
an American Muslim organization based in Los Angeles and Washington,
D.C., said the registration program marks a "pivotal moment for the
civil rights of Muslims." Echoing the sentiments of many attending
the conference, he said there has been an erosion of public
confidence in the U.S. government.</TE>
<TE>   Al-Marayati said the USA Patriot Act, passed last year, placed the
U.S. Department of Justice in the position of being both prosecutor
and judge. That act, a sweeping federal law, broadens the
government's ability to use secret searches, wiretaps and other
covert surveillance techniques in pursuit of terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because it's a law doesn't mean it's constitutional," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Maher Hathout, another conference speaker, said many of the
detainees fled their countries of origin for political reasons. Yet,
he said, "No matter how much you say, 'I hate them and I love
America,' it doesn't matter," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many conference attendees said they know people who had been
detained last week. Adam Homsi, 22, a consultant on technology, said
two of his clients, brothers originally from Iran, were among the
detainees. He said he was told that the men were detained in cramped
quarters inside a warehouse.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think it happened in another country," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Why would they call on law-abiding citizens to register?"
wondered Sajeda Sultani, 50.</TE>
<TE>   Joseph Zogby, special counsel on post-9/11 national origin
discrimination in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division,
addressed conference attendees shortly after the vote was taken.</TE>
<TE>   He acknowledged that many people within the Muslim American
community have developed a mistrust of government. "That is very
worrisome to us."</TE>
<TE>   Zogby, said his department has little jurisdiction over the
detention issue. But he promised to take concerns expressed in the
meeting back with him to Washington.</TE>

<HD>Christmas Cheer, Even for Crime's Other Victims</HD>
<DH>Prisoners' families get holiday support from the Society of
St. Vincent de Paul.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Lobdell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With her boyfriend in the state penitentiary since February, Sonja
Valencia turned this year from a volunteer in prison ministry to a
recipient of the charity.</LD>
<LD>   She and her three children, and the three additional children
living with her, received presents, a lunch of turkey, mashed
potatoes and gravy, and pictures with Santa Claus at the 18th annual
Society of St. Vincent de Paul Christmas party Saturday at the West
Coast Anaheim Hotel.</LD>
<LD>   "Before I felt for them, but now I really understand," said
Valencia, 32, whose boyfriend was helping raise the children before
his parole was rescinded earlier this year.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to the holiday event, the Santa Ana woman said, the
"Friends Outside" branch of the St. Vincent de Paul ministry has
provided clothes, counseling and bus trips to and from Wasco State
Prison for her children. "If they can't help you, they find someone
else to help you."</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said Saturday's event, which brings Christmas to
children whose fathers or mothers are incarcerated, drew a record 800
children and 200 adults.</TE>
<TE>   "These are the silent victims of crime," said Joseph D. Kay, the
executive director of the Orange County chapter of the Society of St.
Vincent de Paul, adding that children lose both a parent and the
support of that parent's paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the party goes out through city and county jails and state
prisons. Inmates then send invitations to their children.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something special because it comes from Dad," Valencia said.</TE>
<TE>   The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is an international nonprofit
organization run by Catholic laity. In Orange County, the
organization, known especially for helping the inmates and their
families, has about 1,000 volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   Highly visible at the event were firefighters, sheriff's deputies
and probation officers, who came to give the children a positive
image of law enforcement and other authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "They can see that we're the good guys too," said Deputy Ray
Guerrero, who gave children tours of his patrol car outside the
hotel. "We always come bearing gifts. We just need to break down that
barrier a bit."</TE>
<TE>   Donna Miller, whose husband is serving three months in county
jail, brought her four boys to the party.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very special for us," said the Fullerton resident. "It's
tough. I'm a single parent now, and I just feel blessed to have this.
I didn't know they had things like this."</TE>
<TE>   As the presents were passed out, Miller's youngest son, 2-year-old
Jordon, kept both hands on the box holding his toy train. And
Miller's oldest son, 13-year-old Jeffery, an eighth-grade honors
student and basketball player, checked out the features of his
SuperSoaker water gun.</TE>
<TE>   But maybe the most satisfied member of the Miller family was his
mother, who received a black purse, a scented candle and a hand-held
wooden massager. She gave it a test try on her neck muscles.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh yeah," she said. "Mommy needs this."</TE>

<DH>Holiday boat parade draws throngs and some gripes.</DH>

<LD>The sky threatened to flood it with rain and many thought it was all
wet for shortening its course, but Newport Beach's venerable,
electrified Christmas Boat Parade churned on triumphantly Saturday
night.</LD>
<LD>   "Extremely impressive," said Todd Schafer of Costa Mesa as he
watched the progression of yachts bedecked in colored lights,
red-nosed dolphins, inflatable snowmen and water-skiing Santas.
"They're very creative."</LD>
<LD>   A 94-year tradition, the parade has been called one of the top
holiday spectacles in the nation, and features scores of brilliantly
illuminated boats blasting music and cheer in a 5-mph convoy. The
event, which has run nightly for much of the past week, is a
logistical and nautical challenge for organizers and authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd liken it to Labor Day in the dark," said Sgt. Kurt Vasentine
of the Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol. "It has the potential
to get very hectic. The boat traffic is extremely heavy."</TE>
<TE>   All week, hundreds of watercraft, from rowboats to giant yachts
churned their way around the harbor before an estimated total of 1
million spectators. Despite chilly weather and the chance of rain,
viewers filled homes, docks and harborside restaurants to watch.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very cool, so it feels like Christmas," said Jan Cobb of
Newport Beach, who watched the procession with his wife, Brigette,
from the back of the Chart House restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   The flotilla sailed into controversy last year when its admirals
decided the event was too long and that enthusiasm was ebbing. A
survey found that most of the participating boat owners were having
trouble filling their vessels with passengers and crew for seven
nights, and those they could recruit did not like being out on the
chilly water in closed quarters for so long.</TE>
<TE>   So the seven nights have become five, with Lido Isle and Peninsula
Point now bypassed on three of those nights. One parade official
resigned in frustration, and residents along the excised route are
still fuming.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel cheated," said Wendy Webb of Lido Isle, whose home
overlooks the island's western shore. "Everybody here is holding a
party tonight, because it's the only night we're going to be able to
see anything."</TE>
<TE>   Tonight, starting at 6:30, is the season's final parade. For
online details about the event, which is sponsored by the Newport
Beach Chamber of Commerce, go to www.christmas boatparade.com.</TE>

<HD>State, Youth Sports Advocates Clash Over Best Use of Parks</HD>
<DH>Many residents want soccer and ball fields on two parcels
near downtown, but officials say their mission is to protect the land
as it is.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Miguel Bustillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last December, Gov. Gray Davis posed for pictures with the Latino
boys and girls from a local soccer league to celebrate the state's
conversion of two old rail yards near downtown Los Angeles to
parkland. As a woman held aloft a sign that said "Gracias Santa
Davis," the governor promised to bring state parks closer to the
people.</LD>
<LD>   The occasion culminated a long campaign by a coalition of
community groups and environmentalists who were locked in a struggle
for control of the land with developers who wanted to build
industrial parks on both sites.</LD>
<LD>   But, as it turns out, the state's purchase of the land was just
the beginning of a contest over the fate of the two parcels, known as
the Cornfield and Taylor Yard -- a struggle that underscores the
competing visions for park space in Los Angeles.</LD>
<TE>   Last month, when state officials shared their vision for the parks
at neighborhood meetings, community groups learned to their surprise
that preliminary plans included no soccer fields or baseball
diamonds, and that the state had no intention to ever build any. As
the officials explained it, the mission of the California Department
of Parks and Recreation is to protect natural resources and preserve
historic sites, not to oversee ball fields. That, they said, is the
city's job.</TE>
<TE>   The state's position infuriated the community activists, who now
feel used and misled by the politicians and environmentalists who
enlisted them to join the open-space campaign with color-coded maps
of emerald soccer fields. More broadly, it has touched off a debate
on what urban parks should be, with the activists challenging the
prevailing practice at California state parks to maintain land as
undeveloped open space.</TE>
<TE>   "We are all very upset over this betrayal," said Raul Macias, a
Mexican immigrant who worked to start his own clothing factory,
became prosperous, and now spends $25,000 a year to buy poor boys and
girls cleats and uniforms to play soccer. The league Macias founded,
the Anahuak Youth Soccer Assn., has grown to more than 1,400
children. But it still has no playing fields to call its own, a void
he expected the new parks to fill.</TE>
<TE>   State parks officials "do not understand the reality of this area
and what happens" in traditional parks, he said. "They fill up with
people who like to drink and smoke marijuana. I am all for preserving
rocks and trees and those things, but to me, it seems more important
to help the children first."</TE>
<TE>   Led by then-Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, Los Angeles
politicians ensured that Proposition 12, a huge parks bond issue on
the 2000 ballot, contained millions for urban open space. Last year,
by tapping that money, the state spent almost $60 million to buy the
Cornfield, a 32-acre parcel near Chinatown, and a 30-acre chunk of
Taylor Yard beside the Los Angeles River in Cypress Park.</TE>
<TE>   State parks officials insisted they never promised playing fields
to anyone, a position not disputed by any of the community groups.
Furthermore, they pointed out that although the state has no such
plans at the Cornfield and Taylor Yard, it is trying to broker an
arrangement by which city officials could provide more playing
fields.</TE>
<TE>   With help from state and city politicians, the state parks
officials are discussing plans to have Los Angeles manage ball fields
at Taylor Yard, and are exploring a land swap that would allow the
city to take over part of Taylor Yard to provide sports programs.
City parks officials are receptive to both ideas.</TE>
<TE>   State officials are not in favor of a similar arrangement at
Cornfield, however, arguing that it is more suited to a traditional
state park with benches, meadows and trees.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to serve Los Angeles, and we think we can serve Los
Angeles by providing important cultural and natural spaces, and
working with local officials to see that there are playing fields,"
said acting state parks Director Ruth Coleman. "State parks' mission,
and it is in statute, is to provide statewide resources. It has to be
a place anyone, from Fresno to Los Angeles, could use at any given
moment."</TE>
<TE>   "There are no villains here, just a gigantic misunderstanding,"
said Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), who noted that
without the state's intervention, both sites would be industrial
parks by now.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Goldberg said, it may be time to redefine the
mission of the state parks department in urban areas, and she is
considering sponsoring legislation to do just that. State officials
strongly disagree, and say that requiring them to run recreation
programs would overburden a system of 274 parks that already faces
some difficult decisions due to California's $34-billion budget
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   But In Los Angeles, a city starved for open space, proposals for
new parks are increasingly prone to disputes over how the land should
be used. Most of Los Angeles, but especially the Eastside and the
city's central urban core, has less park land than the six to 10
acres per 1,000 people recommended by the National Recreation and
Park Assn. It should be no surprise that gangs have become an
epidemic in many parts of the city, recreation advocates argue, given
the paltry opportunities for athletic activities. The city as a whole
has roughly 4.2 acres of park land acres per 1,000 people, according
to a USC study.</TE>
<TE>   "It has taken 10 years for us to get this far," said Ramon Muniz,
a Cypress Park resident who has participated in the public debate
over Taylor Yards for years and is wary of the new promises that
playing fields will eventually be built. "How long is it going to
take?" State officials in recent years have begun aggressively
acquiring land for urban parks in response to political pressures
from Latino legislators and activism from environmental groups who
want to plant an apron of greenery along the heavily developed banks
of the of the Los Angeles River. The buying spree has been financed
largely by bond measures passed with disproportionately high support
from urban Latino voters. But the state has yet to adapt to what
those voters expect of their parks, critics say.</TE>
<TE>   Many urban park users are immigrants from Mexico and Central
America and see their local parks as gathering places akin to the
small town squares of their native countries, a UCLA study found.</TE>
<TE>   "The state's understanding of parks is largely based on the
outdoors: mountains and rivers and open space," said Los Angeles City
Councilman Ed Reyes, who represents the neighborhoods where the two
parks are being planned. "This area lost all of that a long time ago,
and what we have is a need to relieve the pressure caused by the
high-density development in this area." Though state officials say
they don't have the money or authority to build and manage playing
fields near the new urban parks, an attorney representing the Anahuak
youth soccer program said the state has allowed baseball diamonds
near million-dollar mansions at Malibu Bluffs State Park, and a polo
ground and soccer field at Will Rogers State Park in Pacific
Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "Loose talk from state parks that their mission is to protect
natural resources is just plain wrong, and we've called them on it,"
said Robert Garcia, a former federal prosecutor and now a lawyer with
the Santa Monica-based Center for Law in the Public Interest. "If
they can provide public playing fields for wealthy white communities
in the west side of town, they had better do it for working-class
Latino communities in Cypress Park."</TE>
<TE>   The area within a five-mile radius of the Cornfield site, which
includes Chinatown, is 68% Latino and 14% Asian, and has a median
income of $28,908 -- far below the state median of $47,493, according
to 2000 census figures. Similarly, the area surrounding Taylor Yard,
which includes Cypress Park and Highland Park, is 56% Latino and 17%
Asian and has a median income of $32,863.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the area around Will Rogers State Park is 70% white
and has a median income of $70,333. Malibu is 89% white, and
one-fourth of its residents have incomes over $200,000, census
figures show.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say they never wanted permanent playing fields in
Malibu or Pacific Palisades, which they say were put in as a result
of local political pressure on the California Coastal Commission and
other state agencies. And state parks officials said they are pushing
to shut them down. To provide active recreation at Taylor Yard, a
former Union Pacific switching station, state park officials say they
hope to enter into a partnership with the Los Angeles Department of
Recreation and Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I know we are going to see active recreation there, because the
political will is there," said Melanie Winter of the River Project,
one of the environmental groups that pushed for a park at Taylor
Yard.</TE>
<TE>   At the Cornfield, however, state officials are committed to a more
traditional state park, noting the site's extraordinary history.
Buried beneath the Cornfield, named for a farm that once was there,
lies a piece of the zanja madre, or mother canal, which carried water
from the Los Angeles River to the city's earliest Spanish settlement.
It is also close to a former Native American settlement of the Tongva
people, the region's prior settlers. It was also a 19th century
locomotive stop where many of Los Angeles' early white inhabitants
first set foot in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "People have to be cognizant of the fact that it is significant
that the state is now becoming active in urban parks in Los Angeles,
and we should not make the experience a negative one for them," said
Manuel Mollinedo, the general manager of the city Recreation and
Parks Department. "What is happening right now is that we have so
little open space that everyone is focusing on these sites instead of
looking at the big picture."</TE>

<HD>For O.C.'s Sinners, a New Idea: Penance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's vital to our democracy that church and state remain separate --
except on bingo nights.</LD>
<LD>   That's what I thought before reading that 16 Roman Catholic
priests in Orange County are beginning acts of public penance to show
contrition for the misdeeds of other priests.</LD>
<LD>   They hope their shows of remorse to sexual-abuse victims around
the country will spread to other parishes.</LD>
<TE>   You talk about reviving a great tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, whole new opportunities arise for wayward public figures
who want to replenish their souls.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Church thought of penance hundreds of years
ago; why didn't government? The best it could come up with were jail
and fines and the occasional flogging.</TE>
<TE>   The priests have it right. They announced last week a series of
acts of self-sacrifice and service designed to humble themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Included on the list are doing janitorial work at schools, going
without their cars for a while, or giving their clothes to charity.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, if only public officials who stray would get the sacramental
urge. I realize that "humble themselves" and "public officials" are
disharmonious, but imagine how good their penitential deeds would
make the rest of us feel, if not themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Just nine days ago, former Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd was
fined, put on probation for a conflict-of-interest charge and barred
from ever running for office.</TE>
<TE>   Appropriate punishment, but how about some penance? Since he
wronged the city, why not volunteer to clean the unsightly pigeon
excrement from every public building in Seal Beach over the next few
months?</TE>
<TE>   Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas was chastised by the Orange County
grand jury for vindictively targeting political opponents. If
Rackauckas agreed to fix each of them a meal this week, finish their
Christmas shopping for them and take down their trees, it'd be steps
in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   In the old days, before it fell out of favor among sinners,
penance included such things as fasting, public humiliation and the
wearing of sackcloth. If only former Congressman Bob Dornan had
considered penance for his multitudinous attacks on our sensibilities
-- how a month of silence from him at any point during his tenure
would have made this a better place.</TE>
<TE>   Or, take actress Tawny Kitaen. Please. She agreed to enter a
spousal-battery program after making mincemeat of her husband, former
Angels pitcher Chuck Finley. While wearing sackcloth would be great
penance for the clotheshorse Kitaen, she could perform no greater
public service than agreeing never to act again. As for Finley, well,
he's been humiliated enough.</TE>
<TE>   Former Orange County Supervisor Todd Spitzer must consult his
conscience and ask if he wronged anyone by abruptly resigning from
the board last month, leaving at least one would-be candidate out in
the cold. If the answer is yes, Spitzer -- a lawyer -- might want to
provide pro bono legal advice to an organization.</TE>
<TE>   I'd suggest the Airport Working Group.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be negative, but I doubt any of these people will become
penitents. Or, at least, not very convincing ones. For starters, you
must truly think you've erred, and I doubt any of them do.</TE>
<TE>   Where's the Council of Trent when you need it?</TE>
<TE>   That august body declared in 1551 that "as a means of regaining
grace and justice, penance was at all times necessary for those who
had defiled their souls with any mortal sin."</TE>
<TE>   These folks' sins don't rise to mortal status, but would it kill
any of them to repent? Failing that, how about a good flogging?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saul Amarel, a pioneer in artificial intelligence and founder of the
computer science department at Rutgers University, died Wednesday of
cancer in New Brunswick, N.J. He was 74.</LD>
<LD>   Amarel was known internationally for his work in computer
simulations, network synthesis and "hypercomputing," and for
organizing collaborations of scientists in using artificial
intelligence.</LD>
<LD>   Artificial intelligence combines science and engineering to
understand how humans and machines process information, then applies
that knowledge in designing machines smart enough to do human tasks
and ones beyond human intelligence.</LD>
<TE>   A native of Greece, Amarel and his family fled the country in 1942
for what was then British Mandatory Palestine. He earned an
undergraduate degree in 1948 at the Institute of Technology in Haifa
while fighting for Israeli independence. He later led projects until
1952 for the scientific department of the Israeli Ministry of
Defense.</TE>
<TE>   After earning a doctorate in engineering science at Columbia,
Amarel led the computer theory group at RCA Sarnoff Labs in Princeton
from 1958 to 1969. The same year, he founded the Rutgers computer
science program, which he chaired until 1984.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Gordon McCarter, 71, an NFL referee whom Pittsburgh Steeler Coach
Bill Cowher once chased across the field to stuff a snapshot of a
play into his pocket, died Friday in a Cleveland hospital. No cause
of death was given.</LD>
<LD>   McCarter, a referee from 1974 until his 1996 retirement, was in
charge of several disputed games during his last years.</LD>
<LD>   The most memorable incidence came in 1995, when he made an
incorrect call, saying that 12 Pittsburgh players were illegally on
the field in a game against Minnesota, when there were only 11.
League rules at the time did not allow photographic evidence to
overturn calls.</LD>
<TE>   McCarter was fined a game's pay for his incorrect call, and Cowher
was also fined for stuffing the Polaroid photo into the referee's
pocket.</TE>
<TE>   McCarter joined the NFL as a line judge and back judge in 1967.
Before that, he officiated at junior high and high school football
games and amateur track meets.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruth Kobart, 78, an American Conservatory Theater actress who
appeared in the organization's first production 35 years ago, died
Dec. 14 in San Francisco of pancreatic cancer.</LD>
<LD>   Kobart appeared as Madame Pernelle in "Tartuffe," the company's
first production at San Francisco's Geary Theater in 1967.
Twenty-five years afterward, she recalled: "The house was electric,
and the whole thing was a big love affair between us and the
audience. The more they loved it, the better we got. We really took
off with a whoosh!"</LD>
<LD>   Kobart, a native of Des Moines, began her career life in New York,
where she pursued roles in opera. She made her professional debut
off-Broadway as the Witch in "Hansel and Gretel" with the Lemonade
Opera, and then frequently performed in New York and on tour with NBC
Opera.</LD>
<TE>   Her varied career included the musical "A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to the Forum," which won her a Tony nomination in 1963; and
television and film credits such as "Bob," "Dirty Harry" and "Sister
Act."</TE>
<TE>   Kobart last appeared with the American Conservatory Theater in
"Home" in 1994.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Glover, a retired editor and drama critic for the Associated
Press, died Friday after a long illness. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   In his 18 years as AP's drama critic, from 1960 to 1978, Glover
covered more than 3,000 openings on and off-Broadway.</LD>
<LD>   During a time when first-night drama critics raced back to their
desks to write reviews on deadline, Glover acquired a reputation for
his agile exits from the theater the moment the curtain came down.
Cue magazine once dubbed him "the Nureyev of the aisle."</LD>
<TE>   If Glover liked a show, he said so in the opening paragraph. "An
exuberantly winning musical, 'Mame,' opened tonight to well-earned
cheers at Broadway's Winter Garden Theater," he wrote in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   Glover graduated from Rutgers University, and served in the U.S.
Maritime Service from 1943-1945. He was a member of the New York
Drama Critics Circle, as well as one of its presidents, and was for
many years on the nominating committee for the Tony Awards.</TE>

<HD>Encino Reservoir Upgrade Begins</HD>
<DH>Neighbors are resigned to a noisy year ahead as DWP starts
work on a $24.7-million filtration plant at the base of the open-air
site.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Stassel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jeff Scapa will be ringing in 2003 on a bittersweet note.</LD>
<LD>   He's resigned to the fact that the new year will be a noisy one on
his Encino street, but he's not looking forward to it.</LD>
<LD>   His home borders the Encino Reservoir, where construction of a
30,000-square-foot filtration plant has already begun. The plant is a
crucial part of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power's
effort to comply with stricter regulations for open-air reservoirs.</LD>
<TE>   "I wish they didn't have to do anything," said Scapa, a real
estate investor who has lived in his home for more than 20 years.
"This is a secluded place where you don't hear anything. It's a great
place to live.</TE>
<TE>   "But since it's going to happen, they are trying to make the
unpleasantness as pleasant as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing that open-air reservoirs are prone to contamination by
such things as rain runoff and bird droppings, state and federal
agencies drafted new rules to help protect consumers. The challenge
for the DWP has been creating plans that satisfy the agencies as well
as reservoir neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade of discussions between water officials and
residents -- sometimes involving a hired mediator -- it was
determined that as of Jan. 1, water for Encino's and Tarzana's
100,000 residents would come directly from the Los Angeles Reservoir
and be treated at the DWP filtration plant in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   Aging 72-inch water lines were recently replaced with 96-inch
pipes to accommodate the load, part of the DWP's $3.1-billion
improvement plans during the next decade. Water officials plan to
begin bypassing the Encino reservoir a few days before the state
Department of Health Services' Jan. 1 deadline. Failure to meet the
deadline could result in a $1,000-a-day fine.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, a $24.7-million high-tech filtration plant is being built
at the base of the Encino Reservoir, which would largely be taken out
of daily service but maintained for use during emergencies such as
earthquakes and prolonged droughts. The new plant will filter up to
6.5 million gallons of water a day and allow for better control of
the reservoir's water level.</TE>
<TE>   If the DWP had chosen to maintain the status quo at the Encino
Reservoir, the water supply would have needed additional chlorine
treatment, and a large $200-million filtration plant would have had
to have been built, involving four years of construction and
expensive ongoing maintenance costs.</TE>
<TE>   The chosen plan "was a cheaper solution and better in the long
run," said Melinda A. Rho, DWP's manager of regulatory affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Improvements have been made, or will be made, at three other DWP
reservoirs that are subject to runoff contamination. Two 30-million
gallon underground tanks were installed to replace the Upper and
Lower Hollywood reservoirs. Construction of a small filtration plant,
pumping station and chlorination facility at Lower Stone Canyon
Reservoir north of Bel-Air is to begin next summer.</TE>
<TE>   To lessen the effects of construction at the Encino Reservoir, the
DWP and residents laid down several rules for the contractor, Merco
Construction. Work cannot stretch beyond 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
weekdays and deliveries are limited to 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. No more than
25 vehicles a day can arrive at the site; if more are needed, workers
will carpool. Noise cannot exceed 75 decibels within a 500-feet
radius. The grounds will be watered three times a day and trucks that
travel more than 500 feet on the property must be covered with a tarp
to reduce dust pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "The noisy, dusty part will be done within a year," said Raul
Banuelos, a DWP project manager. "Once the walls of the building are
up, they'll be working inside the building.</TE>
<TE>   "We know [the restrictions] are the right thing to do. The reality
is, the residents are our customers and it's our responsibility to
work with them."</TE>
<TE>   Featuring a low-profile design that follows the contour of the
land, the plant will be visible to as many as 15 homes. The facility
is to be painted a dusty green to help it blend into the hillside.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an absolutely elegant system," said neighbor Jim Brust, a
retired aerospace executive who helped form the Encino Hillside
Coalition to represent local residents. "I'm very much in favor of
what they are doing. It turned out to be the best technical
decision."</TE>
<TE>   But Gerald Silver, who lives two miles from the reservoir, isn't
pleased with the plan. He would rather have had the DWP build the
larger filtration plant, which could have provided more water in the
event of an emergency.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't have an earthquake or a terrorist attack, then the
city probably did the right thing," said Silver, president of
Homeowners of Encino. "Only time will prove who is right."</TE>
<TE>   Banuelos said Silver is "probably the only person not happy" with
the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The DWP is very sensitive to the community and community values,"
he said. "We're not going to put a building up that looks like a
refinery. We want to put something that everyone will be comfortable
with."</TE>

<HD>Robles Defense Is Sticks, Stones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Criminal attorneys for South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles never
denied that the city official had said he wanted to kill people.</LD>
<LD>   Their defense was simple: That's politics in South Gate.</LD>
<LD>   It worked. A judge declared a mistrial last week after jurors
could not agree on whether Robles had committed crimes by threatening
people, including two state lawmakers.</LD>
<TE>   Call it tough talk. Call it threats. Political discourse in this
mostly Latino, working-class city of 96,000 people is anything but
civil.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say Robles, employing three allies on the five-member City
Council, rules South Gate through fear and intimidation. The
37-year-old Robles unleashes profanities, in Spanish and English,
over the telephone, in city conference rooms and across crowded
restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Usually, he gets his way.</TE>
<TE>   After Robles' arrest on felony threat charges last spring, the
council voted to make him the deputy city manager and pay him an
annual salary of $111,000. They also ordered the city to pay his
legal bills, now in the six figures, even though South Gate is one of
the poorest municipalities in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   A judge earlier this year barred him from the Police Department
after prosecutors said he had intimidated several police witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   During his trial this month, Robles was accused of having
threatened to rape state Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) and kill
her husband. Escutia testified that she was so afraid, she has set
foot in South Gate only once in nearly two years, even though she
represents the city in Sacramento. She also had arranged for personal
bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   Robles told a friend of state Assemblyman Marco Firebaugh (D-Los
Angeles) that he wanted to take the lawmaker to Tijuana, put him the
trunk of a car and "blow his brains out." Firebaugh testified that he
had been assigned special state security after the threats.</TE>
<TE>   Robles said those things, his attorneys acknowledged, but it was
just talk -- protected speech against political enemies.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that's exactly, unfortunately, what we expect from
politicians of this country from time to time," said George B.
Newhouse, a city attorney, at one court hearing.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' legal team, headed by Thomas Brown, has spent nearly $1
million in city money -- at a pace equal to 10% of the city's annual
budget -- to represent Robles in the treasurer's legal troubles.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' admirers like his passionate and blunt manner. He is an
eloquent speaker who portrays himself as the little guy in
David-and-Goliath battles. He said Escutia and Firebaugh filed
complaints against him because he had defeated their efforts to build
a power plant in South Gate.</TE>
<TE>   The man heading Robles' prosecution, L.A. County Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley, has said that Robles pointed a hand at Cooley like a gun
during a recent conference of public officials. Robles denied it.</TE>
<TE>   On a TV broadcast, Robles called Escutia "a pig."</TE>
<TE>   The judge declared the mistrial after jurors could not agree on
charges that Robles had threatened Escutia; her husband, Leo Briones;
Firebaugh; and a South Gate police lieutenant. None of the alleged
threats was made directly to its target. They were relayed by other
people. Robles' attorneys denied that any verbal threats had been
made against the police lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have not decided whether to retry Robles on the threat
charges. He still faces two illegal weapons charges in a separate
trial after police found numerous weapons at his home this spring,
including a semiautomatic assault rifle.</TE>
<TE>   Robles did not comment after the mistrial. Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba
said the declaration was a victory for the city treasurer. "Clearly,
the jury's message was a strong indication they understood this case
was politically motivated and without merit," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Others said it is just another chapter in weary saga.</TE>
<TE>   "It's embarrassing to residents," said City Councilman Hector De
La Torre, a Robles critic. "It's making us look like some Third
World, petty dictatorship where all kinds of political intrigue and
craziness is going on all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Many South Gate residents have had it with Robles. They have
collected about 8,000 signatures to recall him and his council
allies. They are backed by police unions, which have accused Robles
and the council of trying to interfere with the department. In
response, the council has moved to disband the force and bring in the
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to police the city.</TE>
<TE>   City officials raised so many obstacles to the recall effort in
the last year that Secretary of State Bill Jones helped push
legislation to take the matter out of their control.</TE>
<TE>   "The voters of South Gate confront some of the most serious
allegations of official misconduct and voter intimidation that I have
ever seen," Jones said this fall. "I'm committed to making certain
that the people of South Gate can freely, fully and without
intimidation or corruption, exercise their right to recall."</TE>
<TE>   Robles, Ruvalcaba, Vice Mayor Raul Moriel and Councilwoman Maria
Benavides face a Jan. 28 recall election.</TE>
<TE>   Their critics say the Robles coalition is now trying a different
campaign strategy. The council in December has offered a month of
free trash service and unveiled a plan for a variety of free medical
services at a new city health clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people have been lining up at City Hall to participate
in the city's first-ever "New Year's Dream Home Raffle." One lucky
resident, at a special council meeting in January, will be picked as
the winner of a new, three-bedroom, two-bathroom home.</TE>
<TE>   At the city's annual Christmas parade, Robles, surrounded by
children, rode down the city's main street in a Cadillac convertible,
waving and wishing hundreds of residents a merry Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Some residents interviewed Friday said they had not been won over
by the council's new generosity or by prosecutors' failure to convict
Robles.</TE>
<TE>   "He shouldn't be using that kind of language," said Moises
Rodriguez, a senior citizen who has lived for more than 20 years in
South Gate, which is in the southeast corner of the county,
straddling the Long Beach Freeway. "I don't like the kind of person
he is."</TE>
<TE>   "He's supposed to be setting an example," said another resident.
"Instead, it's like having thugs running the city. You're going to
threaten somebody because they don't agree with you?"</TE>
<TE>   Two of Robles' political opponents have been victims of violent
attacks. His political enemy, City Councilman Henry Gonzalez, was
shot in the head in 1999. Gonzalez suffered minor injuries. Two years
later, the vans of another political opponent were firebombed. Both
crimes remain unsolved, and Robles has never been named a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   During the weeklong trial, which ended Thursday, the central issue
was not whether Robles made threatening statements, but whether the
statements had frightened the recipients, and therefore amounted to a
crime.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors questioned why Firebaugh had waited months before asking
for police protection after hearing that Robles had said he wanted to
kill him. Some jurors said they agreed with defense arguments that
such fiery language was part of the political landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Robles is ousted in the January recall election, he is
already preparing for his next office. He has filed papers to run for
the South Gate City Council in the March election.</TE>
<TE>   "He is relentless. He will not stop.... It's the eleventh hour,
55th minute, and he will not stop," said South Gate Police Department
Sgt. Richard Wade, a recall worker.</TE>

<LD>I hitched a ride with a different candidate each week in the last
presidential campaign, and acquaintances back home would often ask if
George W. Bush was the lightweight he appeared to be.</LD>
<LD>   Absolutely not, I told them. If you want to talk dim, take a look
at the Al Gore campaign. From one day to the next, the Democratic
heir to the throne couldn't decide who he was or what to say. He
couldn't even decide whether to wear wingtips or cowboy boots.</LD>
<LD>   Bush was smart enough to know it takes very little to sell
yourself to the American public. With a twinkle in his eye, he kept
it simple and conveyed warmth and conviction, even when his actions
contradicted his words.</LD>
<TE>   He kept saying the GOP had to throw open the country club doors
and become the party of inclusion, for instance. And then his first
campaign speech in South Carolina was at Bob Jones University, where
interracial dating was banned.</TE>
<TE>   How did he get away with it?</TE>
<TE>   Same way he got away with zipping his lip for a full week after
Sen. Trent Lott turned a birthday bash for Strom Thurmond into a Klan
rally.</TE>
<TE>   Bush understands that we expect little of our political leaders
these days and demand even less.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, he finally condemned Lott when it was clear he had no
choice. He cut him loose and Trent was left to remake himself on
Black Entertainment Television. (I don't know what the next stop is
on the salvation tour, but I'd pay money to see Lott on "Soul
Train.")</TE>
<TE>   The thing is, if segregation so troubled Bush's soul, what was he
doing in the company of those backwater crackers at Bob Jones
University in early 2000?</TE>
<TE>   I've got a theory about political sleight-of-hand like this. Here
it is:</TE>
<TE>   Nobody ever said politics was the cradle of truth and virtue, and
Bill Clinton certainly upheld that tradition in his championship
season. But I think there's a plot underway. A plot to make us even
more cynical than we already are.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't just a Republican conspiracy, either. Think of the last
time a Democrat had a bold idea that roused civic interest. Wait a
minute, let me lower the stakes. Think of the last time a Democrat
had an idea, period.</TE>
<TE>   See what I mean?</TE>
<TE>   I'm telling you the devil himself is in on a plan to extinguish
interest in public affairs, so a small group of political leaders and
several friends of Dick Cheney can rule the world without any
interference from us.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   We say we're disgusted by the influence of money in political
campaigns, and what do our fearless leaders do?</TE>
<TE>   They spend more, more, more.</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles Times poll says 90% of respondents claim that the
president has failed to make a case for war with Iraq, and what
happens?</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration practically sets a date for the bombing to
begin.</TE>
<TE>   Is there marching in the streets? No. Not even any loitering. Is
there a scream from anyone who thinks it makes more sense to go after
terrorists first, and deal with Saddam later? Not even a whisper.</TE>
<TE>   I think they've got us where they want us now. We're turned off
and tuned out -- our attention span shorter than the nap on Trent
Lott's rug.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have any idea what voter turnout was this year in major
elections across the country? It was one of the lowest numbers in
history, according to the Alliance for Better Campaigns, at a paltry
39.3%.</TE>
<TE>   We're on the brink of a confrontation that could lead to a global
clash of cultures, and what did American patriots do in November?</TE>
<TE>   We went shopping.</TE>
<TE>   "A surge in spending on furniture and on electronics at stores
such as Best Buy Co. pushed retail sales 0.5% higher" in November,
The Times reported, even as "first-time claims for unemployment
benefits rose to an eight-month high."</TE>
<TE>   Catch all the action from Baghdad on a big-screen TV.</TE>
<TE>   I swear the people in charge are laughing at us. It's crystal
clear that our thirst for oil put us in bed with Middle Eastern
countries that produced the Sept. 11 terrorists, and what did
Congress do?</TE>
<TE>   It crushed a bill requiring better gas mileage, and nobody out
here raised much of a stink. We just kept buying bigger cars and
putting flags in the windows. You think this is OK with the White
House, which is run by former oil executives?</TE>
<TE>   To answer the question at the top of the column once more, George
Bush is no dummy. Ten days away from the year that could change the
world, he's got everything under control, and he's smarter than you
might have thought.</TE>

<HD>California's 'Forgotten War' Virtually Destroyed a
10,000-Year-Old Culture</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>California's Modoc War of 130 years ago doesn't rank among such
watershed Native American battles as Wounded Knee, Little Bighorn or
the Sand Creek massacre. But it was the only major Indian war ever
fought in the state; the only Indian war in which a U.S. general was
shot and killed; and a sad chapter in the saga of how the West was
won, for it virtually destroyed the 10,000-year-old Modoc
civilization.</LD>
<LD>   In a remote corner of northeastern California, where a vast
network of cave-riddled lava beds linked by natural trenches make up
Lava Beds National Monument, a small band of Modocs held off the U.S.
Army in 1872 and 1873 in what is known as the Forgotten War.</LD>
<LD>   It was a war of five major battles and several skirmishes, all
waged about 30 miles south of the Siskiyou County town of Tulelake.
Against overwhelming odds, 52 warriors held nearly 1,000 soldiers at
bay for six months.</LD>
<TE>   Before the flood of white trappers and settlers arrived in the
late 1820s, the Modocs had thrived for centuries in domed dwellings
mostly along the shores of Tule Lake and Lost River. Except for
occasional skirmishes with other native peoples, life was simple. But
then settlers staked claims to river territory; prospectors'
operations hurt the salmon runs; and wagon trains frightened away
wild game, on which the Modocs depended for food.</TE>
<TE>   The Modocs retaliated by rustling cattle, kidnapping two teenage
girls and attacking wagon trains. In retaliation, a
rancher-turned-vigilante named Ben Wright led a massacre of 41 Modocs
in 1852. He was later killed by an Indian woman whom he had stripped
naked and whipped in public. It's said she cut out his heart and ate
it in revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides remained trapped in a cycle of attack and
retaliation until 1864, when they signed a peace treaty. The
government refused to grant the Modocs title to any of their homeland
and instead forced the tribe of several hundred people to move to an
Oregon reservation alongside Klamaths and Paiutes, their longtime
foes.</TE>
<TE>   The Modocs initially agreed to the unwelcome arrangement, but it
didn't last. Led by a chief known as Kintpuash or Kientpoos -- or
"Captain Jack" to the Army -- about 150 Modocs bolted the reservation
after dishonest government agents withheld their food and supplies.
The Indians headed home and resettled on their ancestral land on the
Lost River, alongside settlers.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several years, the settlers made increasing demands
on the government to remove the Modocs, who were helping themselves
to the settlers' cattle because fishing was poor and the harsh
winters diminished their food supply.</TE>
<TE>   In November 1872, the cavalry arrived several hundred strong to
force the Modocs back to the reservation. When one Indian refused to
give up his rifle, a face-off ensued and shots were fired on both
sides. When the exchanges stopped, a soldier and three Indians,
including a woman and her child, lay dead on the frozen ground.
Another Indian was wounded, as were seven soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers retaliated by burning the village. More than 150
Modocs fled through ranchlands, where they killed several men but
left women and children unharmed.</TE>
<TE>   They reached a natural rock formation in the lava beds that soon
became known as Captain Jack's Stronghold. It was ideal for defense,
with a perfect view of approaching soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not believe that a hundred thousand men in a hundred
thousand years could construct such fortifications," an unidentified
federal officer remarked.</TE>
<TE>   The Army pitched tents a few miles from the stronghold, near Tule
Lake. Soon, the soldiers advanced into the lava beds, which looked
relatively flat and easy to negotiate. What the troops didn't know
was that the rugged, inhospitable terrain was full of deep fissures
and sharp rocks; the landscape alone took a toll on the force.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 17, 1873, more than six weeks after the battle began,
soldiers poured heavy but ineffective fire from rifles and howitzers
into the impenetrable stronghold. Meanwhile, the Modocs took careful
aim, killing nine soldiers and wounding 28. When the Army fell back,
the Modocs gathered guns and ammunition from the fallen men.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks later, Kintpuash agreed to an interview with a reporter from
the New York Herald, giving him a long list of complaints going back
20 years and defending his tribe's conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Soon newspapers around the country sympathized with the Modocs. A
playwright packed a Manhattan theater with his melodrama "Captain
Jack and the Modoc War," which portrayed Kintpuash as the hero.</TE>
<TE>   He "endures the most frightful oppression," then "butchers
promiscuously, with a fervent curse on the pale faces," as one critic
put it.</TE>
<TE>   President Grant ordered a peace treaty, and Brig. Gen. Edward
Canby, 56, a West Pointer who was experienced in fighting Indians,
was brought in to broker an agreement. After weeks of stalemate,
during which he sent gifts ranging from barrels of biscuits to bolts
of cloth, Canby persuaded Kintpuash to leave his stronghold for peace
talks.</TE>
<TE>   Kintpuash proposed that he travel to Washington, D.C., to meet
with Grant and secure 2,000 acres of the Modocs' homeland near Lost
River.</TE>
<TE>   Canby brushed this aside as naive and insisted that the 150
Modocs, including women and children, return to the Oregon
reservation. Feeling defeated, wanting peace and knowing the
hardships endured by his people in the lava caves, Kintpuash
consulted with his warriors.</TE>
<TE>   A Modoc shaman named Curley Headed Doctor opposed surrender and
denounced Kintpuash for weak leadership and unquestioning deference
to white authority. The shaman called the chief a "fish-hearted
woman," while men wrestled Kintpuash to the ground and threw a
woman's shawl and hat over his head. Kintpuash finally yielded and
accepted his tribe's plan to kill Canby.</TE>
<TE>   On Good Friday, April 11, 1873, Kintpuash and six Modoc
lieutenants met Canby and three other peace commissioners halfway
between the Army camp and the Modoc stronghold. The Modocs were
armed, violating the terms of the meeting; neither Canby nor his
companions were.</TE>
<TE>   When the general again refused the Modocs' demands, Kintpuash shot
Canby in the head, killing him. In the barrage that followed,
Methodist minister Eleasar Thomas was hit in the head and killed, and
Supt. of Indian Affairs Alfred B. Meacham was shot four times.
Government Indian agent L.S. Dyar escaped to summon help. But before
the Modocs fled, they slashed the dead Canby's throat and partly
scalped Meacham, who nevertheless survived.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a memorial cross stands on the site.</TE>
<TE>   While the heretofore sympathetic nation recoiled in outrage, most
of the 150 Modocs escaped the stronghold through trenches and
tunnels. The Modocs ambushed a 60-man Army patrol at nearby Hardin
Butte, killing 36 and wounding 19.</TE>
<TE>   After several weeks on the lam, many warriors had surrendered to
the Army by late May. A pair of settlers killed at least four Modocs
in an ambush as the Indians were being taken by wagon to an Army
post. In exchange for amnesty, a few Modocs offered to help the Army
capture Kintpuash and the other ringleaders.</TE>
<TE>   On June 1, troops surrounded the Indian camp. Exhausted and
hungry, more than two dozen warriors eventually put down their arms.
The very group of Modocs that had incited Kintpuash to carry out the
violent plan ended up betraying him.</TE>
<TE>   A peace commissioner called the affair "an expensive blunder." The
battle cost the federal government almost $500,000 and nearly 60
soldiers' lives. Altogether, almost 100 people died, including 16
civilians, 15 Modoc warriors and several Indian women and children.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, the remaining band of 153 Modocs was banned from
California forever. The government exiled them by train to the Quapaw
Indian Agency in Oklahoma and insisted that they no longer speak the
Modoc language or practice their culture. It would take more than
three decades before the government allowed Modocs to return to the
Klamath reservation in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Four months after their capture, two Modocs were convicted of
murder and got life terms at Alcatraz. Kintpuash and his lieutenants
-- John Schonchin, Boston Charley and Black Jim -- were convicted of
murder and hanged at Ft. Klamath.</TE>
<TE>   The warriors' heads were cut off and shipped in alcohol to the
Army Medical Museum for "scientific investigation."</TE>
<TE>   "This is vengeance, indeed," screamed the San Francisco Chronicle.
"Captain Jack said that he would like to meet the Great White Chief
in Washington face to face. The government evidently intends that his
dying wish shall be respected."</TE>
<TE>   The Army Medical Museum's collection was transferred to the
Smithsonian at the turn of the last century, and the skulls were
eventually turned over to the Indian community.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, descendants of the Modocs, soldiers and settlers gathered
to resolve any bitter feelings as the National Park Service dedicated
a plaque at Gillem's Camp Cemetery. It lists nearly 100 names,
everyone who died in the Modoc War.</TE>

<HD>Oxnard Christmas Toy Giveaway Makes Spirits Bright</HD>
<DH>More than 1,500 kids and their families attend the event,
where volunteers hand out gifts and sweets for the underprivileged.</DH>

<LD>Cloudy skies and a cool breeze didn't stop more than 1,500 children
and their families from bundling up and going to the Ventura County
Rescue Mission on Saturday, where volunteers handed out gifts and
sweet treats and offered holiday greetings.</LD>
<LD>   For the 14th consecutive year, the mission on East 6th Street in
Oxnard was the place to be for the county's underprivileged children,
ages 1 to 16, whose families struggle to pay even the most basic
bills each month.</LD>
<LD>   "For most of these kids, this is the only Christmas they will
have," said Carol Roberg, the mission's executive director and the
force behind the event, this year titled "The Great Christmas Toy
Giveaway."</LD>
<TE>   As one little boy walked by clutching a large wrapped box -- one
of the thousands of new toys donated to the cause -- 2-year-old
Yolanda Moreno napped on her father's shoulder in a line that circled
the mission.</TE>
<TE>   "Barbie, Barbie shoes, Barbie anything," said the youngster's
mother, Maria Moreno. "That's all she talks about."</TE>
<TE>   Moreno and her husband attended the event for the first time this
year. Like many others in the line, they said the effort by mission
volunteers was very much appreciated.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very nice, because some people cannot afford to buy any
gifts," Moreno said as her husband, Alejandro, nodded in agreement.</TE>
<TE>   As in years past, families had to show proof that they were
collecting unemployment insurance or receiving another form of public
assistance before their children could receive gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the stucco mission, volunteers included community members,
some of whom have been donating their time for years, representatives
from local police and fire departments and members of a motorcycle
group called Bikers for Christ.</TE>
<TE>   To keep families entertained outside -- the event allows groups of
10 children at a time to come in and receive presents -- several
entertainers took turns performing.</TE>
<TE>   One popular act was a group of teens called Grace in Action,
members of Ventura's Grace Baptist Church who dress in black and
white, paint their faces white and mime various religious stories
about the holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the line, 12-year-old Ruby Nieto explained that
this was her second year at the event. This time, she came with her
two sisters and several nieces and nephews. The Lemonwood School
sixth-grader said she would appreciate anything she was given.</TE>
<TE>   "It's Christmas and they give presents, and that's enough," Ruby
said.</TE>

<HD>Trip Home to Mexico Isn't Easy, Post-9/11</HD>
<DH>With a staunch tradition of returning for the holiday, many
Southland immigrants take to the road rather than risk LAX, or worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, members of the Guerrero family canceled their annual
Christmas flight to Guadalajara, scared off by the events of Sept.
11. This year, they -- like thousands of other immigrants from Mexico
-- will resume the holiday tradition.</LD>
<LD>   But they'll be driving.</LD>
<LD>   Worried about security and fearing that they lack proper
identification, many Southern California families that travel to
their hometowns in Mexico for the holidays are shunning airports this
year and making the trip by bus or car, a grueling and sometimes
risky ride.</LD>
<TE>   "For us, it just made sense," said Antonio Guerrero, 37, a Santa
Ana construction worker, who planned to take a bus to Tijuana with
his family and borrow a friend's car for the drive to Guadalajara, a
40-hour haul. "My wife got scared of the airports," he said. "All
those lines they show on television."</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans throughout the United States return to their hometowns at
Christmas to celebrate with relatives, sometimes doubling or tripling
the size of a town. The Mexican government estimates that more than 1
million people will return this holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition is so strong that some Southland school districts
have lengthened the winter break to accommodate students traveling
back to Mexico with their families. In Mexico, families often squeeze
the major events of the year -- confirmations, weddings, parades --
into the holiday season so relatives from El Norte can be present.
Cars with plates from California, Texas and Illinois line hometown
streets.</TE>
<TE>   The events of Sept. 11, 2001, continue to affect the annual
exodus. Airport security has scared off travelers to Mexico,
particularly some in Orange County who feel that going to Los Angeles
International Airport just isn't worth it. They would rather go to
Tijuana and catch a plane or simply drive from there.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year, people didn't move," said Marcela Prado, a Santa Ana
travel agent. "This year, people are opting for land travel."</TE>
<TE>   For airline tickets, "we've seen a 40% drop in sales," she added.
"The airport revisions are making people nervous. People would rather
go to Tijuana and fly, or go in a car. Either way is less expensive
and less hassle."</TE>
<TE>   The Mexican deputy consul in Santa Ana, Alberto Bernal, said his
office has talked to many Mexicans who fear they would be headed for
trouble at LAX. He said they typically want to find out how to obtain
additional identification before buying airline tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a logical fear because there may be people who don't have
identification or don't have enough of it and they don't know what to
expect at the airport," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Marta Madrigal of Garden Grove opted to take a bus to the Tijuana
airport for the first time instead of heading to LAX.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care about heavy [inspections] of our luggage, because
it's just clothes inside. But I do worry about the rest. I'm afraid
the plane is going to fall from the sky," said Madrigal, who boarded
a bus early Friday afternoon in Santa Ana for a 6:05 p.m. flight out
of Tijuana, where she and 11 relatives would head off to Guadalajara
and Michoacan to visit relatives.</TE>
<TE>   As for the driving option, the Mexican government expects to issue
240,000 permits for cars entering the country during the Christmas
season, about 20% more than last year, said Mario Perez, Los Angeles
representative for Paisano, a Mexican government program that helps
travelers.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the Mexican government nearly doubled the number of
border workers by adding 600 employees to process temporary passes
for automobiles entering the country, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among immigrants who plan to drive, there is a nagging fear that
during their trip they will run into Mexican officials who want to
extort bribes from them. Cartoons in Mexican newspapers depict the
immigrants running from the police as they make their way from the
United States to their hometowns. President Vicente Fox has taken
measures to cut down on bribes. But doubts linger.</TE>
<TE>   "People are afraid of flying. You can't blame them. But then they
may be faced with the famous mordidas," said Santa Ana travel agent
Fernando Arenado, using the Mexican word for bribes.</TE>
<TE>   Many are perfectly willing to fly -- as long as the trip starts
south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   At Acapulco Travel, agent Luis Arenado has been successful selling
airline tickets from Tijuana to other parts of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He said his Tijuana departures cost $50 to $100 less than an LAX
flight, even after customers buy a $22 round-trip bus ticket to the
Tijuana airport from Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "In Orange County, we are already halfway to San Diego," he said.
"So what is the point of going to an airport with heightened security
and high-priced tickets?"</TE>

<HD>9/11 Makes Holiday Trip Home to Mexico Harder</HD>
<DH>To keep a staunch tradition, many immigrants take to the
road rather than risk LAX, or worse.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Last year, members of the Guerrero family canceled their annual
Christmas flight to Guadalajara, scared off by the events of Sept.
11. This year, they -- like thousands of other immigrants from Mexico
-- will resume the holiday tradition.</LD>
<LD>   But they'll be driving.</LD>
<LD>   Worried about security and fearing that they lack proper
identification, many Southern California families that travel to
their hometowns in Mexico for the holidays are shunning airports this
year and making the trip by bus or car, a grueling and sometimes
risky ride.</LD>
<TE>   "For us, it just made sense," said Antonio Guerrero, 37, a Santa
Ana construction worker, who planned to take a bus to Tijuana with
his family and borrow a friend's car for the drive to Guadalajara, a
40-hour haul. "My wife got scared of the airports," he said. "All
those lines they show on television."</TE>
<TE>   Mexicans throughout the United States return to their hometowns at
Christmas to celebrate with relatives, sometimes doubling or tripling
the size of a town. The Mexican government estimates that more than 1
million people will return this holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition is so strong that some Southland school districts
have lengthened the winter break to accommodate students traveling
back to Mexico with their families.</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, families often squeeze the major events of the year --
confirmations, weddings, parades -- into the holiday season so
relatives from El Norte can be present.Cars with plates from
California, Texas and Illinois line hometown streets.</TE>

<LD>Another Pacific storm was moving through Ventura County on Saturday
but was expected to clear by this morning, according to the National
Weather Service office in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   The rainfall started about 3 p.m., and the storm had dropped about
one-third of an inch in most parts of the county by early Saturday
evening. The snow level was at 4,000 feet and up to 5 inches of snow
was expected near Lockwood Valley.</LD>
<LD>   No major crashes were reported and weather officials said most of
today would be cloudy with highs in the mid-50s.</LD>

<LD>The sad part for anyone who cares even the smallest bit about UCLA
basketball wasn't Kansas 87, Bruins 70.</LD>

Saturday's game at Allen Fieldhouse, a reflection of continued effort

the Bruins behind, 14-6, because it was already obvious that this was

eight points with nearly 30 minutes to play, a team that wasn't
buried after starting a road game with almost five scoreless minutes
-- and a total of four points in the first 8:30 -- still had a shot
to win. But common sense told you better. Everything the Bruins had
done to that point, in this game and in this season, told you they
weren't going to win.</TE>
<TE>   Because the Bruins have no direction. And if they don't know where
they're going, how are they going to get there?</TE>
<TE>   What's their offensive philosophy? Who's their go-to guy? They
have no idea.</TE>
<TE>   "You've gotta establish roles and we've gotta have goals
offensively," Bruin senior Ray Young said. "Until we kind of figure
out who has what role and what's a good shot, what's a bad shot, what
plays work better for different people or different lineups in the
game, we'll still kind of struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really have that offensive identity, like Kansas, per
se. You know whether they make or miss, they're pushing the ball up
the court, they're running and gunning, they play inside-out. Until
we establish our offensive identity, we're still going to be floating
around. It'll be a roll of the dice."</TE>
<TE>   And it'll usually come up snake eyes. Steve Lavin said the plan
for this game was to take advantage of Kansas' aggressive denial all
over the court by making backdoor cuts. But it's not fair to expect
the Bruins to turn into Princeton overnight. They wound up doing the
exact opposite: throwing risky lateral passes around the perimeter
that the Jayhawks intercepted and turned into fastbreaks the other
way. That's why Kansas led, 48-25, at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins don't have a low-post threat and they aren't setting up
their top perimeter shooter, Jason Kapono. If Kapono can't create
good shots for himself, it's up to the guys with the clipboards to
free him. But at this point it's hard to tell who is more confused
about Jason Kapono's role in the offense -- Lavin or Kapono.</TE>
<TE>   On one possession, Lavin yelled directions to Kapono. Kapono
thought about setting a high screen, then didn't, then started to set
a low screen and that didn't happen, either. Meanwhile, the option of
someone setting a screen for him never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   At least Dijon Thompson has an idea of what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Post up!" he yelled at T.J. Cummings, after a miscommunication
and indecision by Cummings led to another UCLA turnover. "Post up!"</TE>
<TE>   Later, Cummings did post up, Thompson got him the ball and
Cummings scored. Now what was so hard about that ... and why did it
take more than half the game for it to happen?</TE>
<TE>   Thompson was a bright spot Saturday, leading the team in scoring
(21), assists (five) and steals (four).</TE>
<TE>   The only good thing to say about the UCLA team was that the Bruins
did play hard all the way through. Playing hard will usually get you
something, and in this case it was an 11-3 run in the second half
that trimmed Kansas' one-time 25-point lead down to 11 with three
minutes to play. For a little while it was UCLA forcing quick shots,
causing turnovers and creating transition opportunities. The Bruins
even had the ball with a chance to cut the lead to single digits.</TE>
<TE>   But what good would that have done? Then they would have been
locked in a battle of execution, possession for possession, and you
know how that would have turned out.</TE>
<TE>   What made the Kansas-UCLA matchup so enticing in theory was that
it involved schools with rich basketball tradition, bringing together
the ancestral homes of Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, James
Naismith and John Wooden.</TE>
<TE>   The present looked pretty lopsided. Kansas Coach Roy Williams vs.
Lavin isn't even debatable, and it showed in Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   Another area in which Kansas holds the edge: home-court advantage.
Allen Fieldhouse, with its windows up on the walls and cozy size, is
my favorite venue in college basketball. It has all the great
atmosphere of Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium, with none of the
pretentiousness.</TE>
<TE>   Pauley Pavilion still is home to those 11 championship banners,
but lately the crowds haven't even been half as large as the 16,300
who packed Allen on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   There's not much for Lavin to say to the sharks right now. They're
in feeding-frenzy mode after tasting Bob Toledo's blood, and they're
jumping out of the water with excitement over Dan Guerrero's
selection of Karl Dorrell.</TE>
<TE>   Spin won't win.</TE>
<TE>   "We should be discouraged and disappointed," Lavin said. "We've
dug ourselves a hole here, being 2-4.</TE>
<TE>   "There's still a lot of basketball ahead of us. It's not as deep a
hole as the Lakers are in or even the Angels got off to start their
season. But we do have some deficiencies we have to remedy."</TE>
<TE>   With an ax-wielding athletic director around, Lavin would be wise
to shore them up himself. UCLA came up way short in this battle of
basketball bluebloods -- and it's a lot easier to get a new coach
than a new building.</TE>

<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>For much of the game it looked as if Louisiana State would win big
over No. 1 Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   In the end the Tigers were delighted to hang on for a one-point
victory.</LD>
<LD>   LSU, which led by 15 points in the second half, held off a furious
rally by Arizona for a 66-65 win Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   "We were a different team the last five to six minutes than we
were earlier in the game," Arizona Coach Lute Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jaime Lloreda had 19 points and 13 rebounds for LSU, which beat a
No. 1 team for the second time in the program's history.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers beat No. 1 Kentucky, 95-94, in overtime on Feb. 11,
1978.</TE>
<TE>   "This game puts us back on the map," said LSU forward Ronald
Dupree, who was nearly the game's goat after calling for a timeout
the Tigers didn't have. "It was time for us to win a big one and get
this town excited about something."</TE>
<TE>   LSU's defense frustrated the Wildcats for much of the game and
controlled the tempo until the final minutes. The Tigers held Arizona
to a season-low 33% shooting from the field, including 18% (four for
22) from three-point range.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have helped if we didn't miss all the triples we shot,"
Olson said. "We had a lot of easy shots that we didn't put away. Some
of that had to do with the challenge of those shots by LSU
underneath."</TE>
<TE>   LSU (7-1), which had won four in a row by 20 or more points, had a
15-point lead over the Wildcats (5-1) in the second half and was up
six with about a minute to play. But Arizona had a chance to win with
two possessions in the final seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "We won this game by rebounding and guarding," LSU Coach John
Brady said. "I kept telling my team that they were going to make a
run at us at some point and they did, but the toughness in the
defensive effort of our team was really good."</TE>
<TE>   It was the second straight loss for Arizona to LSU, which beat the
then-fifth-ranked Wildcats, 86-60, in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   After a basket by LSU's Antonio Hudson, Channing Frye made one
free throw to get Arizona within 66-61. Dupree rebounded Frye's
second attempt, but was falling out of bounds and tried to call a
timeout. LSU was out of timeouts, and Salim Stoudamire made both of
the free throws on the technical foul to make it 66-63.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers turned the ball over and Andre Iguodala scored, pulling
Arizona within 66-65 with 36 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   A pass from Torris Bright then was picked off by Frye. Jason
Gardner drove and lost the ball out of bounds with half a second
left. Bright tipped the inbounds pass to clinch the victory for the
Tigers.</TE>

<LD>Cal State Northridge (6-2) at Southern Illinois (4-2), 11:30 a.m. PST
-- Northridge has won five consecutive games and has equaled its best
start under Coach Bobby Braswell. Ian Boylan, who scored a
career-high 27 points Thursday to lead the Matadors over Loyola
Marymount, 74-71, has scored 20 or more points in four of his last
five outings. Stetson Hairston leads Southern Illinois, which has
lost two in a row, in scoring (15.8 points).</LD>
<LD>   Lipscomb (3-7) at Pepperdine (5-4), 1 p.m., KPLS (830) -- The
Waves can only improve on their poor showing in a 77-61 loss Friday
against Utah. The Waves were outrebounded, 48-32, and made three of
22 three-pointers (13.6%). Three Pepperdine players -- Devin
Montgomery, Glen McGowan and Will Kimble -- missed the game because
of various ailments. They are not expected to play against Lipscomb,
an independent NCAA team that will join the Atlantic Sun Conference
next year. Lipscomb lost Friday at Kansas State, 88-64, with freshman
center Charlie Jenney scoring a team-high 15 points.</LD>
<TE>   UC Irvine (3-3) at St. Mary's (5-3), 3 p.m., KUCI-FM (88.9) -- As
7-foot center Adam Parada goes, so go the Anteaters, who were held to
a season low in scoring Thursday at Stanford, 84-57. Parada has been
in early foul trouble in Irvine's three losses. He played only 15
minutes and scored seven points before fouling out against the
Cardinal. Forward Tyler Herr leads St. Mary's in scoring (14.8) and
is second in rebounding (5.4).</TE>

<HD>Wells Suspended for Fight, Wallace Is Fined $15,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bonzi Wells drew a two-game suspension from the NBA on Saturday for
fighting at the end of the Portland-Golden State game Friday at
Oakland, and Rasheed Wallace was fined $15,000 for attempting to go
into the stands.</LD>
<LD>   Wells' suspension began with Portland's home game Saturday night
against Seattle. He will sit out the game against Utah on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "He was disappointed," said Trail Blazer Coach Maurice Cheeks, who
said Wells learned of the suspension about 3 1/2 hours before the
game against Seattle. "He was disappointed the situation happened,
for himself and the team. For him to be out for two games is hard for
him and it's hard for the team."</LD>
<TE>   Penalties for the Golden State players who took part in the
altercation are expected to be announced today.</TE>
<TE>   Wells was punished for throwing a punch at Chris Mills, who
reportedly tried to get into the Trail Blazer locker room but was
restrained.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as the Trail Blazer bus tried to leave the arena, Mills
parked his car in front of it, got out with several friends and
challenged the Trail Blazers, the Oregonian newspaper reported. The
bus wasn't able to leave until Oakland police arrived to provide an
escort.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen a guy do anything like that," Cheeks said. "That
can be kind of scary, because you don't know what's going through a
guy's mind."</TE>
<TE>   The brawl started seconds after Wallace made a buzzer-beating jump
shot to give Portland a 113-111 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we dislike each other," said Antawn Jamison of the
Warriors, who was on his way to the locker room and missed the fight.
"In a close game like that, there's a lot of emotion involved, and
sometimes guys go over the top."</TE>
<TE>   Wells and Mills were battling for position and were still tied up
after Wallace's shot went through. As the two exchanged words and
pushed each other, the Warriors' Troy Murphy entered the fray and
threw punches.</TE>
<TE>   Portland's Scottie Pippen said the disturbance never should have
escalated that far.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no reason he shouldn't let Bonzi go," Pippen said,
referring to Mills.</TE>
<TE>   The situation was made worse by fans throwing wads of gum and
plastic beer bottles at the Trail Blazers as they headed for the
locker room. One man was handcuffed and subdued by security officers.
He threw gum at Wallace, sparking another confrontation with several
Trail Blazers.</TE>
<TE>   In November, Wells was suspended for one game by the NBA for
spitting on San Antonio's Danny Ferry during a game.</TE>

<LD>What would be the outcry in Major League Baseball if New York Yankee
owner George Steinbrenner also owned the Dodgers, Red Sox,
Diamondbacks and Giants? Or from NFL fans if the Oakland Raiders' Al
Davis also owned the Rams, Dolphins, Bears and Colts?</LD>
<LD>   It flat-out couldn't happen.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, in Major League Soccer, Philip Anschutz and his Entertainment
Group own not only the champion Galaxy, but also the Chicago Fire,
Colorado Rapids, D.C. United, New York/New Jersey MetroStars and San
Jose Earthquakes. And the Hunt family owns the Kansas City Wizards
and the Columbus Crew.</LD>
<TE>   Anybody see conflict of interest here? Or could it just be that
nobody cares?</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who is the only coach to have won the Rose Bowl game
with a Pac-10 team and a Big Ten team?</TE>
<TE>   Sober facts: During the holiday season, the need for designated
drivers seems especially important. If you could have any sports
personality as your designated driver, who would you choose?
Anheuser-Busch conducted a poll and found that Dale Earnhardt Jr. and
Tiger Woods were the favorites.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt got 42% of the vote, followed by Venus Williams with 16%
and Derek Jeter with 12%. If a golf cart was to be the mode of
transportation, Woods was a runaway winner with 43%.</TE>
<TE>   Surprised? Don't be. Earnhardt's sponsor is Budweiser.</TE>
<TE>   Passing it around: Joe Gibbs won three Super Bowls as coach of the
Washington Redskins and has won two Winston Cup championships as a
car owner.</TE>
<TE>   What makes it more unusual is that he won the Super Bowls with
three quarterbacks, Joe Theismann in 1983, Doug Williams in 1988 and
Mark Rypien in 1992, and the stock car titles with two drivers, Bobby
Labonte in 2000 and Tony Stewart in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Bowl precedent: When Mike Price coaches Washington State in the
Rose Bowl game, despite having signed to coach Alabama next season,
he won't be the first lame-duck coach in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Bernie Bierman had already agreed to move on to Minnesota when his
Tulane team accepted a Rose Bowl bid for the 1932 game. He was at the
helm as the Green Wave lost to USC, 21-12.</TE>
<TE>   Happy days: Paul Kariya, the Mighty Ducks' superstar wing, on how
the Angels' World Series win helped the hockey team:</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of the best things to happen to Orange County," he
said on "Best Damn Sports Show Period." "It gave us tremendous
momentum when we started the season."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: John Cooper, with Arizona State in 1987 and Ohio
State in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: The Denver Broncos and the Raiders may be meeting
today with the AFC West title on the line, but a fascinating sideshow
will be coverage by Raider linebacker Bill Romanowski on Bronco tight
end Shannon Sharpe.</TE>
<TE>   Sharpe claimed Romanowski intentionally injured him when they
played Nov. 11 and Sharpe suffered a dislocated right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Responded Romanowski, a former Bronco, "Well, Shannon's got a big
mouth, that's what I think about it. If he wants to cry about it,
that's his deal."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if would try to get even, Sharpe told the Denver Post, "If
we had the division locked up ... sure, no question. But not now,
there's too much at stake."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Outburst Is Final Blow to Indiana</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Until now, nobody realized how well Mike Davis could impersonate
Bobby Knight.</LD>
<LD>   The Indiana coach, enraged by a no-call, ran wildly onto the court
with 2.6 seconds remaining in Saturday's game with No. 18 Kentucky.
He was ejected, and the No. 6 Hoosiers lost to the Wildcats, 70-64,
at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   Davis' outburst cost Indiana any chance it had of winning. The
Hoosiers (8-1) trailed, 65-64, but Keith Bogans made five of six free
throws awarded to the Wildcats (6-2) for the two technical fouls
called on Davis.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time Davis, who was subdued and apologetic
afterward, had been ejected from a game.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way I should've acted like that," he said. "I can't
explain it. I've done something to embarrass my team.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been a lot of games won with 2.6 seconds on the clock.
I cost us the game. I was so emotional. I need to learn and grow from
this."</TE>
<TE>   It was Davis' second meltdown playing Kentucky in Freedom Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, after an 88-74 loss to the Wildcats, Davis said in
his postgame news conference that he wasn't the man to succeed Bob
Knight as the Hoosier coach.</TE>
<TE>   With Kentucky, a 2 1/2-point favorite, clinging to the 65-64 lead,
Indiana's Bracey Wright drove to the basket and badly missed a layup.
Davis thought the Hoosier freshman was fouled.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I really didn't see it once I went up,"
Wright said. "All I saw were a lot of white jerseys and a lot of
arms. Then, I saw myself going into a cameraman."</TE>
<TE>   Bogans got the rebound, but Davis jumped off the bench and ran to
confront referee Bert Smith near the free-throw line. He slapped his
forehead and screamed that Wright was hit in the face by Kentucky
center Jules Camara.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter what the officials call, sometimes we're wrong and
they're right and we don't know," Davis said. "I do apologize to that
official, because there's no reason for me to act that way."</TE>
<TE>   Television replays showed that Indiana's Jeff Newton, not Camara,
inadvertently grazed Wright, who scored 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky Coach Tubby Smith evaded a question about the decisive
play.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't see it," he said. "I was at the other end of the
court."</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Alabama 69, Providence 61 -- Erwin Dudley and Mo Williams
each scored 19 points at Tuscaloosa, Ala., and the Crimson Tide (8-0)
made seven of eight shots from the free-throw line in the final 1:34
to hold off the Friars (4-3).</TE>

<HD>This Time, Clippers Hold Off Nuggets</HD>
<DH>Olowokandi's big plays in final minute preserve a 92-89 win
and avoid a repeat of last month's collapse in Denver.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the end Saturday night, the Clippers had the look of a weary and
wounded marathon runner searching for an elusive finish line that
just must be around the next corner.</LD>
<LD>   The Denver Nuggets were nipping at their heels, huffing and
puffing and threatening to take away a victory from the
energy-depleted Clippers, when Michael Olowokandi leaped twice to
snatch the game back in the closing moments.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi blocked Nene Hilario's driving layup attempt, then made
a hook shot on the other end to preserve the Clippers' hard-earned
92-89 victory before a relieved crowd of 15,503 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi scored 18 points in 43 minutes before fouling out with
6.4 seconds remaining, one of four starters with 10 or more points.
Marko Jaric led the Clippers with 22 points in 43 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were again without three-fifths of their starting
lineup, with power forward Elton Brand (strained calf), small forward
Lamar Odom (sprained ankle) and Eric Piatkowski (abdominal strain)
sitting out. Plus, top reserves Quentin Richardson (sprained ankle)
and Corey Maggette (knee surgery) also couldn't play.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers have been making do without Odom and Maggette for
some time now, but they were hurting again without Brand, Piatkowski
and Richardson. And still the Clippers were in a position to pull off
an unlikely victory, their 12th in 28 games before their five-day
holiday break.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a real hard team to play against," Clipper Coach Alvin
Gentry said of the Nuggets, who lost their eighth consecutive game.
"This is the team that held Dallas to 80 points the other night
[during an 80-75 loss], so we knew it was going to be a tough game to
play."</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 69-62, after Juwan Howard scored the last of his 13
points in the third quarter on a jump shot, the Clippers rallied to a
73-69 lead going into the fourth. Tremaine Fowlkes fueled the
Clippers' 11-0 run in the final 3:41 of the quarter by scoring eight
of his career-best 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers' run continued into the final quarter, with Jaric
driving for a layup and Keyon Dooling adding two free throws for a
77-69 lead. The Nuggets went without a point until Howard's layup
with 8:57 remaining in the game ended a 15-0 Clipper run.</TE>
<TE>   Howard added a hook shot, then scored on a driving layup. But he
was about all the Nuggets had going for them. Howard finished with 30
points on 11-for-18 shooting in 37 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all the trouble Howard caused the Clippers, particularly
in scoring 22 points in the second half, they managed to hold the
lead, something they failed to do in squandering a 16-point lead in
the final 9 1/2 minutes of a 72-70 loss Nov. 22 at Denver.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Olowokandi] did a good job on Juwan Howard when we put
him on him late," Gentry said. "We're playing with a lot of guys hurt
and banged up right now. We're not making excuses, but we're a little
depleted right now. To me, this was a great win for the guys. I
didn't see anything negative about it."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams played Friday, the Clippers losing to the Phoenix Suns
at Staples and the Nuggets falling to the Orlando Magic at Denver. So
neither had the advantage of having a day to prepare for Saturday's
game.</TE>
<TE>   Given that this was each team's second game in 24 hours, the play
was crisp enough at times early on. The Nuggets built a 50-40 lead
with 3:51 left in the second quarter and appeared set to end a
seven-game losing streak, but the Clippers roared back with a 12-2
run to close out the half. The Clippers' nine-for-15 shooting (60%)
in the second quarter kept them in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We needed a win before the holiday break and we got it," Fowlkes
said. "We knew they were going to come out and play hard, especially
defensively. It feels really good to get the win."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Clippers' five-day holiday layoff couldn't have come at a better
time for the battered and bruised team. The list of injured grew
again during Friday's loss to the Phoenix Suns, when backup guard
Quentin Richardson sprained his left ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Richardson would have to sit out Saturday against the Denver
Nuggets.</LD>
<LD>   And there was more.</LD>
<TE>   Point guard Andre Miller's sprained left ankle was not
significantly improved and his status for Saturday's game also was
uncertain until tipoff. Miller is scheduled to sit out while the team
practices Monday, Tuesday and Thursday in an attempt to reduce the
swelling and soreness in his ankle, injured Nov. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, power forward Elton Brand sat out his second game
because of a strained right calf. Shooting guard Eric Piatkowski was
sidelined for his sixth game because of a lower abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   Small forwards Corey Maggette and Lamar Odom continued to be
sidelined by knee and ankle injuries, although each is moving closer
to a return to the court. Maggette is expected back early next month
and Odom is tentatively scheduled to play for the first time in 11
months next Saturday against the Golden State Warriors.</TE>
<TE>   Odom suggested to The Times on Friday that he might consider
moving up his return date to Friday's game at Phoenix, the Clippers'
first game after their five-game break. He said it again Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm thinking about coming back on the road," he said. "Less
pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Of the string of injuries that have derailed the Clippers' hopes
to move into playoff contention and stay there from the start of the
season, Coach Alvin Gentry said, "We play and get into a rhythm and
somebody else gets hurt. You can't do anything about it. The players
don't want to be hurt. The coaches don't want them to be hurt. You've
just got to deal with it."</TE>

<KH>LAKER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Bryant Tries to Locate Positive Side</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Sometimes, on their way from the bus, or to the practice floor,
particularly in the hour or so after a loss, the Lakers appear so
weary, exhausted from carrying the weight of their terrible start.</LD>
<LD>   Not only have they been unable to turn around their games -- they
are 10-18, 7-9 since Shaquille O'Neal returned from surgery -- but
they are asked relentlessly to sort through the reasons and their
feelings about them.</LD>
<LD>   Kobe Bryant said it's OK, that he's actually regaining some of his
early strength, apparently sapped in the first month without O'Neal.</LD>
<TE>   "You have to take the good with the bad," he said. "Sometimes in a
negative situation, it's tough to find positives. But they're there.
You just have to seek them out. There are a lot of positives to be
learned from this game and the last one. We just have to learn from
them, as well as the negative ones, and move on to the next one."</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher, rubbing a jaw slammed by Allen Iverson in Friday's
overtime loss in Philadelphia, said the Lakers can turn it around.</TE>
<TE>   "As bad as it hurts to have this record," he said, "we can come
back tomorrow, keep chipping away at it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers flew to Toronto on Saturday morning and held a light,
semi-mandatory practice several hours later.</TE>
<TE>   Those who played heavy minutes were given the day off, leaving the
rest to a game of three on three. Several regulars did take treatment
and lift weights, including Bryant, who matched his career high by
playing 52 minutes the night before.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant is shooting 44.2% from the field, which, if it holds for
the season's next two-thirds, would be his lowest percentage since
1997-98, his second year in the league.</TE>
<TE>   Among those shooting lower than their career percentages: Bryant,
Rick Fox, Robert Horry and Devean George.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At last, on a trip through Minnesota, New Jersey and Philadelphia,
a fair fight for the 10-18 Lakers: the 8-18 Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   Vince Carter is on the injured list because he strained his right
knee in practice two weeks ago. He sat out 10 games early in the
season because of a sore left knee.</TE>
<TE>   Carter still leads all Eastern Conference players in the All-Star
voting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   There was no sign of O'Neal after Friday night's loss in
Philadelphia, perhaps in part due to frustration with his free-throw
shooting. He missed 11 of 19, including all six in the fourth
quarter, two with 31 seconds left in regulation that would have given
the Lakers the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about O'Neal's postgame demeanor, Bryant said, "Shaq was his
usual. He's just upset. You'd have to ask him how he's really
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is shooting 62.1% from the line in 15 games, 48.5% on the
road trip.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant visited his parents while in Philadelphia.... George is
expected to play today after spraining his ankle against
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY</TE>

<TE>   Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site -- Air Canada Centre.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KLAC (570), KWKW (1330).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Lakers 10-18, Raptors 8-18.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Raptors (2001-02) -- 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- There are plenty of Laker castoffs in Toronto. Lindsey
Hunter, who was in the deal for Kareem Rush and Tracy Murray,
averages 10.7 points a game. Jelani McCoy has started 10 games at
center, Greg Foster nine games. The Lakers haven't lost in Toronto
since Nov. 8, 1996. Two years ago, Bryant scored 40 points in a game
at Air Canada Centre. Alvin Williams, Voshon Lenard and Morris
Peterson average between 15 and 16 points a game for the Raptors.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Marion believes the secret to defeating the Sacramento Kings is
to mimic them on offense and outwork them on defense.</LD>
<LD>   "We rebounded the ball, we pushed the ball. We pretty much got
into their style of game, but we played defense," Marion said.</LD>
<LD>   Marion and Stephon Marbury scored 28 points apiece, and the
Phoenix Suns defeated the Kings, 110-101, Saturday night at home for
their sixth victory in seven games.</LD>
<TE>   The Suns negating Chris Webber's first triple-double in nearly two
years. Webber finished with 29 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 56 seconds, Marion had a basket and two free throws, a
defensive rebound and a steal off an inbounds pass to snuff out
Sacramento's attempt to rally.</TE>
<TE>   After two losses to the division-leading Kings this season,
including 95-86 on Tuesday, Coach Frank Johnson stressed the need to
stop the fastbreak.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a conscious effort to get back on defense so they
wouldn't get easy baskets," Johnson said. "A lot of times those are
momentum-stoppers."</TE>
<TE>   Portland 81, Seattle 80 -- Derek Anderson made a three-point
basket with 1.4 seconds left to lift the Trail Blazers at home.</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, who had 27 points, scored on a layup with 8.3 seconds
left to pull Portland to within 79-78. Rasheed Wallace fouled Vitaly
Potapenko with 6.9 seconds left, but Potapenko made only one of his
free throws.</TE>
<TE>   After a timeout, Anderson connected from 25 feet.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio 92, Washington 81 -- Tony Parker scored 21 points for
host San Antonio, including consecutive three-point baskets in the
final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The Spurs trailed by 10 points at the half but made 22 of 36 shots
after the break to end Washington's three-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 110, Indiana 103 -- Jalen Rose scored all but three of his
28 points in the fourth quarter to lift the Bulls at home.</TE>
<TE>   Rose, who threw away his sneakers following the Bulls' loss at
Indiana on Friday, missed his first eight shots for the second
consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   But he scored Chicago's last 16 points, and his 25 points in the
fourth quarter was a United Center record for points in a quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Atlanta 79, Philadelphia 77 -- Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 28
points at Atlanta, and the Hawks ended a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Allen Iverson, who played 48 minutes Friday in an overtime victory
over the Lakers, made only six of 28 shots and finished with 13
points.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 89, Cleveland 82 -- Antoine Walker scored 23 points at
Cleveland to help the Celtics overcome a 19-point deficit and the
ejection of Paul Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   Pierce and the Cavaliers' Zydrunas Ilgauskas were ejected for
fighting with 11:15 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   The Cavaliers did not make a field goal over a 10:07 span of the
third and fourth quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 98, Houston 86 -- Troy Hudson made five three-point
baskets in the first half and teammate Kevin Garnett dominated the
second half at Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Garnett had 27 points, 11 rebounds and five assists. He scored 13
of Minnesota's 21 points in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 100, Detroit 92 -- Jason Kidd had 27 points, 12 assists
and five steals to help the Nets win their ninth in a row at home and
end the Pistons' season-high six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey is 14-1 at home, losing only to Dallas, which has the
NBA's best record.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Wallace had 11 points and 14 rebounds for Detroit, which lost
for the first time since Dec. 7. The Pistons committed 23 turnovers.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 94, New York 90 -- Sam Cassell scored 25 points,
including two key jump shots in the closing seconds, to lead the host
Bucks.</TE>
<TE>   Cassell made a jump shot from the top of the key with 58 seconds
left and a three-pointer 35 seconds later.</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Day 53 of the Lakers Held Hostage by Themselves....</LD>
<LD>   It's getting scary out here. Whenever the Lakers go into a new
town, the other team bows down beforehand, praising their name
forever, but what they really mean is: We can't be that lucky that
these prima donnas are going to lie down for us too, can we?</LD>
<LD>   The media is piling on for all it's worth. Reporters say Shaquille
O'Neal looks w-a-y overweight (actually, he looks as if he has
knocked off a quick 20 pounds since he got back) and isn't twirling
about as he used to (they must not have seen him for a while; we're
not talking about Mikhail Baryshnikov here).</LD>
<TE>   Magic Johnson, doing a Turner gig, calls the losses at Minnesota
and New Jersey two of the worst in Laker history, which would be
true, if he meant very recent Laker history.</TE>
<TE>   The interesting thing about that is what it suggests about the
inner workings of the Laker organization, of which Magic is still a
co-owner:</TE>
<TE>   It's getting scary in there too.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, as Wall Street insiders know that a Time cover on boom
times is actually a contrary indicator, meaning sell and run for your
life, a consensus among sportswriters usually means that story is
over and a new one has begun.</TE>
<TE>   And it seemed to last week, when the pieces that had been so
scattered for so long seemed to fall back into place.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal not only looked ready physically but emotionally, over his
snit at his teammates who were now "my guys" again, and over his
embarrassment when the media (yes, us again) blew it up so much
bigger than he intended.</TE>
<TE>   He uttered his famous unprintable words about teammates who
weren't doing anything after the loss at Golden State in an offhand
manner, over his shoulder, outside the dressing room as he walked to
the bus. Of course, a week before, he had snapped off a similar
compliment after a loss at Utah, where he said, pointedly and not in
an offhand manner, he wanted eight teammates who played hard.</TE>
<TE>   The Utah comment elicited raised eyebrows. The Golden State
comment came on a slow news day and triggered a feeding frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Shaq, of course, wasn't talking, so reporters settled for asking
his teammates how they would feel about being traded, and how long
they thought the organization would give them, which did wonders for
their confidence.</TE>
<TE>   This resulted in more losses ... and Shaq holing up even more ...
and teammates joking about it ... and the jokes getting in the paper
... and even deeper gloom and still more losses.</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the Kobe Bryant problem.</TE>
<TE>   Worn out and banged up from trying to carry the team before O'Neal
came back, he now went into a never-before-seen Avery Johnson Mode in
which he'd barely shoot, until his competitive instincts took over at
the end, as when he scored 21 of his 27 points in the fourth quarter
in their rally against the Dallas Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   When asked if he was hurt, he said he was fine, he just couldn't
attack from the top of the triangle with defenders clogging the lane,
although he always had.</TE>
<TE>   What was really going on was Kobe's version of challenging his
teammates to make a shot:</TE>
<TE>   Here's the rock, do something with it.</TE>
<TE>   And if they missed, he was going to throw it to them again until
they made one.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't totally off the wall, as Bryant has been at moments in
his arch-precocious career, but it was going too far in the other
direction. The Lakers need Kobe to score and not only after they
trail by double figures in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The big guys are supposed to make the game easier for the little
guys, and that wasn't happening.</TE>
<TE>   Happily for the Lakers, Bryant was amenable to Phil Jackson's
suggestion to open up and took 29 shots at New Jersey on Thursday.
Unhappily for them, the timing wasn't great because Kobe had a bad
cold, hadn't tried that sort of thing in a while and missed 21.</TE>
<TE>   It came together at Philadelphia the next night where the big guys
were great and the little guys fell in line behind them ... right up
until the moment that Rick Fox missed that pass going in for the
winning layup.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Robert Horry's pass was behind Fox, coming over his
shoulder, Jackson having drawn the unorthodox play up with five
seconds left, knowing the defense would jump on Bryant and Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Omens notwithstanding, a loss was a loss and the more they pile
up, the more corrosive they are.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant got visibly upset at not getting the ball from Derek Fisher
once. O'Neal, who talked before the game, almost stopping the
presses, didn't afterward, as is his custom when he's upset, although
he would make things easier on himself, and everyone around him if he
did Phil's "What, me worry?" act.</TE>
<TE>   At this late date, the Lakers need more than things falling in
place, or good effort. From now on, it will be about wins.</TE>
<TE>   Not that this should be a surprise, after their last two harrowing
title defenses.</TE>
<TE>   It's only that it never has been quite this bad before.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's Chicago Bulls posted the best record in the East in five
of their six title runs, overcoming incredible distractions -- the
furor over Michael Jordan's gambling, over "The Jordan Rules,"
Jackson's feud with General Manager Jerry Krause, Scottie Pippen
calling owner Jerry Reinsdorf "a liar," Dennis Rodman -- because the
team was so hungry and so together.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers have been best in the West once in three title runs and
last season didn't even win their division.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulls' organization was dysfunctional, but the team fell in
line behind the relentless Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers run a nice, family organization, but the team is wacky.
O'Neal gets upset and Bryant is always in the process of re-inventing
himself. So far we have seen Child Kobe, Estranged From Everyone
Kobe, Feuding With Shaq Kobe, Balanced Super-Duper Kobe and, of
course, the recent Avery Kobe.</TE>
<TE>   "It's true," Jackson said last week of the difference between the
united Bulls and the ever-negotiating Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to embellish on it," he added, laughing, lapsing into
moon-speak to keep from reflecting harshly on anyone, "but I think
it's kind of a seismograph energy coming from the earth, that's what
I attribute it to.</TE>
<TE>   "Astrologically, we don't fit together as a team quite as well as
that [Bulls] group did. And the conjunctions of certain planets have
kept us apart."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, that's all it is.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, for you letter writers who think Phil has chilled too
much and needs to be defrosted, did you notice how many titles the
Lakers won in O'Neal's first three seasons, and how many in the next
three with Jackson? What do you think that was, a coincidence?</TE>
<TE>   Happily for the Lakers, for three seasons O'Neal and Bryant have
gotten where they needed to be in time, and they seemed to be heading
there last week too.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, they're out of time, so they'd better have
their planets together.</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   David Stern's desire to encourage minority ownership collided with
his desire to involve Larry Bird, but the owners settled the issue
the old-fashioned way, they sold their latest Charlotte franchise to
the richest bidder. That was Robert Johnson, the first black majority
owner of a major league team (although that was of more importance
symbolically than in fact, because two blacks, Bertram Lee and Peter
Bynoe, had minority stakes but operating control of the Denver
Nuggets in the early '90s.).... Bird said he was "heartbroken" but
shouldn't have been surprised. When big numbers are involved, as when
the owners are putting the usual astronomical price tag on an
expansion team, sentiment disappears fast, as in Toronto, when they
passed up Magic Johnson's group.</TE>
<TE>   Wild Bunch, still riding: First Pippen, whose contract is up at
the end of the season, ripped owner Paul Allen and General Manager
Bob Whitsitt: "It's always changes in Portland. We come as close as
anyone to beating the Lakers against the greatest center ever. Then
they let Jermaine O'Neal go. They go get Shawn Kemp. That had to be
the worst move in pro sports." Then they won four in a row. Then they
got into a postgame melee with the Warriors, with Rasheed Wallace
going into the stands after a fan.... Former Denver Coach Doug Moe,
on the Dallas Mavericks: "I like them a lot. I like the openness of
their style. Why can't they win it this year? Sacramento runs maybe
more than Dallas does and the only reason the Kings didn't win it
last year was they choked. Was it because they were running? No, they
just took the gas down the stretch. But they were every bit as good
as the Lakers. Dallas is right there too. Just tell them if they get
there not to choke."</TE>
<TE>   Miami's Pat Riley said referee Steve Javie told him the officials
were enjoying his struggles, claiming that showed the refs were out
to get him, and was, of course, fined $50,000. Because referees stick
together like cops, and there's zero percentage in upsetting them,
Riles then came back with a gentler version of his predicament: "This
is really the bottom line for me: When I was coaching teams that had
a lot of talent and I coached against teams that were perceived to be
bad, I knew that I had an edge without having to say anything. I just
felt it with Magic and Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar]. It's like a cushion
that you have, a subconscious, psychological cushion. We're right now
perceived to be a bad team. I know now that I'm on the other side of
it and I feel it." In other words, things are just evening out for
Riley, calls-wise and otherwise.... Another week, another quantum
leap for Yao Ming, including his eye-popping 29-point performance
against Indiana that featured his
drive-reverse-reverse-again-lay-it-up shot that teammate Steve
Francis named "the double Dream Shake." ... Houston Coach Rudy
Tomjanovich on Yao: "He's a different player than Hakeem Olajuwon.
But in Dream's development, we would be on the bench and say, 'My
God, he stole the ball from a guard.' With Yao, it's different
things. The passes are unbelievable." ... Memphis Coach Hubie Brown
rediscovered hard-working 6-10 Lorenzen Wright, who was once thought
to be available, but now starts at center and is off the trading
block. Wright: "When Hubie came, I saw Bill Fitch [Wright's coach
with the Clippers.] Hubie came in hard, talking crazy. I'd been there
before. I learned that as long as you work hard, you don't have any
problems with that type of coach."</TE>

Taking a Tumble
The Lakers, after winning three consecutive NBA championships, appear
to be going from banner to bummer this season. Some other sports
dynasties that fell apart in one season even with presence of star
players:
NBA
BOSTON CELTICS
Won 10 NBA championships in 11 seasons, including 1967-68 and
1968-69. Despite the presence of John Havlicek in 1969-70, the
Celtics fell to 34-48 and forced coach-turned-general manager Red
Auerbach to go cold turkey on his victory cigars by not making the
playoffs. The 2002-03 Lakers are on pace to win 29 games, or as Tom
Heinsohn, the coach of that 1969-70 Celtic team, would say, taking "a
hard fall."
BASEBALL
NEW YORK YANKEES
Appeared in five consecutive World Series from 1960-64, winning two.
Despite the presence of Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford, the Yankees
fell to 77-85 and a sixth-place finish in the 10-team American League
in 1965. With no George Steinbrenner around yet to take care of
business, Yankee impostors such as Horace Clarke and Roger Repoz took
over the team, which didn't resurface in the World Series for 11 more
seasons
NFL
GREEN BAY PACKERS
Won three consecutive NFL championships -- including the first two
Super Bowls -- from 1965-67, after which Vince Lombardi stepped down
as coach. The Packers fell to 6-7-1 in 1968 -- even with Bart Starr,
Forrest Gregg, Ray Nitschke, Herb Adderley and Willie Wood still in
their prime -- and wouldn't experience a true Run to Glory until
three decades later by winning the Super Bowl in the 1996 season
NHL
TORONTO MAPLE LEAFS
Won four Stanley Cup championships in six seasons (1961-62, 1962-63,
1963-64, 1966-67). Then the Leafs became brittle and old in 1967-68
and didn't make the playoffs despite the presence of future Hall of
Famers George Armstrong, Tim Horton, Frank Mahovlich, Marcel
Pronovost and Bob Pulford. Even the Kings, in their first NHL season,
made the playoffs</TE>

<LD>   GAME OF THE WEEK</LD>
<LD>   SACRAMENTO AT LAKERS</LD>
<TE>*--*
Rk  Team (Record)          Comment (last week's position)
1   DALLAS  (22-4)         Mavericks won 22 of first 25 games and
                           still have the Kings breathing down their
                           necks. (1)
2   SACRAMENTO  (21-8)     Bibby's return last week restores game's
                           deepest backcourt (Jackson, Christie,
                           Turkoglu). (2)
3   SAN ANTONIO  (17-10)   Spurs look ready to rumble too after
                           holding Kings 18 under average in win at
                           Arco. (4)
4   DETROIT  (18-8)        Pistons look ordinary, but as Nets' Thorn
                           notes, their second team is almost as good
                           as first. (10)
5   NEW ORLEANS  (18-10)   After beating Lakers at Staples, Hornets
                           lost at Sacramento, Portland, Golden
                           State. (3)
6   NEW JERSEY  (18-9)     Nets thought Jefferson was an emerging
                           star, not merely young and promising. (5)
7   INDIANA  (19-8)        Oops: To hit Yao, new Bad Boy Brad Miller
                           has to hit Jermaine O'Neal, hurts his
                           knee. (6)
8   HOUSTON  (15-11)       Prodigies' benchmark: Shaq averaged 23-14
                           as rookie. Yao at 18-12 this month. (11)
9   PHILADELPHIA  (18-10)  Win with Iverson's makes, lose with
                           misses, but 76ers have got that lovin'
                           feeling back. (8)
10  BOSTON  (18-9)         Oops: Celtics lost to Bulls, Heat last
                           week and 18 of their next 28 are on the
                           road. (9)
11  SEATTLE  (14-14)       Payton mellow (for him) at 34, never
                           better, shoots 46% with career-high 9.4
                           assists. (12)
12  PHOENIX  (16-11)       That's Amare: Averaging 13-9 this month,
                           throws monumental one down on Olowokandi.
                           (14)
13  MINNESOTA  (15-13)     Everyone complains about Brandon, but
                           Timberwolves were 32-15 when he left last
                           season. (13)
14  UTAH  (13-12)          Jazz slipping back into dotage after 9-1
                           run and just lost Jarron Collins for
                           season. (7)
15  ORLANDO  (15-13)       Garrity comes through with 48 points in
                           two games as Hill sits out again, McGrady
                           hurts back. (16)
16  PORTLAND  (15-11)      Someone (Wallace? Wells?) probably must go
                           after postgame melee at Oakland. (18)
17  CLIPPERS  (12-16)      Check that desultory Phoenix loss to see
                           what they would be like without Elton
                           Brand. (17)
18  LAKERS  (10-18)        Their problem is, 10-18 isn't really a
                           slow start, it's more like bad first half
                           of the season. (15)
19  WASHINGTON  (12-14)    Still Jordan after all these 39 years:
                           After two-point embarrassment, he scores
                           30 and 33. (21)
20  ATLANTA  (11-15)       Kruger era shaky as Hawks go 0-5,
                           including home loss to Wizards, rival for
                           playoffs. (19)
21  MILWAUKEE  (11-15)     The only colleague having a worse season
                           than Sen. Kohl's team is Trent Lott. (20)
22  NEW YORK  (8-15)       Doesn't take very much in the East: Knicks
                           spruce up as 3-0 run brings them near No.
                           8. (24)
23  GOLDEN STATE  (9-17)   Most improved player is easy thus far,
                           that's amazing 5-5 Earl Boykins, the
                           Clipper castoff. (23)
24  CHICAGO  (10-17)       Doesn't take very much in the East: A 3-0
                           run persuades Bulls they're contenders
                           too. (27)
25  MEMPHIS  (8-20)        Geriatric coach/kiddie roster continue
                           surge, with a 6-2 run after Grizzlies'
                           2-18 start. (25)
26  MIAMI  (8-18)          That's so you: After Riley rails that
                           referees are out to get him, Heat wins two
                           in row. (29)
27  TORONTO  (8-18)        With both Antonio Davis and Vince Carter
                           out, this is more like an expansion team.
                           (22)
28  CLEVELAND  (5-24)      Sounds like Trail Blazer material: Ricky
                           Davis rips fans, then posts third 40-point
                           game. (28)
29  DENVER  (6-22)         Kiki trades best, Posey, betting the house
                           he can get someone to move in next
                           summer.(26)</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   When -- Wednesday. Time -- 5:30 p.m. TV -- Ch. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Story line -- Not that this marquee matchup has lost its glow
entirely, but as King Coach Rick Adelman noted recently, "Didn't
Dallas make that a moot point?" Nevertheless, it's an important game
... especially for the Lakers, who have to show everyone, including
themselves, they can still play with the big guys.</TE>

<LD>**** Makings of a classic</LD>
<LD>   *** Smash-mouth football</LD>
<LD>   ** Good for an end around</LD>
<TE>   * Strictly fantasy fodder</TE>
<TE>*--*
** Detroit (3-11) at Atlanta (8-5-1), 10 a.m.: After a couple of
listless performances by Falcon quarterback Michael Vick, this seems
like a good time for him to build some momentum for the playoffs,
considering Lions have lost 15 in a row on the road. LINE: Atlanta by
10 1/2
*** Buffalo (7-7) at Green Bay (11-3), 10 a.m.: "I can't fathom
losing at home," Green Bay Coach Mike Sherman says, in general.
Neither can Packers, who are 80-12 at Lambeau Field since Brett Favre
became quarterback in 1992. Cold-weather Bills do seem to be an ideal
opponent to crack the armor. LINE: Green Bay by 6 1/2
* Houston (4-10) at Washington (5-9), 10 a.m.: Texans motivated to
win one for General Manager Charley Casserly and the 15 other former
Redskin front-office employees who escaped Daniel Snyder to work in
Houston. How do you think Snyder would feel having the same number of
victories as an expansion team? LINE: Washington by 6 1/2
* Chicago (4-10) at Carolina (5-9), 10 a.m.: We know Bear quarterback
Chris Chandler has had his share of concussions, but couldn't he have
articulated his feelings a little better about what a victory will
mean? "A win is the best deodorant. There is some saying about that,
that it makes everything smell better." LINE: Carolina by 3
*** New York Giants (8-6) at Indianapolis (9-5), 10 a.m., Channel 11:
Giants have won five of seven since Coach Jim Fassel took over
play-calling from offensive coordinator Sean Payton. No truth to
rumor that Lawrence Taylor will be brought in to make calls on
defense the last two games. LINE: Indianapolis by 5
*** Tennessee (9-5) at Jacksonville (6-8), 10 a.m.: Don't count on
Titan cornerback Samari Rolle trying to knock Jaguar quarterback Mark
Brunell from the game again. Five of Rolle's 15 interceptions have
come against Brunell. LINE: Tennessee by 3
*** San Diego (8-6) at Kansas City (7-7), 10 a.m., Channel 2, KNX
(1070): Preemptive strike by Charger Coach Marty Schottenheimer, who
will make his return to Kansas City and will be subjected to a vocal
crowd against him: "Kansas City and their fans are as fine a group as
I've ever been around." That'll soften 'em up. LINE: Kansas City by 1
1/2
* New Orleans (9-5) at Cincinnati (1-13), 10 a.m.: Burning question
of the week: Can someone explain how giving away unwanted Bengals'
tickets to underprivileged kids in the Cincinnati area actually
improves their quality of life? LINE: New Orleans by 7
** St. Louis (6-8) at Seattle (5-9), 1 p.m., KXTA (1150), XTRA (690):
Marc Bulger of Rams will try to become only the fourth NFL
quarterback since 1970 to start his career 7-0. But, on second
thought, does he want to join a group that includes Dieter Brock,
Daunte Culpepper and Mike Tomczak? LINE: Seattle by 1
**** Denver (8-6) at Oakland (9-5), 1:15 p.m., Channel 2, KMPC
(1540), KNX (1070): Lincoln Kennedy says, "We're fighting for our
life." Charles Woodson says, "We still got some things to shoot for."
No, these aren't desperate tactics against Raider fans who have
turned on them. The players simply know how much is on the line this
week. LINE: Oakland by 4
*** Cleveland (7-7) at Baltimore (7-7), 1:15 p.m.: Finally a matchup
between these two teams that doesn't shove the
Art-Modell-taking-the-old-Browns-to-Baltimore card in everyone's face
as the primary source for motivation. There are actual playoff
implications this time. LINE: Baltimore by 3
*** New York Jets (7-7) at New England (8-6), 5:30 p.m., ESPN,
KLSX-FM (97.1): Jets coming off a loss to the 4-10 Chicago Bears.
Patriots coming off their worst game in a loss to Tennessee. Good to
see that these AFC teams are heading into the postseason on a roll.
LINE: New England by 4
*** Pittsburgh (8-5-1) at Tampa Bay (11-3), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel
7, KNX (1070): Buccaneers, or "paper champions" as Steeler Lee
Flowers likes to call them, have their best chance yet to quiet the
critics. Or as receiver Keenan McCardell says: "The only way to shut
people up is go out and put it on them." LINE: Tampa Bay by 4</TE>

<KH>MINNESOTA 20, MIAMI 17</KH>
<HD>Anderson Has Plenty of Kick Left</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Vikings had nothing to lose. So why not let Randy Moss
throw the ball and send a 43-year-old kicker out for his longest
field-goal attempt in four years?</LD>
<LD>   Moss threw a 13-yard touchdown pass to give Minnesota the lead
early in the fourth quarter, and Gary Anderson's 53-yard kick with 17
seconds left gave the Vikings a 20-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins
on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Anderson's previous long this season was 44 yards, and his last
field goal of 50 yards or more was a 53-yarder on Dec. 20, 1998
against Jacksonville.</LD>
<TE>   Even though Anderson hadn't tried a field-goal attempt as long as
53 yards since that game against the Jaguars, the NFL's all-time
leading scorer was confident.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to bring your driver out," Anderson said with a laugh.
"It's not a five-iron shot."</TE>
<TE>   The defeat prevented the Dolphins (9-6) from clinching a playoff
spot. They lead New England by a half-game in the AFC East and can
win the division by beating the Patriots in Foxboro, Mass., next
week. A loss could leave them out of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Life is simple for the next seven days," said defensive end Jason
Taylor, who had 1 1/2 of his league-leading 18 1/2 sacks. "Win, or
we're home for New Year's."</TE>
<TE>   Moss, selected to his fourth Pro Bowl this year after being left
off last season, had seven receptions for 110 yards. He has 100
catches this season, 18 more than last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings (5-10) continued taking risks, six days after Daunte
Culpepper ran for a two-point conversion with 10 seconds left in a
32-31 victory at New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   A kick would have sent the game to overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Culpepper kept the pivotal drive going Saturday by running three
yards on fourth and two at the Miami 45.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Coach Mike Tice sent the punt team out, but he called
timeout and changed his mind as Viking fans urged them to go for it.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard them," Tice said. "What the heck? They deserve some fun.
They've been through a long season."</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings reached the 35, and Anderson made the line-drive kick.
It curled right, grazed the right upright and sneaked over the
crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone said he didn't have the leg," Viking center Matt Birk
said. "But he showed he had it, boy."</TE>

<HD>Jones Discusses Cowboys With Parcells</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones met with Bill Parcells for five hours
Wednesday, but no job was offered -- or even specifically discussed,
both said.</LD>
<LD>   "He inquired as to whether I thought I might go back to coaching
or not, or would I consider going back to coaching. But he didn't
specifically ask me would I coach again or, 'Would you coach the
Cowboys?' " Parcells said Saturday on ESPN, for which he is an NFL
analyst.</LD>
<LD>   But the Dallas Morning News, citing sources close to Jones and
Parcells, reported in today's editions that Jones had already decided
to fire Coach Dave Campo.</LD>
<TE>   Parcells, who won two Super Bowls with the New York Giants, said
if he would return for "the absolute right situation."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he wanted Parcells as his coach, Jones said, "I don't
want to get into that."</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys have had three coaches in six seasons, with Campo in
charge the last three. Campo has a 15-32 record, including 5-10 this
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson practiced on a limited basis
because of a severe lower back bruise and remained questionable for
Monday night's game against Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Buccaneer Coach Jon Gruden said a final determination on Johnson's
availability probably will not be made until just before the game,
and that Johnson probably will make the call himself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doctors working for Korey Stringer's widow claim that the Pro Bowl
offensive lineman would have survived heat stroke if the Minnesota
Vikings had given him proper treatment after he collapsed during a
workout.</TE>
<TE>   The five doctors and a trainer made the comments in statements
prepared for Kelci Stringer's wrongful-death lawsuit against the
team, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in June.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for the team and the doctors who treated Stringer
denounced the statements, saying their own experts will show that he
received proper treatment from an informed training staff.</TE>

<HD>Hopefuls, Hopeless Ride AFC Bubble</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>MIKE PENNER</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So the AFC has completed 15 weeks of football, with Week 16 headed
into the books Monday night, and the only teams they've eliminated so
far are the Cincinnati Bengals and the expansion franchise. Is
realignment great or what?</LD>
<LD>   A look at the 14 remaining hangers-on in the AFC, otherwise known
as the Conference on the Bubble, as they are currently seeded:</LD>
<LD>   1. OAKLAND RAIDERS</LD>
<TE>   Why they're here: At various times this season, the Raiders have
been 4-0 and surprisingly sprightly for their age; 4-4 and showing
their years; 9-4 and defying the calendar; and now 9-5 after either
hitting the wall or forgetting to take their medicine last Sunday in
Miami. They own the top spot by virtue of a 52-25 win over Tennessee
on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: The 0-4 slump after the 4-0 start. The
Raiders lost twice in Missouri and twice against California rivals
San Francisco and San Diego, causing many to wonder about the
old-timers' health before November brought a second wind.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: If San Diego loses one of its final two
games, the Raiders can clinch the AFC West title by winning one more
home game -- against Denver today or Kansas City next week.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Yes, but they probably need to sweep to keep
home-field advantage throughout the AFC tournament.</TE>
<TE>   2. TENNESSEE TITANS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Steve McNair wincing through the pain and
leading an 8-1 run after the Titans started 1-4 and had owner Bud
Adams wondering aloud if Jeff Fisher was getting outcoached.
Considering the Titans' apparent dearth of talent -- no players voted
to the Pro Bowl, or one fewer than Cincinnati got -- Fisher ought to
be coach of the year by acclamation.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Consecutive losses to Dallas,
Cleveland, Oakland and Washington in September and October. At the
time, Adams wasn't the only one wondering about Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: The Titans will return to the playoffs if
they win at Jacksonville today or at Houston next Sunday. They win
the AFC South title with one victory and one loss by Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Seems certain. If they sweep their last two games,
and they should, and Oakland loses once, the Titans will have
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   3. PITTSBURGH STEELERS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Tommy Maddox bailed out Kordell Stewart, then
Stewart bailed out Maddox. Along the way, Amos Zereoue bailed out
Jerome Bettis.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Coach Bill Cowher played not to lose
against Atlanta and got exactly that -- a 34-34 tie. Four weeks
later, the Steelers outgained Houston by 375 yards at home -- and
lost by 18 points.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: The Steelers are the only AFC division
leader with more than a one-game lead in the standings. They can
clinch the AFC North title by winning at Tampa Bay on Monday night.
Or, more likely, with a home victory next Sunday against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Probably. But the Steelers figure to lose to Tampa
Bay, turning their season finale into a loser-stays-home showdown
with Baltimore. Cowher versus Brian Billick in a big game? Steeler
fans won't be getting much sleep for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   4. MIAMI DOLPHINS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: On March 8, the Dolphins traded a handful a
draft picks to New Orleans for a running back named Ricky Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: On Oct. 13, quarterback Jay Fiedler
broke the thumb on his passing hand. Without him handing the ball to
Williams, Miami scored 10 points in consecutive games against
Buffalo, Green Bay and the New York Jets and lost them all.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Beat New England next Sunday in New England
and they win the AFC East. Lose and they'll need outside help to
clinch a wild card.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Probably, but Saturday's loss to Minnesota means
they'll probably open the postseason on the road, where the Dolphins
are 0-4 since October.</TE>
<TE>   5. INDIANAPOLIS COLTS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: With little more than used or spare parts, Tony
Dungy turned one of the league's weakest defenses into one of the
best, lowering the Colts' points-allowed average from 31 to 18. Oh,
and Marvin Harrison got open a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Two losses to the Titans.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Most likely, they'll get in by winning one
of their remaining two games, both at home, against the Giants today
and Jacksonville next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Yes. The Colts have two very winnable home games. A
split gets them in. A sweep, coupled with a Tennessee defeat, would
give them the AFC South title.</TE>
<TE>   6. DENVER BRONCOS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Early on, the Broncos fooled us into thinking
they were the best-balanced team in the league. Then they were routed
at home on a Monday night by the Raiders. Then Brian Griese got hurt.
Finally, they ended an 0-3 swoon by holding on at home against Kansas
City, barely.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Night games. The Broncos haven't won a
game played after sunset this season.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Sweep their remaining games -- at Oakland
today and at home against Arizona next Sunday -- and they're in. Lose
one and they'll need San Diego and New England to both finish 1-1.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Very shaky footing. The Broncos lost to the Raiders
by 24 points in Denver. Today they play the rematch in Oakland.
Should the Raiders complete the sweep, the Broncos' postseason hopes
will hinge on two other teams losing.</TE>
<TE>   7. SAN DIEGO CHARGERS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Washington owner Daniel Snyder wasn't happy with
Marty Schottenheimer's 8-8 record last season with the Redskins, so
he spent $25 million to bring in Steve Spurrier, who is now 5-9.
Schottenheimer moved on to San Diego, where his keep-it-safe,
keep-it-grounded approach found a willing accomplice in LaDainian
Tomlinson.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: After a startling 6-1 start, the
Chargers' limited talent has found its level, going 2-5 since
Halloween.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Probably sweep their last two games -- at
Kansas City today, at home against Seattle next Sunday -- and root
for the Raiders today.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Not likely. Priest Holmes' hip injury helps their
chances today, but the Chargers haven't won a road game since
October. After that, they need too much help.</TE>
<TE>   8. NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Win three, lose four, win one, lose one, win
three, lose one.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: A rough first-half schedule, resulting
in consecutive losses to potential playoff teams San Diego, Miami,
Green Bay and Denver.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: The Patriots control their own destiny, and
they play both of their remaining games at home. If they sweep the
Jets and the Dolphins, they will win the AFC East championship.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Their chances are better than Denver's and San
Diego's.</TE>
<TE>   9. CLEVELAND BROWNS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Ten games decided by eight points or fewer. Five
wins, five losses.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: A 2-5 record at home.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Sweep their remaining games -- at Baltimore
today, against Atlanta next Sunday -- and hope for lots of help.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Doubtful. Baltimore is desperate to win today.
Atlanta could be in the same condition if the Falcons don't clinch a
wild card today.</TE>
<TE>   10. NEW YORK JETS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Temporary insanity on the part of Wayne Chrebet.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: The Jets waited too long to make the
switch to Chad Pennington. Playing catch-up from October on, the Jets
stumbled on the last hurdle when Chrebet tried to hurdle four Bears
in Chicago and wound up losing the ball, the game and, most likely,
the wild card.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Sweep the Patriots and the Packers and hope
the Broncos, Chargers, Patriots and Browns all lose.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? The Jets won't go 2-0 against New England and Green
Bay. But Pennington's back for 2003. Not so sure about Chrebet.</TE>
<TE>   11. KANSAS CITY CHIEFS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Their offense.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Their defense.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Sweep San Diego and Oakland and pray for
other miracles.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Their season ends next weekend. On the bright side,
Holmes' hip will have ample time to heal.</TE>
<TE>   12. BALTIMORE RAVENS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: There's no reasonable explanation. After the
salary-cap implosion, the Ravens looked to be rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: They're .500. They're playing over
their heads.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Beat Cleveland today. Then beat Pittsburgh
after the Steelers lose to Tampa Bay. It could happen.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? If the Ravens and Buccaneers win at home, Baltimore
will go to Pittsburgh to play for the AFC North title.</TE>
<TE>   13. BUFFALO BILLS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: Drew Bledsoe's first eight games in Buffalo,
when the Bills went 5-3.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Bledsoe's last six games, when they
went 2-4.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: Sweep Green Bay and Cincinnati and pray for
half the teams seeded above them to collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? Perhaps in 2003, after they draft a defense.</TE>
<TE>   14. JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS</TE>
<TE>   Why they're here: A 3-7 swoon after Tennessee's Samari Rolle
knocked out quarterback Mark Brunell on Oct. 13, leaving them 6-8.</TE>
<TE>   Why they haven't clinched: Many reasons, but Coach Tom Coughlin
blames the kickers. He has cut three this season.</TE>
<TE>   What they need to do: No need to get into all that, really.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff-bound? They have a better chance of moving to Los Angeles
for the 2003 season. Not that we want them or anything.</TE>

<KH>PHILADELPHIA 27, DALLAS 3</KH>
<HD>Eagles Experience Little Resistance</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>IRVING, Texas</DL>
<LD>The Philadelphia Eagles have scored the most points in franchise
history and have matched their most victories in a season. All that's
left is wrapping up home-field advantage in the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Barber returned an interception 80 yards for a touchdown
early in the fourth quarter, giving the Eagles the jolt they needed
to defeat the Dallas Cowboys, 27-3, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Philadelphia (12-3) won its sixth consecutive game and reached 12
wins for the first time since the 1980 squad that made it to the
Super Bowl.</LD>
<TE>   The Eagles can clinch home-field if Green Bay loses today and
Tampa Bay falls Monday night. If either lose, Philadelphia locks up a
first-round bye.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles can secure home-field on their own with a victory in
the finale next Saturday against the New York Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing now is we control our destiny and we can run with
it," said quarterback A.J. Feeley, who completed 19 of 33 for 253
yards to improve to 4-0 as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   The Cowboys (5-10) performed miserably in what might have been the
last home game for Emmitt Smith and Dave Campo.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had only 30 yards in eight carries and was only a decoy in
the goal-line situation that used to be his specialty, marking one of
many questionable coaching moves Campo made -- the kind that might
have prompted owner Jerry Jones to meet with Bill Parcells on
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The Dallas Morning News, citing sources close to Jones and
Parcells, reported today that Jones had already decided to fire
Campo.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas failed to cross midfield until late in the third quarter
and didn't convert a third down. This was the Cowboys' third
consecutive loss, putting them in double-digit losses for the third
successive season -- a first in franchise history.</TE>
<TE>   The team encouraged fans to wear Smith's No. 22 jerseys, and many
obliged.</TE>
<TE>   There also were plenty of signs asking for Smith's return,
including one person who held up a giant check for $7 million that
had "loyalty" in the memo section.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to apologize to all Cowboys' fans. This was an
embarrassing performance," said Smith, who then walked out the back
door of an interview room.</TE>

<KH>SAN FRANCISCO 17, ARIZONA 14</KH>
<HD>Owens Rests, but Garcia Still Shines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>While Terrell Owens rested, Jeff Garcia put in a full day for the San
Francisco 49ers in a game that meant nothing against a team headed
nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   Garcia completed 23 of 39 passes for 256 yards and a touchdown,
and Garrison Hearst ran for a touchdown Saturday as the 49ers held on
for a 17-14 victory over the Arizona Cardinals.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a difficult game to decide how to play, who to use for how
long, and all the reasons why and why not," 49er Coach Steve Mariucci
said.</LD>
<TE>   With the 49ers' playoff position locked -- a home game against a
wild-card team -- Owens took the day off because of a sore groin.</TE>
<TE>   "He hadn't practiced all week, and I want to freshen him up for
the playoffs," Mariucci said.</TE>
<TE>   The NFC West champions (10-5) weathered two missed 42-yard
field-goal attempts by Jeff Chandler, a lost fumble at the Arizona 17
and a late Cardinal rally led by quarterback Jake Plummer.</TE>
<TE>   The 49ers came to Sun Devil Stadium for the first time since a
Monday night game in 1999, when Steve Young went down with what
turned out to be a career-ending concussion. Garcia stepped in and
has been in charge ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Plummer, in what might have been his last home game for Arizona,
nearly engineered his 22nd fourth-quarter comeback.</TE>
<TE>   After Renaldo Hill intercepted Garcia's deflected pass at the San
Francisco 33, Kevin Kasper caught his second touchdown pass of the
game from six yards to cut the lead to 17-14 with 4:08 left.</TE>
<TE>   But the 49ers got a first down at the Cardinals' 33 at the
two-minute warning, then ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   Plummer, whose contract runs out after the season, completed 16 of
26 for 109 yards and two touchdowns. He had one pass intercepted.
Plummer said he treated it like any other game and repeated his
desire to re-sign with the Cardinals.</TE>

<HD>Back in Gear</HD>
<DH>USC's Malaefou MacKenzie thought he was giving up football
after his father's death last year, but he returned from Samoa to get
his life ...</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Malaefou MacKenzie is a USC running back who can swallow the field
with his power.</LD>
<LD>   Matt MacKenzie drops to a knee on that field after every practice
to pray that his late father is watching.</LD>
<LD>   Malaefou MacKenzie is a proud Samoan whose sculpted body is dotted
with the tattoos of a warrior.</LD>
<TE>   Matt MacKenzie curls up his arms and weeps when pondering his
family's pain.</TE>
<TE>   Malaefou MacKenzie will be one of the stable, senior inspirations
for a Trojan team that plays Iowa in next week's Orange Bowl game.</TE>
<TE>   Matt MacKenzie still has a plastic bag filled with blades of grass
as a reminder of when he walked away from it all.</TE>
<TE>   It was last fall, his father had just died of prostate cancer in
Samoa, and the kid with two names was consumed with grief and
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   His father had hugged him, harassed him, lived through him. Now
that he was gone, where did that leave him?</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie needed his family to share his sorrow. His family needed
him to help with their grocery business.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't matter that he was a senior on the verge of graduation.
It didn't matter that, several years ago, he had changed his name
from Matt to Malaefou in hopes of declaring his independence.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, he was Matt again, the name his family still calls him,
his father's little boy again, with history leaving him no choice.</TE>
<TE>   When his father was in college, he had given up a football career
to return to Samoa for his ailing father.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was Matt's turn.</TE>
<TE>   After a mid-October game against Arizona State, he walked to the
Coliseum field, scooped up some grass and said goodbye. He then
climbed on a plane to Samoa with no intention of coming back.</TE>
<TE>   "My career was done," he remembered. "My father was dead and I was
going home where I belonged."</TE>
<TE>   He gave away all of his football gear. He left behind all of his
schoolwork. He took a wrecking ball to old priorities.</TE>
<TE>   He spent the next three months sleeping on a couch in a sweltering
house with no hot water in the tiny town of Vauala on the island of
Upolu.</TE>
<TE>   During the day, he would haul bags of sugar and potatoes at
MacKenzie's wholesalers. At night, he would run for hours along the
city's rocky streets.</TE>
<TE>   For showers, he would stand outside in the rain. For food, he
would eat roadside fried chicken.</TE>
<TE>   For inspiration, he would sit by the plain, unmarked concrete box
that was his father's grave.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, unable to sleep because of the heat, he would jog five
miles to that grave at 3 a.m. Several hours later, his worried sister
would drive to find him there, weeding.</TE>
<TE>   "I was looking for answers," he said. "I was looking for my father
to tell me what to do next."</TE>
<TE>   After the Trojan football season ended in a disappointing loss --
an event he learned about a week later -- he found it.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't in the yelping of the stray dogs that nipped at his feet
while he ran, or the smoky rumble of the city bus that he would board
when he was late for work.</TE>
<TE>   It was in, of all things, the long-distance scratchy voice of
Coach Pete Carroll on a phone call across thousands of miles of
ocean.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted MacKenzie back. He had kept MacKenzie's scholarship.
Even though MacKenzie had walked away and used up his eligibility and
probably would be of no use to the program, Carroll had not cut him
or taken away his tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Said Carroll: "This was about more than football, it was about the
rest of this kid's life."</TE>
<TE>   Said MacKenzie: "I realized I had more than one family."</TE>
<TE>   So, at the urging of both of his families, he returned to school
in January.</TE>
<TE>   At the prodding of USC officials, the NCAA properly gave him a
rare sixth year of eligibility.</TE>
<TE>   And today? While the ending might be storybook, the pages are
still yellowed.</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie had a terrific season, scoring nine touchdowns even
though he touched the ball only 80 times.</TE>
<TE>   But he still mourns. He still aches. He still wonders.</TE>
<TE>   Underneath his jersey, he wears a weathered T-shirt imprinted with
photographs of his late father and late brother Hornell, who had Down
syndrome and died when MacKenzie was 10.</TE>
<TE>   In his room in the house he shares with several other Trojans, he
keeps a cross that was around his father's neck when he died.</TE>
<TE>   Even after splendid plays like the juggling touchdown catch
against Notre Dame, he stands in the end zone wondering what his
father would have thought.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not over it, no," sister Dayna Faupusa said. "He still
sometimes shuts everything out, makes it hard to get through to him."</TE>
<TE>   When the Trojans held their swanky football banquet in Beverly
Hills recently, they gave a courage award to Malaefou MacKenzie.</TE>
<TE>   But Matt couldn't bring himself to leave his house.</TE>
<TE>   "His coaches called me from the banquet in a panic, wondering
where he was," Dayna said. "But I just don't think he was ready to
face all the talk about his father again."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was studying. But, he admits now, he was also hiding.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard the banquet was beautiful," he said. "But I could just
not be there."</TE>
<TE>   He will be there next week in Miami, though, strong and speedy and
alive. To him, it will be more than a game. It will be another step
in the process of Malaefou learning to live with Matt.</TE>
<TE>   It's what college does best. It's what USC has done well. It's
about a boy becoming a man.</TE>
<TE>   "What a story," Carroll said this week, shaking his head. "What a
sad, wonderful story."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   You won't see Malaefou MacKenzie talk about this story on
television. He is not comfortable on TV.</TE>
<TE>   You won't hear him doing a phone interview on the radio. He is
constantly losing his cell phone. Earlier this year, he went four
months without any sort of phone.</TE>
<TE>   He won't want to get rich off this story. As recently as last
year, he was keeping his money in a shoe box under his bed.</TE>
<TE>   He won't drive around town bragging about this story. He gave his
truck to his sister, making him perhaps the only 23-year-old L.A.
personality who walks or bums rides.</TE>
<TE>   "Footmobile," he said with a grin.</TE>
<TE>   Where others of his stature walk around campus in designer gear,
he buys his clothes at a swap meet. Where others like PlayStation, he
prefers dominoes.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm simple like that," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Since he arrived in Mission Viejo from Samoa at age 9, that
simplicity has been both Malaefou MacKenzie's blessing and his curse.</TE>
<TE>   When he was younger, to instill discipline, his mother Stella
would sometimes spank him at school. To instill hard work, his father
Vernon would make him train like a pro, jogging and lifting weights
seemingly from the time he could hold a bottle.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad lived through him," Dayna said. "Because he never realized
his football dream, he would say, 'It's all up to you.' It made it
kind of hard for him."</TE>
<TE>   MacKenzie remembers the time he was half a pound overweight in Pop
Warner football. He said his father drove him home, dropped him off,
and told him to run the four miles back to school before his father
drove there.</TE>
<TE>   "So I ran back to school and when I got there, my dad turned the
car around and I had to run home after him," MacKenzie said. "It was
like that all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Is it any wonder, then, that during his high school years at
Capistrano Valley, police were once summoned to the training room
late at night, only to discover that MacKenzie was lifting weights?</TE>
<TE>   Or, is it any wonder that during his recruiting trip to USC, he
was spotted by other recruits jogging down Figueroa at 2 a.m.?</TE>
<TE>   "Any time I went out partying, I always jogged it off, it didn't
matter what time," he said. "But this time, I was really
embarrassed."</TE>
<TE>   He truly had become his father's son, so much that his father
asked the USC coaches to harness his spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Unbowed, MacKenzie vowed to work even harder to give his dad a
Pacific 10 Conference championship ring.</TE>
<TE>   But his father became sick and even more stubborn. And in January
2001, he moved back to Samoa full time. It turns out, he was moving
back to die.</TE>
<TE>   Said Malaefou: "I always thought he was going to come back for my
senior season."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dayna: "My father knew what he was doing. He didn't want
anybody to see him suffer."</TE>
<TE>   In the final days, he even sent his wife to the United States to
arrange for hospital care, but he never joined her.</TE>
<TE>   At 3 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001, Malaefou awoke in his off-campus
apartment with a funny feeling inside. When he later heard about the
terrorist devastation, he thought that was it.</TE>
<TE>   But then his mother showed up at his door crying about his father,
and he knew he was wrong.</TE>
<TE>   At first, he blamed himself. If he had not suffered a sprained
knee, maybe his father would have joined his mother here to watch
him, and received better treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he blamed life for splitting up a family with an ocean
between them.</TE>
<TE>   Because they could not get a flight back for two weeks, he had
time to blame plenty of things.</TE>
<TE>   When he arrived in Samoa, he was so distraught he could not look
at his father's body until just before the casket was closed. Then he
tossed in a red No. 21 Trojan jersey and turned away.</TE>
<TE>   He initially returned to Los Angeles and the team, but his mind
stayed in Samoa.</TE>
<TE>   "I was numb, I was lost, I was depressed like never before, the
worst in my life," he said. "I didn't know what I was doing. I didn't
know why I was there."</TE>
<TE>   Teammates and coaches noticed.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything like it," said Carson Palmer, one of his
roommates. "He was just out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Added Carroll: "We were genuinely concerned that he could make it
to the next day, then the day after that."</TE>
<TE>   When his mother felt this in their phone conversations, she told
him to come home. He said he wanted to, but he didn't have the
strength.</TE>
<TE>   One day, after he had been back about a week, she put down the
phone, climbed on a plane, and took the 11-hour flight to get him.</TE>
<TE>   "I needed to be with my family," he said. "But I needed help
getting there."</TE>
<TE>   Once back in Samoa, a place he had not lived for 14 years, he said
it was culture shock. The humidity was stifling, the work
overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "I would get up at 3 a.m. because I just couldn't sleep," he said.
"Running was the only way I could relax."</TE>
<TE>   The only news from USC came off the computer in the office of the
wholesaler. He would talk to his teammates every couple of weeks, but
only for a couple of minutes, with his old life seeming more distant
with each call.</TE>
<TE>   As his arms grew sore from carrying 100-pound bags of sugar, and
his back grew sore from bumpy rides delivering food around the
island, he started to wonder.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes I would hit myself in the head and say, 'What are you
doing here?' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   It would be those times when he would find himself sitting next to
his father's grave, remembering something his father always told him.</TE>
<TE>   Be like me, but don't be like me. Take care of your family, but
don't lose yourself doing it.</TE>
<TE>   "What finally came out was that Matt was so close to graduation,
so close to all his dreams, he needed to finish it," Dayna said. "He
needed to do it not for my dad, but for himself."</TE>
<TE>   Whether it be a mother or father or any other mentor, isn't that
what all young people have to eventually learn?</TE>
<TE>   Slowly and painfully, Malaefou MacKenzie is learning it.</TE>
<TE>   He is going to try to make it in the NFL, where Carroll thinks he
has a chance because of his versatility. But if he doesn't, he's
going to be a policeman or a fireman.</TE>
<TE>   He agreed to accept that courage award in the coach's office. But
he's going to give it to a relative.</TE>
<TE>   He's thinking about himself more, but not forgetting the person
who once walked away from his life because he thought it would help
others.</TE>
<TE>   He's celebrating Malaefou, without losing Matt.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best man I've ever met in my life," said Palmer,
quarterback for USC's Pac-10 co-champions this season. "I just wish
everyone would have a chance to meet him."</TE>
<TE>   Who knows, maybe they'd get some jewelry out of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I always promised my Pac-10 ring to my dad, now I'm going to put
it on a necklace and give it to my mom," he explained recently after
a lengthy interview, his eyes red but his voice strong. "But now I
find out, we're getting an Orange Bowl ring too? Now who can I give
that to? Man, there's got to be somebody...."</TE>

<LD>There are things worse than being a Cincinnati Bengal, especially if
one becomes a Bengal by being the No. 1 NFL draft choice and signing
a contract worth millions of dollars.</LD>
<LD>   So this isn't intended as a plea for sympathy for Carson Palmer.
But anyone who likes the USC quarterback, who thinks Palmer has
suffered well the boos, endured stoically the rotating roster of
position coaches and misconceived offensive schemes during his first
three years as a Trojan might want to cross your fingers and hope.</LD>
<LD>   Hope that Palmer has not made himself so good, so popular, so
indispensable a quarterback that the Bengals must take him as the No.
1 draft pick next spring.</LD>
<TE>   Boomer Esiason has a feeling he knows what Palmer is thinking.
Esiason knows that Palmer is a polite young man who is careful with
his words and who would never say this.</TE>
<TE>   "But he wants to," Esiason says. "I know Carson is saying to
himself, 'I pray to God I'm not drafted No. 1, I pray to God the
Bengals don't take me.' It's what everybody has been saying the last
few years."</TE>
<TE>   It hurts Esiason to say this. Esiason was a Bengal. He went to the
Super Bowl. He likes the city and the fans and no player wants to
think the place where he became famous, became a star, achieved
goals, has become the most dreaded stopping point in professional
sports.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer is riding high. He is cuddling the Heisman Trophy,
practicing for an intriguing Orange Bowl matchup against Iowa. He has
impressed college football fans with his humble, heartfelt surprise
and exultation at winning college football's best and biggest
individual award.</TE>
<TE>   And now this.</TE>
<TE>   Now Palmer might become the NFL's No. 1 pick. Just like Ki-Jana
Carter.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 Carter, after helping lead Penn State to an undefeated
season, after missing out on the Heisman mostly because teammate
Kerry Collins earned a bunch of votes too, Carter smiled wide and
celebrated being the No. 1 pick, even if it was to the Bengals. What
an honor. What a career to look forward to.</TE>
<TE>   Carter never played a game in 1995. He tore up a knee in training
camp. Bad luck or bad preparation, by the coaches or Carter? Who
knows? But Carter, who is out of the league, ended up playing in only
35 games over five seasons with the Bengals and gaining only 747
yards.</TE>
<TE>   A year earlier Dan Wilkinson, "Big Daddy," an Ohio State hero, a
huge, fast, mean, defensive tackle, was the No. 1 pick. By the end of
his second Bengal season, Wilkinson was vocally unhappy. It took
Wilkinson four seasons to escape to the Redskins, but he hasn't had
the career of Pro Bowl appearances that seemed likely.</TE>
<TE>   Akili Smith wasn't a No. 1 pick. He was No. 3. But Smith was a
successful, happy, riding-high Pac-10 quarterback from Oregon when
the Bengals made him their first-round pick in 1999. In nearly four
complete seasons, Smith has played in 22 games. He is, by several
accounts, bitter and discouraged because he fears his career is over.
Worse, he feels his career never had a chance to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Because he's a Bengal.</TE>
<TE>   "Recent history shows this isn't the best place to get drafted,"
said Dave Lapham. Lapham is another former Bengal and now a radio
announcer for the team and college TV broadcaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Carson has played himself into a potential No. 1 and that should
be awesome for him,"</TE>
<TE>   Lapham said. "It's sad that it's not because the prospect of
becoming a Bengal isn't appealing. I know that. Maybe the only thing
Carson can hope for is that he's become so well thought of that other
teams will want to trade for the pick. There's rumors out of
Washington that [Steve] Spurrier and [owner Dan] Snyder are in love
with him and want him to be the guy."</TE>
<TE>   Being benched every other pass incompletion or becoming the next
David Klingler, those are the choices?</TE>
<TE>   Klingler was a Bengal savior in 1992, Cincinnati's first-round
choice, the run-and-shoot magician from Houston. Klingler played 31
games over four years for the Bengals. Most of them were awful and by
the time Klingler escaped to Oakland in 1996 his confidence was gone
and his game was in ruins.</TE>
<TE>   That's because owner Mike Brown has, Esiason says, "a skewed view"
of football, making it particularly unsettling to be a quarterback
for Brown's team.</TE>
<TE>   "In Mike Brown's world," Esiason said, "it's all about the
quarterback. Mike is just convinced, always has been, that if he can
only find his Brett Favre or Joe Montana or Michael Vick or Donovan
McNabb, he's got the simple fix for an ailing franchise without
understanding that without all the other support, all you've done is
put a young kid in a no-win situation."</TE>
<TE>   There are other failings of Brown, a former Dartmouth quarterback,
according to Esiason and Lapham. On Brown-created teams there is
little concern about locker-room harmony or team chemistry. There is
little attention paid to scouting or training staff. There is never
enough support staff.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see Mike drafting Carson but keeping Jon Kitna and Akili
Smith around," Esiason said. Kitna is now the starter. "Can't you see
the quarterback meeting every week, Kitna and Smith bitterly unhappy
and both thinking they should be starting and Carson sitting in the
middle?"</TE>
<TE>   Several draft experts, including ESPN's Mel Kiper, are projecting
Palmer to be the No. 1 pick. If the Bengals lose today to go 1-14,
they guarantee themselves that pick.</TE>
<TE>   Since Paul Brown Stadium opened in 2000 (yes, it's named after
Mike's dad), the Bengals have won 11 of 46 games and only seven of 23
in Cincinnati. They are 0-7 at home this year. The new stadium is
getting emptier and emptier. Brown notices that.</TE>
<TE>   Brown is getting embarrassed weekly by the foibles and fumbles of
the Bengals. Last weekend the Bengals suffered a penalty at a key
time for having 12 men on the field for a punt. In Game 14 of a
16-game season, Coach Dick LeBeau's team can't execute the simplest
of plays.</TE>
<TE>   "Look," Esiason said, "it's not the stadium, it's not the practice
facility that's the trouble. It's the internal way this franchise
does business. That said, I can't imagine Mike bringing Dick LeBeau
back. Mike might finally understand he needs to hire somebody who has
had some success attributed to him, who is a strong personality and
maybe Mike will let that guy do things the right way.</TE>
<TE>   "Because this isn't a terrible situation. There's a great running
back [Corey Dillon] and an offensive line that's pretty good. And no
matter what, if Carson's picked No. 1 he's going to have to be paid,
and paid handsomely, no matter what. So let's not hear violins in
sympathy."</TE>
<TE>   Then Esiason added one more word.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet."</TE>

<KH>Q AND A WITH MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG</KH>
<HD>Landing Olympics Is A-No. 1 Goal for Him</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Michael R. Bloomberg, 60, is New York's 108th mayor. He took office
Jan. 1, succeeding Rudolph W. Giuliani.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg has spent much of his first year grappling with a major
budget crisis -- a municipal deficit now estimated at more than $6
billion for next year, caused by the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks
as well as a downturn in the national economy and setbacks suffered
by Wall Street firms.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg has nonetheless played a recurring and highly visible
role in promoting New York's bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics -- a
plan that calls, in part, for construction of a stadium on
Manhattan's West Side and an Olympic village in Queens, across the
East River from the United Nations. Last month, the U.S. Olympic
Committee picked New York to be the U.S. candidate for 2012; the
International Olympic Committee will choose the 2012 site in 2005.</LD>
<TE>   The mayor sat for an interview in the second-floor "bullpen" at
City Hall -- a converted public-hearing chamber where he and his top
aides work in egalitarian, office park-like cubicles.</TE>
<TE>   Question: Why New York City for the Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: New York City is the world's second home. It represents
the diversity of the world more than any other venue. It has for a
few hundred years been the city where people who dream and want to do
things by themselves come; it's the land of the tired, the hungry,
the poor yearning to be free. It's the land of opportunity in ways no
other city has been in the modern day.</TE>
<TE>   It also provides probably the best venues from a physical point of
view of any prospective location. The ability to get from an event to
any other event by a water taxi or subway is unique.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Where does winning the Games rank on your list of priorities?</TE>
<TE>   A: My first responsibility is obviously keeping the city safe,
fixing our public school system and promoting economic activity. I
think that the Olympics help all of those things by enhancing the
world's knowledge of what New York City has to offer and promoting it
as a tourist destination.</TE>
<TE>   Q: London, Paris, Moscow and other cities may try for 2012 as
well. Your view of the competition?</TE>
<TE>   A: All nice cities but I can't speak for them. All I can speak for
is New York and its 8 million people, who better than anybody else
represent to the world and have an attitude that anything is possible
and have demonstrated an ability for 350 years, 400 years, to accept,
to embrace, to welcome the world's population.</TE>
<TE>   Q: You and the deputy mayor for economic development, Dan
Doctoroff, have said repeatedly that the Games will not burden
taxpayers. How can that be? Why should they believe you?</TE>
<TE>   A: I am the mayor and he is the deputy mayor; there is a certain
amount of validity because of your office and because of people's
experience with us. If you look at the numbers, given the kind of
wealth in this city, corporate and individual, raising money for the
Olympics will not be a complex thing. We need the housing that will
be the Olympic village....</TE>
<TE>   The big projects -- the extension of the subway system, the No. 7
line; and the expansion of the Javits [Convention] Center -- this
city desperately needs to revitalize its tourism business. We will do
those things regardless of whether the Olympics come here; we hope to
have both under construction before the decision is made in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How does the city's budget crunch play into the bid process?</TE>
<TE>   A: Not at all. You're talking about an economic downturn that may
by now be over -- though the effects will be felt in every
municipality in every state of the Union for a while. You're talking
about the next couple years versus the long term. You're talking
about an operating budget problem when [construction] would come out
of capital budgets. It's also true we believe most of this will be
done with private money.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, Central Park was built when the country was falling
apart. The subways were built when the Lower East Side was so teeming
with population it was life-threatening. We built the Empire State
Building at the very bottom of the Depression. New York City builds
things when we're in trouble because that's when people get together
and understand the need to have a future. Adversity is a catalyst.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Before the USOC vote, some of the city's biggest names in
politics, diplomacy, business, entertainment and the media let it be
known they were New York 2012 supporters. But do you sense an
overwhelming desire on the part of the general public for a New York
Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   A: All the polls say the public is overwhelmingly in favor. You're
talking about something that will be decided in 2005, three years
from now, and take place in 2012, 10 years from now. If you can
stimulate this kind of support now, imagine what will happen as the
fever builds and people realize the excitement and the impact on New
York City longtime.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you have a favorite Olympic moment?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'd like to see my younger daughter compete in the Olympics.
She's an equestrian, 20 years old. I asked her whether she'd like to
come to Athens with me in 2004, to see the equestrian events. She
said, "Daddy, why wouldn't I want to be there in person to
participate?" I think she's a touch too young. It's a sport where the
competitors tend to be in their upper 20s, early 30s. But don't doubt
my daughter. She's very tough.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Have you been to an Olympics?</TE>
<TE>   A: Never been.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What role will 9/11 play in the bid process?</TE>
<TE>   A: I believe we will get the Olympics because of the character of
the people of New York City and what they've shown and how they've
pulled together after 9/11. Nobody expects a sympathy vote. But I do
think that this was a city united [before the attacks] in ways the
general world didn't understand; 9/11 just showed it. We're the most
cosmopolitan city in the world and have virtually no racial problems.
There's no other city where people get along as well as they do here.
We're a city that accepts everybody. I don't know of any city that
[offers] upward mobility to those who want to work harder than the
other person, no matter their background, gender, race, ethnicity,
orientation, whatever.</TE>

<HD>Win Comes Easily for UCLA, but Loss of Pitts Hard to Take</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Terry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Normally the UCLA Bruins would have been giddy about the kind of game
they played Saturday, overwhelming outmanned and undersized Cal State
Northridge, 88-49, to end a three-game losing streak in front of 943
at Pauley Pavilion.</LD>
<LD>   But most of the joy was gone long before the final buzzer.</LD>
<LD>   Before the game, Coach Kathy Olivier's worst fears about injured
forward Julia Pitts were confirmed. The results of an MRI exam
revealed that the promising freshman, hurt during Thursday's game
against Baylor, has torn anterior and lateral ligaments in her left
knee. She will require surgery; recovery and rehabilitation could
take six to nine months.</LD>
<TE>   Pitts, who averaged 10 points and a team-best 5.9 rebounds, was
making 67.4% of her field-goal attempts, on pace to break the school
record held by Denise Curry (62.1%).</TE>
<TE>   She may not be eligible to redshirt this season, having already
played eight games.</TE>
<TE>   "She helps us so much with rebounding, running the floor,
defensively," Olivier said. "But what we'll miss the most is her
demeanor. She's a kid who carries herself like a winner no matter
what the situation is. For a freshman that's remarkable because she's
in an environment that's pretty competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Greco, who led all scorers with 22 points in 19 minutes,
can empathize with Pitts. Greco had to miss last season because of
concussions.</TE>
<TE>   "I was telling her before the game I admired how she's stayed
upbeat, not dwelling on her injury and forgetting about the team,"
Greco said. "She's very positive and supportive."</TE>
<TE>   Greco seemed intent on easing the loss of Pitts by herself. The
fifth-year senior made seven of nine shots in the first half as the
Bruins (5-4) established a 39-31 lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the second half, UCLA unleashed a full-court trapping defense
that forced 19 of the Matadors' 31 turnovers and triggered scoring
runs of 18-4 and 18-0. UCLA led by as many as 41 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you trap and double team like that it either picks your
team up and gets them easy buckets or the other team takes
advantage," Northridge Coach Tammy Holder said. "You hope to take
advantage the first two or three times they do it, but we didn't help
out or rotate well. It looked like we played right into their game
plan."</TE>
<TE>   Ofa Tulikihihifo scored 17 points for the Matadors (0-8), who have
lost 14 in a row dating to last season.</TE>
<TE>   Their last victory was Feb. 18 against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 93, USC 86 -- The Trojans got 23 points and 12 rebounds
from Ebony Hoffman and 19 points from Rometra Craig, but their
struggles against a difficult early-season schedule continued with a
loss at Boulder, Colo., that dropped their record to 5-5.</TE>
<TE>   Tera Bjorklund scored 28 points for the Buffaloes (8-1).</TE>

<HD>UCLA Has Internal Combustion in Loss</HD>
<DH>Latest breakdown leaves Bruins at a dead end, bickering at
each other or not talking at all after 87-70 defeat at Kansas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAWRENCE, Kan.</DL>
<LD>UCLA is like a high-end automobile with a blown engine, looking
impressive until the ignition is turned. The Bruins lurch in fitful
starts and stops, going nowhere.</LD>
<LD>   And after getting left in the driveway by No. 19 Kansas, 87-70,
Saturday, there is foul smoke rising from their ears.</LD>
<LD>   Ray Young ducked off the court and into the locker room without
shaking hands after his shot in the final seconds was blocked. Dijon
Thompson reacted to a turnover by yapping testily at T.J. Cummings.
Jason Kapono slipped out of the locker room without talking to the
media.</LD>
<TE>   Unless they locate a repair shop soon, the Bruins (2-4) will find
themselves stranded on a desolate road to nowhere. Or worse, in the
NIT.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, this will be the first time since 1984 they wake up on
Christmas morning with only two victories. And this is their worst
start since 1988 -- the last time UCLA missed the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas (6-3) dispatched the Bruins quickly -- but hardly
painlessly. The Jayhawks led, 25-11, on a three-point basket by Jeff
Hawkins 13 minutes into the game, at which point Kapono had missed
all four of his shots, Cummings had missed his only three and Young
his only two.</TE>
<TE>   By rights, everyone could have gone home then, but the boisterous
sellout crowd of 16,300 at Allen Fieldhouse was having too much fun
and CBS had the rest of its time slot to fill.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA, which thought it had reached a low in a loss at home to
Northern Arizona on Tuesday, had no choice but endure further
humiliation. To the Bruins' credit, even the angriest player refused
to break ranks or point fingers afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "It was frustrating for all of us," Thompson said. "We still have
the Pac-10 conference ahead of us. Our heads are high."</TE>
<TE>   Said Cummings: "We were trying to solve problems out there, that's
all it was. It was a loud place. We love and take care of each other.
In the first half we were just in a fog."</TE>
<TE>   Or something similar. A large banner on a wall inside the historic
fieldhouse named after legendary former Jayhawk Coach Phog Allen
reads, "Pay Heed, All Who Enter: Beware of the Phog."</TE>
<TE>   Add to the warning Jayhawk guard Kirk Hinrich and forwards Nick
Collison and Wayne Simien, each of whom made eight of 13 shots.
Hinrich led all scorers with 27 points and made five of nine
three-point attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "We were so fired up early and did a good job defensively,"
Hinrich said. "A lot of teams have trouble here."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA was nervous and tentative in the first half, committing 10
turnovers while making only 11 baskets. Kansas anticipated passes and
made seven steals, three by Collison that led to layups.</TE>
<TE>   Soon the score was 42-17, and by halftime it was 48-25. The Bruins
outscored Kansas, 45-39, in the second half, the product of an
effective full-court press and the Jayhawks simply losing interest.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the same problems that plagued UCLA in losses to San
Diego, Duke and Northern Arizona again were apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono couldn't get many open shots and missed when he did get a
look, scoring 13 points on five-for-14 shooting and making only one
from the perimeter. He did make an impact on the boards, equaling his
career high with 13 rebounds to lead UCLA's 45-36 advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings, who made two of 10 shots, and Young, who made three of
12, failed to see open teammates and launched ill-advised shots.</TE>
<TE>   The point guards struggled. Cedric Bozeman had five points and one
assist in 22 minutes and Ryan Walcott had three points and four
turnovers in 16 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were careless with the ball and shot too quickly, which fed
right into their transition game," UCLA Coach Steve Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   The only bright spots were Thompson, who scored 21 points off the
bench, and forward Andre Patterson, who scored 12 on six-for-eight
shooting in his first career start.</TE>
<TE>   A year ago UCLA shocked then-No. 1 Kansas, 87-77, at Pauley
Pavilion behind strong inside play from seniors Matt Barnes and Dan
Gadzuric. Surprisingly, Hinrich said this UCLA team is as good.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the most talented team we've played," he said. "They
have so many guys and don't lose much when somebody comes in."</TE>
<TE>   Considering Kansas has been defeated by Oregon, Florida and North
Carolina, that's quite a statement.</TE>
<TE>   But talent is a lot like the exterior of that late-model luxury
car. It's superficial if the engine doesn't purr.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not hitting on all cylinders," Young said.</TE>

<HD>USC Takes Pleasure Out of La Salle Trip</HD>
<DH>Trojans get career-best games from Curtis and Smiley in
89-63 victory. Hutchinson injures ankle again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Gutierrez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As soon as La Salle arrived in Los Angeles late Wednesday morning,
the Explorers lived up to their nickname by immediately exploring
Southland attractions to make the most of their one-game West Coast
trip.</LD>
<LD>   They went straight from the airport to Universal Studios before
taking a tour of Hollywood and checking out the House of Blues on
their second day in town.</LD>
<LD>   Saturday at the Sports Arena, though, USC took La Salle and the
announced crowd of 3,111 on a ride of a different kind, a bumpy,
in-your-face California misadventure.</LD>
<TE>   USC pummeled La Salle, 89-63, in a game that saw the re-emergence
of the Trojans' defense and a marked improvement in the home team's
offensive execution. Just in time for USC to open up Pacific 10
Conference play, which the Trojans will do in their next game, at
Washington State on Jan. 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was a good performance," USC Coach Henry Bibby said.
"The kids were coachable and we had a carry-over from practice [this
week] to the game, which was something we haven't had yet.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting better every game, seeing improvement with each
player."</TE>
<TE>   USC's most improved players against La Salle were sophomore power
forward Nick Curtis and junior shooting guard Roy Smiley, who each
had career highs in points, and sophomore shooting guard Errick
Craven.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis, who lost the toenail on his left big toe six minutes into
the game after a scramble for a loose ball, had 21 points on
eight-of-11 shooting and Smiley finished with 18 points. Craven,
meanwhile, seemed to break out of his season-long shooting funk and
finished with 16 points in 19 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "Tonight was an all-around game for us, our best game so far,"
said Curtis, who also had a career-high four blocked shots to go with
eight rebounds, two steals and two assists in 33 minutes. This after
going for a combined six points and nine rebounds in his previous two
games.</TE>
<TE>   "We pride ourselves on defense, but we also want to buy into the
offense and the whole scheme of things."</TE>
<TE>   USC did that with aplomb against La Salle.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans (4-3) forced the Explorers (3-4) into 28 turnovers and
had nine steals while shooting 46.4% from the field, 43.8% (seven of
16) from three-point territory.</TE>
<TE>   USC came out hot, going on a 9-0 run to open up an 11-6 lead four
minutes into the game. But then La Salle's full-court pressure
defense unnerved the Trojans, who were getting anxious in their
half-court game and lacking continuity after losing Curtis and senior
point guard Robert Hutchinson within 38 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Hutchinson's bothersome right ankle, which he sprained Dec. 3, was
caught under a crush of players diving for a loose ball. He was taken
to University Hospital for X-rays, though results are not expected
until today.</TE>
<TE>   With USC distracted, La Salle tied the score on four occasions,
the last at 22-22 with 6:57 remaining in the first half. But the
Trojans intensified their defense and blew the game open, leading by
as many as 31 points late in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman guard Gary Neal led the Explorers with 21 points.</TE>
<TE>   "We were never in it," La Salle Coach Billy Hahn said. "We didn't
compete. USC was bigger, stronger and faster. There was nothing on
the bright side tonight."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Coach Henry Bibby's heart dropped when he saw senior point guard
Robert Hutchinson go down and out in the seventh minute Saturday
night after his right ankle was rolled over in a pile for a loose
ball.</LD>
<LD>   "I was like, 'Oh [shucks], here we go. What do we do now?' " Bibby
said.</LD>
<LD>   Bibby turned the game over to sophomore Brandon Brooks. And Brooks
maintained the flow for the Trojans in their 89-63 victory over La
Salle.</LD>
<TE>   "When Hutch went down, I knew I'd end up playing most of the
game," said Brooks, who finished with seven points, six assists and
two turnovers in 23 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need my minutes to produce. I didn't play my best game,
but I ran the team."</TE>
<TE>   The previous squad Brooks ran was one made up of himself and four
walk-ons late in the Trojans' blowout victory over Cal State
Fullerton on Dec. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "That killed me," Brooks said. "I love them dudes [the walk-ons],
but that just killed me. My head wasn't in it."</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 2 at Washington State, 7 p.m. -- If Jerry Dupree's grades
keep him eligible, and if Bibby deems the junior forward's attitude
acceptable, then he will join USC for the Pacific 10 Conference
opener.</TE>

<HD>Trojans Are Proven Winners</HD>
<DH>USC earns first women's volleyball national title since
1981, erasing all doubt with convincing victory over Stanford.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS</DL>
<LD>USC may have been at the top of the national rankings most of the
season and earned its status as favorite to win the NCAA women's
volleyball championship. After all, the Trojans had the nation's best
record and the most complete team.</LD>
<LD>   But they were facing Stanford, the most successful program in
tournament history and the defending national champion. That made
them the underdog in the eyes of many at New Orleans Arena, site of
Saturday's national title match.</LD>
<LD>   So the Trojans (31-1) went out and proved they were the best.
Using its balance and amazing depth, USC captured its first NCAA
championship since 1981 with a 30-27, 23-30, 30-24, 30-26 victory
over the Cardinal.</LD>
<TE>   The Trojans hadn't won a title since the first year the NCAA
sanctioned the sport. They won three Assn. of Intercollegiate
Athletics for Women titles before the 1981 championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been my dream to win a championship at USC," said senior
Lauren Killian, the team's captain. "I came to USC to do something
that my dad [Don] did in 1977. I don't want this moment to end."</TE>
<TE>   USC avenged its only loss of the season, against the Cardinal on
Nov. 2. Even as Stanford showed a champion's heart in games 3 and 4
with late comebacks, the Trojans were determined not to go home with
runner-up trophies.</TE>
<TE>   "Personally, I wasn't going to make any predictions," outside
hitter April Ross said. "But if we're going to be in a game like
this, we're just not going to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford (32-5) appeared to be peaking as it sought its
NCAA-record sixth national championship. It had lost only one game in
five postseason matches.</TE>
<TE>   It also had two-time defending national player of the year Logan
Tom and big-hitting All-American sophomore Oganna Nnamani on its
side.</TE>
<TE>   USC had more to work with, though. Junior middle blocker Katie
Olsovsky led the Trojans with 16 kills, tournament MVP Keao Burdine
and Ross each had 15 and Emily Adams added 12 with only two errors.</TE>
<TE>   "They had a lot of weapons," Stanford Coach John Dunning said.
"They were very impressive to watch."</TE>
<TE>   Nnamani was brilliant, hitting .545 with 19 kills. Tom, also a
leading player on the U.S. national team, had 16 kills but didn't
have the overwhelming impact she had in a semifinal victory over
Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the reason was that the Cardinal struggled at the setting
position. Junior Anna Robinson was replaced by freshman Katie
Goldhahn in each of the final two games after Stanford couldn't get
into an offensive rhythm and fell behind in each.</TE>

<HD>Commodore Recalled in Hopes He's Big Hit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There seemed to be a message in the Mighty Ducks' latest roster move,
although Coach Mike Babcock was being coy.</LD>
<LD>   Defenseman Mike Commodore, all 6 feet 4, 230 pounds of him, was
recalled from minor league Cincinnati. He is expected to be in the
lineup tonight when the Ducks play Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Commodore is a physical presence, something that was lacking in
the Ducks' 5-4 loss to the Kings on Thursday. The Ducks were without
Keith Carney (stomach virus) and Ruslan Salei (strained muscle in his
side) for the game, leaving them with only five defensemen.</LD>
<TE>   Carney and Salei will play tonight, Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether Commodore was a precautionary call-up or was here to
stay, Babcock said: "I don't know," then added, "He's big though,
isn't he?"</TE>
<TE>   Babcock said he is considering having seven defensemen suit up
tonight. The Ducks are far from being physically intimidating, but
Commodore should lessen that.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll use my body and play physical, if that's what they need me
to do for this team," said Commodore.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Duck tough guy Kevin Sawyer looked the part of a hockey refugee
when he returned home from Thursday's game, after a detour to the
hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "When I knocked on the door and my wife answered, there I was
barefoot, wearing my hockey shorts and a ripped jersey," said Sawyer,
whose wife is due to have the couple's first child this week.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer underwent X-rays and a CT scan Thursday. Sawyer said
doctors determined he didn't have a concussion. He said he was still
suffering from a mild headache.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer, who is not eligible to come off injured reserve until Dec.
27, was hurt in a second-period fight with the Kings' Brad Norton on
Thursday. Mike Brown, recalled Saturday, will likely take Sawyer's
spot tonight.</TE>

<HD>Mount Union Gets Division III 3-Peat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His uniform dirty and eye black fading, Dan Pugh looked nothing like
a running back who had carried the ball a record 49 times in leading
Mount Union (Ohio) to a 48-7 victory over Trinity (Texas) in the
Division III national championship game Saturday at Salem, Va.</LD>
<LD>   "This definitely completes the picture," Pugh said after gaining
253 yards and scoring four touchdowns to carry the Purple Raiders to
victory in the Amos Alonzo Stagg Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   "This is what we came to do."</LD>
<TE>   The title was the third in a row for Mount Union (14-0) and its
seventh in 10 years. It also was the 96th victory in 97 games for the
Purple Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   After winning the last two titles by three points each, Mount
Union made this game look easy. It took a 28-0 halftime lead as Pugh
ran for two touchdowns and Rob Adamson threw for two.</TE>
<TE>   Trinity (14-1) played without suspended quarterback Roy Hampton,
who was arrested last week on a charge of public intoxication. The
Tigers struggled to get their offense going, and they finished with
203 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh scored on runs of 19, two, one and one yards. The third
touchdown was his 40th of the season, breaking Barry Sanders'
all-divisions record of 39 set at Oklahoma State in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Pugh finished with a record 15 postseason touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robb Latrielle passed for 264 yards and three first-half
touchdowns as Carroll College of Montana won its first NAIA title by
defeating two-time defending champion Georgetown (Ky.), 28-7, at
Savannah, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints (12-2) had lost in the semifinals the last two years to
the Tigers (12-1), who had won 53 of their previous 55 games.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown gave up 417 total yards, while gaining only 198.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers' only touchdown came in the first quarter, on a 35-yard
pass from Neil Warren to Cody Brown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida State quarterback Chris Rix said he was worried about his
father's health when he overslept and missed a final exam, leading to
his suspension for the Sugar Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I am deeply sorry for what happened. I let a personal situation
with my father distract me far beyond what I intended," Rix said
Friday in offering his first explanation of his actions.</TE>
<TE>   His suspension means the 16th-ranked Seminoles will go into the
Jan. 1 game against Georgia without their top two quarterbacks. Last
month, Adrian McPherson was kicked off the team when he was accused
of stealing a check.</TE>
<TE>   When Rix was suspended, the sophomore immediately apologized to
teammates, coaches and fans. He said at the time that he overslept
because of a "personal family issue, which was weighing heavily on
me."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Rix decided to elaborate. He said he returned home
Wednesday to Santa Margarita and admitted his father to a hospital
for an undisclosed ailment. Chris Rix Sr. was released after a day
but is still receiving treatment, the younger Rix said.</TE>
<TE>   Rix refused to specify his father's illness, saying it is not
terminal, "yet it is very serious."</TE>
<TE>   He said he did not intentionally miss his exam.</TE>

<HD>New Look, Familiar Result for Toccet</HD>
<DH>Colt and Chavez, in borrowed silks, win stretch duel with
Kafwain in Hollywood Futurity.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Christine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The jockey's silks might have been forgotten in the trainer's car in
Maryland, but the horse didn't forget how to find the finish line as
Toccet fought back in the stretch Saturday to win the $409,500
Hollywood Futurity by a head over Kafwain.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing green-and-white silks with Hollywood Park lettering on his
back, Jorge Chavez showed why he is one of the strongest finishers in
the game with his ride of Toccet.</LD>
<LD>   Kafwain, the 13-10 favorite off his win in the Norfolk and
second-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, put a head in
front of Toccet for a couple of strides in midstretch before Chavez
roused his colt and regained the lead for good.</LD>
<TE>   Toccet and Kafwain will be among the early favorites for next
year's Kentucky Derby, but in the Eclipse Awards voting for best
2-year-old male they'll take a backseat to Vindication, Kafwain's
stablemate, who topped off an undefeated campaign with a convincing
win in the Breeders' Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Owner Daniel Borislow and trainer John Scanlan had dismissed
Toccet's ninth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup because the colt
drew the outside post position in a 13-horse field. Scanlan suggested
they scratch from the Arlington Park race, but Borislow insisted on
running.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Toccet won three consecutive stakes races in Maryland
and New York preceding Saturday's conquest. For the year, the son of
Awesome Again and Cozzene's Angel has won six of eight starts,
including four stakes wins at 1 1/16 miles or farther. Saturday's
purse of $243,900 increased his earnings to $755,610.</TE>
<TE>   "The only 2-year-old I've ever seen that was better than mine was
Spectacular Bid [in 1978]," said Borislow, who was 38 when he retired
from the Internet business in 1999 with a billion-dollar nest egg.
"This horse deserves the respect that he's never gotten. I don't know
of a 2-year-old out there who's better suited to run a mile and a
quarter [the Derby distance]."</TE>
<TE>   If there was a downside to Borislow's trip to California, it was
the disqualification of Kafwain from second place to fourth after he
and jockey Victor Espinoza came over on Coax Kid as they made their
late run at the top of the stretch. Borislow, known to bet with both
hands, wagered $5,000 to win on his horse, who paid $5.20 for $2, but
missed out on a $5,000 exacta on Toccet and Kafwain. The official
order of finish among the runners-up was Domestic Dispute, Coax Kid,
Kafwain, Roll Hennessy Roll and Logician.</TE>
<TE>   Toccet, a misspelling of his namesake, retired NHL star and former
King Rick Tocchet, ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:41 1/5, three-fifths of a
second off the stakes record, as he became the first Eastern-based
horse to win the Futurity since Stephan's Odyssey in 1984. The winner
ran close behind the pace-setting Roll Hennessy Roll before taking
the lead leaving the final turn.</TE>
<TE>   "He was slipping on the track a little bit, but he was still
fighting," Chavez said. "It was amazing. He didn't like the track,
and he still won like that. He's got such a big heart."</TE>
<TE>   As they say along the backstretch, Toccet doesn't have to carry
his racetrack with him. Two of his wins came at Laurel Park, where
Scanlan is based, and he had also won at Pimlico, Belmont Park and
Aqueduct before arriving at Hollywood on Thursday night. Scanlan said
that this wasn't the first time he and Borislow had won a race after
the trainer had forgotten the owner's silks.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened with Dinner In Rio, a $50,000 claim who
won the Seneca Handicap at Saratoga in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Borislow said that Toccet's next race might be at 1 1/8 miles on
the grass, which would be way for a Derby contender to begin a
3-year-old campaign.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In the 10th stakes dead heat for win in Hollywood Park history,
Tout Charmant and Surya hit the line together in the $150,000 Dahlia
Handicap.... Golden Ticket's 2:13 2/5 clocking was a track record for
1 3/8 miles.... Hombre Rapido broke the 5 1/2-furlong record Friday
with a time of 1:01 3/5.... Riding at Calder Race Course in Miami on
a bobblehead day in his honor, Laffit Pincay won a race to boost his
record total to 9,479.</TE>

<KH>THE TIMES' ALL-STAR GIRLS' CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM</KH>
<HD>Goals of Team Work for Pasciuto</HD>
<DH>Junior earned numerous individual honors, but helping
Murrieta Valley win section and state titles proved far more
satisfying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Ortega</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Individual accolades were plentiful for junior Liza Pasciuto of
Murrieta Valley during cross-country season.</LD>
<LD>   But it was a desire to lead Murrieta Valley to its first Southern
Section and state Division I championships, not to add to her already
impressive running resume, that motivated Pasciuto to excel.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, she was pleased to win her first section championship and
second consecutive Inland Empire Challenge title.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, she was happy about finishing second in the state
championships for the second time in three years.</TE>
<TE>   But none of those accomplishments would have meant as much to The
Times' girls' cross-country runner of the year if Murrieta Valley had
failed to win the section and state championships.</TE>
<TE>   "This year was more about the team than me," said the outgoing
Pasciuto. "I wanted to do whatever I could to help our team do as
well as we could."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Murrieta Valley was expected to contend for a top-three
finish in the Southern Section Division I final at Mt. San Antonio
College but placed 11th after Pasciuto collapsed while battling Emily
Vince of Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula for the lead with a mile
left.</TE>
<TE>   Medical tests failed to pinpoint the cause of Pasciuto's collapse,
but there was no question that she and her Nighthawk teammates wanted
to come back with a vengeance this year.</TE>
<TE>   They won the Bronco and Woodbridge invitationals in the first two
weeks of the season and finished third while running against a
national-class field in the Great American Cross-Country Festival in
Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 28.</TE>
<TE>   That was followed by runner-up finishes to national power Hesperia
Sultana in the Inland Empire Challenge on Oct. 12 and in the Mt. San
Antonio College Invitational two weeks later. But Pasciuto and Co.
never lost track of their ultimate goals.</TE>
<TE>   They accomplished the first goal Nov. 23, when Pasciuto's
first-place finish paced Murrieta Valley to a 70-102 victory over
runner-up Thousand Oaks in the section championships at Mt. SAC.</TE>
<TE>   The second was attained a week later when the Nighthawks edged
Thousand Oaks, 61-68, for the state title at Woodward Park in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   "We had talked about doing this since last December," Murrieta
Valley co-Coach Steve Chavez said at the time. "Everything we had
done in training has been done to get us to this point."</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta Valley's performance in the state meet -- the Nighthawks
cut three seconds off the previous team record for the course before
Sultana smashed that mark in the Division II race two hours later --
propelled the Nighthawks from 11th to seventh in Harrier magazine's
final national poll. But Pasciuto says the section final is the race
she'll remember most.</TE>
<TE>   "I really needed to run well there because of what happened last
year," Pasciuto said. "To help us win the [section] title on that
course was really exciting."</TE>

<LD>Christmas is only three days away, so it's a perfect time to tell the
story of Jimmy Goffredo, a senior basketball player at Crescenta
Valley High who has never received a grade other than an A since
kindergarten.</LD>
<LD>   When he was 9, Goffredo faced the ultimate test for a child: the
death of his mother.</LD>
<LD>   "I was staring at the ceiling of my parents' bedroom listening to
the ticking of the clock. Right next to me, my dad and my sisters
were awake, victims of the same insomnia. None of us spoke. Silence
seemed to be the only response to the uncertainty and fear that
pressed on our hearts.</LD>
<TE>   "Silence was the only way we could show each other that hope still
existed, that no matter what the doctors said, maybe a miracle was
possible. But then, at 5:46 a.m., the silence was broken by the
piercing ring of the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad answered and in a broken voice whispered, 'She's gone.' At
9 years old, I had to face the reality that cancer had placed its
deadly grip on my mother's life."</TE>
<TE>   When a young boy loses his mother, he could become a bitter,
rebellious child. But Goffredo had a father and two older sisters to
watch over him, and basketball to serve as an emotional release.</TE>
<TE>   John Goffredo was the basketball coach at Crescenta Valley for 19
years. He was a fiery, demanding perfectionist. The death of his
wife, Kathy, left a wound in his heart as painful as that in Jimmy's.
They found strength in each other.</TE>
<TE>   "He started looking after me," John said. "We actually became
buddies. When someone was feeling down, we'd comfort the other. It
was an automatic reaction."</TE>
<TE>   John gave up coaching to prepare his only son for life's trials
and tribulations.</TE>
<TE>   "Through the passing of my mother, I have learned that life is not
something to take for granted. Even when she was too weak to get out
of bed, she never complained about the pain. She was the toughest
person I have ever known, and every day I try to match that strength
in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Goffredo grew up watching and reading about Crescenta Valley
basketball. He knew it was a school that produced high-scoring
guards.</TE>
<TE>   The tradition started with Brad Holland, who averaged 34.9 points
in 1975. Then came Greg Goorjian and his 43.4 average in 1978. Harvey
Mason averaged 28.6 in 1986. The Falcons have always preferred guards
who weren't afraid to shoot, and Goffredo fits the bill.</TE>
<TE>   He's averaging 33.4 points after nine games, including two
47-point performances. He has 1,890 career points, putting him in
position to pass Holland (1,917 points) and move into fourth place
among the school's scoring leaders.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent three-point shooting contest with his coach, Adam
Jacobsen, who scored 2,157 points in his Falcon career, the 6-foot-1
Goffredo made 22 in a row to Jacobsen's 12.</TE>
<TE>   But Goffredo's life revolves around much more than basketball. He
has been accepted to Harvard, where students pursue the dreams of a
lifetime. His college decision has given him peace of mind and helped
lift his basketball fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a terrible experience might leave some people truly broken,
but I let it become my motivation to be a better person. Rather than
use my mom's death as an excuse to do poorly in school or to remain
unhappy, I decided that it would drive me to succeed."</TE>
<TE>   Goffredo never set out to be perfect in school. His mom was a math
teacher and made sure homework came before basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was little, I didn't say I didn't want to get a B my
entire life," he said. "It didn't seem realistic. Last year, I
realized I'm getting close to the end of high school and thought it
would be pretty nice to not get a B."</TE>
<TE>   He's taking Advanced Placement classes in English, calculus and
economics, along with a class in sculpture. He has a 4.3 grade-point
average and scored 1,350 on the Scholastic Assessment Test.</TE>
<TE>   When he says something deemed not very intelligent, his friends
tease him. Such is the price for choosing Harvard. He visited the
campus in October and felt his mom's presence.</TE>
<TE>   "She's probably so proud of me where I am and where I'm going to
be," he said. "I'm sure she couldn't imagine me going to Harvard."</TE>
<TE>   His mother is gone, but his stepmother, Stevie, has provided
unconditional support and guidance.</TE>
<TE>   "She's as close to a mother as a stepmom can be," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But no one is more thankful for how Goffredo has prospered than
his father.</TE>
<TE>   "Jimmy's an amazing kid, better than his grades and his basketball
skills," John said. "He's an incredible, caring young man, a special
kid."</TE>
<TE>   Harvard requires a 500-word personal essay as part of its
admission process. Goffredo wrote about his mother.</TE>
<TE>   "In the midst of my grieving, I learned to endure. Of course, I
would give anything to be with my mom again, but that is not
something I can control. And, when I need her most, I always remember
that my mom's spirit lives on through me."</TE>

<LD>The five horses scheduled to run in today's $70,000 Dayjur Handicap
certainly know where the finish line is.</LD>
<LD>   Echo Eddie, Rocky Bar, Mighty David, Gibson County and Slew Of The
Night have combined for 28 victories and $1,751,265 in earnings
heading into the 5 1/2-furlong race, the feature on Hollywood Park's
closing-day card.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by David and Rita Milch and trained by Darrell Vienna, Echo
Eddie is the most accomplished member of the quintet and will be
favored. Idle since finishing second to Breeders' Cup Sprint winner
Orientate in the $400,000 Smile Sprint Handicap at Calder on July 13,
the 5-year-old gelding has trained well for his return.</LD>
<TE>   A winner of eight of 19 and more than $905,000, Echo Eddie will
break from the inside in a speed-laden field, and he has demonstrated
the ability to win from slightly off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Valenzuela, who won the $100,000 Ken Maddy Sprint Handicap
at Golden Gate Fields with the gray earlier this year, has the mount.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Recent claims Martel and U U Star are among seven
$40,000 claimers scheduled to go 5 1/2 furlongs in today's seventh at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Jockeys whose last names begin with a V. Valenzuela,
Jose Valdivia Jr. and Octavio Vergara combined to win all eight races
at Hollywood Park on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: John Anderson. The trainer based in Northern California
is four for 94 this year.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four using Bossanova and Romeo Tango
in the sixth, U U Star and Martel in the seventh, singling Echo Eddie
in the eighth and Creme Cee's, No Smoochin, General Nancy and Baby
Mel in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 2/85. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $7.40/$472.20. Total money bet: $578.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Is Starting to Find Way to Net</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Craig Johnson went more than two months without a goal to start the
season, but he's on a roll with two goals in his last four games.</LD>
<LD>   "If you play any sport, whether it's golf, baseball or whatever,
it's frustrating when you're in a slump," said Johnson, who has 72
goals in his nine-year career. "You feel like you're not playing that
bad, but when things aren't going for you, you're missing those
three-footers on the golf course and those line drives are being hit
to the second baseman. All of the sudden, you're getting a little
tighter and start pressing a little more."</LD>
<LD>   Johnson, however, never got discouraged, and by doing the little
things, he ended his scoring drought with a game-tying goal against
Pittsburgh and a key score against the Mighty Ducks last week.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a long season and you're going to have your ups and downs,"
said Johnson, who scored 13 goals last season and won Game 5 of a
playoff series against Colorado with an overtime goal.</TE>
<TE>   "You try and limit your downs, but I just had a longer stretch.
It's nice to finally score, but you don't look at it like you have
two goals in four games. I just try and remember the phrase, 'There
is no future. There is no past. The present is now, so make it last.'
"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Brad Chartrand scored twice and picked up an assist
against the Ducks after not scoring since the second game of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice to see those guys get on the score sheet for sure,"
Coach Andy Murray said about Johnson and Chartrand. "We don't ever
consider those guys to be prolific scorers, but if you're a forward
in this league you have to score some."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Winger Adam Deadmarsh, sidelined the last week because of an
undetermined ailment, possibly related to an early season concussion,
will miss the Kings' two-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   "He's day to day, depending on how he feels," Murray said.
"[Trainer] Pete [Demers] thinks that it might help if we just keep
him off the ice for a couple of days. He's been practicing regularly,
but he just hasn't been feeling right."</TE>

<LD>The lengthy meeting comes to an end tonight, but there is not much
rest for the weary.</LD>
<LD>   Los Alamitos' new season begins on Thursday and racing will
continue through Dec. 21, 2003 on the usual Thursday through Sunday
basis.</LD>
<LD>   The main events this evening are two divisions of the $27,350 Paul
Ford Memorial Handicap at the seldom run distance of 550 yards.</LD>
<TE>   In the first division, the streaking Ryland will try for his
fourth win in a row and fifth in his last six outings for the Donald
Ryan Revocable Trust and trainer Jesus Enriquez.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-year-old gelding, Ryland ran the fastest 550 yards of the meet
(26.80 seconds) when winning the Cerritos Handicap on Sept. 20.</TE>
<TE>   In the second division, He Doll, who has won six of seven at 870
yards, will shorten up for owner Margarito Farias and trainer Jorge
Farias. Ramon Sanchez will ride the gelding, who hasn't run down the
straightaway in more than a year.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. My Little Trixie. 2. Casual Smile. 3. Chrom
Illusion. 4. Bobbin Lee. 5. Faster Than Cash. 6. Raise A Brewski. 7.
Ryland. 8. He Doll. 9. Bdr Bug On The Dash.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use My Little Trixie and She Is Classic in the first, Casual
Smile and Sure Is Exclusive in the second, all in the third and
single Bobbin Lee in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Not Much Color is better than his last would
indicate and should go better in the fifth. Catchmeinyourdreams could
improve at the trip for trainer Chris O'Dell in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 5:30 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Oracle Beats OneWorld for 3-0 Lead in Series</HD>

<LD>Oracle of San Francisco moved within one victory of the America's Cup
challenger final, defeating Seattle's OneWorld today off Auckland,
New Zealand, for a 3-0 lead in the semifinal repechage.</LD>
<LD>   OneWorld incurred an early penalty for a right-of-way infringement
and fouled again when it crossed the start line before the gun.</LD>
<LD>   The errors gave OneWorld little hope of saving the race and
preventing Oracle from taking a big lead in a best-of-seven series.
It followed Oracle around the 18.5-nautical-mile course and, when it
had discharged its penalty at the finish line, trailed by 55 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Oracle needs one victory to join Alinghi of Switzerland in the
final starting Jan. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Oracle's strongest asset in the series has been its strong
defensive performances against a talented opponent in shifty
conditions. It showed that quality again today, holding out OneWorld
on the last two legs to cross the finish line 23 seconds in front
before its rival had completed its penalty.</TE>

<HD>Lalime Stops Flyers in Senators' 3-1 Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Ottawa Senators are one of the league's hottest teams for one
reason -- goaltending.</LD>
<LD>   With Patrick Lalime again strong in goal, Peter Schaefer scored a
tiebreaking goal 7:30 into the third period to help the Senators to a
3-1 victory over the Flyers on Saturday at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   Ottawa ended Philadelphia's five-game unbeaten streak.</LD>
<TE>   "He had some awesome saves," Mike Fisher, who scored Ottawa's
first goal, said of Lalime. "He kept us in it and he was the story
for our team. The win can be attributed to him."</TE>
<TE>   Lalime made 27 saves, and the Senators won their third in a row
and seventh of eight.</TE>
<TE>   "Patrick has been consistent all year," said Daniel Alfredsson,
who assisted on Fisher's goal. "He had a so-so training camp but
since we started in October, he's been great for us."</TE>
<TE>   Lalime, who has lost only two of his last 15 starts, credited his
teammates for his success.</TE>
<TE>   "As a team we played well on defense," he explained. "It's not
only the defensemen, it's the fowards and everybody played a strong
game."</TE>
<TE>   Schaefer, left uncovered in the slot, walked in and beat Roman
Cechmanekr. Wade Redden also scored for the Senators, who have lost
only two of their last 20 games. Redden's goal was an empty-netter
with 31 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 5, Dallas 3 -- Jeff Friesen scored the go-ahead goal on
a giveaway by goaltender Marty Turco, and John Madden scored twice to
lead the Devils at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The Devils matched their season high for goals. It was the second
time this season Dallas gave up five goals.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 3, New York Rangers 2 -- Nicklas Lidstrom and Igor
Larionov each had a goal and an assist to lead the host Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   The defending Stanley Cup champions have lost once in 10 games,
and the Rangers have won once in eight games.</TE>
<TE>   It was Detroit's seventh consecutive victory over the Rangers,
dating to Jan. 20, 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 2, Calgary 0 -- Steve McKenna scored his first goal in
nearly a year, and Johan Hedberg stopped 23 shots to help the
Penguins end a 10-game winless streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Flames haven't won at Pittsburgh since Feb. 12, 1989.</TE>
<TE>   NHL scoring leader Mario Lemieux had an assist for his first point
in four games, ending the longest point drought of his career at 245
minutes 33 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 2, Tampa Bay 2 -- Tomas Vokoun made 40 saves, including
20 in the third period and overtime, to lead Nashville to a tie at
Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay outshot the Predators, 16-2, in the third period.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 3, Toronto 3 -- Tomas Kaberle and Mats Sundin scored
power-play goals in the third period, and Toronto rallied for a tie.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Belfour made 26 saves for the Maple Leafs, who had won eight in
a row at home -- one shy of tying the team record.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 3, Boston 3 -- Ivan Novoseltsev and Viktor Kozlov each
scored with less than a minute to play to tie the score for the
visiting Panthers.</TE>
<TE>   Boston appeared to have the game won until Shaone Morrionn was
given a double minor for high sticking with 4:03 remaining, leading
to Kozlov's score.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Michael Nylander scored the
tying goal, missed a penalty shot, and then put Washington in front
-- all in the third period at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Washington is 21-1-3 in the last 25 games against the Islanders.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 6, Buffalo 2 -- Doug Gilmour scored twice, and Yanic
Perreault and Saku Koivu each had a goal and two assists at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens, who scored all of their goals on their first 12
shots, were outshot, 38-16.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 4, Minnesota 2 -- Peter Forsberg and Rob Blake each had a
goal and an assist at Denver, and the Avalanche won its second in a
row under new Coach Tony Granato.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota peppered Patrick Roy with a team-record 47 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver 4, Edmonton 3 -- Markus Naslund scored his
league-leading 22nd goal during a two-man advantage in overtime to
lift the host Canucks.</TE>
<TE>   Naslund capitalized with a snap shot over the shoulder of
goalkeeper Tommy Salo.</TE>

<HD>Hall of Famers to Meet With Selig About Rose</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Hall of Fame has invited all 58 of its living members to a
meeting with Commissioner Bud Selig in Los Angeles on Jan. 17 to
discuss the possible reinstatement of Pete Rose, a Hall official said
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Rose, the all-time hit leader, has been on baseball's ineligible
list since 1989, when he accepted a lifetime ban for gambling. The
penalty has made him ineligible for election to the Hall of Fame, but
he met with Selig on Nov. 25 to discuss his possible reinstatement,
and there have been subsequent meetings between his representatives
and baseball officials.</LD>
<LD>   It is presumed that Rose, who has never acknowledged betting on
baseball, would have to do so before he is reinstated. An
investigation by lawyer John Dowd documented that Rose, then managing
the Cincinnati Reds, placed 412 bets on baseball during a four-month
period in 1989, including 52 on the Reds to win.</LD>
<TE>   The Hall official would not talk for attribution, but he said: "I
don't think there's a united feeling among our members, but it's
obvious from their comments that many are concerned about the stature
being cheapened and want to understand why the commissioner's
thinking [on Rose] has changed after so much time. It should be
understood, however, that the Hall doesn't have a role in the
decision. It's strictly up to the commissioner."</TE>

<HD>CONCACAF Argument Is Half-Baked</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The world has grown used to -- not to mention tired of -- inane
remarks being made by Trinidad and Tobago's Jack Warner, who through
sheer luck or politics is president of CONCACAF and a FIFA vice
president.</LD>
<LD>   But when U.S. Coach Bruce Arena makes the same ill-founded claims
as Warner, the time has come to set the record straight and prevent
the pair from continuing to delude themselves and others.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is whether CONCACAF, soccer's North and Central American
and Caribbean region, deserves the extra half-place in the World Cup
that FIFA awarded it Tuesday.</LD>
<TE>   According to Warner, the question is not even up for debate. He
argues that it should have been a full place.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the evidence, it is only right and proper that
we should be able to send our best four [teams]," he said before
Tuesday's vote in Madrid, "because who in the world can argue that
our best three [at the 2002 World Cup] did not stand up to the best
the other confederations have to offer? And who can argue that our
best four could not do the same?"</TE>
<TE>   Well, Jack, here's the argument.</TE>
<TE>   True, the United States reached the quarterfinals at Korea/Japan
'02, but it was only the width of an Inchon goalpost away from being
eliminated in the first round. If that last-minute shot by Portugal's
Sergio Conceicao had been one foot to the right, South Korea would
not have saved the Americans' bacon. And there would have been no
appearances with Jay Leno or David Letterman, no magazine covers, no
$750,000-a-year coach contracts.</TE>
<TE>   True, Mexico made it to the second round before losing to the
U.S., but all that shows is that CONCACAF perhaps deserves two World
Cup places, the same number it had before the field was expanded from
24 to 32 in a ploy to help former FIFA president Joao Havelange be
reelected.</TE>
<TE>   What did Costa Rica do at the World Cup? Supposedly, it was
CONCACAF's best team, having finished in first place during
qualifying. But it went 1-1-1 and was ousted in the first round after
being hammered, 5-2, by eventual champion Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   Warner argues that CONCACAF should have been given four World Cup
places based on its 2002 performance. But no one heard him argue
after France '98, when the U.S. finished dead last in the field of
32, that CONCACAF should get fewer places.</TE>
<TE>   It just doesn't wash. If performance is to be the criteria, then
it should not be only the most recent tournament that is considered.</TE>
<TE>   Look at the history of CONCACAF teams in the World Cup. Ten
countries have represented the region since the inaugural tournament
in 1930. Half of them have not won a single game. Three more have won
only five games between them.</TE>
<TE>   It goes without saying that no CONCACAF team has ever won the
event.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the 10 countries' cumulative record in World Cup play is
an abysmal 21-54-17. Hardly figures that support Warner's claim.</TE>
<TE>   And yet here comes Arena, basking in the glow of a new
multimillion-dollar contract and the fawning praise of U.S. Soccer,
which might be a lot richer than it used to be but is no smarter.</TE>
<TE>   And what does Arena say at his coronation?</TE>
<TE>   "I think if we [CONCACAF] had gotten a full slot, I would clearly
say that we deserve it. I think it is ridiculous that Europe has as
many places as they do."</TE>
<TE>   Oh, really? This is rich, coming from a coach who for four years
has ducked European teams at every turn. U.S. Soccer's publicity
machine makes much of the fact that Arena is "the winningest coach in
team history" with a four-year record of 34-18-14, a .621 winning
percentage.</TE>
<TE>   But if numbers mean so much, then perhaps Arena's record against
European teams should be checked. It is 3-7-1.</TE>
<TE>   Not to rub it in, but Arena has never beaten a European team on
European soil, going 0-4 in the pitifully few occasions he has
ventured into Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the U.S. is 32-67-26 all-time against European teams.</TE>
<TE>   Given that sad history, no American, let alone the national coach,
should be claiming that it is "ridiculous that Europe has as many
places as they do," especially if the argument is that Europe should
give up places to the likes of CONCACAF.</TE>
<TE>   In this neck of the woods, only Mexico and the U.S. have proved on
the field that they deserve World Cup berths. Yet Warner thinks it is
"right and proper" that the region gets double that many places.</TE>
<TE>   What utter drivel.</TE>
<TE>   Europe and South America each lost a half-place at the World Cup
so that CONCACAF and Asia could each gain a half-place. And Oceania
gained a full place at the expense of the defending champion, Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   South America, for one, was unimpressed. The influential Argentine
daily La Nacion was scathing in its criticism of FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more convenient [for FIFA] to embrace the presence of South
Korea, China, Japan, Australia, countries with no footballing
language but with a very influential commercial impact," the
newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine Football Assn. and,
like Warner, a FIFA vice president, was oddly restrained, but he
might have a hidden agenda.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to accept it," Grondona said. "We can't be too
disappointed. There are more important things in the world than half
a place more or less at the World Cup."</TE>
<TE>   One of those things is the right to stage the 2014 World Cup,
which now appears al- most certain to go to South America.</TE>
<TE>   That was the Cup the U.S. wanted, 20 years after the success of
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, if FIFA continues to nibble away at Europe's places, it
won't be too long before the European Championship becomes a much
more competitive and meaningful event than the World Cup. It's close
to being that already.</TE>

<HD>Thompson Is First Class as Sixth Man</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAWRENCE, Kan.</DL>
<LD>Dijon Thompson isn't thrilled about his role as sixth man the last
four games, but he can't quarrel with the results.</LD>
<LD>   The sophomore forward led UCLA with 21 points and five assists
against Kansas on Saturday and is averaging 16.5 points coming off
the bench.</LD>
<LD>   "You can see the way I'm playing, it doesn't bother me," he said
with a shrug. "I just roll with it."</LD>
<TE>   Thompson played 29 minutes before fouling out, more than any Bruin
besides senior guards Jason Kapono (32) and Ray Young (30).</TE>
<TE>   "He gives us a spark and he ends up playing starter's minutes,"
Coach Steve Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In his third game since becoming eligible, sophomore forward Andre
Patterson made his first start and his greatest impact.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson made six of eight shots for 12 points, displaying a soft
touch on a hook shot from the lane. He played only 20 minutes because
of foul trouble.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Freshman center Ryan Hollins, who averaged 12 minutes in the first
five games, did not play. He said his benching was not disciplinary
and it surprised him.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's because Andre is back," he said. "I'm not sure why. I
just take my minutes as they come."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin said Patterson's return makes for fewer minutes for Hollins
and fellow freshman post player Michael Fey, who played only five
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Kansas All-American Jacque Vaughn had his jersey retired at
halftime. Coach Roy Williams stayed on the court to introduce Vaughn,
who starred for Kansas from 1994-97.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn, a product of Pasadena Muir High, is in his sixth NBA
season.</TE>
<TE>   UP NEXT</TE>
<TE>   Saturday vs. Michigan, 11 a.m. -- This will be UCLA's last

<DL></DL>
<LD>Norm Chow, USC's offensive coordinator, remains well in the mix to
become head coach at Kentucky.</LD>
<LD>   Asked Saturday if there had been any recent contact with Kentucky
representatives, Chow said, "No comment."</LD>
<LD>   Chow said Friday that he had not heard from Kentucky
representatives since interviewing with Athletic Director Mitch
Barnhart last Sunday. Barnhart has said that he wanted to name a
coach by Christmas.</LD>
<TE>   Broadcast outlets in Mississippi reported Saturday that
Mississippi Coach David Cutcliffe accepted the Kentucky job after
meeting with Barnhart on Friday. Cutcliffe acknowledged the meeting
took place, but announced Saturday night that he was not a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   California Coach Jeff Tedford and West Virginia Coach Rich
Rodriguez also were contacted by Kentucky, but they signed contract
extensions Friday and Saturday, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans Saint assistant Mike Riley and Central Florida Coach
Mike Kruczek also have been mentioned as candidates to replace Guy
Morriss, who left Kentucky to become coach at Baylor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Orange Bowl game against Iowa won't be until Jan. 2, and it
can't come soon enough for USC.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to get out of here and get this week over and not peak
too soon," Coach Pete Carroll said after Saturday's practice. "We're
ready to play a game one more day from now."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans will play a mock game Monday and then take two days
off before departing for Miami.</TE>
<TE>   "Monday will be like our Saturday," Carroll said. "We'll take a
break and then start it over one more time for game week."</TE>
<TE>   Freshman offensive lineman Fred Matua looked game-ready when he
leveled linebacker Bobby Otani on a screen pass during competitive
team drills.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't felt that in a long time," said Matua, who had knee
surgery in October and will redshirt.</TE>
<TE>   Said Carroll: "It was a good clean shot. The kind that keeps
everybody attentive."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Gregg Guenther, who had arthroscopic knee surgery Dec.
4, took part in team drills for the first time and said he would be
ready to play against Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "They don't want to push me too much," he said. "When we get to
Miami, I'll go full contact.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a stiffness, but nothing that is too bad."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   About a dozen members of the football team remained after practice
and cheered loudly as the USC women's volleyball team defeated
Stanford to win the NCAA championship.... Each USC player is allotted
six tickets for the Orange Bowl, and freshman receiver Mike Williams
said he made it clear to friends in Tampa that all of his are spoken
for. "I'm taking care of my family," said Williams, who is from
Tampa. "Everybody needs to know they have to go out and buy their
own."</TE>

<HD>The Plots and Designs of Al Qaeda's Engineer</HD>
<DH>Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the man believed to be behind 9/11,
hides in plain sight -- and narrowly escapes capture in Pakistan.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terry McDermott, Josh Meyer and Patrick J. McDonnell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Senior Pakistani and American intelligence officials say the
operational commander of Al Qaeda, the man believed to have planned
the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States, narrowly avoided capture
during a raid in which authorities took his two young sons into
custody.</LD>
<LD>   It was one of at least half a dozen missed opportunities over
eight years to seize Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who is described by
intelligence analysts on three continents as the man most responsible
for Al Qaeda's continuing terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency has had Mohammed's
two sons, ages 7 and 9, in custody since September. One senior
American investigator said authorities believe that they might have
come "within moments" of capturing Mohammed in the raid at a Karachi
apartment.</LD>
<TE>   In family photos seized at the apartment, Mohammed is pictured
playing with the boys.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani intelligence officials said that in recent months they
have seen persistent evidence that Mohammed -- even on the run -- has
been aggressively directing Al Qaeda terrorist cells.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite being so much in danger, he has not gone into
hibernation," one senior Pakistani official said. "He is trying to
protect what they have. He would like to consolidate first and then
rebuild on the same edifice. And he is doing that. He remains
active."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed has been linked to attacks against the United States as
far back as 1993, but his importance in the Al Qaeda structure became
clear only after Sept. 11 last year, U.S. officials say. Now, some
officials say, stopping Mohammed is as important as capturing Osama
bin Laden is, perhaps even more so.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, believed to be 37, has traveled the world as one of the
chief managers of the Al Qaeda network, using Egyptian, Qatari,
Saudi, British and Kuwaiti identities. He is said to speak Arabic
with a Kuwaiti accent and to be fluent in Urdu, the principal
language of Pakistan, and English, acquired in part as he studied for
his mechanical engineering degree at a university in North Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   Although born in Kuwait, he is a Pakistani national whose family
is from Baluchistan, an area that straddles Pakistan's borders with
Iran and Afghanistan. He has used more than three dozen aliases,
including one -- Mukhtar al Baluchi -- that honors this tribal
heritage.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed has been operating out of Karachi on and off for a
decade. He communicates with Al Qaeda cells around the world by
courier, e-mail, coded telephone conversations and shortwave radio;
German intelligence agents say that when he has been forced to
retreat to rural hide-outs he sends his messages by donkey.</TE>
<TE>   Even during the U.S. bombing campaign against Al Qaeda in
Afghanistan late last year, Mohammed continued to plan, staff and
direct new terrorist attacks, according to intelligence documents
made available to The Times. The documents detail Mohammed's
orchestration of a bombing campaign in Southeast Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed the Pakistani, as the Asian bombers knew him, housed a
young Canadian recruit for weeks in his Karachi apartment, personally
instructing him on communication protocols -- e-mail passwords,
telephone codes. He then sent him off to coordinate and finance the
bomb squads. With just a few days' notice, Mohammed was able to
deliver $50,000 to the recruit to pay for bomb-making materials. The
money was delivered in packs of $100 bills at a shopping mall in
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, according to the intelligence documents.</TE>
<TE>   That plot was foiled, but Mohammed's intimate involvement in it
underscores his leadership in building regional terrorist networks.
One network linked to Al Qaeda is allegedly behind the October
bombing in Bali, Indonesia, in which nearly 200 people died.</TE>
<TE>   It is the same role that American investigators believe he played
not just in Asia but also around the world: If Bin Laden has been the
architect of Al Qaeda, Mohammed has been its engineer. Al Qaeda
members in custody have told their interrogators that Mohammed had
operational cells in place in the United States after the Sept. 11
attacks and that he was the principal proponent within Al Qaeda of
developing radioactive "dirty bombs," according to European
intelligence officers.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI acknowledges that it underestimated Mohammed's
significance for years, a senior agency official said. "He was under
everybody's radar. We don't know how he did it. We wish we knew....
He's the guy nobody ever heard of. The others had egos. He didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed's persistence has earned the grudging admiration of some
investigators, who marvel at his uncanny ability to stay one step
ahead of unprecedented dragnets. In Pakistan, where the FBI believes
Mohammed is still hiding, those attempts have involved a small army
of agents from the military, police and multiple countries and
intelligence agencies.</TE>
<TE>   "The way he is managing their affairs, the way he is controlling
things, he is not an ordinary man," said one top Pakistani
intelligence official. "He is very sharp and brave -- an unusual
combination."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Mohammed's escapes have been abetted by the caution of
his pursuers. In one instance, in 1996, U.S. intelligence had
determined that Mohammed was in Doha, Qatar. Some American officials
wanted to organize what they call a "snatch and grab," essentially a
commando raid, to seize him.</TE>
<TE>   "Good intel had placed him in Qatar. This was, 'Oh my God! This
bastard is in Doha -- let's get him," said one person involved in the
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   This plan was defeated when high-level managers complained during
a White House meeting that it was too risky and might result in
American deaths, according to two people involved in the decision.
They said this failure to act decisively characterized the U.S.
government's lack of a serious approach to terrorism before the Sept.
11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at what has happened in the last six years -- you would have
to assume that he played a role in everything from that point on. We
absolutely believe that," said Neil Herman, a former top FBI
counter-terrorism officer. "He is right there. He is a common
denominator. If he had been caught in 1996, who knows what could have
been prevented."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani and American officials say catching Mohammed now could
turn the tide in the war on terrorism. The senior Pakistani
intelligence official said: "If you catch Khalid Shaikh at this
point, you will break the backbone of the entire network."</TE>
<TE>   Almost every Al Qaeda suspect whom the Pakistanis have arrested
since last year has had some connection to Mohammed, authorities say.
Many of those arrested have no links to one another, but they all
know Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Even those investigators who have been most involved in the
hunt for Mohammed say they know very little about him. In the small,
closed world of international counter-terrorism, he has become a
mythic figure -- a ghost in the machine -- whose vague presence lurks
behind innumerable plots but never comes completely into view.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait: Oil Town</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was born in 1965, according to records, and
reared in Fahaheel, a busy oil settlement south of Kuwait City, on
the road to Saudi Arabia. The town was historically part of a sleepy
agricultural zone on the edge of an oasis, a traditional site of palm
and vegetable cultivation. Older Kuwaitis recall driving the route
from Kuwait City through miles of desert, with the occasional
vehicle, camel and Bedouin tent as the only landmarks.</TE>
<TE>   That changed with the explosive growth of the petroleum business.
By the late 1950s, Fahaheel boomed with a jaunty, cosmopolitan rhythm
all its own. Palestinians, Lebanese, Syrians, Egyptians, Jordanians
-- even the British and Americans -- were drawn here by the oil.
Almost none of them were able to become Kuwaiti citizens, no matter
how long they stayed, creating an enduring anxiety among many of the
overseas workers. Even now, a majority of Kuwait's 2 million people
are noncitizens.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed attended high school at a three-story, 1960s-style brick
all-boys school that housed as many as 1,200 students. Fahaheel
teachers and alumni said they recall him as a studious youth who
concentrated on science. School was, and is, a serious thing in
Kuwait: Schoolboys wear white shirts and gray slacks and the
headmaster walks around with a bamboo cane, to be used on
obstreperous students.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed's oldest brother, Zahed Shaikh, attended Kuwait
University in the 1980s and was a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood --
a militant pan-Arab organization that functioned as an underground
opposition throughout the region. A man who knew the family said a
group called the Islamic Assn. of Palestinian Students was also
formed on campus then; one of its leaders went on to become head of
the political bureau of the militant Islamic group Hamas. This was
the initial politicization of Mohammed, the friend said.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Middle East, following the devastating Arab loss to
Israel in the 1967 war and the death of Egyptian President Gamal
Abdel Nasser -- failed champion of the drive for a secular and united
Arab world -- embarked on a gradual but inexorable turn toward
religion, leading up to the Islamic Revolution in Iran. Analysts say
it seemed that the secular path had been exposed as lacking, and
religion was an alternative source of identity and regional esteem.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a huge vacuum, and nobody was able to fill this
vacuum better than the rising Islamists," said Shafeeq Ghabra, a
political scientist in Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuwaiti government acknowledges that Mohammed was born in
Kuwait, but that is about as far as the authorities will go in
admitting any relationship with him.</TE>
<TE>   "Just because he lived in Kuwait, or may have been born here,
doesn't mean that this man is a Kuwaiti," Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Khalid al Jarallah said recently. "He is definitely
not a Kuwaiti."</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani government also seeks to disown Mohammed, even
though his first known passport was issued by Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   "Why do the Kuwaitis want to shift the blame to us?" said Muhammad
Khalid, head of chancery at the Pakistani Embassy in Kuwait City.</TE>
<TE>   Although much remains murky about Mohammed's background, it seems
clear that his parents came from Baluchistan, which encompasses great
swaths of southwestern Pakistan, southern Iran and Afghanistan. As
avid coastal traders, the Baluchis have an extended history
throughout the Gulf. Generations ago, area sheiks brought in fearsome
Baluchi tribesmen to serve as palace guards.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed's parents had religious callings, according to local
press reports. His father, Shaikh Mohammed Ali Doustin Baluchi, who
died decades ago, according to Mohammed's acquaintances, has been
described as a former imam, or preacher, at a mosque in the sprawling
Ahmadi municipality. Mohammed's mother, Halema, was said to have
worked cleaning women's bodies for burial. This is considered a
prestigious job in Islam, however ill-paid.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed is one of at least five siblings -- four boys and a girl.
The brothers' names -- Khalid (meaning man of eternal life); Zahed
(pious); Abed (worshiper) and Aref (knowledgeable) -- reflect the
family's religious orientation.</TE>
<TE>   What little is known about the sister includes one compelling
piece of information: She is thought to be the mother of Abdul Karim
Basit, better known as Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the man convicted of
masterminding the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Chowan College: Abbie Dahbies</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed's first extended encounter with the West occurred at
Chowan College, a tiny Baptist school nestled among the cotton farms,
tobacco patches and thick forests of eastern North Carolina, just
south of the Virginia line.</TE>
<TE>   The school was founded in 1848 as a refuge of learning for proper
Southern women. Later, it became a two-year junior college, a place
where young adults could gain an academic foothold. Its entry
standards were liberal, but its values were bedrock and its leafy
setting in isolated Murfreesboro, with no bars and a single pizza
shop, pretty much ensured that everyone remained on the straight and
narrow. Generations of small-town ministers, teachers and other
community mainstays passed through Chowan's colonnaded facade.</TE>
<TE>   After World War II, the school's missionary alumni began referring
students from overseas. Dominating the international contingent by
the 1980s were Middle Eastern men.</TE>
<TE>   Chowan did not require the standardized English proficiency exam
then widely mandated for international students, a fact that spread
through the global academic network. Foreign enrollees often spent a
semester or two at Chowan, improved their English and then
transferred to four-year universities.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed applied to Chowan as a Pakistani citizen shortly after
graduating from Fahaheel Secondary in 1983, according to college
records. He told school administrators that he had heard of the
college from a friend in Kuwait. His bill -- $2,245 for the spring
semester -- was paid in full the day of matriculation, Jan. 10, 1984.
He told fellow students that his father was dead and that his
brothers picked up the tab.</TE>
<TE>   "He took his studies seriously and was a very good Muslim," said
Badawi Hindieh, a Palestinian from Fahaheel who attended Chowan at
the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Acquaintances knew him as Khalid Shaikh, a name that stuck in
people's minds. Mohammed, acquaintances said, was culturally
integrated into Arab and Kuwaiti society and could have passed as a
Kuwaiti Arab.</TE>
<TE>   "Khalid Shaikh spoke very good Arabic, like a Kuwaiti, but
introduced himself as a Pakistani," Hindieh said. "We knew he was
Baluchi."</TE>
<TE>   Later in life, as Mohammed used multiple identities and moved from
the Gulf to Afghanistan, the West and beyond, this ability to immerse
in varying cultures would serve him well.</TE>
<TE>   By 1984, about 50 of the 650 or so male students at Chowan were
Middle Easterners, including a sizable contingent from Fahaheel and
elsewhere in Kuwait. The local boys had a name for them: "Abbie
Dahbies."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab students were frequent recipients of anti-Iranian
epithets in the years after the 1979 takeover of the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran. The foreigners were sometimes viewed as cliquish.</TE>
<TE>   "They seemed to be praying all the time," recalled John Franklin
Timberlake, a 1984 Chowan graduate, now a police officer in
Murfreesboro. "Just chanting, like. We never understood a word of it.
Sometimes we'd come home late on a weekend night, maybe after we'd
had a few beers, and they'd still be praying."</TE>
<TE>   At Chowan, Mohammed embarked on a pre-engineering curriculum --
popular among the foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a good student -- a bit better than a B-type student,"
Garth D. Faile, chairman of the science department, said in an
interview this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed, like every student, was required to attend a once-a-week
chapel service based on Christian doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   One large bloc of Middle Easterners lived in Parker Hall, a brick
tower overlooking the campus' Lake Vann, a restful crescent of water
frequented by migrating birds and couples holding hands.</TE>
<TE>   Groups of Arab students would gather in a fifth-floor dorm room
and follow a kind of ritual: boil a chicken, share it with rice among
all present, pray and commence intense discussions, before praying
anew.</TE>
<TE>   In the Middle Eastern tradition, they would leave their shoes in
the corridor. Some U.S. students could not resist the temptation: The
footwear sometimes ended up in the lake. Another prank involved
filling 55-gallon garbage containers with water and propping the
vessels against the doors of the "Abbie Dahbies," knocking and
running away. When the door opened, water flooded the room.</TE>
<TE>   The hijinks did not appear to discourage the visitors, many of
whom remained in the States and completed their degrees. Years later,
one alumnus interviewed at his office in Kuwait City recalled his
time at Chowan with great affection, remembering in particular the
becalmed lake -- an extravagance for Arabs reared in parched
latitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "In a place like Chowan, some students became more insular --
speaking only to Arab students, while others tried to mix with the
Americans," he recalled. "I tried to mix, but others did it
differently."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed completed his semester at Chowan and moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Greensboro: The Mullahs</TE>
<TE>   In summer 1984, Mohammed enrolled as an engineering major at North
Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University in Greensboro, a
historically black college on the Piedmont plain in the central part
of the state.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 1, 1960, students at A&amp;T -- whose most famous graduate is
Jesse Jackson -- staged the first lunch-counter sit-in at a downtown
Greensboro Woolworth's, a galvanizing action that spread throughout
the South.</TE>
<TE>   College abroad was a rite of passage for legions of Middle Eastern
students -- overwhelmingly men. Typically, this was their initial
long-term exposure to Western life. Some left appalled at what they
witnessed. Others ate it up.</TE>
<TE>   "We were all excited about going to the States," said Khalil A.
Abdullah, a 1987 A&amp;T graduate. "In high school we had seen all the
movies, heard the music. We wondered so much about it."</TE>
<TE>   In Greensboro, Mohammed was part of the large Middle Eastern bloc
in the university's expansive engineering department -- a natural
major for Kuwaitis and others from oil-producing nations. By all
accounts, there were three distinct student groups at the school:
African Americans (by far the largest group), white Americans and
Middle Easterners.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't like there was tension or anything, but that's just the
way it was," said Winfred S. Kenner, who studied mechanical
engineering at the sprawling, tree-lined campus east of downtown.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle Easterners tended to live off campus in anonymous
complexes like the Yorktown and the Colonial, seldom ate in the
cafeteria and skipped organized events. While "Aggies" trundled off
in merry droves to Saturday football games, the foreign students
arranged soccer matches in the park. They socialized mainly with one
another.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the college life: We used to get together three, four
times a week, watch the games, chat, drink, you know," said Sami
Zitawi, a Kuwaiti native who recalled large get-togethers of Arabs on
Friday, the Muslim holy day. "We used to go to the farmers, buy a
lamb or a goat. Butcher it with a knife.... Every Friday night
someone would have a big dinner: 15, 20, 25 students."</TE>
<TE>   Political discussions inevitably occurred. The year before
Mohammed's arrival, students in Greensboro marched in protest of the
1982 massacres of Palestinians at refugee camps in Lebanon -- though
the Arab visitors learned to mute their criticisms.</TE>
<TE>   The Middle Eastern students were far from a monolith.
Differences in politics, culture and, especially, in the practice of
Islam tore at regional solidarity.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, what you saw was a micro-society of our
home," explained Mahmood Zubaid, a Kuwaiti architectural engineer.
"Everybody fit in where they felt most comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   A social barrier separated the elite scholarship boys like Zubaid
and students like Mohammed, the Baluchi, and the Palestinians,
reliant on their families or smaller grants for tuition and living
expenses. But religion was the real dividing line.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever large concentrations of Middle Eastern students gathered
on Western campuses, graduates say, groups of religious conservatives
sprung up. These self-appointed moral overseers endeavored to ensure
adherence to Koranic values and avoidance of wine, women, drugs and
other vices. They grew beards as religious statements and prayed five
times a day, typically in makeshift mosques in apartments or
university-provided centers. And they actively recruited fellow
students.</TE>
<TE>   "We called them the mullahs," recalled Waleed M. Qimlass, a 1980s
A&amp;T graduate who now directs environmental affairs for Kuwait City.
"Basically, the students at Greensboro were divided into the mullahs
and the non-mullahs."</TE>
<TE>   At A&amp;T, several Arab graduates say, Mohammed was among the
mullahs. Even back at Chowan, one student recalled, Mohammed had
reproached him for eating pork.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty at A&amp;T for Mohammed and other true believers to
be distressed about. Some Arab students drank, flirted and frequented
clubs -- indulging in hedonistic pursuits absent back home. A few
motored about the expansive campus in Porsches and Mercedeses.</TE>
<TE>   The party crowd attempted to keep their indiscretions private,
fearing that word might get back to their families. But the mullahs
took notice and exercised pressure both intense and subtle.</TE>
<TE>   Islamists at Greensboro and other U.S. universities made a point
of seeking out newly arrived Arab students at airports. Qimlass
recalled how three "guys with beards" intercepted him and a friend as
the two Kuwaitis waited for their luggage at the airport in Tulsa,
Okla., where Qimlass studied before transferring to A&amp;T. The trio
immediately ushered the two arriving Kuwaiti students to a kind of
rooming house that doubled as a mosque, reproaching a fatigued
Qimlass when he lighted up a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   If they missed new arrivals at the airport, the bearded ones would
seek them out on campus. Their advances were sometimes rejected but
often welcomed among vulnerable newcomers who were homesick and out
of place.</TE>
<TE>   "Your first day in Greensboro, you didn't know anybody, maybe your
English is not so good, and they met you at the airport and helped
you get started," Zubaid said.</TE>
<TE>   One former Kuwaiti student wasn't so thrilled: He would place a
bottle of Johnnie Walker on his table whenever the mullahs came by,
like a cross proffered to Dracula.</TE>
<TE>   The disproportionate influence of religious students overseas has
long troubled Arab capitals. The region's mostly autocratic rulers
aren't keen to subsidize the training of would-be ayatollahs who
would return and espouse revolt. Nor did the prospect of religious
indoctrination abroad thrill secular parents seeking to broaden their
children's horizons.</TE>
<TE>   "Pre-Sept. 11, I knew many mothers here who worried about their
children going to America and coming back very radical in their
thinking as Islamists," said Ghabra, the political scientist at
Kuwait University.</TE>
<TE>   The Kuwaiti government would disperse U.S.-based scholarship
students if fears emerged that any kind of religious-political cabal
was gaining traction, according to several former students. The
precise reason remains unexplained but, in the late 1980s, the steady
stream of Kuwaitis attending North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical
State University dwindled. Few Arab students attend the school today.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of Sept. 11, the religious recruitment inevitably
takes on a sinister slant. Yet former A&amp;T students stress that the
Muslim evangelizing there was largely spiritual and cultural, common
enough throughout the Islamic world, where communal prayer is
encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   Students who recall Mohammed invariably describe a studious and
private devotee of the library and Allah, but friendly enough in a
casual way and capable of a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "All anyone knows about him is that he was in the mosque all the
time," said Faisal Munifi, who studied mechanical engineering at the
same time.</TE>
<TE>   "He very much kept to himself," said Zitawi, now a gas station
owner in the Greensboro area. "We'd see each other at the Burger King
for coffee or lunch. That was our hangout.... He was always polite.
He wasn't a funny guy, but when he's talking to you, you feel like
he's smiling. He wasn't rude or anything."</TE>
<TE>   Nor did Mohammed spout anti-Western or anti-American rhetoric.
"Something must have happened later that caused that feeling," said
Hindieh, who knew Mohammed at both Chowan and Greensboro. "I never
remember him saying anything like that."</TE>
<TE>   There is an unmistakable similarity between descriptions of
Mohammed and the later accounts of the men, like Mohamed Atta, he
sent to attack the United States: all Western-educated scions of
middle-class Arab families; dedicated young men from discerning
backgrounds who came to embrace a volatile creed of religion,
politics and resentment.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of 1986, after just 2 1/2 years, Mohammed had completed
his work. He graduated Dec. 18, one of 28 mechanical engineering
graduates, almost a third of them Middle Easterners. As at Chowan,
there is no photo of him in the yearbook.</TE>
<TE>   None of almost a dozen faculty members in the department from that
era recalled Mohammed. For most of his classmates and teachers, the
future terrorist mastermind with a $25-million price on his head did
not cast a long shadow, if any at all.</TE>
<TE>   Peshawar: The Call</TE>
<TE>   Jihad, Abdullah Azzam wrote, is the way of everlasting glory, and
the only way to get there is behind the barrel of a gun. "Jihad and
the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogues,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam, more than any man, created the modern notion of a Muslim's
duty to wage war against all comers in order to reestablish the reign
of Islam on Earth. It is a duty, he said, that commands all Muslims
to its banner.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam was born in the West Bank in 1941, land later occupied by
Israel. He answered his first call to battle with the Palestinian
resistance there, which he criticized because it was, he said, mere
politics insufficiently rooted in Islam.</TE>
<TE>   He departed for Cairo and an academic career, then left that when
the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979. He was among the first
of the Afghan Arabs to arrive in Peshawar, Pakistan, in an upland
basin ringed by hills that rise into mountains north and west en
route to the Khyber Pass and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's unruly Northwest Frontier
Province, has for centuries been an international crossroads for
traders, warriors and rough statesmen. In the 1980s, Azzam made it
the capital of the Afghan resistance and the destination for tens of
thousands of Muslims who joined the holy war.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia's national airline offered special jihad fares. Arab
governments sent emissaries and opened offices for dozens of
state-sponsored charities to assist the fighters.</TE>
<TE>   For a decade, parts of Peshawar were transformed into a sort of
Little Mecca.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bustling Arab town -- Arab restaurants, bazaars,
bakeries. During the jihad there were Arab newspapers and magazines
published here. There were men in kaffiyeh, women fully covered in
black," said Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pakistani journalist who became a
leading chronicler of the Afghan wars.</TE>
<TE>   It was, said Gen. Hamid Gul, who formerly headed Pakistan's
Inter-Services Intelligence, "the first international brigade of the
modern time."</TE>
<TE>   Among those who answered Azzam's call was a former student, Osama
bin Laden. Azzam's intellectual fervor and Bin Laden's bank book
combined in an organization that eventually became Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi government sent dozens of missionaries and millions of
dollars. The United States funneled arms and more millions through
Peshawar.</TE>
<TE>   Gun violence had been a way of life and death in the region long
before the Soviet war. As one Pushtun saying puts it: A man's jewelry
is his gun. But there had never been anything on this scale before.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani intelligence, the ISI, was installed as executor of
American and Saudi interests. The service created a new logistics
operation just to distribute the flood of armaments. Convoys of
10-ton trucks filled with rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers and
antiaircraft missiles were sent out daily on the cross-country trip
from the docks in Karachi to Peshawar and the Afghan interior beyond.</TE>
<TE>   "The original jihadis started in old Peshawar with very little
money, in the pre-Saudi, pre-CIA days," Yusufzai said. "Later, they
all rented places in University Town, the most expensive neighborhood
in Peshawar."</TE>
<TE>   The Arab neighborhoods in University Town were, oddly, the most
westernized in the city. Old Peshawar is a crooked tangle of alleys
and bazaars rich with the smells, smoke and people of Central Asia. A
thick haze of exhaust, dust and brick kiln smoke lies over it.</TE>
<TE>   University Town is clean and rectangular, laid out on a grid
filled with walled compounds of big three-story stucco houses that
would be at home in Orange County. The new villas were filled by the
Arabs and an even larger militia of camp followers. Armies used to be
trailed by merchants of flesh and other entertainments; modern
armies, even ragtag agglomerations like the moujahedeen, are as
likely to be followed by a social worker as a streetwalker. The
Afghan wars, because of the international nature of their combatants
and finances, were the apotheosis of this.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest industry in Peshawar in the '80s and '90s, after the
arms trade, was good works. More than 150 charities, development and
refugee care organizations opened offices.</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty to do. Afghanistan at the time of the Russian
invasion had a population of 15 million. Over a decade, that would
shrink by almost half. Many fled through the mountain passes to
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   One of the largest aid agencies was a Kuwaiti charity called
Lajnat al Dawa al Islamia, the Committee for Islamic Appeal. The
charity at one point had more than 1,000 employees in Pakistan and
was spending $4 million a year in the region. Its regional manager
was Zahed Shaikh -- Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's older brother.</TE>
<TE>   As head of one of the largest charities in town, Zahed became a
figure of importance. He knew local diplomats, the Afghan warlords;
when Pakistani politicians came to town, he shared the dais with
them.</TE>
<TE>   After college in North Carolina, Khalid, according to Kuwaiti
authorities, never returned home. Instead, he joined his big brother
in Peshawar. Another brother, Abed, a schoolteacher, left his job in
the Gulf emirate of Qatar and came east too. A man who knew all three
said Zahed, the eldest, was the coolest head of the trio; Abed was
more militant and Khalid tended to follow him.</TE>
<TE>   At the center of the Afghan resistance movement in Peshawar was
Pushtun warlord Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, who had been a junior lecturer at
Kabul University and was known as the Professor. He had been schooled
in Cairo and spoke fluent Arabic. He became the favored recipient of
money from the Saudi and American governments.</TE>
<TE>   The money funded his army, a political party, a newspaper, a huge
refugee camp and a college called the University of Dawa al Jihad,
which means Convert and Struggle.</TE>
<TE>   The university became known as a place you could learn darker
trades than mathematics -- bomb-making, for example. A student once
described it to U.S. journalist Mary Anne Weaver as an Islamic
Sandhurst, likening it to the famous British military academy. For a
time, the college also had as many as 1,000 students studying
engineering, medical technology and literature.</TE>
<TE>   The abandoned school sits behind high mud walls amid the sprawling
Jalozai refugee camp, which today has more than 200,000 residents and
is less an encampment than a city. Pakistanis marvel at the ingenuity
of the Afghans, who have built a thriving local economy that includes
the manufacture of pottery, textile and latticed wooden roofs that
are exported back to Afghanistan where timber to make such things is
scarce. There's even a carwash.</TE>
<TE>   By 1989, Mohammed had gone to work at Sayyaf's university, a
friend said. He taught there and worked weekends at the refugee camp.
The three Baluchi brothers became part of the small, semi-permanent
Arab community that included Azzam, Islamic Jihad founder Ayman
Zawahiri and Bin Laden, who came and went with his wives and children
in his own airplane. Most of the Arabs in town worshiped at a small
mosque on a dead-end alley called Arbat Road, across the street from
Zahed's office.</TE>
<TE>   It was a different world then, said one man who was part of the
scene. Everyone had the same goal: to oust the Soviets. Everyone knew
one another, prayed and socialized together, and even went to the
jihad training camps together.</TE>
<TE>   Victory over the Soviets, who withdrew in 1989, should have been
the crowning achievement of the jihad. But the various Afghan
factions, deprived of a common enemy, began fighting one another.
American support disappeared with the end of the Soviet campaign.
Many felt that the U.S. actively opposed the establishment of an
Islamic government in Kabul after the Soviet withdrawal. This was, to
some, the cruelest cut of all.</TE>
<TE>   Azzam, the heart of the Arab jihadi resistance, and two young sons
were murdered by a bomb on the street outside the mosque in 1989.
That same spring, Khalid's brother, Abed, also was killed by a bomb.</TE>
<TE>   The political and religious climate changed in Peshawar, and
resentment of the American abandonment festered. Bin Laden replaced
Azzam as head of the Arab moujahedeen and began preaching hatred
against the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the American-led
counterattack, which deepened divisions in the Arab world. Bin Laden,
for one, was furious that the Saudi royal family allowed the U.S. to
base its soldiers in the kingdom, violating what he felt was a
Koranic dictate to keep infidels out of the holy land.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the moujahedeen who had gathered in Pakistan went home,
warriors without a war. Those who stayed changed perceptibly. Khalid
Shaikh Mohammed and his circle changed with the times, one friend
said.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1991-92, their whereabouts, their meetings, their thoughts, it
became more secret," he said. "The hatred for Americans -- it was
among every Arab who came to Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Karachi: The Next War</TE>
<TE>   Peshawar in the jihad years was said to have more spies, secret
agents and freelance schemers per capita than any city in the world.
Conversations dripped intrigue and purpose. Among the plotters was
Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's nephew, Ramzi Yousef.</TE>
<TE>   Like Khalid, Yousef had left Fahaheel and Kuwait for college -- in
his case, to study electrical engineering in Wales. He first visited
Peshawar on a summer break in 1988 and then returned in 1991. He
would become the first of the next-generation jihadis to carry the
fight beyond Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   It has never been clear who, if anyone, recruited Yousef, but at
some point over the next year he began to make plans to attack. He
asked a boyhood friend who was studying at flight schools in the U.S.
to suggest potential targets. The friend suggested the World Trade
Center, and by the fall of 1992 Yousef was in New York, assembling a
team to bomb the twin towers.</TE>
<TE>   American investigators say that Mohammed in late 1992 wired
several hundred dollars to Yousef, so he knew at least where Yousef
was; investigators believe that he also knew what Yousef was doing.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed moved his base of operations to Karachi, the metropolis
of Pakistan's southern seaboard, with direct flights throughout the
Gulf, to Europe, to Southeast Asia, to Africa and the Americas. It is
Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, if also its most violent.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995 alone, there were 1,742 slayings, most of them the result
of sectarian political rivalries that made parts of the city the
exclusive property of one political party or another. These districts
are called "no-go areas"; even police have abandoned any pretext of
controlling what goes on within them.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed lived off and on in Karachi, using the city as a base
from which to travel the globe. He began using the first of dozens of
aliases, often posing as a Gulf businessman. At various times he told
people that he was a holy-water salesman, an electronics importer and
a Saudi oil sheik.</TE>
<TE>   When Yousef returned to Pakistan in 1993 after the first World
Trade Center bombing, he and Mohammed began assembling a team to
broaden the battleground. By 1994, both men were spending months at a
time in the Philippines and Malaysia, meeting like-minded men.</TE>
<TE>   The events they planned were, in what would become a Mohammed
signature, perversely spectacular: They would assassinate the pope,
perhaps the American president, and in a stunning finale would blow
up a dozen American airliners over the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The plans were thwarted when bomb-making chemicals were ignited in
a Manila apartment, leading to the discovery of their plots and the
eventual arrest of fellow plotters. Yousef fled, just as he had after
the first World Trade Center bombing, back to Pakistan. Mohammed had
been careful; none of the other plotters even knew his name. It would
be months before authorities figured out who he was and many years
and thousands of deaths before they realized his significance.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar: Slipping Away</TE>
<TE>   Yousef wasn't so careful. Some of the other plotters had known him
for years; one told police that Yousef was the same man who had
planned the Trade Center bombing. A worldwide manhunt ensued and
within months Yousef's whereabouts were betrayed. American and
Pakistani agents stormed a hotel room in Islamabad, the Pakistani
capital, in February 1995 and hauled Yousef away, kicking and
screaming. At least that's what another guest told a reporter.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a hurricane, a big panic," the guest said. "He was
shouting: 'Why are you taking me? I am innocent! Show me papers if
you are going to arrest me! Who are you?' No one listened to him.
They took him without his shoes. His eyes were blindfolded, his head
was covered, his arms and legs were tied."</TE>
<TE>   The man giving this account identified himself as a Karachi
businessman. He was registered under the name Khalid Shaikh. It was,
American authorities eventually came to believe, Mohammed, hiding in
plain sight. Mohammed's caution -- he used three aliases on the
Manila plot alone -- had paid off. He was still an unknown. That was
about to end.</TE>
<TE>   Yousef never gave up any valuable information. But investigators
had recovered his laptop computer in Manila and a treasure trove of
leads. The computer files included a letter seeking money for the
plots. It was addressed to a potential donor, one who the
letter-writer apparently felt was shirking his duty.</TE>
<TE>   "Fear Allah, Mr. Siddiqui, there is a day of judgment," the letter
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was signed Khalid Shaikh.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew there was another person involved ... but he was very
mysterious and we didn't know who he was," said Herman, who led the
FBI investigation of the Manila plot. "He basically eluded us."</TE>
<TE>   The evidence they did have led investigators back to Peshawar and
the circle of friends and acquaintances there. Zahed Shaikh --
Mohammed's brother -- was scrutinized, and although there was never a
formal accusation lodged against him, he disappeared from Peshawar.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say Mohammed spent the next year building and
maintaining a fund-raising network in the Persian Gulf.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout the region, there was this classic sort of money
collector -- the guy who was hanging out at the mosque, checking out
the scene, basically casing the mark, who would invariably be some
old guy with lots of money. A religious guy, probably. The collector
would come up alongside him, make his pitch very persistently and the
mark would write him a check," said one American official, who worked
in the Gulf throughout the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was a collector, a guy who would collect
the money from the street collectors.... A guy in the Philippines
would call a guy in Dubai who would call Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. It
would be a chain of telephone calls, and Khalid would send the
money."</TE>
<TE>   American understanding of Islamic terrorism then was still
inchoate. Even Bin Laden was seen as just another guy with bad ideas
and a lot of money. Al Qaeda was barely on the screen. Potential
state-sponsored terrorism was deemed more dangerous, so more
attention was given to Iran, which had become the chief international
proponent of Islamist goals.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed lived openly in the Gulf. "He wasn't even using an
alias," said one official. American agents tracked him to Italy,
Egypt, Singapore, Jordan, Thailand, the Philippines and Qatar. In
Qatar, American officials say, he stayed as the guest of a member of
the country's ruling family, Abdullah ibn Khalid al Thani, who was
then the country's minister of religious affairs.</TE>
<TE>   "Abdullah ibn Khalid had a farm outside" Doha, said one American
official. "A lot of these guys had what were basically gentlemen's
truck farms. It was a hobby. Grow cabbages, raise ducks. So he has
this farm and he always had a lot of people around, the house was
always overstaffed, a lot of unemployed Afghan Arabs.... There were
always these guys hanging around and maybe a couple of Kalashnikovs
in the corner."</TE>
<TE>   American intelligence figured out that one of the guys on the farm
was Mohammed. About the same time, a grand jury in New York indicted
Mohammed for the Manila airliner plot and a debate occurred on what,
exactly, to do about it.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Louis J. Freeh met with Qatari officials seeking
permission to arrest him. One FBI official said months passed without
approval, even though Qatar acknowledged that Mohammed, whom agents
had begun referring to as KSM, was there. At one point, according to
documents obtained by The Times, Qatar told the U.S. that it feared
Mohammed was constructing an explosive device. They also said he
possessed more than 20 different passports; still, they delayed
granting the U.S. permission to arrest him.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials strongly felt that the U.S. should act as quickly
and with as much force as necessary to capture Mohammed. Others were
more wary. A meeting was called in Washington in early 1996. Caution
prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   "That D.C. meeting ... struck me as one of the great lessons in
politics," said one person who attended the meeting. "Here was this
opportunity to get this bad guy, and we didn't do it. The Qatar
government had no interest in screwing up its fragile relationship
with us. If we had gone in and nabbed this guy, or just cut his head
off, the Qatari government would not have complained a bit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone around the table for their own reasons refused to go
after someone who fundamentally threatened American interests.... The
FBI can't go anywhere overseas without the CIA providing the intel,
the [Department of Defense] providing the logistics and military
muscle in the event we have to shoot our way in. And none of that
happened."</TE>
<TE>   Another person at the meeting said the real obstacle was the
Pentagon, which feared another "Black Hawk Down" debacle similar to
the one in Somalia in 1993 and insisted that a raid would require
hundreds, if not thousands, of troops.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, rather than sending a kidnapping squad, Freeh sent a
letter to Qatar's government. By the time permission was granted and
American agents went to Doha, Mohammed was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "We reached out to every one of our friends out there to try
and get him," recalls one senior Justice Department official. "But he
just kind of slipped off the screen."</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan: Regrouping</TE>
<TE>   Being on the run did not mean that Mohammed was out of commission.</TE>
<TE>   He left Qatar about the same time Bin Laden was making common
cause with the newly emergent Taliban in Afghanistan, who in exchange
for his assistance gave him a secure base from which to operate.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of attacks in Saudi Arabia marked the beginning of a new
jihad, Bin Laden told British journalist Robert Fisk in 1996. He
began expanding the reach of Al Qaeda across the world. Investigators
now suspect that Mohammed was the key man in that effort. While Bin
Laden and the men previously identified as his main deputies --
Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef and Abu Zubeida -- spent the bulk of their
time in Afghanistan and Pakistan consolidating and rebuilding their
training camps, Mohammed traveled the globe, searching out allies and
recruits, and assembling what now seems like an omnipresent worldwide
network.</TE>
<TE>   "He was building a terrorism business. He was one of the key
lieutenants in the entire Al Qaeda structure," said the FBI's Herman.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators suspect that Mohammed developed direct personal
relationships with several of the men who became Al Qaeda's top
regional operatives.</TE>
<TE>   His trail wound through Europe, Africa, the Gulf, Southeast Asia
and even South America, according to investigators in Malaysia where
Mohammed, traveling under an Egyptian passport, obtained a Brazilian
visa.</TE>
<TE>   At times, said one senior U.S. counter-terrorism official,
Mohammed would travel to other countries to personally establish
terrorist cells and provide them with plans for attack, money,
manpower and logistical support. Other times, he would operate at a
higher level, overseeing senior Al Qaeda commanders who led the
attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The official said Mohammed is believed to have been
actively involved in the bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa that
killed 224 people in 1998, the bombing of the Cole in the Yemeni port
of Aden in 2000, which killed 17 sailors and nearly sank the
$1-billion U.S. warship, and many other attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a clear operational link between him and the execution
of most, if not all, of the Al Qaeda plots over the past five years,"
the official said.</TE>
<TE>   American investigators acknowledge that this evaluation of
Mohammed as a central figure in Al Qaeda is largely retrospective. It
wasn't until after Sept. 11 that his larger role became apparent.</TE>
<TE>   "He popped up post 9/11 and then, looking back, we saw that he was
the Zelig of Al Qaeda, involved in a lot of other things," one
investigator said.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11</TE>
<TE>   One of the hallmarks of Al Qaeda is its breadth, the dispersion of
its resources. So, for example, parts of the network could be
preparing to attack American warships in Yemen, others to bomb
civilian targets in Europe and Asia, even as the larger organization
was already planning Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview with Al Jazeera television, recorded in May this
year, Mohammed described himself as the head of Al Qaeda's military
committee. He said that "about 2 1/2years prior to the holy raids on
Washington and New York, the military committee held a meeting during
which we decided to start planning for a martyrdom operation inside
America."</TE>
<TE>   That would date the inception of the plot to early 1999. Later
that same year, the men who would execute it were chosen, he said.
German intelligence agencies believe that Mohammed first came into
contact with these men when they visited Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Several of the men were students in Hamburg, Germany, part of a
small group of devout Muslims who were growing increasingly restive
over the plight of the Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   They were largely middle class, some well educated, not
dispossessed in any apparent way. One was an urban planner and
architect, one an aeronautical engineering student and one a
prospective marine engineering student. Mohammed, a mechanical
engineering graduate, chose other engineers for Al Qaeda's riskiest
undertaking. They were, like him, devout but at home in the West,
adept at languages and technically inclined.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the hijacking crews were made up of two veteran Al
Qaeda operatives, a replacement pilot and a group of young Gulf Arab
volunteers, chosen from what Mohammed described as "a big excess of
brothers who were filled with desire for martyrdom," whose job was
mainly to effect the physical takeover of the airliners.</TE>
<TE>   As Sept. 11 approached, intelligence agents in the West were
nearly beside themselves with anxiety. They knew something was going
to happen, but they couldn't figure out what. Mohammed was already
moving on. He spent the weeks before Sept. 11 instructing a new
Canadian recruit on communications protocols. He was sending the
recruit to Southeast Asia to coordinate a bombing campaign in the
Philippines and Singapore. The only acknowledgment that something big
was afoot was his suggestion that the recruit should probably leave
Pakistan before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   It is that sort of unrelenting focus that makes Mohammed such a
feared figure among those who pursue him. He simply does not stop.</TE>
<TE>   In the months after Sept. 11, investigators think that Mohammed
was moving back and forth between Pakistan and Afghanistan. One
Afghan general, Ziaudeen Deldar, said intelligence reports indicate
that "Khalid the Baluchi" was among hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters who
escaped on foot to Pakistan from a camp near Shahi Kot in
southeastern Afghanistan last spring when American forces launched
Operation Anaconda -- an attempt, they said, to finish off Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Americans faced considerably more resistance than
anticipated and backed off. The grasp of the anaconda relaxed and the
prey, including Mohammed, slipped away. Weeks later, Al Qaeda
operatives blew up a truck outside a synagogue in Tunisia, killing 19
people. In the days leading up to the attack, investigators say, one
of the bombers was in frequent telephone contact with a man in
Karachi -- Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed was accompanied at the Al Jazeera interview by Ramzi
Binalshibh, another Hamburg man who had wanted to become one of the
suicide pilots but who tried and failed four times to obtain a U.S.
visa. Binalshibh instead became Mohammed's field coordinator for the
plot.</TE>
<TE>   It's noteworthy that in the interview, Mohammed let Binalshibh do
most of the talking. Even in granting an interview, the purpose of
which ostensibly was to reveal, he exposed almost nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Karachi: Behind Walls</TE>
<TE>   Karachi is a reasonably modern, at times almost ordinary, place.
Kids on bikes pass by on their way to school. Boys and girls giggle
in one another's presence and listen to music that offends their
parents' ears. Young hipsters scout the latest boutiques and
restaurants with cool, enigmatic one-word names. Okra is one of the
latest.</TE>
<TE>   The city is by many measures a mess. It hasn't had a comprehensive
development plan since the 1920s, the air is foul, but cars are
smaller and traffic manageable. Important people ride Toyota Corollas
to work, some with chauffeurs and bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   It has some of the vanity and swagger of cities accustomed to
dominating their surroundings. It is in love with the myth of itself
as a place of danger and deception.</TE>
<TE>   So maybe it is not surprising how many people here can tell you
where Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is, would be or has recently been. For a
ghost, he has made many appearances. You can, in a couple of weeks,
collect half a dozen addresses and a great many more stories.</TE>
<TE>   The stories start in the Defense Housing Society, a large, newer
group of neighborhoods between the old city center and the sea. It
was at a Defense apartment building that a big shootout occurred in
September. Defense -- it's named for its developer, army officers --
contains many of the finer districts in the city. Benazir Bhutto, the
former prime minister, lives in one of them, a leafy area of big
homes and older-model Mercedeses.</TE>
<TE>   The shootout was just beyond the better neighborhoods, in a
commercial-industrial tract full of five- and six-story buildings,
most with low-rent light industrial tenants: textile plants, zipper
and button factories and small machine shops. The streets are paved,
but the buildings are separated by bare dirt and are shuttered in the
front with metal roll-up doors. The night before, when police
arrived, the streets were empty and dark.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing happened that night. The police or, rather, the
authorities -- there were more intelligence agents and army special
forces than there were cops -- waited. This is the sort of thing that
spawns rumors. Why did they wait? The simplest explanation, the one
authorities give, is of course not trusted, but it is the one that
makes sense. They waited because they didn't know what else to do.
They didn't know what or who to expect and waited to see.</TE>
<TE>   People would like to believe the opposite: that authorities knew
everything and waited because that would confuse things afterward;
that they waited to give the people they had come to get time to
escape; that they waited because this is Karachi and nobody knows why
they waited.</TE>
<TE>   This is what happens in a place where everything has been secret
for so long. And it is one of the reasons Karachi is such a great
place to hide: Who couldn't hide in a place where everything is
hidden?</TE>
<TE>   Khalid Shaikh Mohammed first came here to live and do business a
decade ago, assembling money and people for plots that would occur
everywhere in the world but here. An early co-conspirator said he
first met Mohammed in an Arab neighborhood full of money changers and
bucket shops. A man who was captured in another plot had a phone
number for Mohammed that was traced to the other end of town, a
middle-class preserve of single-family homes of clean modern lines
behind pale stucco walls.</TE>
<TE>   The walls, actually, are the one thing many of the neighborhoods
have in common. Karachi is a city of walls.</TE>
<TE>   Another address is in the neighborhood where Ramzi Yousef's
in-laws lived, a cramped, dense place where the food stalls are full
of root vegetables and the women wear the richly embroidered dresses
favored by Baluchis. At least 10% of Karachi's 12 million people are
from Baluchistan, the next province to the northwest, and there is a
constant traffic to and from the rural precincts, and from there to
Iran and Afghanistan. It's where Mohammed's people came from.</TE>
<TE>   A man claimed that he met Mohammed and his family across the marsh
flats in the mud huts of another neighborhood this past spring.
Mohammed was posing as a spiritual advisor, a holy man on the run
from Arab agents who didn't like his brand of Islam. The story seemed
preposterous, but police acknowledge that they received a tip from
another source and searched the same neighborhood extensively.</TE>
<TE>   The part about there being a family turned out to have some basis.
The police and the agents and the army all gathered for the big
shootout in Defense because of the family. Earlier that day, acting
on a tip, the police raided an apartment a couple of miles away.
Pakistini authorities say they had information, based on utility
records, that a senior Al Qaeda leader might be there. Instead, they
found three children, two women and a man.</TE>
<TE>   One of the women was a caretaker, and one child was hers. The
other woman was a "foster mother" of sorts to the other two children,
and the man her companion. The two boys, ages 7 and 9, were named
Omar and Abdullah. Pakistani and American officials believe that
their father is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.</TE>
<TE>   American authorities say the house contained photographs of
Mohammed with the children; there was also evidence of another woman,
thought to be Mohammed's wife. It seemed a happy, playful group, a
senior FBI investigator said. Some thought that they might have
missed Mohammed by mere minutes, so when the people they captured
told them about a group of Arabs living at another address in
Defense, the authorities called up reserves and hurried across town.</TE>
<TE>   "Our officers moved immediately," said a senior Pakistani
official. "No, we didn't know that he was there. But from the
interviews and surveillance we knew there was something big going on.
The number of people there, the weapons, the intelligence we
gathered. "</TE>
<TE>   After morning prayers, they found the caretaker, who told
them that the entire top floor was filled with Arabs. They'd been
there for two months, he said, and overpaid on the rent. The
authorities went in, and all hell broke loose. They were fired on
immediately, the Pakistani official said. "Then it was a
free-for-all. We fired at the windowpanes, put in tear gas and
stormed them."</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of rounds and two dead men later, the authorities secured
the building. They searched room by room and in a storage space under
a stairwell found the would-be Sept. 11 pilot Ramzi Binalshibh.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, and still, Karachi was thick with rumor. Mohammed was
dead, was captured, was there and got away, was there and was allowed
to get away.</TE>
<TE>   The police are about the only ones who claim not to know how near
they were to catching him that morning. They think that they were
close, but they don't really know. They are, as they've been for a
decade, still looking and they're not quite sure who it is they're
trying to find.</TE>
<TE>   They're hesitant to talk about it much, but intelligence officers
acknowledge that they have interrogated Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's two
young sons. Not surprisingly, the boys haven't had much to say. Not
even his children know much about the man who engineered Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>7 Germans Die in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>Mechanical failure is considered the cause of the soldiers'
helicopter crash, which comes hours after an American is killed in
combat.</DH>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>KABUL, Afghanistan -- New harm befell foreign military forces here
Saturday as seven German peacekeepers were killed in the apparent
crash-landing of their helicopter only hours after the first combat
death of a U.S. soldier since May.</LD>
<LD>   The crash capped what was among the most violent weeks in
Afghanistan since Sept. 5, when a car bomb killed at least 25 people
in Kabul and President Hamid Karzai narrowly escaped an assassination
attempt in the southern city of Kandahar. Security has been tight and
tensions have been rising with the approach of today's one-year
anniversary of Karzai's appointment as interim president.</LD>
<LD>   The helicopter accident, thought to have been caused by a
mechanical failure, also claimed the lives of two youths on the
ground at the crash site, a largely industrial area near the airport,
according to Kabul Police Chief Abdul Basir.</LD>
<TE>   Col. Andreas Steffan, a spokesman for the German contingent of the
International Security Assistance Force, said the chopper was on a
routine mission when it went down just before 4 p.m. The Germans are
part of a 22-nation, 4,700-soldier peacekeeping force charged with
policing Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   German technical experts were scheduled to arrive in Afghanistan
today to try to determine the cause of the crash. Witnesses saw a
fire on board the chopper shortly before but heard no explosion to
indicate a rocket attack, Steffan said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Defense Department identified the U.S. soldier
killed earlier Saturday as Sgt. Steven Checo, 22, of New York, a
member of the 504th Infantry Division. Checo died in a firefight near
the village of Shkin in the unsettled southeastern province of
Paktika, where Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants continue to harass U.S.
military units from hide-outs across the border in Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   The skirmish took place after an armored convoy of U.S. soldiers
approached "seven to nine" suspicious individuals about three miles
from the U.S. base at Shkin, spokesman Maj. Stephen Clutter said.
Soldiers then dismounted their vehicles to give chase, and the
suspects began firing before fleeing. Although the U.S. platoon
quickly received air support from A-10 aircraft, no enemy soldiers
were captured or killed.</TE>
<TE>   The fatality was the 26th suffered in action by U.S. forces since
the war on terrorism was mounted after last year's Sept. 11 attacks.
An additional 28 soldiers have died in nonhostile incidents,
including plane crashes and other accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such incidents, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Richard B.
Myers told reporters at nearby Bagram air base during a visit
Saturday that the country is a better place to live than it was a
year ago and that progress is being made in the fight against
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "My assessment is that things continue to get better over here,"
the general said. "We know there are going to be times when U.S.
forces will get shot at ... and that we're going to take some
casualties, unfortunately, and we did have a tragic death last
night."</TE>
<TE>   But he added: "We're making progress every day, and not just the
military but the whole international effort ... to make Afghanistan a
better place to live."</TE>
<TE>   The Pakistani border, across which the attackers were believed to
have fled Saturday, will be a "problem for some time to come because
of the free movement of population back and forth," Myers said. But
he said he was satisfied with the Pakistani government's cooperation
in efforts to secure the border, including the arrest of 400
terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, two U.S. soldiers were seriously injured outside
Kabul's main money changers' market when a grenade was thrown into
their parked car. Two suspects arrested in connection with that
attack are to be interrogated soon by U.S. forces, Afghanistan
commander Lt. Gen. Dan McNeill told reporters Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, an assailant killed himself and two Afghans in an
attack on the main camp of the German ISAF contingent, about six
miles east of Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The two incidents are thought to have been the first direct
attacks on multinational forces in or near the capital since the fall
a year ago of the fundamentalist Taliban regime, although the city
has been the scene of numerous bombings and rocket attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But for his part, McNeill insisted that the security situation in
Kabul is improving.</TE>
<TE>   "By and large, when you consider that 1 million refugees have been
pushed back into that city in the last year, I think Kabul's doing
pretty well. But you can't put a Western template on it," McNeill
said. The attacks Tuesday and Thursday were more "casual than planned
professionally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, McNeill said, he expected "sympathetic"
terrorist attacks in Afghanistan to increase if the United States
leads a war on Iraq.</TE>

<LD>An oil slick the size of New York City is moving away from Spain's
coast and is not closing in on the devastated beaches of Galicia,
Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said.</LD>
<LD>   But high winds made it difficult for clean-up ships to suction off
the fuel oil spilled from the sunken tanker Prestige, Rajoy said,
adding that the nearest slivers of the slick were 18 nautical miles
off the Sisargas Islands, just off the coast of Galicia.</LD>
<LD>   Spanish media have reported that an oil slick estimated at 309
square miles was encroaching on the northwestern coast.</LD>

<LD>President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ordered a holiday cease-fire with
communist rebels -- who refused to reciprocate but promised that they
would fight only if attacked.</LD>
<LD>   In a speech marking Armed Forces Day, Arroyo ordered a "suspension
of offensive military operations" against the New People's Army
rebels on Christmas Eve, Christmas, Dec. 31 and Jan. 1 to give
soldiers time off.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for the Communist Party said it will not -- for the
first time in 17 years -- declare a holiday cease-fire, but said it
would prefer no hostilities.</LD>

<LD>Italy's conservative government has unveiled plans to crack down on
prostitution, saying it wants to sweep streetwalkers out of public
view.</LD>
<LD>   Under the bill, which has to be approved by Parliament,
prostitutes caught soliciting in public would face on-the-spot fines
for a first offense, and fines of up to $1,000 and three months in
jail if caught again. Their clients also could be fined.</LD>
<LD>   But women would be allowed to work in "cooperatives" as long as no
more than two work in one apartment and the building's other tenants
don't object.</LD>

housing project. Three people were arrested.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives found the art Friday, nearly three months after it
disappeared from Russborough House, the home of the late English art
collector and philanthropist Sir Alfred Beit. It was the fourth time
thieves had targeted the house south of Dublin, which is open to the

<HD>Colombia Extends Special Powers</HD>
<DH>Senate measure will keep current state of emergency in
effect until May.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Colombia's Senate has extended a measure that gives the government
emergency powers in its battle against outlawed armed groups, a
government official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate approval late Friday extends the measure for 90 days
beginning Feb. 7, when it was set to expire, said Maria Margarita
Zuleta, a vice minister for justice and the interior.</LD>
<LD>   Colombia's Constitution allows the measure to be renewed without
approval from the House of Representatives. This was the second time
the Senate has extended the measure, Zuleta said.</LD>
<TE>   President Alvaro Uribe's Aug. 13 declaration of a "state of
unrest" gives the government power to decree special measures to
battle leftist rebels fighting in the nation's 38-year civil
conflict. Most of the country's outlawed right-wing paramilitary
groups recently declared a unilateral cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights monitors worry that the emergency powers could be
used to suppress individual freedoms. Colombia's Constitutional Court
has thrown out many of the provisions pushed through under the
measure.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Uribe won final approval from Congress late Friday on a
sweeping tax hike and a referendum to stem political corruption, the
president's office said.</TE>

<HD>Home for the Holidays -- With an Escort</HD>
<DH>Mexican drivers arriving from the U.S. get VIP treatment
from police officers who are there to protect them, not extort them.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hector Tobar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>If you're a Mexican living in the U.S. and the journey to your
homeland this holiday season takes you through this rough-and-tumble
border city, one group of police officers will offer to give you a
VIP escort so other police don't rob you.</LD>
<LD>   With their American-bought cars loaded with Christmas presents,
returning Mexican immigrants have long presented an enticing target
for corrupt cops, customs agents and other unsavory characters.</LD>
<LD>   This month and next, Mexico's federal government is sponsoring the
Paisano (Countryman) Project in this and other border crossing
points, as tens of thousands of people travel from America to states
such as Zacatecas and Michoacan in the heart of Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Driving a beat-up tan van that had brought him from Franklin,
Tenn., and heading for the city of La Piedad in Michoacan,
bleary-eyed Fernando Guzman seemed an unlikely candidate for the
red-carpet treatment.</TE>
<TE>   And yet, there he was, following the red-and-blue flashing lights
of a Nuevo Laredo police car, his family's caravan of vehicles being
guided through the city to a customs checkpoint 16 miles outside of
town.</TE>
<TE>   No one hit him up for a bribe. No one threatened to confiscate his
Christmas presents if he didn't fork up a little "assistance" for the
men in blue.</TE>
<TE>   "When they treat you like this it makes you happy to be here,"
said Guzman, 36, who works detailing cars back in Tennessee. "When
you first start the trip, you're full of worries. You think you won't
make it back home to your tierra [land] without at least one bad
thing happening to you."</TE>
<TE>   The program has escorted at least 1,300 cars so far this holiday
season.</TE>
<TE>   President Vicente Fox has made treatment of Mexicans in the U.S. a
priority of his administration. In 2000, he invited a group of
expatriates to his first official appearance as president and
declared Mexicans living abroad "national heroes."</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Fox visited Nuevo Laredo to review the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to tell our beloved paisanos and paisanas that they can
come [to Mexico] with confidence," Fox said. "They will be treated
here with honesty and efficiency. And if they suffer any abuse, their
complaints will be heard."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, during a similar Fox visit, local television reported
that state police had robbed a caravan of travelers outside the city.</TE>
<TE>   The returning migrants "come to see their sons, wives and
brothers," said Laura Montano, head of Mexico's federal immigration
office here and local coordinator of the Paisano Program. "For them,
to return home is a feeling of success and happiness. That's why it's
sad that some [officials] try to take that happiness away from them."</TE>
<TE>   The Paisano escorts are also in place at all the other major
crossing points along the border, from Tijuana near San Diego to
Matamoros near the Gulf of Mexico, Montano said.</TE>
<TE>   In Nuevo Laredo, Montano has helped streamline the process whereby
returning immigrants register their vehicles for the trip home, a
paper chase that requires approval from three Mexican agencies. In
years past, the procedures were rife with abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Now the returnees can get all the paperwork done in a single
office, in less than an hour, with young aides in white windbreakers
labeled "Paisano" roaming the room to make sure they don't suffer any
official abuse. Large signs proclaimed "Feliz Navidad Paisanos."</TE>
<TE>   With a reporter looking on, Montano escorted one elderly -- and
somewhat disoriented -- couple from Texas through the procedure.</TE>
<TE>   "Ordinarily, we would expect them to try and take some money from
us," said Gabriel Quinones, a resident of Belton, Texas, who, like
other immigrants, carried a laminated copy of his U.S. naturalization
papers to show the officials. "But I guess that's not going to happen
this time." Quinones was traveling to Durango to visit relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the registration center, the cars in the parking lot
offered proof of how Mexican immigration has spread to nearly every
corner of the United States. They sported license plates from a dozen
states, including Illinois, New York, Georgia, Colorado and
Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   The Guzman family caravan from Tennessee included Fernando, his
brother (whose truck was towing a trailer), his cousin and a guy from
Georgia they had met along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Their escort was young patrolman Heraclio Lerma, who, like all the
officers working on the Paisano Project here, is fresh out of the
academy, untainted by connection to the department's old guard.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't even given me a gun yet," Lerma said.</TE>
<TE>   Reaching the customs checkpoint outside of town, Lerma said
goodbye to his charges without accepting anything other than a
grateful handshake from Guzman. "We can only hope that the rest of
the trip is as nice as this," Guzman said.</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Girl Shot in Gaza</HD>
<DH>The victim is the third child killed in four days in a
chaotic battle-zone border area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>An 11-year-old Palestinian girl was fatally shot near her home in the
southern Gaza Strip on Saturday, two days after another 11-year-old
girl was killed in the same area, a border zone where civilians have
increasingly been caught up in chaotic fighting between Israeli
troops and Palestinian gunmen.</LD>
<LD>   The child's death came as Israeli soldiers, backed by tanks and
armor, enforced a stringent new blockade in the narrow Mediterranean
coastal strip that prevented tens of thousands of Palestinians from
venturing more than a few miles from their homes.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the heightened security, at least one Palestinian gunman
managed to make his way late Saturday into a Jewish settlement in
southern Gaza and lob grenades at the Israeli troops guarding it
before being shot and killed.</LD>
<TE>   One soldier was injured, the army said. Troops using helicopters
and searchlights hunted late into the night for any accomplices in
the infiltration of the settlement, Morag.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement lies close to the town of Rafah, where the
11-year-old Palestinian girl was shot hours earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives and hospital officials said Hanina abu Seiteh was shot
in the thigh as she walked home from school with her 12-year-old
sister.</TE>
<TE>   Their neighborhood has been the scene of fierce exchanges of fire
almost every day between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   The bullet that struck Hanina apparently nicked an artery, and she
died a short time later in the Rafah hospital, doctors said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said it did not know anything about the death but
reported that around that time, a group of Palestinians had tossed
grenades at Israeli soldiers and the troops had responded with
gunfire.</TE>
<TE>   Like much of Gaza, Rafah and its adjoining refugee camp are
densely populated.</TE>
<TE>   The area where most of the recent armed confrontations have
occurred is packed with flimsily built shanties that offer those
living there almost no protection against stray shots from automatic
weapons or heavy machine guns.</TE>
<TE>   Hanina's death was the third in four days of a child in Gaza
younger than 16. Another 11-year-old schoolgirl was killed Thursday
as she leaned out of the window of her family home to watch the
funeral procession of a 15-year-old boy who had been shot on the
street Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Each side blames the other for the escalating civilian casualty
count.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians say the Israeli military operates with reckless
disregard for the safety of Palestinian civilians; the Israelis
accuse the gunmen of deliberately using crowded neighborhoods as
cover for staging attacks and for smuggling weapons via a network of
tunnels that run beneath the border with Egypt.</TE>
<TE>   The Gaza blockade imposed Saturday was in response to a surge in
the number of shooting attacks against Israeli civilians and soldiers
-- in particular, the ambush-style killing Friday of the rabbi of a
Jewish settlement in central Gaza, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   The 40-year-old rabbi, Yitzhak Aramai, was shot at the wheel of
his car, in which his wife and six children were also riding. None of
the other family members was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility for the shooting. Early Saturday, the army arrested
two Islamic Jihad members in Gaza and blew up their houses, but it
did not say whether they were believed linked to the attack on the
rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   The new Israeli checkpoints, through which only ambulances were
being allowed to pass, blocked Gaza's main north-south roads,
dividing the strip into three small sectors and trapping many people
who had left their homes to work or visit relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The army said this blockade is the most restrictive in five
months. Its lifting will depend on the security situation, a military
spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   In the West Bank city of Jenin, a German diplomat escaped injury
when a Palestinian gunman fired shots at his armored car, the army
and Palestinian officials said. The diplomat was not identified.</TE>

<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraq, which has been trying to improve ties with its Persian Gulf War
foe Kuwait, promised Saturday to return another batch of Kuwaiti
property missing since the conflict more than a decade ago.</LD>
<LD>   A Foreign Ministry statement said Iraq would hand back the
property today at the headquarters of the U.N. Iraq-Kuwait
Observation Mission in Umm al Qasr.</LD>
<LD>   The mission observes the cease-fire that ended the 1991 Gulf War,
in which a U.S.-led coalition expelled Iraqi forces from Kuwait after
Baghdad invaded its neighbor.</LD>
<TE>   The ministry said Iraqi customs authorities had recently seized
the property, including four paintings and seven gifts from foreign
dignitaries to the Kuwaiti ruling family, along with museum items.</TE>
<TE>   It did not say where the items had been found.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq has previously returned some property it took from Kuwait
during its 1990-91 occupation, including gold, museum pieces,
military equipment and civil and military aircraft, as required by
the cease-fire terms.</TE>

<HD>Singer Returns to Mexico to Face Charges</HD>
<DH>Gloria Trevi fought extradition from Brazil. She is accused
of corrupting minors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Boudreaux</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>MEXICO CITY -- One of Latin America's trashiest real-life soap operas
came full circle Saturday when disgraced Mexican pop idol Gloria
Trevi flew home from Brazil, with the baby she had in prison, to face
charges of kidnapping young girls and forcing them to have sex with
her manager.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly three years behind bars, Trevi, 34, gave up fighting
extradition last month, saying she feared losing custody of her
10-month-old son, Angel Gabriel, who was conceived under unexplained
circumstances in an all-woman cellblock. The singer known as Mexico's
Madonna has denied the charges against her.</LD>
<LD>   "I miss my country," she told reporters before boarding a
commercial airliner in Sao Paulo under Mexican police escort. "I have
confidence in God, in my lawyers, in my family and in justice."</LD>
<TE>   Mexicans dwelt on the diva's homecoming with macabre fascination,
predicting a blockbuster trial and, eventually, her return to the pop
music scene she once dominated with her untamed red hair, she-devil
stage antics and gritty lyrics about female empowerment that sold
millions of albums.</TE>
<TE>   For weeks, her long-awaited extradition has prompted breathless
media coverage and a proliferation of pro-Gloria Web sites. The jail
awaiting her in the northern city of Chihuahua was repainted for her
arrival, and a leading Mexican producer announced plans to serialize
her travails for television.</TE>
<TE>   A swarm of federal agents kept Trevi fans at bay as their idol
landed in the Caribbean resort city of Cancun and was led to a
Mexican government jet bound for Chihuahua.</TE>
<TE>   Trevi faces charges there of being an accomplice to rape,
kidnapping with intent to have sex and corrupting minors. If
convicted, she could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The accusations are based on claims by Karina Yapor, now 20, whose
parents sent her from Chihuahua to Mexico City for musical training
in the care of Trevi and her manager, Sergio Andrade, eight years
ago. The girl abandoned a baby in Spain in 1999, saying Andrade was
the father.</TE>
<TE>   Yapor told reporters Saturday that she had forgiven Trevi but was
ready to testify that she "suffered horrible physical and
psychological torture" while living with the singer and her manager.</TE>
<TE>   Trevi was the 14-year-old child of an abusive father when she met
Andrade, then twice her age. He guided her to a string of platinum
albums, hit movies, nude-pinup calendars and a lucrative contract
with Televisa, Mexico's leading television network.</TE>
<TE>   Her in-your-face sexuality made her one of Latin America's hottest
stars of the 1990s, a trash-talking icon who defied traditional
Latino ideas about the role of women.</TE>
<TE>   During concerts, she would summon a young man from the audience to
the stage and strip him to his underwear. Wearing bandoleers of
condoms across her bare chest, she sang about unwed pregnancies and
abortion rights. She flashed her pantied crotch and said she wanted
to run for president.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, however, some of Trevi's former fans, including
Yapor and Andrade's ex-wife, wrote books challenging the singer's
public persona. They depicted Andrade as the head of a sex cult that
abducted star-struck teenage girls, with Trevi as his submissive
henchwoman.</TE>
<TE>   As Mexican police started to investigate those stories in 1999,
the couple vanished, prompting a hunt across Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, Brazilian police found Trevi and Andrade in a
beachfront apartment on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana, along with three
teenage sisters and Maria Raquenel Portillo, a bandmate of Trevi's
known as Mary Boquitas. The teenagers were sent home to Mexico, the
others arrested.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's Supreme Court authorized the trio's extradition in
December 2000. Five months later, Trevi became pregnant -- a fact
used by her lawyers to try to keep her in Brazil, because that
country traditionally refuses to send home foreigners with
Brazilian-born children.</TE>
<TE>   Trevi's lawyers said she was raped by a Brazilian police officer.
The police at first said she managed to impregnate herself with the
sperm of a Brazilian gangster imprisoned in a nearby cellblock.</TE>
<TE>   After the baby was born, Brazilian authorities took DNA samples
and declared that Andrade had fathered it, allegedly after Trevi
bribed guards for time alone with him in an attorney-client
conference room. Her lawyers have demanded independent DNA tests.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade and Raquenel remain imprisoned in Brazil, also facing
extradition. The Supreme Court turned down their bids for political
asylum, along with Trevi's, last month.</TE>
<TE>   Trevi told the Mexican newspaper Reforma last week that the
scandalous claims against her "are all false," nothing more than a
conspiracy by her enemies in Mexico's television industry and young
women who write "truculent stories to get rich at my expense."</TE>
<TE>   She also said she feared for her life. For that reason, her
lawyers insisted that she return home on a commercial flight, even
though Mexico sent a government plane to pick her up. The dispute
delayed her extradition by a day, and she won.</TE>
<TE>   A fan club in her native Monterrey has gathered 5,000 signatures
on a petition saying she cannot get a fair trial in Chihuahua and
demanding a change of venue.</TE>
<TE>   Public opinion, however, may have turned against her. Her fans
were mostly young girls, and they have grown up. Nearly two-thirds of
Mexicans polled nationwide by Reforma said Trevi is guilty. Yet many
Mexicans believe her celebrity status will get her off the hook.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Subversion Legislation Elicits Growing Opposition in
Hong Kong</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tyler Marshall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Saddled with economic woes, eroding confidence and a struggling
political leadership, the last thing Hong Kong needs is doubt cast on
the future of its democratic freedoms.</LD>
<LD>   But the regional government's determination to push through a new
anti-subversion law despite mounting public opposition has done
precisely that.</LD>
<LD>   Since a loosely worded consultation document on the new
legislation was unveiled in September, a disparate grouping of
organizations ranging from Amnesty International and the World Assn.
of Newspapers to multinational banks and chambers of commerce have
weighed in with high-profile public statements of concern.</LD>
<TE>   Last Sunday, thousands of marchers snaked their way through
central Hong Kong, protesting the proposal. Organizers called it the
largest demonstration against the regional government since the
British colonial era ended more than five years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just the mass media and some politicians" who are
opposed, said Martin Lee, co-founder of Hong Kong's Democratic Party
and a human rights activist. "It's bankers, lawyers, businesspeople
and librarians. What more do you want?"</TE>
<TE>   Even President Bush was drawn briefly into the debate, feeling
compelled to underscore the importance of "preserving the rights of
Hong Kong citizens" in comments made during Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to the U.S. in October.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the law worry that it could limit freedom of
expression, including media freedom; restrict the flow of economic
data; and even lead to a ban of groups, such as Falun Gong, that are
viewed as undesirable by the central government in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, many critics also see the legislation as a
potentially serious blow to the 5-year-old political experiment meant
to protect democratic rights and rule of law in Hong Kong as it
changed from a British colony to a quasi-autonomous special
administrative region of China.</TE>
<TE>   A three-month discussion period on the consultation document,
which sketches out the planned law, is due to end this month, after
which a final version of the law will be published "as soon as
practicable," according to the government. Because 36 of the 60 Hong
Kong legislative council members are government appointees, passage
is virtually guaranteed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are signs the government wants to ease the pressure.
It has indicated that it would roll back proposed additions to police
search and seizure powers and hinted that it might be backing away
from its refusal to publish a draft bill for discussion.</TE>
<TE>   More than any other factor, it is the Western-style freedoms and
legal system that have set Hong Kong apart as an attractive Asian
financial center and a preferred location for foreigners doing
business in the vast but chaotic Chinese market.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong's secretary for security, Regina Ip, who is leading
efforts to sell the measure, insists that there are no sinister
motives. She notes that the legislation is required under Article 23
of the Hong Kong's Basic Law, which stipulates that the regional
government "shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of
treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's
government ...."</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a constitutional obligation to enact those laws," Ip
recently told a group of journalists and businesspeople. "It is
certainly not our intention to crack down on press freedom."</TE>
<TE>   But the government's refusal to publish a working draft of the
bill -- a so-called white bill -- coupled with questions about the
timing of the legislation and the Hong Kong administration's
commitment to democracy, have all fueled suspicion.</TE>
<TE>   "Why now?" asked Lee.</TE>
<TE>   The government counters that, given the years since Hong Kong
reverted to Chinese sovereignty, it's time to act.</TE>
<TE>   Ip hasn't helped her cause with quips implying that democracy is
overrated and noting that Adolf Hitler came to power through
universal suffrage.</TE>
<TE>   In a carefully worded comment published in a recent edition of the
Financial Times, Hong Kong's former chief civil servant, Anson Chan,
joined the debate with an understated yet powerful voice.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, in its sometimes hard-sell approach, the
government has failed to allay public concern," she declared. "There
is growing suspicion of its motives."</TE>
<TE>   Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong, is one of many urging the government to publish a draft
bill to better focus the debate on specific language. He noted that a
provision in the consultation document addressing the theft of state
secrets fails to define what a state secret is.</TE>
<TE>   Kin-ming Liu, general manager of Apple Daily, Hong Kong's popular
anti-establishment newspaper, said the proposals would extend
prosecution for unauthorized government leaks to include the
recipient of any documents as well as the civil servant passing the
information.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to become more draconian," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of opposition has led the government to give some
ground, but there is no sign of scrapping the law.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the Hong Kong government is going to back down in
any significant way," Liu said. "It will still try to push this
through."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HYDERABAD, India</DL>
<LD>At least 19 people were killed and 70 injured when an express train
derailed in southern India early Saturday, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   At least seven cars and the engine of the Bangalore Express jumped
the tracks 155 miles south of Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra
Pradesh state.</LD>
<LD>   The train was traveling from Hyderabad to the city of Bangalore
when it derailed about 1 a.m.</LD>
<TE>   Rescue workers recovered 18 bodies from the scene of the accident,
and one passenger died after being taken to a hospital, said S.M.
Singla, chief of railroad services in the country's south-central
zone. Singla said rescue workers had finished searching for bodies in
the derailed cars and the tracks were cleared for other trains.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 passengers were being treated at nearby hospitals, while
others with minor injuries received first-aid treatment, local police
said. Six of the injured were believed to be in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   The train was running at 55 mph when the accident occurred, said
Bandaru Dutta Ray, India's junior railroad minister.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of the accident was not immediately known. Poor track
maintenance often leads to derailments in India.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's derailment was the fifth this year.</TE>
<TE>   At least 118 people died when a train plunged off a bridge in
eastern India in September.</TE>

<HD>Iraqi Press Blasts Bush</HD>
<DH>Newspapers decry the 'drums of war.' U.N. inspectors make a
fourth visit to a plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi newspapers issued stinging criticism of President Bush on
Saturday as U.N. weapons inspectors visited 10 sites, including their
fourth known visit to a large plant where Iraqi scientists once
worked on a nuclear bomb.</LD>
<LD>   The daily Al-Iraq said "the forces of evil and aggression, led by
the great Satan -- the United States -- and its arrogant idiot
President Bush" were doomed to fail in what the newspaper said were
plans to attack Baghdad under "false pretexts."</LD>
<LD>   Also Saturday, Babel, the newspaper owned by President Saddam
Hussein's elder son, Uday, was printed for the first time since it
was banned for a month. It accused the U.S. of "bloodthirstiness" and
beating the "drums of war."</LD>
<TE>   The huge al-Qa'qaa complex visited by U.N. experts Saturday was
inspected for three consecutive days beginning a week ago and had
been under U.N. scrutiny in the 1990s. It was involved in the final
design of a nuclear bomb before United Nations teams dismantled much
of Iraq's nuclear program after the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   The site, about 15 miles southeast of Baghdad, contains a sulfuric
acid plant, an explosives production facility and storage areas.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other sites visited Saturday by U.N. teams were the
Samara pharmaceutical factory, 80 miles north of Baghdad; the Al
Samood missile factory, about 25 miles west of Baghdad; the Al Furat
State Chemical Industry Co. in Baghdad; an oil refinery south of
Baghdad; and a communications center near the Iranian border.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Bush canceled a January trip to Africa, and the U.S.
military forged ahead with a buildup that could have more than
100,000 troops in the Persian Gulf region in weeks.</TE>
<TE>   An Iraqi opposition leader said Saturday that he believed a
U.S-led attack on Iraq could happen very soon. Ahmad Chalabi of the
Iraqi National Congress spoke in Turkey, which borders northern Iraq,
and urged Turkey to help in any such campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "If Turkey participates in a possible operation on Iraq, peace
could be achieved faster due to its position in the U.N. and its
relations with neighboring countries," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But in Syria, leaders spoke out against any attack. Vice President
Zuheir Masharka accused Washington of double standards.</TE>
<TE>   "The priorities of U.S. policies clash with the interests and
hopes of the [region's] people, increasing their outrage against U.S.
policies," he said. "There is no justification allowing the U.S.
administration to launch a war against Iraq, no matter how numerous
the pretexts are.</TE>
<TE>   "It is Israel that has a large arsenal of weapons of mass
destruction," he said, "and it is Israel that represents the most
dangerous core of terrorism in the region and the world."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile Saturday, Western aircraft dropped leaflets over
southern Iraq advertising radio frequencies carrying appeals to Iraqi
soldiers to desert, U.S. Central Command said. Officials say 240,000
leaflets were dropped.</TE>

<DL>DUEKOUE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>French forces firing tank-mounted cannons drove back rebels in Ivory
Coast on Saturday, stalling the insurgents' advance toward Abidjan,
the West African nation's prized commercial center.</LD>
<LD>   The fighting around the western city of Duekoue was among the
heaviest yet for the French forces in the 3-month-old rebellion
splitting this former French colony, the world's largest cocoa
producer and the region's economic powerhouse.</LD>
<LD>   The battle highlighted how the stepped-up French deployment may be
decisive in stopping the rebel campaign to drive out President
Laurent Gbagbo and seize the entire country.</LD>
<TE>   The rebels have scored several days of success in their push south
and east toward Abidjan. Controlling the city is the key to
controlling Ivory Coast, one of Africa's most vital economic hubs and
ports. With so much at stake for the region if Ivory Coast falls into
chaos, the French decided to take up their largest military role in
years in their former colony.</TE>
<TE>   As rebels seized the western city of Man on Thursday and pushed
farther south Friday, French forces dug in at Duekoue, 210 miles
northwest of Abidjan.</TE>
<TE>   Fighters of the French Foreign Legion and other elite troops had
set up positions with antitank missiles, rocket launchers and heavy
machine guns outside Duekoue to stop any rebel advance -- calling
their positions in the area the "stop point" for any insurgent drive
on the commercial capital.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, rebels moved to bypass the French. After fighting
Ivory Coast government troops, the insurgents took the town of Blodi,
just outside Duekoue, on a secondary road that would let them skirt
the French position and push on to Abidjan.</TE>
<TE>   French troops then entered the fighting. French Capt. Hubert
Dunant said five to eight rebels were killed. The battle reached
within half a mile of Duekoue. Sounds of guns and mortars sent
civilians into hiding indoors. The French said they suffered no
injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Despite gains in the day, rebels pulled back eight miles north of
Duekoue by nightfall, rebel commander Felix Doh said.</TE>
<TE>   French forces, initially in Ivory Coast to protect foreign
nationals and enforce a shattered cease-fire, have stepped up their
role as the rebel challenge has grown. France plans to double its
deployment to 2,500 by month's end.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Disables Surveillance at Reactor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VIENNA</DL>
<LD>The U.N. nuclear watchdog said Saturday that North Korea has disabled
surveillance devices that the agency had placed at a nuclear reactor
suspected of being used to make weapons-grade plutonium. The agency
expressed "deep regret" at the move and issued a new call for
restraint.</LD>
<LD>   Mohammed Baradei, the director-general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, said he urged the reclusive nation not to take further
actions to restart its nuclear program. Baradei said North Korea "cut
most of the seals and impeded the functioning of surveillance
equipment" at one of its 5-megawatt reactors at Yongbyong.</LD>
<LD>   The secretive Stalinist state said this month it would restart the
reactor, which had been closed under a 1994 international agreement.
The IAEA, based in Vienna, has been monitoring the freeze of the
reactors and other nuclear operations at Yongbyong since 1994.</LD>
<TE>   North Korea pledged to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear
arms program in exchange for shipments of oil and the construction of
more proliferation-proof reactors. Those facilities have not yet been
built, and oil shipments were recently suspended after the North
admitted having a secret uranium-based nuclear arms program.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials called on the regime in Pyongyang on Saturday to
adhere to the 1994 agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "We urge the [North] not to restart its frozen nuclear
facilities," U.S. State Department spokesman Lou Fintor said.</TE>
<TE>   Fintor said Washington was trying to establish exactly what North
Korea had done, although it did not appear that Pyongyang had
disturbed seals or cameras at a reprocessing plant or at the
spent-fuel pond where 8,000 spent-fuel rods were stored.</TE>
<TE>   South Korean officials had a similar message. "North Korea must
immediately restore the surveillance equipment," Foreign Ministry
official Shim Yoon Jo said today. "It has been our consistent
position that we will not tolerate North Korea's nuclear activities."</TE>
<TE>   North Korean officials said today that they were removing the
monitoring equipment "because the U.S. unilaterally abandoned its
commitment to supply heavy oil in compensation for the loss of
electricity," the nation's official Korean Central News Agency
reported.</TE>
<TE>   "This situation compelled [us] to immediately start the work of
removing the seals and monitoring cameras from the frozen nuclear
facilities for their normal operation to produce electricity," the
agency said.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelan Strike Tightens Global Taps</HD>
<DH>With a major producer's output at a trickle, energy markets
roil over the prospect of a war with Iraq further constricting supply</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Three weeks of strikes in Venezuela have choked off a key source of
oil needed to offset any loss of production in the Middle East,
raising the stakes for any military action in Iraq, industry
officials and analysts say.</LD>
<LD>   Most experts predict the public uprising against Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez will end before the United States would be
ready to wage war. But the mere possibility of overlapping crises is
roiling energy markets, creating new risks for the economy and adding
another element of uncertainty to events unfolding in the Persian
Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   "It becomes much more risky" to invade Iraq, said John Lichtblau,
chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York.
"It definitely was not part of the administration's plan to do this
with one of its major foreign oil suppliers being inoperative."</LD>
<TE>   "We are very concerned," Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said
last week. "We ... are very worried about the fact that the oil
sector is slowly shutting down, with economic consequences for all
Venezuelans as well as others outside Venezuela."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has had little to say publicly about the
effect of the Venezuela crisis on its Iraq planning. A senior State
Department official said U.S. officials do not anticipate a sustained
loss of Iraqi oil in the event of war and believe production can be
ramped up relatively quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Going to war will affect oil markets, but it won't have a
long-term dramatic effect," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Few experts say that the Venezuela predicament is likely to alter
the timetable of an Iraq offensive. But oil analysts and industry
insiders said the turmoil is being taken into account as the
administration proceeds with its planning.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had two conversations today with people from the government,
and that was the subject, Venezuela and Iraq," said one industry
official. "It complicates it, no question about it."</TE>
<TE>   The combination of the Venezuela strike and Middle East jitters
has already driven the price of oil above $30 a barrel, close to a
two-year high. Some analysts expect the higher prices to stick.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman Sachs predicted last week that oil prices will average
more than $30 a barrel during the first half of 2003, even if the
Venezuelan strike ends in two weeks and the U.S. government releases
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Prices would rise even
higher in the event of war in Iraq, an unusually cold winter or no
SPR drawdown, the investment firm said.</TE>
<TE>   Higher oil prices would cause the U.S. economy to slow and the
unemployment rate to rise, Goldman analysts warned. If war in Iraq
pushed oil prices above $40 for a sustained period, another recession
might be in the cards.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly nervous about it," said Goldman Sachs' chief U.S.
economist, William Dudley. "It's going to lead to a short-term supply
shortfall over the next few weeks. So the margin for safety if there
is war in Iraq is very much diminished, and the risk of an oil price
shock has gone up. One could imagine oil price spikes above $40 a
barrel."</TE>
<TE>   The combined effect of the strike in Venezuela, nuclear power
shortfalls in Japan and the recent cold snap in the U.S. has created
a "perfect storm" capable of pushing prices substantially higher,
said Deutsche Bank global oil strategist Adam Sieminski.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer it goes on, the worse it's going to get until you have
some of that production being made up by Saudi Arabia and a couple of
other OPEC countries with spare capacity," Sieminski said.</TE>
<TE>   The strike by Venezuelan oil producers, refiners and shippers has
virtually shut down production in what the most recent U.S.
government data show is America's fourth-largest source of imported
oil, behind Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a country that has been regarded as a reliable exporter
since the Second World War. It's been one of the bedrocks of U.S.
energy security," said Daniel Yergin, oil historian and chairman of
Cambridge Energy Research Associates. "Replacing Venezuela eats up a
significant part of the security margin of additional supplies that
can be brought into the market."</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela has been providing 9% of the crude oil consumed in this
country. Since the strike began in early December, production has
fallen from nearly 3 million barrels a day to fewer than 500,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's already a serious disruption," said Edward Morse, special
advisor to Hess Energy Trading Co. in New York. "The world has lost
at least 35 million barrels of oil already. The chances are we will
lose at least another 25 million barrels."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the strike ended tomorrow, it would take about eight weeks
to fully restore production. For each additional day the situation
goes unresolved, nearly 3 million barrels are subtracted from global
oil supplies. The world uses 77 million barrels a day.</TE>
<TE>   Morse said the loss of Venezuelan production, by itself, is not
enough to create lines at U.S. gas stations. But it is sufficient to
keep oil prices high.</TE>
<TE>   "It's taking place in the wintertime, when global demand is peak,
with the coldest winter we've had in three years and with commercial
stocks at a historically low level," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts predict the shortfall will soon force U.S. officials
to tap the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That in turn would
reduce slightly the amount of stockpiled oil available to offset any
loss of production from Iraq or its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The government has already suspended scheduled deliveries to the
SPR so more oil will be available in the spot market. But so far, it
has rejected appeals from oil companies to release any of the 599
million barrels of crude currently stored in salt caverns beneath the
coasts of Texas and Louisiana.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia and other members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries have promised to boost production to offset any
sustained shortfalls caused by events in Venezuela or Iraq. But they
have also warned that it will be difficult to make up the difference
if production is curtailed in several countries simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Algerian Oil Minister Chekib Khalil, speaking to reporters Friday
before a meeting of Arab oil exporters in Cairo, said "a worsening
situation is to be feared" because of Venezuela, Agence France-Presse
reported.</TE>
<TE>   While many analysts and officials are betting the strike will end
before an Iraq campaign begins, some cited the possibility of Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein halting oil exports ahead of schedule in an
effort to inflict havoc on world markets while Venezuela's wells
remain shut down.</TE>
<TE>   Although events in Iraq have received more attention, the
situation in Venezuela could have a bigger effect on oil markets,
analysts said. Venezuela produces more oil than Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, it takes only about a week to ship oil to the United
States from Venezuela but nearly six weeks to make the same trip from
the Middle East.</TE>

<HD>Bus Bombing Kills 2 in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Blast comes after police say they had arrested four people
and thus quashed terrorist plot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>A bomb ripped through a passenger bus in southern Pakistan on
Saturday, killing two people and injuring 18 just hours after police
announced that they had quashed a terrorist plot by arresting four
Islamic militants armed with grenades.</LD>
<LD>   There was no claim of responsibility for the explosion aboard the
local bus in Hyderabad, about 100 miles north of Karachi. It was the
second bus bombing in as many months in Hyderabad, where attacks are
fueled largely by ethnic and religious conflict.</LD>
<LD>   In Karachi, police announced earlier Saturday that four suspects
arrested late Friday had been planning to carry out suicide attacks.
Pakistan has been hit by at least 12 such attacks or plots this year.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the men said they had been recruited by two members of
Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. All four suspects belonged to the
outlawed Islamic group Jaish-e-Mohammed and sought to buy
high-powered explosives.</TE>
<TE>   "We swiftly took action ... and were able to arrest all four
terrorists with three hand grenades," said Shafi Rind, divisional
police officer in eastern Karachi.</TE>
<TE>   Police acted on a tip to collar the four as they headed toward a
major street where they allegedly were planning to blow up a bridge.</TE>
<TE>   They told police that they were recruited more than two months ago
by two men from a Middle Eastern country. They said they were given
$180 to purchase explosives in remote tribal regions, where such
weapons are readily available.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not disclose the identities of the alleged recruiters
or their nationalities.</TE>
<TE>   The four Pakistani suspects -- identified as Riaz Uddin, Aziz
Mubarak, Mohammed Kamran and Abdul Rehman -- said they carried out
several robberies to get money to buy more explosives and weapons. In
recent months, they said, their gang stole $3,350.</TE>
<TE>   A court ordered them held without bail. A new anti-terrorism law
permits authorities in Pakistan to hold suspected terrorists for one
year without filing charges.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan outlawed Jaish-e-Mohammed in January. The United States
has declared it a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   But the head of the group, Maulana Masood Azhar, was ordered
released from house arrest Dec. 14. Dozens of members of militant
Islamic groups have been freed from jail in Pakistan in recent weeks,
many of them in the regions governed by Islamic conservatives near
the Afghan border.</TE>

<LD>DOHA, Qatar -- Just 10 miles north of a strategic command center
where a U.S. general was orchestrating war games, a Persian Gulf War
veteran reggae-rapped the night away here on a beachfront stage.</LD>
<LD>   "Hello, Qatar!" bellowed Jamaican American fusion artist Shaggy to
more than 3,000 foreigners and a smattering of Qataris this month. "I
was told by reliable sources that nobody party like Qatar party!"</LD>
<LD>   Then, in a conservative Islamic land where 95% of the women still
dress in black head-to-toe abayas, the ex-Marine hip-hopped his way

fast-changing nation that has emerged as one of America's most
strategic military allies and the likely headquarters in the event of
another U.S.-led war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   This Connecticut-size thumb of sand jutting into the Persian Gulf
-- with sufficient gas reserves to heat every American home for more
than a century -- has thrown itself headlong into this new
relationship with the U.S. The ties are as precious as they are
precarious for both nations.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship is born of the crusade by Qatar's progressive
young emir, Sheik Hamad ibn Khalifa al Thani, for modernity and
security in a region awash with hostility and religious antipathy.</TE>
<TE>   The alliance was underscored Saturday by a visit by Air Force Gen.
Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and earlier
this month by the military exercise under Central Command chief Army
Gen. Tommy Franks. The maneuvers involve more than 1,000 U.S.
military officers and enlisted personnel throughout the region at a
new, mobile command-and-control facility at Qatar's Camp As Sayliyah.</TE>
<TE>   The command post duplicates a facility at Prince Sultan Air Base
in neighboring Saudi Arabia, which has been hesitant to support any
U.S.-led war on Iraq. But the military's "Internal Look" exercise
merely capped a strategic relationship here dating back several
years.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar (pronounced KAH-tar) has spent more than $1 billion
upgrading Al Udeid Air Base for American forces, and Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld stopped in Doha, the capital, recently
to sign an agreement that will expand U.S. use of the facility. Al
Udeid already boasts a 15,000-foot runway and is home to more than
5,000 U.S. military personnel.</TE>
<TE>   The Shaggy concert, sponsored by this nation's Olympic committee
and a state-run company that owns resort hotels in Doha, echoes a
U.S.-Qatari cultural relationship that dates back almost to the day
seven years ago that the emir exiled his father in a bloodless coup.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar is spending $1 billion on a new "Education City," a
futuristic spread of Islamic and Western architecture, which will
open in June and be staffed by U.S. professors. It is the future home
for satellite campuses of Cornell University's Weill Medical College,
Virginia Commonwealth University and several other American
institutions. Cornell has already started its first year of premed
classes in temporary space nearby.</TE>
<TE>   The project's director and chief advocate is the emir's second
wife, Sheika Mozah Nasser Misnad, who is emerging as the region's
first American-style first lady. The sheika selected only U.S.
universities for the new city, which she hopes will be a mecca of
higher learning for students throughout the Arab world.</TE>
<TE>   And the Mall in the heart of Doha stands as a citadel to icons of
U.S. commerce: Starbucks, KFC and McDonald's line the atrium leading
to the Cineplex, where "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" has
been sold out nightly. This month, the Mall's centerpiece of model
Qatari dhow fishing vessels and Arabian coffee urns was replaced by a
North Pole Christmas set.</TE>
<TE>   Yet some Qataris at the Shaggy concert spotlighted growing
resentment here over the American military presence and tough new
immigration rules in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Let them leave. The sooner the better," a British-educated
21-year-old at the concert said about American troops.</TE>
<TE>   "Look, man, I can't go to the U.S.A.," said the Qatari, who would
only give his name as Omar. "Look at me. If I go to Los Angeles, the
LAPD will be all over me. I'm afraid to go there. So why should your
guys be here?"</TE>
<TE>   The following day at Qatar's Foreign Ministry, Khalid Rashid
Mansouri, director of European and American affairs, gave a knowing
nod. "This a burden we share together -- Qatar and America," he said
of Omar's views.</TE>
<TE>   Mansouri, a diplomat at the Qatari Embassy in Washington for six
years, helped cement the U.S. military alliance. He noted that Qatar
is merely the latest of the Gulf nations, from Kuwait to Oman, to
host U.S. military facilities. But he acknowledged that those ties
happened suddenly in most Qataris' eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "We went from, say, Stage 3 to Stage 10 almost overnight," he
said. "But we were very honest and open with the Americans and with
our people. We told them that we have a base. We have a relationship
with the Americans. And we put it on television for all to see."</TE>
<TE>   Qatari officials argue that the country needs the American
presence to protect its people, its vast resources and the investment
by energy companies such as ExxonMobil, which now tops $30 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "After the Gulf War, we were convinced there was nobody in the
region to protect us," Mansouri said.</TE>
<TE>   Some Qataris are unconvinced.</TE>
<TE>   "Qatar has a choice whether to accept this presence or not," said
Mohammed Saleh Musfir, a political science professor at Qatar
University. He rejects it.</TE>
<TE>   "Saddam Hussein is not a threat to Qatar unless the American
facilities here make the country a target," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no more love for the American government among the
Qataris -- among most of the Gulf people," he added. "We used to hold
them up as a model of democracy, of freedom.... But not anymore."</TE>
<TE>   American-style democracy nonetheless is being introduced here. In
1999, Qatar held municipal elections, and the government is planning
to stage parliamentary balloting in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   Qatar also was the first Gulf state to let women vote and run for
office, although none of the female candidates won three years ago
and 80% of the women voted for men.</TE>
<TE>   "This time is the golden age of women in Qatar," said Sheika
Abdulla Misnad, a vice president of Qatar University, where more than
two-thirds of the 9,000 students are women.</TE>
<TE>   She said the election outcome and the fact that the overwhelming
majority of Qatari women still wear the abaya are the result of a
woman's right to choose.</TE>
<TE>   "Wearing the abaya gives you freedom -- freedom to move, to dress
as you wish underneath without feeling that people are staring at
your body," she said, adding that Qatari women traditionally have run
the household and remain deeply conservative.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's upon women themselves to decide what they want. And the
government has encouraged this."</TE>
<TE>   The greatest encouragement has come from Misnad's niece, the first
lady.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest push came in October, when her highness shocked the
nation and the region by standing at a podium, her face uncovered and
her husband in the audience, and delivered a televised speech in
English.</TE>
<TE>   The following day marked the rare event: Local newspapers at home
and in the region carried a picture of a Gulf first lady. The
occasion was the inauguration of the new Weill Cornell Medical
College in Qatar.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a remarkable event in more ways than you can imagine,"
said Daniel Alonso, the school's resident dean.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when tough rhetoric from Washington and regional war
games seem to signal a looming confrontation with Iraq, most Qataris
point to the Cornell school and Education City as symbols of the
relationship they prefer with the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not just buying the physical buildings. We're buying the
whole thing -- all the same standards of quality and excellence --
and it isn't just for the Qataris, it's for the whole region," said
Hassan Ansari, a Qatar University professor and government advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "Our strategic relationship with the U.S. is different than the
other countries in this region because it is not purely military. And
it didn't start that way. It started with the economic investment in
the gas fields and with projects like Cornell."</TE>
<TE>   Ansari, who has a doctorate in Middle East history from the
University of Michigan, added: "Some people think we're moving too
fast. Some people think we're moving too slowly.</TE>
<TE>   "The point is, it's a package. And what's at stake is nothing less
than our future as a nation and as a people."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Smoking will get a little harder next year in Italy, where cigarettes
are as common an accessory as a Vespa motorbike or a Fendi handbag.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate passed a bill Saturday banning smoking in most public
places. The law takes effect in a year.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, already approved this month by the lower Chamber of
Deputies, requires bar and restaurant owners to create separate
smoking areas.</LD>
<TE>   Owners failing to enforce the law face up to $2,000 in fines.
Individuals who light up face fines of $25 to $250; the amount can
double if they smoke near a pregnant woman or child younger than 12.</TE>
<TE>   Smoking is banned in some restaurants, offices and public places,
but Italians frequently light up in no-smoking areas.</TE>
<TE>   About 12 million Italians -- or 20% of the population -- smoke,
and Health Minister Gerolamo Sirchia has campaigned to get them to
quit. He recommended forming a "Vigilance Committee" to keep smoking
from being glamorized on TV.</TE>

<HD>Iraq War Remains Unpopular in Strategically Located Turkey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amberin Zaman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>As the Bush administration intensifies efforts to line up
international support for possible military action, a war against
Iraq remains deeply unpopular in this predominantly Muslim nation.</LD>
<LD>   "Why should our sons die so that America can occupy Iraqi oil
fields?" asked Ayse Matarci, an Istanbul homemaker, as she shopped
for vegetables at a local market. "Turkey should not dip its hands
into Iraqi blood."</LD>
<LD>   Strategically wedged between Europe and the Middle East and with a
roughly 200-mile border with Iraq, NATO's sole Muslim-majority member
is set to play a pivotal role in any war against its southern
neighbor.</LD>
<TE>   Eager to bolster ties with the West, Turkey's government formed by
the Justice and Development Party, which swept into power in Nov. 3
elections, has said it is prepared to help the war effort under some
conditions, such as U.N. approval of military action. Turkish leaders
have said they would allow the use of bases and are considering
allowing U.S. troops to move into northern Iraq via Turkish soil.</TE>
<TE>   The main question facing the antiwar movement is whether the
public's dislike of a war can be used to influence leaders'
decisions. "The answer, sadly," said Aydin Engin, a writer and
antiwar activist, "is a big fat no."</TE>
<TE>   Engin helped organize the biggest antiwar rally here Dec. 1,
attracting 10,000 to 15,000 demonstrators. "The turnout was pretty
disappointing when you consider that twice as many people were
protesting in Australia that day, and that Australia's population is
19 million, while Turkey's is 70 million," Engin said. "The reason is
simple. Most people are scared."</TE>
<TE>   Such fears date back to 1980, when the Turkish military seized
power in its third and last coup. The country's then military rulers
drew up a constitution, including restrictions on unions, political
parties, free speech and free association.</TE>
<TE>   Successive governments have been amending the constitution as part
of an ongoing democratization drive aimed at securing membership for
Turkey in the European Union. Even so, public demonstrations are
often banned. And when they do take place, police typically use
violence to break them up.</TE>
<TE>   "The aim of the authorities is to depoliticize, to intimidate the
Turkish people, and they have largely succeeded," said Gulden Sonmez,
a lawyer who works for an Islamic-leaning rights group. "As in many
Muslim countries, people here feel they have little control over
their destiny. Democracy has yet to fully take root."</TE>
<TE>   What sets Turkey apart from other predominantly Muslim nations,
however, is that antiwar sentiment is rooted neither in feelings of
religious solidarity with the Iraqis, nor in pro-Arab sentiment. If
anything, there is strong mutual dislike between the Turks and Arabs
dating back to when the Ottoman Turks ruled over much of the Arab
Middle East and North Africa. In recent years, Turkey has become
Israel's chief regional ally. "Turks are against the war," explains
Tuncay Akgun, a prominent political cartoonist, "because of what
Turkey itself stands to lose in such a war."</TE>
<TE>   The chief concern shared by ordinary Turks and policymakers is
that the Kurds who have controlled the north of Iraq since the end of
the 1991 Persian Gulf War will exploit the turmoil that is likely to
follow Saddam Hussein's removal to set up their own independent
state. That in turn could reignite separatist sentiment among
Turkey's own restive Kurds, some officials fear.</TE>
<TE>   The other worry is economic. Turkey says it has lost more than $40
billion in trade with Iraq as a result of United Nations sanctions
against Baghdad following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Another war
would kill trade that has climbed back to prewar levels under a U.N.
program.</TE>
<TE>   It would also hurt Turkey's multibillion-dollar tourist industry.
The Bush administration has reportedly proposed an aid package to
compensate Turkey for its losses. "So far, they're asking for the
moon and offering peanuts in exchange," said a senior Turkish
official, who declined to be identified by name.</TE>

<HD>Northern Front Is Part of U.S. War Strategy</HD>
<DH>Pentagon plan envisions use of air bases in Turkey to
helicopter troops onto Iraqi soil.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Esther Schrader</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon is drawing up plans to helicopter thousands of U.S.
soldiers into Iraq from Turkey in the early days of an invasion,
establishing a northern front that war planners increasingly see as a
key part of any U.S. military action against Saddam Hussein's regime.</LD>
<LD>   Designed partly to address Turkish opposition to basing large
numbers of U.S. troops on its soil, the plans call for ferrying
soldiers into Turkish bases and transferring them quickly to
helicopters that would deposit them in northern Iraq, senior defense
officials said. There they would secure key oil fields and stabilize
provinces already controlled by ethnic Kurds, who oppose the Iraqi
president's regime.</LD>
<LD>   The still-developing plans for a northern front would use Turkish
bases as staging areas for lightly equipped U.S. Army airborne units.
The troops -- most likely elements of the Army's V Corps, based in
Germany, and the 101st Airborne Division, based at Ft. Campbell, Ky.
-- would be flown into Turkey a few thousand at a time, only long
enough to be shuttled onto combat helicopters for deployment into
Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   An assault on Iraq from the north, in addition to much larger
invasions planned from the west and the south, "will scare the
bejesus out of Saddam," one military officer said, and force him to
devote troops and resources to repelling U.S. advances on several
fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The plans cannot be successful without approval of Turkish
officials, who have been the focus of intense U.S. diplomatic efforts
in recent weeks. Turkey, the sole predominantly Muslim member of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, has permitted small numbers of
U.S. special forces to move clandestinely into Kurdish regions of
northern Iraq, but doesn't want a huge American military presence.</TE>
<TE>   For months now the Pentagon has been building up forces in the
Persian Gulf nations to Iraq's south -- Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman
and the United Arab Emirates -- capable of mounting a major invasion
of Iraq by land, sea and air. Such an invasion, including forces that
would move into Iraq from Saudi Arabia to the south and west, could
involve more than 100,000 U.S. troops. About 50,000 soldiers,
sailors, airmen and Marines already are in the Persian Gulf, with
heavy armor and other equipment flowing in.</TE>
<TE>   The ability to fly warplanes out of Turkey has long been seen as
essential in any campaign against Iraq. The bases are modern
facilities built and outfitted to fulfill Turkey's obligations as a
member of NATO, which makes them compatible with U.S. planes and far
superior to many other air bases in the region.</TE>
<TE>   The country played a key role in the 1991 Persian Gulf War when it
opened its bases to U.S. military aircraft staging bombing raids
against Iraqi targets. The decision to allow the American airstrikes
from its territory was made at the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   But until recently, the U.S. has developed its plans largely
without counting on using Turkey as a major staging area for American
ground troops, sensitive to the delicate economic and political
situation in that country and to its worries that territorial
ambitions of Kurds in Iraq might spread to its own restive Kurdish
minority.</TE>
<TE>   That changed this month, when Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D.
Wolfowitz flew to Turkey to press the government there to provide
more support for the U.S. plan.</TE>
<TE>   "We're quite comfortable with what we can do from the south" of
Iraq, Wolfowitz said after meeting with Turkish officials in Ankara,
the capital. "Obviously, if we are going to have significant ground
forces in the north, this is the country they have to come through.
There is no other option."</TE>
<TE>   Senior U.S. officials said that although a campaign against
Hussein's regime can succeed militarily without Turkey's involvement,
the country's support is key to "keeping it short, keeping it fierce,
keeping the flow of refugees small."</TE>
<TE>   The Incirlik air base has been a major hub in the last year for
C-17 cargo flights to and from Afghanistan. U.S. and British military
aircraft have been using the air base for more than a decade to
enforce a "no-fly" zone imposed over northern Iraq after the 1991 war
to protect about 3.5 million Kurds in the region.</TE>
<TE>   With only a few air bases available to U.S. forces in the
countries to Iraq's south, planes flying out of Turkey could well
represent more than a third of the total air power during an Iraq
campaign. The U.S. has secured access to three air bases in Oman, two
in Kuwait, one in Qatar and possibly one in the United Arab Emirates.
Saudi Arabia has yet to grant permission for the U.S. to use its
bases to fly combat missions.</TE>
<TE>   "We need access to Incirlik air base," said one former senior U.S.
Air Force official familiar with the Pentagon's plans. "Without at
least one modern air base, we can't sustain air cover for whatever we
do."</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's bases, notably Diyarbakir air base in the east, are
particularly important in providing air support for operations in
Iraq's north. Two smaller airfields in far-eastern Turkey, Batman and
Van, have been used by U.S. special operations before and may be used
again.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish officials are expected to decide soon which of its air
bases to make available to U.S. forces and whether to allow American
ground troops to move through the country. An advisor to the Turkish
government with knowledge of the discussions said Tuesday that the
two countries are still divided. Turkey has offered use of three air
bases, including Incirlik, and wants a strict limit on the number of
ground troops in the country. The U.S. seeks the use of an additional
four bases and more freedom to maneuver its forces.</TE>
<TE>   An administration official would say only that "this is a
consultative process that's going to take some time."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. teams are in Turkey assessing the readiness of the country's
airfields for American forces.</TE>
<TE>   Incirlik is about 570 miles from Baghdad, considerably closer than
U.S. air bases in Oman and about the same distance from the Iraqi
capital as those in Qatar. It already houses several thousand U.S.
military personnel, mostly air crews patrolling the northern no-fly
zone and support personnel, and could handle several thousand more.
As many as 100 U.S. aircraft could be based there.</TE>
<TE>   The northern front envisioned by the Pentagon would be unlike any
traditional ground advance. There would be no tanks rumbling into
Iraq from the north and only tiny numbers of special forces soldiers
entering the country on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the topography of northern Iraq makes the notion of a
traditional ground advance absurd, former military officials and
analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey's 206-mile border with Iraq quickly moves from rolling
plateaus nearest Turkey to irregular hills and the 8,000-foot peaks
of the Zagros mountain range. One railway and just three roads of any
significance traverse the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to the Iraqi terrain in the south and west, with its
large expanses of desert and marshland, the north is "hardly tank
country," one U.S. military officer said.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion that [U.S. forces] would go down a highway from Turkey
is implausible as an opening gambit," said the officer, who requested
anonymity. "The army's plan for Afghanistan was air mobile, and that
makes even more sense in Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Special forces troops, preceded by days of assaults by bombers,
fighter jets and gunships, would be the first into Iraq from Turkey.
They would arrive by helicopter near the Iraqi air base at Kirkuk and
the nearby Kirkuk oil fields, oil refinery and petrochemical plant,
and the air base near the city of Mosul.</TE>
<TE>   They probably would have to subdue Iraqi regular army troops, the
two fighter squadrons of Iraq's V Corps and I Corps in particular,
headquartered at Kirkuk, and the Northern Corps of the Republican
Guard, based in Mosul.</TE>
<TE>   Once the airstrips are secured, U.S. C-130 transport planes would
land, disgorging light armored vehicles and other equipment to
support a ground force. At the same time, airborne light infantry
units would be helicoptered in on Apache and Black Hawk attack
helicopters to meet up with the equipment. The whole operation is
expected to take a few days.</TE>
<TE>   The troops entering from the north would expect to meet less
resistance than the main invasion force advancing into Iraq from the
south and west. Along with securing oil facilities, they would
prevent the Iraqi Kurds from attempting to seize territory of their
own. Kurds and Turks stake claims to Kirkuk and its oil riches. For
that reason, military planners are carefully weighing a role for
Turkish forces in northern Iraq following a fall of the Hussein
regime.</TE>
<TE>   "Once there is a surrender, we would want the Turks to be
operating in northern Iraq with prisoners of war and refugees, but in
very close collaboration with us and any kind of opposition group,"
said Bulent Aliriza, a political scientist and specialist on Turkey
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
"It's a very complicated relationship. The U.S. is really like a man
caught between two lovers. It clearly wants to encourage the Kurds,
but not to the point that they enrage the Turks. It's a delicate
act."</TE>

<HD>State Crisis Will Test Finance Chief's Theory</HD>
<DH>Steve Peace has written that a budget emergency would be a
great chance to reform government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, Steve Peace wrote in a newspaper opinion piece that a
budget crisis is a great opportunity to reform government.</LD>
<LD>   At the time, California's budget "crisis" was a $3.3-billion
deficit on a $42-billion spending plan. Peace, an assemblyman from
Chula Vista, found it a good excuse to propose that the state wipe
out useless commissions, discipline an out-of-control bureaucracy and
"focus on the needs of the future, not the habits of the past."</LD>
<LD>   Today, California's budget is so far out of whack that it makes
the 1992 deficit look like spare change. And Peace -- having just
walked away from 20 years in the Legislature with a reputation as
energetic, caustic and sometimes too smart for his own good -- now
has another chance to test his theory that a budget crisis should
breed better government.</LD>
<TE>   On Wednesday, Gov. Gray Davis named Peace director of the
Department of Finance.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment won high marks from Peace's colleagues in the
Legislature, who describe him as incredibly intelligent and
hard-working, capable of mastering the intricacies of the most
complicated issues. But they also know him as annoyingly long-winded
and cocky; a fellow senator once described him as the little brother
you don't know whether to hit or hug. His appointment as finance
director could prove to be a brilliant or disastrous move for Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it's locking up criminals, buying milk for poor children
or widening highways, government decisions invariably come down to
money, and the Finance Department's role in advising the governor is
central to the debate.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks in large part to losses in the stock market that depressed
tax collections, the governor says he and the Legislature must pare
spending or raise taxes to cover a $10-billion hole in the current
budget and a $25-billion shortfall in the fiscal year beginning July
1.</TE>
<TE>   Leading the Department of Finance when a yawning budget gap has
swallowed nearly every other government priority is not what Peace,
49, had in mind when term limits forced him from the Legislature this
year.</TE>
<TE>   At his August farewell on the Senate floor, Peace said, "I will
follow Mrs. Peace's admonition. She says I can do whatever I want
next, as long as the media's not interested in it and it requires me
to be out of town periodically."</TE>
<TE>   'Killer Tomatoes'</TE>
<TE>   Peace said he had planned to invest more time with his family, get
back into the movie industry and maybe earn a law degree. Now the
father of three college-age sons, he produced, wrote and starred in
the B-movie classic "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes" when he was a
college student himself. He recently sold his share of a San Diego
video production company called Four Square Productions.</TE>
<TE>   A graduate of UC San Diego who married a cheerleader from his
11th-grade class, Peace credits his stepfather, Gordon Browning, with
inspiring his interest in politics. A Navy dentist, Browning was
campaign chairman for then-state Sen. Wadie Deddeh, a Democrat from
Chula Vista.</TE>
<TE>   Peace worked for Deddeh and former Democratic Assemblyman Larry
Kapiloff of San Diego before running for the Assembly himself at age
29.</TE>
<TE>   "In retrospect, I would not vote for me," said Peace, an opponent
of term limits for legislators. "I was too young."</TE>
<TE>   Three years into his Assembly stint, Peace got into a Capitol
hallway argument with a senior senator. Witnesses say Peace called
Sen. Alfred Alquist (D-San Jose) "a senile old pedophile." Peace
claims he actually called Alquist "a pitiful little creature."</TE>
<TE>   He still has a reputation for attacking legislative witnesses.
Last year, at a news conference, he told an American Heart Assn.
official: "You're so dumb. You can't fix dumb."</TE>
<TE>   He's quick to recount the history of an issue and all of its
permutations.</TE>
<TE>   "Ask me what time it is and I'll tell you how to build a clock" is
how he once described himself, quoting a sign his schoolteacher
mother kept on her desk.</TE>
<TE>   A moderate Democrat who is as wary of the excesses of Democrats as
of Republicans, Peace was a member of the "Gang of Five," a group of
Democratic lawmakers who teamed with Republicans to try to oust
powerful Assembly Speaker Willie Brown in 1988. They failed, and
Brown retaliated by stripping them of good committee assignments and
prime office space.</TE>
<TE>   Peace eventually worked his way back into Brown's good graces, and
won election to the Senate, where he worked on what would become
California's disastrous deregulation plan. That experience left him
ready to leave Sacramento when he reached the end of his term this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Peace will resume the weekly airplane commute between San
Diego and Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "What convinced me to take the job," he said, "was that the
governor is committed to permanent, structural reform."</TE>
<TE>   In interviews before he agreed to become finance director, Peace
described how he believes California can avoid the wild gyrations of
the past decade, in which state revenues have gone from bust to boom
to bust.</TE>
<TE>   They include such difficult goals as persuading the federal
government to pay a greater share of immigration-related costs and
reviving California's manufacturing sector. Employment in
manufacturing has fallen 12% since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We've created a tax structure that discourages growth of
manufacturing jobs, that underdevelops housing and overdevelops
retail because local government is overcompensated by retail," Peace
said in an interview last month. "Over time, that's corrosive. At the
core of every successful economy is making things."</TE>
<TE>   Prop. 13 'Irrationality'</TE>
<TE>   He connects much of the "irrationality" in California's tax
structure to Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot initiative that capped
annual property tax assessment hikes at 2% a year until a site is
sold. Though Proposition 13 has protected the elderly and the poor
from soaring tax bills, it also has made the state, cities and
counties more dependent on volatile income and sales taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Peace has suggested cutting the capital gains tax that people pay
when they sell commercial property as a way to hasten the turnover
and reassessment of businesses at a higher tax rate under Proposition
13.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Ross, executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group
California Budget Project, dismissed that idea, saying there is "no
evidence" that it would bring in more money.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a massive giveaway to extremely wealthy people who were
planning to sell property anyway," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Another suggestion Peace tossed out earlier this month was raising
property tax levels above the Proposition 13 cap -- a move that would
require the approval of voters. Homeowners could be buffered from the
increase with other tax breaks, he said, but commercial property
owners don't need the same protection.</TE>
<TE>   Peace doesn't minimize the political difficulty of restructuring
the state's revenues, especially if it involves the landmark
Proposition 13. "There is not any way to fix the structure without a
constitutional amendment," he said this month.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking Thursday as the new finance director, Peace refused to
discuss reforms in detail, saying an overhaul belongs in the hands of
elected politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Based on his history as Senate budget chairman, he'll
probably argue for quick, deep cuts in state programs. Earlier this year,
Peace urged the governor to convene the Legislature after the
November election so that it could quickly slow the flow of cash.</TE>
<TE>   Paring a dollar this year, midway through the budget, saves $2
next year, Peace argued. But Davis did not call a special session on
the budget until the Legislature returned as usual in December.</TE>
<TE>   The shift from elected politician to bureaucrat may not be easy
for Peace. Some at the Capitol say they anticipate a clash between
Peace and the governor -- both known as mercurial.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be sitting back to watch that," said the Assembly minority
leader, Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks). He said he knows of Peace's temper
only by reputation, and though he doesn't often agree with Peace, "he
was always courteous, polite and listened to what I had to say."</TE>
<TE>   Former Democratic lawmaker and budget expert Phil Isenberg, a
lobbyist who now advises Davis on budget matters, said Peace should
make a terrific finance chief.</TE>
<TE>   "Start with pure brains, a real understanding of the large picture
of the issues in California and an ability to drive the process
toward decision-making," Isenberg said. "He's a marvelously inventive
and smart guy. He'll figure it out."</TE>
<TE>   He is easily frustrated by the failure of fellow lawmakers and the
media to grasp the subtleties of the issues he tackles, from workers'
compensation and consumer privacy to open primary elections.</TE>
<TE>   None was so complex as the launching of electricity deregulation.
That experience two years ago killed Peace's ambition to run for
secretary of state and cost him credibility as the power crisis
dominated headlines.</TE>
<TE>   California's deregulation plan was launched in 1995 with a 3-2
vote by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson's appointees to the Public
Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature sought to modify that plan, and Peace was chairman
through weeks of hearings in the summer of 1996. The result was a
bill that sailed through the Legislature without a single no vote.
Peace got much of the credit.</TE>
<TE>   In the hearings, Peace said he didn't think deregulation was a
good idea and questioned whether it would help small consumers. But
he also bragged about California's effort as "the most complex
transition of an industry done anywhere in the world."</TE>
<TE>   He paid for his hubris when the state's new power market went
horribly awry, starting in May 2000. Soaring electricity prices
enriched private energy companies and bankrupted the state's largest
utility.</TE>
<TE>   Peace, frequently and wrongly identified as the originator of
deregulation, was ridiculed by San Diegans, whose utility bills
doubled.</TE>
<TE>   Peace dropped out of the public spotlight during the worst days of
the electricity crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But he kept close watch on the issue. From the Senate floor, he
repeatedly attacked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for
failing to police private energy companies, and Enron Corp. for
gouging consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem was, Steve was so sure it was going to work.... He
kept talking about it and talking about it, like it was his bill."
Then, when the plan unraveled, "he got somewhat defensive and went into a
funk," state Sen. John Burton (D-San Francisco) said at Peace's Senate
farewell.</TE>
<TE>   "As he would berate FERC and berate FERC, the currency was
somewhat devalued in some of our minds .... And then, as time would
tell, he was absolutely right."</TE>

<HD>The Long, Hard Trek to Rose Parade Victory</HD>
<DH>A float sponsor aims for a three-peat. It takes time, big
bucks and eccentric talent.</DH>
<SE>One in an occasional series on the 2003 Tournament of Roses.</SE>
<AU>Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's dawn on a fall Saturday and Tim Estes, tired and grumpy, has
been at work for two hours.</LD>
<LD>   He is putting one of America's longest and least-known winning
streaks at risk.</LD>
<LD>   The Rain Bird float, Estes' best hope for extending his victory
run, will soon travel down a quiet street in Duarte, the critical
final inspection before it glides down Colorado Boulevard in the 2003
Rose Parade.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, Estes snaps at two neighborhood children who have
climbed onto the float ("Don't you know you're not insured?") then
apologizes to their father. "I'm sorry to yell. But this is no
low-pressure thing."</TE>
<TE>   For two straight years, the Rain Bird float has earned the
Sweepstakes Trophy as the most beautiful in the world's most-watched
parade. (No sponsor has won three straight in a generation.) Estes'
streak is even longer. For the last nine years, floats built by his
Fiesta Parade Floats have taken the top prize.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a dynasty greater than the New York Yankees," says Greg
Lewis, a Pacific Palisades flower broker. "And it's Tim who really
holds it together."</TE>
<TE>   Winning the top prize takes 15 months, a big budget and a
crazy-quilt team of eccentric talents, some of whom seem to delight
in tormenting the boss.</TE>
<TE>   Each brings a strange genius, a love of the parade and a
willingness to sacrifice financial self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   Among the players are a sponsor insistent on victory, a designer
who won't go anywhere without his parrot, and a florist who exploits
the artistic possibilities of walnuts.</TE>
<TE>   Estes, a burly man who wears shorts and chews unlighted cigars,
builds 13 floats out of a small warehouse just off the Foothill
Freeway in Duarte. He considers it a good year when he can pay his
insurance premium ($120,000 and rising fast), make the college
tuition for his twin daughters, and take home a $75,000 profit on
annual revenue of $2.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the challenges, Tim never stifles us in any innovative
or creative way," says Jim Hynd, the floral director and part owner
of Fiesta. "We always go to the max and go for the home run. And he
is willing to suffer the personalities and the consequences."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In early spring, Estes studies a design of a water system for the
Rain Bird float.</TE>
<TE>   "If it works ...," he says, scratching his head.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to get paid, it better."</TE>
<TE>   Arthur Ludwick, senior vice president and a member of the owning
family of Rain Bird Corp., is weighing in.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1933 by Orton Englehart, the inventor of a new kind of
lawn sprinkler, and his friend Clem LaFetra, the Glendora-based
company is said to be the world's largest manufacturer of irrigation
equipment. The LaFetra family has kept the firm private and its
profile low, but Ludwick, who married Clem LaFetra's daughter, is not
so shy.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had my life to live over again," the diminutive executive
says, "I'd be Mickey Rooney."</TE>
<TE>   In early 1996, Ludwick applied to the Tournament of Roses for a
spot in the parade, seeing it as a way to identify Rain Bird with
environmental protection. The tournament, eager to have a large local
company on board, accepted Rain Bird, which paid the $4,000 entry
fee. And Ludwick hired Estes, insisting that the float feature
animals (preferably endangered) and illustrate Rain Bird's trademark:
"Intelligent Use of Water."</TE>
<TE>   That first year Ludwick discovered that he couldn't justify the
expense of a float purely as advertising. But his employees and
Glendora city officials loved the attention. And he reveled in the
competition for prizes.</TE>
<TE>   So Rain Bird, as a perk, began taking golf course superintendents
and other key customers to the parade. The firm started an employee
contest to name the Rain Bird entry and put employees in charge of
decorating, shipping pieces to company facilities in Arizona and
Alabama so everyone could participate.</TE>
<TE>   Rain Bird workers can recite the company's record: four
Sweepstakes in six years. Last spring, the company flew its entire
international sales staff to Pasadena to celebrate the 2002 award at
the Doubletree Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The success has put Rain Bird on the elite list of perennial prize
winners -- along with Honda, Kodak and a few others -- that are
unofficially guaranteed a spot near the front of the parade. (Other
floats rotate position year to year.)</TE>
<TE>   That status reflects budget; Rain Bird's is one of the parade's
$300,000 super-floats. Most corporate float sponsors spend only half
that.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a ferociously obnoxious, encrusted personality," says
Ludwick. "And, as I've told Tim many times, I'm only happy when we
win."</TE>
<TE>   To satisfy that thirst for victory, Estes starts by calling Raul
Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   The son of a Navy mechanic, Rodriguez grew up in East Los Angeles
and was 14 when he designed his first Rose Parade float, for the city
of Whittier. He is a designer for hire, in demand in Hollywood (he's
done stuff for Disney) and Las Vegas (the signature facade of the
Flamingo Hilton).</TE>
<TE>   But he has built his career around the less lucrative Rose Parade,
dreaming up float concepts for Estes and two other builders.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always had this obligation to imagine things," he says. "And
Tim gives me freedom."</TE>
<TE>   Rain Bird's is the first of 19 floats he'll design for the 2003
parade. Working from a studio in the rear of his Hancock Park home,
he stops to brew coffee, greet artist friends who constantly drop by,
tend a house full of artwork and chat with his bird, a rare ruby
macaw named Little Foot.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, Rodriguez -- and his bird -- ride on one of his
designs.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't a real world that Raul lives in," says Hynd, the floral
designer. "He's never grown up."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez begins trying out concepts for Rain Bird's 2003 float in
October 2001. One has a rain forest theme, another a galloping horse,
and a third involves a giant tree with a bear.</TE>
<TE>   At a meeting with Rain Bird in February, however, the reaction is
cool.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible, the company's public relations firm asks, to build
a living float?</TE>
<TE>   A float whose flowers have not been glued on but are still growing
on their way down Colorado Boulevard?</TE>
<TE>   After a long pause, Hynd says such a concept is possible but would
severely limit the kinds of flowers -- and thus the variety of
colors. Few things will grow on a cold January morning.</TE>
<TE>   As they talk, Rodriguez sketches furiously. Egyptian images --
then other African ones -- come into his head. Rather than a living
float, he thinks, what about showing a scene where water brought life
to a dry landscape?</TE>
<TE>   Back at home, he blocks in a few shapes. And soon he draws
elephants, giraffes, a zebra and birds playing by a stream with small
waterfalls -- matching Rain Bird's "use of water" message. He makes a
couple of the elephants babies, to mesh with the tournament's theme
of youth and dreams.</TE>
<TE>   Rain Bird jettisons the "living float" and approves Rodriguez's.</TE>
<TE>   "Water Wonderland" will be the winning entry in the company naming
contest.</TE>
<TE>   Estes takes Rodriguez's rendering and has an employee, Frank
Garcia, make a three-dimensional Styrofoam model, which is placed on
the warehouse floor where the float will take shape.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim," says Rodriguez, "can build anything."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Tim," comes a shout from a worker in the Fiesta float barn, "when
are we going to throw out" the rabbits?</TE>
<TE>   Building a float begins with recycling. Estes keeps a few old
float pieces from previous parades (dinosaurs peered over the
surrounding Duarte neighborhood this year as a result). Estes' crew
has stripped the 2002 Rain Bird float down to the chassis, which will
be used on the 2003 model.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough business," says Estes. "You have to save when you
can."</TE>
<TE>   Estes, 47, bought Fiesta from its founding family in 1988. He had
been building floats since he was 8 but had never been an owner. He
has struggled financially -- late payments by a float sponsor nearly
bankrupted him -- but prospered artistically.</TE>
<TE>   The owner of the Fiesta warehouse, or float barn in parade
parlance, is the Tournament of Roses. As it does for other builders,
the tournament heavily subsidizes the rent. Although the builders are
independent companies, in practice they serve at the pleasure of the
parade.</TE>
<TE>   In building Rain Bird's float, Estes must abide by the
tournament's voluminous rules. First he must earn approval for
Rodriguez's design. And in April, Estes appears before the Design
Variance Committee, the tournament's answer to a zoning board.</TE>
<TE>   Estes, in shorts and baseball cap, takes a seat at the end of the
table in the tournament conference room, with the committee -- made
up of parade volunteers in coats and tie -- on the other end.</TE>
<TE>   "This certainly is a very Republican float," he says, pointing out
the elephants.</TE>
<TE>   That gets a chuckle. So Estes begins asking for a series of
exemptions from tournament rules. There will be taped music (that's
common, but needs committee approval). And the float's giraffe and
acacia trees will soar 32 feet, far above the 17-foot-4-inch
clearance where the parade passes under the Foothill Freeway. Estes
explains that he will design the giraffe and trees to bend so they
can squeeze under the overpass.</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the water. Water figures prominently in the
nightmares of parade officials -- specifically, a float so heavy with
water its brakes fail and it slams into the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Estes is pestered with questions about generators and water pumps.
Will the elephants spray the crowd with water from their trunks?
"Only if they see a white-suited individual," Estes jokes, a
reference to the uniform of tournament volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   After 20 minutes, the hearing is over. His variance arrives in the
mail the following week.</TE>
<TE>   With Estes now working six-day weeks, the building begins. There
are eight months to go.</TE>
<TE>   Fiesta has 24 full-time employees -- more than any other builder
-- and some parade officials think Estes a soft touch when it comes
to his payroll. His foreman was his best man. His art director is a
junior high classmate. In addition to the Rose Parade, Estes must
find other work -- a Boise parade, decorations for a Japanese
shopping mall -- to keep his crew busy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to Tim to have an experienced, talented crew that
is loyal to him -- that's how you get the best floats," says Hynd.
"We might make more money by subcontracting more work and having
fewer people, but Tim won't do that."</TE>
<TE>   Estes' crew starts by welding a massive steel frame onto the
chassis. A man named Jim Femino specializes in doing the "rod work":
the metal sculpturing for individual pieces, from elephants to birds.
Lupe Bejarano, an employee of 14 years, covers the float in wire
mesh. Holes in the wire are filled with a white, fibrous substance
during a process called "cocooning."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, a polyurethane foam is sprayed over the float, creating a
coat 2 or 3 inches thick, into which water vials for flowers may be
stabbed. Estes installs the Chevrolet engine, handles the engineering
work and endlessly tinkers, sometimes to the annoyance of his crew.</TE>
<TE>   His chief concern with the Rain Bird float is water. In
particular, he worries that the extra weight could blow a front tire,
leading to the towing of the float (and an automatic fine by the
tournament). Working from a drafting board in a tiny room next to his
office, he sketches a system that will handle more than 1,500 gallons
of water, five waterfalls and 24 high-pressure misting nozzles.</TE>
<TE>   Even before construction is complete, Estes must shepherd the
float through the first of two road tests. The test takes place at
dawn on a Saturday, so roads around the Fiesta barn can be closed
with minimal inconvenience.</TE>
<TE>   Tom McEntire, a Tournament of Roses mechanic, watches as the float
performs a series of turns flawlessly, but detects a disturbing
"putt-putt" from the engine and tells Estes the engine needs to purr.</TE>
<TE>   "McEntire, you've got way too much time on your hands," Estes says
sharply.</TE>
<TE>   "Tim," the mechanic replies, "I just live to give you hell."</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, new spark plugs seem to do the trick.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the road test, floral director Hynd begins work
after the building crew has gone home for the night, climbing over
floats with a tape measure and note pad. "Sometimes I just stare at
the float for a while and think," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Parade floats must be covered entirely in flowers or other
vegetation, dried or fresh, and Hynd has created many of the
decorating techniques used in modern floats.</TE>
<TE>   He was the first to turn straw flowers into confetti, the first to
employ dehydrated vegetables. (Dehydrated carrots will grace Rain
Bird's giraffe). But his most significant advance may have come in
skin tones.</TE>
<TE>   Flower petals were long used to represent skin, but they often
changed color -- leaving the impression that the faces on Rose Parade
floats were forever battling acne. Hynd discovered that walnut shells
-- when ground to different consistencies -- can create six skin
tones.</TE>
<TE>   Hynd has achieved even more subtle shades by rigging a cement
mixer at Fiesta to blend materials from cinnamon to onion seeds.</TE>
<TE>   Hynd is allergic to many of these materials; every innovation
seems to add to things that trigger his allergies. Still, he walks
through dusty produce markets for inspiration. "I look at the world a
little differently from most people," he says. "I see things -- coral
in the sea, cauliflower in the supermarket -- and wonder, how can I
use this?"</TE>
<TE>   Estes recalls how, "one time, Jim and I were at a client meeting
in Maryland. We're driving around, and Jim sees a tree he'd never
seen before. So he pulls off a branch and packs it in a suitcase to
take home."</TE>
<TE>   After months of thinking and a week of measuring and planning,
Hynd retreats into his office and produces a plan for all 990 square
feet of the float's surface area, using a form first developed by the
military for building airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Hynd will use thousands of vibrant yellow giant oncidium orchids
to create the acacia trees. Giraffes will be done in millet seed,
palm fiber and seaweed, elephants in mosses, a zebra in onion seed
(black) and sweet rice (white). To create the feeling of aridity in
the landscape, Hynd orders orange Mercedes roses from a farm in
Israel, one of the few places where they are available.</TE>
<TE>   But before the flowers arrive, the Rain Bird float must pass the
"T2," the tournament's final test.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Turn it on," says Estes, still grumpy as the sun comes up.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time on this late fall Saturday, the Rain Bird float
springs to life in public. The waterfalls run, the water recycled
through large tanks as Ludwick wished. The elephants frolic and spray
water out of their trunks, just as Estes had promised the Design
Variance Committee. The giraffe tilts its head toward an acacia tree,
just as Rodriguez drew it up. Estes, tinkering to the last, added a
sound effect, an air compressor, to mimic the noise of an elephant
giving off spray.</TE>
<TE>   By 7 a.m., the street next to Fiesta is filled with several teams
of Tournament of Roses volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   The two directly responsible for floats are headed by a pair of
brothers, Joe and John Delgatto.</TE>
<TE>   Lurking quietly are two representatives of the Judging Committee.
They carry tape measures to make sure the float meets all the
qualifications for prizes. (It does.) They won't return to the Fiesta
warehouse until after Christmas, along with the three judges, an
Alabama florist, a New York parade organizer and a North Carolina
commercial designer. The judges will announce prizes on New Year's
Day.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire! Fire! Fire!"</TE>
<TE>   A yell from John Delgatto's team breaks the silence. But there is
no blaze. This is a test of Estes' handpicked crew, "his lucky
drivers," three longtime friends who guide the float down the route.</TE>
<TE>   By tournament rule, they must evacuate the float in 45 seconds.
They scramble off in 20.</TE>
<TE>   The clipboard-toting volunteers report only one missing item, No.
526 on their list: The capacity of the fuel tank is not clearly
labeled.</TE>
<TE>   The animation of the elephants is good, says John Delgatto in the
post-inspection meeting in Fiesta's warehouse. "Looks like another
prize winner," Joe Delgatto whispers to Estes.</TE>
<TE>   The float is off to the decorating tent.</TE>
<TE>   Rain Bird has been cleared to defend its title.</TE>

<HD>Antiabortion Leader Faces Felony</HD>
<DH>Nebraska woman is charged with former Planned Parenthood
worker in interception of e-mails, voicemails.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LINCOLN, Neb.</DL>
<LD>The longtime executive director of the state's largest antiabortion
group has been charged with a felony after allegedly intercepting
e-mail and voice messages from Planned Parenthood of Lincoln, an
abortion-services provider.</LD>
<LD>   Nebraska Right to Life Director Julie Schmit-Albin, 46, was
charged Friday along with former Planned Parenthood employee John F.
Keller, 53, with intercepting communications.</LD>
<LD>   Keller was able to access Planned Parenthood e-mails because he
had set up the organization's computer system and knew the passwords
of individual employees, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Schmit-Albin had been in contact with him for several months
through e-mails, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Schmit-Albin's attorney, Sean Brennan, said the evidence was weak
and that his client had clearly stated in e-mail that she didn't want
the information if it violated the law.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities, however, say Schmit-Albin encouraged Keller.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Schmit-Albin told Keller in one
e-mail, "I'm perfectly comfortable taking what you or a third party
tells me; what you have access to."</TE>
<TE>   Police also say Keller offered Schmit-Albin keys and security
codes to get into the two Planned Parenthood clinics in Lincoln,
although her responding e-mails showed she declined to accept them.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail exchanges came to light when abortion opponent Pam
Tabor McCabe, an officer with Lincoln Right to Life, contacted police
after learning of Keller's offer to Schmit-Albin.</TE>
<TE>   Keller reportedly told police he sent the e-mails to retaliate
against Planned Parenthood for firing him; Planned Parenthood
Executive Director Chris Funk said Keller had resigned.</TE>
<TE>   A message seeking comment was left Saturday at a phone number for
John F. Keller in Lincoln, but it was not returned.</TE>

<HD>Bush, Frist Share Vision to Reshape Their Party</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald Brownstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The emergence of Sen. Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) as the probable incoming
Senate majority leader marks another milestone in President Bush's
efforts to reshape the face of the Republican Party.</LD>
<LD>   Though the White House insisted it did not engineer Frist's rise,
or the fall of his predecessor, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, one
of Frist's principal assets in his sudden ascent was the widespread
sense among Republicans that the White House preferred him over Lott
in the top job.</LD>
<LD>   Frist, whose selection is expected to be finalized Monday, will
align the image of Senate Republicans more closely with the White
House because his political profile is much closer to Bush than
Lott's was.</LD>
<TE>   Like Bush, Frist is conservative on most issues. But while Lott
rarely ventured beyond a conventional conservative skepticism toward
government, Frist is more in tune with Bush's idea of a reforming
conservatism that looks to increase reliance on the private market to
achieve social goals, but generally doesn't demonize government.</TE>
<TE>   The change may be most vivid in health care, likely to be a major
focus in the coming Congress and the 2004 presidential race. Over the
last few years, Frist has been a leader in developing a conservative
health-care agenda, which has included proposals to use tax credits
to cover the uninsured and a plan to fundamentally restructure
Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   With the White House already embracing those ideas, Frist's rise
is likely to give that agenda new impetus in the upcoming Congress.
As a result, some Republicans think Frist could help the party close
the historic Democratic advantage on health-care issues much the way
Bush's education initiatives, such as the education reform law of
2001, has narrowed the gap between the parties on that front.</TE>
<TE>   "It can be transformative for the party," insists one prominent
GOP lobbyist.</TE>
<TE>   For Democrats, Frist presents a challenge much like House Speaker
J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), the mild-mannered insider who eventually
succeeded former Rep. Newt Gingrich as speaker, and Bush himself: All
present largely conservative policies in a moderate tone much more
acceptable to swing voters than the harder-edged voices that
dominated the GOP in the immediate aftermath of its 1994
congressional takeover.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just Frist; there's a whole generation of Republicans
coming up ... who are extraordinarily conservative and whose policies
are exactly like the scarier Republicans of a few years ago, but put
a friendlier face on it," said Jim Jordan, the outgoing executive
director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "We have to
do a better job of accentuating the differences on policies and
relying less on visceral reactions."</TE>
<TE>   With Frist's emergence, many Republicans think the party has
completed a generational transition since the Republican takeover of
Congress in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The party then was defined primarily by Gingrich, who openly
dreamed of undoing programs that stretched back through the Great
Society to the New Deal, and his staunchly conservative deputy, Rep.
Dick Armey of Texas. In the Senate, the dominant figures were the
often-dour Majority Leader Bob Dole, and then Lott and his deputy,
Don Nickles of Oklahoma, who is more conservative than Lott.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the dominant voice in the GOP, of course, is Bush, whose
determination to send a message of inclusion led to his strong
denunciation of Lott. Bush gets support from Hastert, an avuncular
figure, and Frist, a physician who has invested time and energy in
health-care issues, such as AIDS and the uninsured, traditionally
considered higher priorities for Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Overall the GOP is considerably more conservative than a
generation ago, a process measured in the distance between this
President Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush. That tilt is also
reflected in the leadership role of staunch conservatives such as
Nickles in the Senate and incoming House Majority Leader Tom DeLay of
Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But relative to the initial Republican thrust after 1994, the new
team at the top constitutes a mid-course correction aimed squarely at
the suburban swing voters who drifted away from the GOP and toward
President Clinton during the two parties' epic struggles over the
role of government in the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's replacement with Frist represents an even more profound
generational change in Southern politics. Eleven years older than
Frist -- and shaped by a Deep South state where racial animosities
were more intense than in Frist's Tennessee -- Lott had roots in the
racially divisive politics that helped Republicans make their first
Southern inroads after the Civil Rights Act ended segregation in
1964.</TE>
<TE>   Lott's first job in politics was working for a segregationist
Democratic congressman; Frist was 12 years old when segregation was
struck down.</TE>
<TE>   The seeming praise for segregation at Strom Thurmond's birthday
party that doomed Lott reflected his political emergence in an era
when such covert signaling was still common. By contrast, Frist
embodies a newer generation of Southern Republican politicians who
attract white voters with conservative positions on taxes, social
issues and national security and generally believe that any
association with racial intolerance could alienate moderate swing
voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The big news" is that the Jesse Helmses are retiring, said Rice
University political scientist Earl Black, co-author of "The Rise of
Southern Republicans." "If you look at the whole generation of
Southern Republican senators ... they too would like to move the
Republican Party as far away from any hint of racial politics as they
can."</TE>
<TE>   Frist's rise gives Senate Republicans a leader whose style is
closer than Lott's to the "compassionate conservatism" Bush projects.
One reason Lott fell is that his remarks at Thurmond's party
crystallized the discontent many Republicans already felt at his
prominence in defining the party's image.</TE>
<TE>   "What this revealed is a desire by a whole lot of people not to
have him be a spokesman for the party anyway because of what he
reinforces with swing voters, as a Southern senator from Mississippi
who wasn't always seen as the most compassionate even before this,"
said one political advisor to the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Frist may be modestly less conservative than Lott; he's shown
enough inclination to compromise with Democrats that conservative
leader Gary Bauer, a 2000 GOP presidential candidate, issued a memo
Friday resisting his selection. But the bigger differences are in
style and priorities.</TE>
<TE>   As the first practicing physician in the Senate in decades, Frist
may offer Republicans an opportunity to begin reshaping their image
on health care. With the cost of health insurance and prescription
drugs soaring, and the number of Americans without health coverage
also rising, the issue looms as a major cloud over Bush's reelection.</TE>
<TE>   "Health care is close to the top of the issues for 2004," says
Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. "It is the No. 1 pocketbook issue in
America today."</TE>
<TE>   Frist has made health care a priority since his Senate arrival in
1995. And Frist's health-care ideas have influenced Bush from the
outset of the latter's presidential campaign in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Like Frist, Bush has proposed to provide tax credits to help the
uninsured buy coverage. Bush's campaign proposal to fundamentally
restructure Medicare by increasing its reliance on private insurance
companies was derived from a plan Frist formulated with Sen. John B.
Breaux (D-La.). Frist would make prescription drugs available for
seniors through private insurance companies, as Bush and almost all
congressional Republicans also prefer.</TE>
<TE>   With Frist's rise, all of those ideas will get a boost. Republican
sources say the administration is completing a plan that would tie a
Medicare prescription drug benefit to the market-oriented reforms
that Frist has long pushed. Over the long run, Frist's goal has been
to convert Medicare from the existing system, in which the government
pays doctors directly for treating seniors, into an approach in which
Washington provides the elderly fixed stipends to purchase private
insurance from a list of approved plans -- an idea known as premium
support.</TE>
<TE>   These ideas offer Republicans the chance to demonstrate a new
activism and interest in health care. But there's the risk that
Democrats, who staunchly oppose these initiatives, will present them
as a threat to Medicare benefits or an agenda designed more to
benefit the health industry than patients.</TE>
<TE>   Frist could prove a lightning rod for Democratic efforts to paint
the GOP as the defender of the health-care industry because his
family founded the firm that became Columbia/HCA, the world's largest
private hospital company. Within hours of his announcement Democrats
made clear they would seize on those ties in the health-care debates.</TE>
<TE>   "To put it mildly he has some conflicts of interest," Jordan said.</TE>

<HD>President Receives His Vaccination Against Smallpox</HD>
<DH>Bush says he was inoculated because of his role as
commander in chief and that most Americans need not follow suit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush received a smallpox vaccination Saturday, but stressed
that he did so in his role as commander in chief and not because most
Americans need to worry about a new outbreak of the deadly disease.</LD>
<LD>   Two weeks ago, Bush ordered nearly half a million U.S. troops to
be immunized against smallpox. Those who serve in the "high-risk
parts of the world ... could be on the front lines of a biological
attack," he said.</LD>
<LD>   The administration also recommended that some 439,000 public
health workers and emergency doctors be vaccinated against smallpox
as well.</LD>
<TE>   If there was a surprise outbreak of the disease, they would be
called upon first to treat the ill.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine is believed to be safe for most healthy people. Mild
reactions such as soreness in the arm or fever are common.</TE>
<TE>   Though serious complications are rare, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention estimated last year that one in a million
people would die from an initial vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   "As commander in chief, I do not believe I can ask others to
accept this risk unless I am willing to do the same," Bush said
during the Dec. 13 announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The president was given a vaccination in his left arm about noon
Saturday, and an hour later left by helicopter for the Camp David
retreat in the Maryland mountains. He had received the same
vaccination as a child.</TE>
<TE>   "The president feels fine, and there are no side effects," said
Jeanie Mamo, a White House spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said neither his family nor his staff would be vaccinated,
and administration officials said they did not recommend that the
general public undergo the vaccination for smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize the point, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of Health
and Human Services, announced last week that he does not plan to be
vaccinated. It wasn't known Saturday whether Vice President Dick
Cheney planned to be inoculated.</TE>
<TE>   The last known incidence of smallpox was in Somalia in 1977, and
the contagious plague was considered officially eradicated by the
World Health Organization in 1980.</TE>
<TE>   But U.S. officials believe the threat has not been entirely
eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that the smallpox virus still exists in laboratories, and
we believe that regimes hostile to the United States may possess this
dangerous virus," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   One such regime is Iraq, and a U.S. attack could provoke a
counterattack with biological weapons. Terrorists also could employ
the virus as a weapon, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "America has stockpiled enough vaccine ... to inoculate our entire
population in the event of a smallpox attack," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   But some national medical groups have questioned the
administration's drive to produce large quantities of the vaccine and
to inoculate health care workers.</TE>
<TE>   They say that the cost diverts resources from more immediately
dangerous diseases such as tuberculosis and the measles, and that the
risk from the vaccine outweighs the benefits.</TE>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sens. John F. Kerry and Joseph I. Lieberman have the most support
among Democrats when asked about the field of likely 2004 candidates
for the Democratic presidential nomination, a poll released Saturday
suggests. But Hillary Rodham Clinton would lead if she were to enter
the field.</LD>
<LD>   Among the current field of likely candidates, Democrats put Kerry
of Massachusetts and Lieberman of Connecticut at 16%, followed by
Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri at 10%.</LD>
<LD>   In an expanded field that included Clinton, the New York senator
was the choice of 30% of Democrats and those who lean Democratic in a
Time/CNN poll. Her aides have said consistently she does not plan to
run in 2004.</LD>
<TE>   Previous polls had put Al Gore, the 2000 Democratic nominee, at
the top of potential 2004 candidates. Gore said last weekend he would
not run.</TE>
<TE>   Such early polls are largely a measure of the public's familiarity
with potential candidates. The telephone survey of 1,006 Americans,
18 and older, had an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.</TE>

<DH>During an unusually busy season, several put in such long
hours that they earned more than federal law allows. Some plan to
fight repayment.</DH>

<LD>As a firefighting expert for the National Park Service, Jim Loach
left his Omaha home and spent what he said were countless hours this
past summer, mostly in Oregon, to help manage the efforts of
thousands of hard-pressed firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   But it turned out Uncle Sam was counting his hours. Loach has been
told he worked too much overtime and must pay back more than $12,000.</LD>
<LD>   Loach is one of about two dozen experts in forest fire management
for the National Park Service, Forest Service and Bureau of Land
Management who in recent weeks have received demands to pay back some
of their overtime earnings.</LD>
<TE>   "Watching my time sheet wasn't my concern," Loach said. "I was
getting out there and providing a service to the country, to get a
handle on all those fires. That's what we do."</TE>
<TE>   Loach said he'll fight to keep the money he earned.</TE>
<TE>   "This is patently unfair," he said. "This doesn't put you in the
Christmas spirit."</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a federal law that limits pay for firefighting duties
to a maximum of $121,600 a year. Even among the most seasoned
government firefighters, most earn much less, even with overtime pay.</TE>
<TE>   But some firefighters with 30 years or more of service who,
because of their experience, are tapped to coordinate the
firefighting efforts on the biggest blazes, make upward of $100,000.
Loach said he earns $117,000 a year, without overtime, as one of the
Park Service's veteran fire managers. So it doesn't take much
overtime for people like Loach to reach the salary cap.</TE>
<TE>   While the repayment demand has shocked firefighters, it also has
caused a certain amount of embarrassment to the Forest Service and
the Department of Interior, which oversees the Park Service and BLM.</TE>
<TE>   Officials say they are trying to find a way to allow the
firefighters to keep their overtime. They may have to repay it to
meet the letter of the law and be reimbursed some other way. "We're
still trying to work out the logistics, but we're going to make it
right with them," said Heidi Valetkevitch, a Forest Service
spokeswoman. "There's a legal requirement that we are operating under
to pay back any overtime overpayments, but we think we have special
authority to still give compensation, and we plan to exercise that
authority. Right now, we're going through a bureaucratic maze."</TE>
<TE>   She estimated that about 20 of the Forest Service's most
experienced managers received payback orders.</TE>
<TE>   John Wright, spokesman for the Interior Department, said he knew
of only one person who was paid too much, "and we're going to try to
work out a system that's equitable to resolve this."</TE>
<TE>   He said Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton "instructed her fire
folks and bureau directors to examine the issue for equitable ways to
resolve these challenges."</TE>
<TE>   Fire officials say that even if they are not forced to pay back
the government for last summer's overtime, the issue needs to be
resolved before it occurs again next year. This year, fires burned
more than 7 million acres -- mostly across the West and nearly double
the 10-year annual average. Because of the continuing drought,
authorities are braced for next summer. The largest firefighting
efforts are coordinated by the elite core of seasoned incident
commanders who travel from one weeks-long fire to the next, managing
thousands of firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   The overtime pay issue "could have a huge impact on fire
management in the future," said Jim Paxon, who served as the
spokesman for fire crews assigned to the mammoth Rodeo-Chediski fire,
which burned nearly 500,000 acres in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell me I won't get paid for working ... uh huh, right. I
wouldn't be too excited about going to work for free, or having to
pay the government back. I'll find something else to do," said Paxon,
a Gila National Forest district ranger in New Mexico who will retire
next month. "The salary cap affects the ones we need the most, our
senior fire managers."</TE>
<TE>   John C. Bedell, the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest supervisor
in Arizona, was told to pay back about $1,000 in overtime earned
helping to manage the Rodeo-Chediski fire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an outrage," he said. "I was remotely aware of this
maximum-pay thing, but it didn't concern me. I was just dealing with
the emergency at hand, and it never occurred to me to say that
tomorrow I can only work 10 more hours, then see ya."</TE>
<TE>   Adding insult to injury, Bedell and others said, was that income
tax and other deductions were withheld from their overtime paychecks,
yet they are being told to reimburse the gross amounts.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never encountered such a thing," said Bedell, who after 39
years of service will retire April 3. He said he will probably pay
the government back, if pressed.</TE>
<TE>   Said Loach, "In my 32 years with the Park Service, I've never
before exceeded the annual cap. If we were running up against it, I
would have thought someone would have waived it, given how bad the
summer fires were."</TE>

<HD>Frist's Possible Conflicts Seen as No Problem Under Senate
Rules</HD>
<DH>The guidelines of the upper house allow the lawmaker to own
stock in a for-profit hospital chain and work on health-care
legislation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jube Shiver Jr.</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. Bill Frist, his wife and children own millions of dollars worth
of stock in HCA Inc., the country's largest for-profit hospital
chain. Frist, poised to become Senate majority leader, is also
promoting legislation to reshape the nation's health-care system.</LD>
<LD>   In some circles, including the executive branch of the federal
government, this would be considered a conflict of interest. But not
in the U.S. Senate, whose mostly wealthy members have embraced ethics
rules that enable them to hold on to their fortunes while they
promote bills that affect their personal financial interests.</LD>
<LD>   "The public should not expect any ethics committee proceedings
regarding the new majority leader's role in health legislation
because that's not the Senate's way," said Charles Tiefer, a
University of Baltimore law professor and nationally recognized
authority on congressional ethics practices.</LD>
<TE>   Since his election in 1994, Frist -- the Senate's sole physician
-- has been applying his experience as a heart surgeon to champion a
long list of health-care issues. Those include prescription drug
coverage for the elderly, coverage for the uninsured, bioterrorism
and medical research.</TE>
<TE>   Frist has rejected suggestions that because of his investments in
HCA and some smaller medical providers, he should recuse himself from
health-care legislation. He has argued, instead, that the Senate
benefits from his expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Frist spokesman Nick Smith pointed to a Senate ethics committee
ruling that allowed Frist to keep his HCA stock and still vote on
health-care issues. But, he said, "the senator went the extra mile"
by putting his holdings in a blind trust.</TE>
<TE>   Smith said that because the holdings are being managed by others,
it is impossible to know what they consist of. But Frist's Senate
financial disclosure forms indicate that he, his wife and children
hold millions of dollars in HCA stock.</TE>
<TE>   For all of his medical knowledge, Frist -- who keeps a white lab
coat and an emergency doctor's bag in his office -- rarely strays
from the party line. Critics say he frequently simply repackages the
GOP's health-care issues with his more extensive medical knowledge
about the issues.</TE>
<TE>   "There are numerous concerns about whether his allegiances are
with health-care companies or with actual consumers who are sick and
ill and need treatment," said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the
Washington office of Consumers Union. "We've never found him to be
very sympathetic to universal [health insurance] coverage or
affordable health care for low- and moderate-income Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fine that he delivers care and offers his own services to
others on a voluntary basis," he said. "But his positions are a
different story."</TE>
<TE>   Ethics rules that apply to the executive branch require top
federal officials to sell financial holdings that might potentially
conflict with their official duties under certain circumstances. In
the House, members are barred from voting on any issues in which they
have a direct pecuniary interest -- a guideline that some senators
voluntarily observe.</TE>
<TE>   In the Senate, members can vote on legislation that benefits them
personally as long as it also benefits the public. Said Tiefer: "The
Senate's rules technically allow senators a lot of wiggle room."</TE>
<TE>   Frist became a multimillionaire through his acquisition of HCA
stock and smaller investments in other medical concerns. But unlike
his brother, Thomas F. Frist Jr., and his father, HCA founder Thomas
Frist Sr., the senator never worked for HCA, which owns and operates
180 hospitals and other health-care facilities in 23 states, Britain
and Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say that by eschewing the hospital executive ranks for
patient care and public service, Frist has demonstrated that he is
more interested in the public interest than financial self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   He won praise, for instance, for his frequent public briefings in
the aftermath of the anthrax attacks on the Capitol in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Frist also has had occasion to put his emergency doctor's bag to
use on Capitol Hill. In one instance, he helped save the life of a
man shot after killing two Capitol Police officers and wounding two
others. First also resuscitated Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) when the
aging senator collapsed on the Senate floor in October 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The list of Frist political contributors is dominated by
health-care companies, unlike most politicians whose financial
support comes mainly from lawyers and financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   For the 1997-2002 Senate election cycle, the health-care industry
gave Frist $1,072,157 in contributions, more than he received from
any other sector, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington research organization.</TE>
<TE>   In his two years as chairman of the GOP's Senate campaign
committee, Frist is also credited with luring health-care industry
donors to the Republican Party -- a move that helped bolster the GOP
in recent elections.</TE>
<TE>   Many colleagues praise Frist as a smart and well-intentioned
public servant. But with his profile rising, critics say the
self-assured surgeon needs to be more attuned to how his actions are
seen by others.</TE>
<TE>   "It is useful to have someone who is a physician and was a surgeon
before he left to enter politics because medical care is going to be
a huge and important issue," said Arnold S. Relman, a professor
emeritus at the Harvard University medical school and former editor
of the New England Journal of Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "But I think he's made a mistake if he thinks that as long as he
puts his HCA holdings in a blind trust he is off the hook," Relman
added. "No way can a human being be indifferent. I think the public
ought to be reassured that a man in such a key position as Bill Frist
should be free of such financial influence."</TE>

<HD>Many Held at Guantanamo Not Likely Terrorists</HD>
<DH>Dozens of detainees pose no real threat, but U.S. policies
make it nearly impossible to get names off lists. There's also fear
of freeing '21st hijacker.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States is holding dozens of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay
who have no meaningful connection to Al Qaeda or the Taliban, and
were sent to the maximum-security facility over the objections of
intelligence officers in Afghanistan who had recommended them for
release, according to military sources with direct knowledge of the
matter.</LD>
<LD>   At least 59 detainees -- nearly 10% of the prison population at
the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- were deemed to be of no
intelligence value after repeated interrogations in Afghanistan. All
were placed on "recommended for repatriation" lists well before they
were transferred to Guantanamo Bay, a facility intended to hold the
most hardened terrorists and Taliban suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of the detainees are Afghan and Pakistani nationals
described in classified intelligence reports as farmers, taxi
drivers, cobblers and laborers. Some were low-level fighters
conscripted by the Taliban in the weeks before the collapse of the
ruling Afghan regime.</LD>
<TE>   None of the 59 met U.S. screening criteria for determining which
prisoners should be sent to Guantanamo Bay, military sources said.
But all were transferred anyway, sources said, for reasons that
continue to baffle and frustrate intelligence officers nearly a year
after the first group of detainees arrived at the facility.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of guilty [people] in there," said one officer,
"but there's a lot of farmers in there too."</TE>
<TE>   The sources' accounts point to a previously undisclosed struggle
within the military over the handling of the detainees. Even senior
commanders were said to be troubled by the problems.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Michael E. Dunlavey, the operational commander at
Guantanamo Bay until October, traveled to Afghanistan in the spring
to complain that too many "Mickey Mouse" detainees were being sent to
the already crowded facility, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   One senior Army officer described Dunlavey's visit as a
"fact-finding" mission. But another who met with Dunlavey said the
general's purpose was more direct: "He came over to chew us out," the
officer said. Dunlavey, an Army reservist, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The sources blamed a host of problems, including flawed screening
guidelines, policies that made it almost impossible to take prisoners
off Guantanamo flight manifests and a pervasive fear of letting a
valuable prisoner go free by mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wanted to be the guy who released the 21st hijacker," one
officer said.</TE>
<TE>   While that concern remains a legitimate one, the fact that dozens
of the detainees are still in custody a year or more after their
capture has become a source of deep concern to military officers
engaged in the war on terrorism around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Many fear that detaining innocents, and providing no legal
mechanism for appeal, can only breed distrust and animosity toward
the U.S. -- not only in the home countries and governments of the
prisoners but also among the inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "We're basically condemning these guys to long-term imprisonment,"
said a military official who was a senior interrogator at Guantanamo
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "If they weren't terrorists before, they certainly could be now."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, he said, even amid the tight security there is
significant indoctrination of prisoners by radical Islamists among
them.</TE>
<TE>   The Afghan and Pakistani governments have raised the issue with
Washington. A Pakistani embassy official, who declined to be
identified, said his government is convinced that many of the 58
Pakistanis known to be in custody "probably joined the Taliban but
didn't know how to spell Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Even some prisoners red-flagged by the screening guidelines were
clearly of no intelligence value and should not have been sent,
military intelligence sources said.</TE>
<TE>   One prisoner was transferred because he was Arab by birth and had
once fought for the Taliban, thereby meeting two key screening
criteria. But before the war he had sustained such a massive head
injury that he could utter little more than his name and was known by
interrogators at Guantanamo Bay as "half-head Bob."</TE>
<TE>   "He had basically had a combat lobotomy," the interrogator said.
"Every [intelligence report] on him from Afghanistan said, 'No value,
no value, don't send him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Others were grabbed by Pakistani soldiers patrolling the Afghan
border who collected bounties for prisoners, sources said. One such
prisoner was captured at a restaurant near the border where he
claimed to have lived and worked for 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the mental capacity to put flatbread in an oven and that
was the extent of his intellect," the interrogator said. "He never
got trained on a rifle, never got pressed into service. But he was
Arab by birth so he was picked up and sent away."</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon officials declined to discuss individual cases, but
insist that the U.S. has reasonable grounds for holding all the
prisoners at Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   "All are considered enemy combatants lawfully detained in
accordance with the law of armed conflict," said Navy Lt. Cmdr.
Barbara Burfeind, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command, which
oversees operations at Guantanamo Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Several senior military officers responsible for transfers of
prisoners also defended their decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody that was sent met the conditions that were sent down
from our higher headquarters," said Army Col. Michael T. Flynn, the
top intelligence officer in Afghanistan when many of the detainees
were transferred. "We were sending the right folks."</TE>
<TE>   According to classified Pentagon guidelines, Guantanamo Bay was
meant to be a long-term detention facility for Al Qaeda operatives,
Taliban leaders, "foreign" fighters and "any others who may pose a
threat to U.S. interests, may have intelligence value, or may be of
interest for U.S. prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   But from the beginning, prisoners who didn't meet those criteria
were sent, sources said. In some cases, military police seemed to
have more influence over flight lists than intelligence officers,
lobbying commanders to ship out troublesome detainees.</TE>
<TE>   Other detainees seemed to get caught up in the military's
bureaucratic machinery. In many cases, low-value prisoners caught
early in the war were placed at the bottom of prioritized lists. But
as planeloads of prisoners were sent to Cuba, names at the bottoms of
the lists drifted to the top, and some started showing up on flight
manifests.</TE>
<TE>   Once they appeared on the manifests, sources said, removing them
proved almost impossible. Doing so required senior intelligence
officers in Kuwait or Afghanistan to work through thickets of
military red tape. It also required them to trust the judgment of
junior intelligence officers, something they were loath to do given
the stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Through much of the war, the decisions were made far from the
battlefield, by commanders in Kuwait or back in the United States.
Intelligence officers in Afghanistan became increasingly dismayed at
the number of low-level detainees on the manifests.</TE>
<TE>   "We saw it as having huge potential for eroding public trust," one
officer said. In a conflict dependent on the cooperation of local
Afghans, he said, "winning the hearts and minds was our greater
concern."</TE>
<TE>   To call attention to the problem, some began circulating lists of
prisoners they believed were being improperly placed on Guantanamo
Bay flight manifests. The lists were seen by senior intelligence
officers in Afghanistan, Kuwait and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   One of the lists covers 49 Afghans and 10 Pakistanis who were held
at Kandahar air base until the Afghan facility was shut down in June,
prompting their transfer to Guantanamo Bay, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The list describes detainees' occupations, the circumstances of
their captures, summaries of interrogations and alibis they provided.
The prisoners range in age from 16 to 50, most with little or no
education. None was deemed to have meaningful ties to Al Qaeda or the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   A typical entry describes a 30-year-old Afghan farmer captured by
Afghan forces who "seemed most interested in stealing his car and
money."</TE>
<TE>   Another describes a 22-year-old Afghan who sold firewood at a bus
station in the city of Kunduz and was picked up by Northern Alliance
forces while he and six others were traveling to Kabul, the Afghan
capital.</TE>
<TE>   "He answers all questions quickly and fully," interrogators
concluded. "His story is plausible and consistent, and there is no
evidence that he has ever worked for or had any knowledge of the
Taliban or Al Qaeda."</TE>
<TE>   Not all of the detainees' stories are so tidy. Many admitted to
being fighters for the Taliban, although often as low-level soldiers
conscripted when they couldn't afford payments required by the
Taliban to avoid service -- often amounting to six months' wages.</TE>
<TE>   Among the Pakistanis on the list was a 16-year-old who traveled to
Afghanistan at the start of the war to help the Taliban, but quickly
had second thoughts and was captured by the Northern Alliance while
trying to flee. "He showed no signs of deception," interrogators
noted. "He never fought for the Taliban."</TE>
<TE>   Another Pakistani, a 33-year-old taxi driver, was captured near
the city of Mazar-i-Sharif.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that the detainee's taxi car broke down was a deciding
factor for him to leave home and fight the Jihad," according to his
file.</TE>
<TE>   "Detainee is a low-level fighter with no tactical intelligence.
Recommend repatriation."</TE>
<TE>   These detainees would almost certainly have been repatriated had
they not been captured early in the war, before screening systems
were overhauled to make releasing low-level prisoners easier, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   By midsummer, military officials took to withholding the names of
new inmates from prison rosters until they could be evaluated. That
way, they didn't officially exist and, if deemed harmless, could be
released before their names got caught up in the system.</TE>
<TE>   "The same people who created this huge bureaucratic monster came
up with a way to thwart it," one Army interrogator said, "which is
never enter people into the system."</TE>
<TE>   At Guantanamo Bay, the presence of dozens of low-value prisoners
drained resources. The facility, known as Camp Delta, was also
plagued by other problems.</TE>
<TE>   A chronic shortage of military police meant interrogations were
shut down at 9 p.m., sources said, denying interrogators the often
effective tactic of subjecting detainees to marathon interview
sessions.</TE>
<TE>   There was also a confusing command structure that hampered
information sharing. Guantanamo Bay was controlled by the Southern
Command -- whose territory includes South America -- even though the
war on Al Qaeda was principally the purview of the U.S. Central
Command.</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence reports often got tied up in transit between the two
commands, sources said, sometimes delaying delivery for days. And
intelligence officers at Southern Command who edited reports out of
Guantanamo Bay knew far more about Colombian rebels than Al Qaeda
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has classified prisoners at Guantanamo Bay as
"enemy combatants," a murky status in which detainees are not allowed
hearings or legal representation.</TE>
<TE>   In July, a federal judge considering a lawsuit filed on behalf of
14 Kuwaiti detainees ruled that prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have no
right to appear in U.S. courts and can be held indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld acknowledged that
the prison population at Guantanamo Bay went beyond the "hard-core"
cases for which it was constructed.</TE>
<TE>   "The first people who were brought down were the hardest of the
hard-core," Rumsfeld said. "Now it is a mix. They run pretty much
across the spectrum.... Some may be transferred to other countries,
some may be released, some may be held for the duration, some may be
tried in one or more of the various mechanisms that are available."</TE>
<TE>   But nine months after Rumsfeld's comments, only five prisoners
have been released from a population that totals about 625 and
represents 43 nations.</TE>
<TE>   The first prisoner released, in April, was so mentally unstable he
was known by interrogators as "Wild Bill."</TE>
<TE>   "He would eat his own feces, dump fresh water from his canteen and
urinate in it and drink it," the senior interrogator said. CIA, FBI
and psychiatric experts "concluded he was insane."</TE>
<TE>   Four others were released at the end of October, including three
Afghans and one Pakistani. Among them were one low-level Taliban
conscript and two men who appeared to be in their 70s and said they
had never served the Taliban.</TE>

<HD>Havens for Homeless Facing More Than They Can Handle</HD>
<DH>As the economy lags, cities report that demand is soaring
for food and shelter. The crisis is especially acute in St. Louis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephanie Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Every night in this city, homeless men and women knock on shelter
doors, desperate for a place to sleep, desperate for a bed for their
babies. More than half are turned away.</LD>
<LD>   Mothers and fathers line up outside food pantries in the cold,
hoping for a box of groceries. They get a small bag: macaroni,
cereal, peanut butter. Enough for a few days, if they're sparing.</LD>
<LD>   Every day, the need grows. More are homeless. More are hungry. "We
are not able to keep up," said Bill Siedhoff, the city's director of
human services.</LD>
<TE>   His colleagues across America echo that assessment, with alarm.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's mayors reported last week that demand for emergency
shelter and food has soared over the past year as the economy has
stagnated. Housing costs continue to rise faster than incomes. And
increasingly, even working parents find themselves unable to pay the
rent and still feed their families.</TE>
<TE>   In St. Louis, the crisis is especially acute: Requests for shelter
are up 64% -- the biggest jump in the country. More than 43,000
people seek food handouts every week. "It's overwhelming," said the
Rev. Larry Rice, who runs a downtown shelter. "People are coming to
us saying, 'We're cold.' "</TE>
<TE>   "I had nowhere to go. Just nowhere to go," said one 31-year-old
mother who sought shelter with the Salvation Army here last month.</TE>
<TE>   She earns $9 an hour at a full-time job she's held for years. But
she cares for her four children and her 2-year-old grandson. After
she and her husband separated, she tried for more than a year to hold
on to their apartment. The rent ate half her income. The bills piled
up, unpaid. She couldn't make it.</TE>
<TE>   She was humiliated, and scared. But she knew where to go. She
works as a social services counselor -- helping needy families find
emergency services. She has many clients. She now knows why.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, requests for food and shelter jumped 19% this
year -- among the steepest hikes in a decade, according to the U.S.
Conference of Mayors. Even as need soars, however, both public and
private agencies are finding their resources severely pinched.</TE>
<TE>   Many charities report that donations are down. The Salvation
Army's annual fund-raising campaign, for instance, is running more
than $400,000 behind last year's collection in the St. Louis region.
Meanwhile, state after state is faced with immense budget gaps; they
are cutting back social services, not pouring more money into
homeless shelters.</TE>
<TE>   The result: Nearly two-thirds of the 25 cities surveyed in the
mayors' report have had to cut back their grocery handouts, rationing
food to ensure that every needy family got at least a little to eat.
Half report that they cannot provide enough food to the hungry.</TE>
<TE>   "We give them just enough to survive," said Pearl Willis, who
distributes groceries at a St. Louis church.</TE>
<TE>   Though they have tried to expand capacity by adding more beds --
or, sometimes, floor mats -- many cities report that their shelters
are overflowing. Fully one-third of the homeless families who seek
emergency shelter in Los Angeles are sent back out to the streets.
One shelter in Nashville reports that it has to turn down half a
dozen families each day.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not simply statistics," Nashville Mayor Bill Purcell
said. "These are real people who are hungry and homeless."</TE>
<TE>   As despair washes over city after city, St. Louis is facing
especially hard times. This struggling city of 348,000 on the
Mississippi River has lost thousands of manufacturing,
telecommunications and transportation jobs in the past year,
including big cutbacks at American Airlines and Boeing Co. The
unemployment rate is stuck at 8.2%, well above the national average.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, officials handled 3,800 requests for shelter. This
year, they expect to get close to 6,000 requests. Only 42% will be
granted. The other men and women, even children, will have to fend
for themselves, doubling up with friends, huddling in their cars, or
camping out on the streets.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Siedhoff begs for more federal aid to address the
overwhelming need.</TE>
<TE>   "We need help," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But Philip Mangano, director of the federal Interagency Council on
Homelessness, can promise only a "modest increase" in next year's
budget -- a proposed hike of $75 million, spread among a dozen
programs that target homelessness. President Bush is also requesting
additional funds to help teens in foster care and newly released
convicts move into independent housing so they don't end up on the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   Mangano remains confident that even without a huge new investment,
the nation will be able to meet the president's goal of ending
chronic homelessness within a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Homeless mom Toni Woods has a much more modest goal: getting her
family an apartment by the spring.</TE>
<TE>   Woods, 26, abandoned her rental house last year when she learned
that her twin toddlers had lead poisoning from the flaking paint. She
moved in with one relative, then another, but the bedrooms were too
crowded, the life too chaotic. She couldn't save up enough money for
a security deposit on a new home from her part-time job as a sales
associate, at $6.50 an hour.</TE>
<TE>   So last week, she moved into a Salvation Army family shelter with
her twins and her 10-year-old daughter, their clothes neatly packed
in orange plastic tubs. Her family shares a small private room with
two bunk beds -- one now strewn with stuffed animals donated for the
twins' Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Woods is permitted to stay in the shelter for 120 days. That means
she has four months to get on her feet again.</TE>
<TE>   Her oldest daughter, Onnica, can't wait.</TE>
<TE>   Onnica can't practice her dance moves at the shelter. There's no
room. She can't play her music, either. She might annoy the other
guests. There's no desk for her to spread out her homework. There's
no kitchen for her to cook up her famous pickles sprinkled with
Kool-Aid powder. Worst of all, she can't invite her best friend over
to trade manicures.</TE>
<TE>   "I miss that," Onnica said, her voice low. She's ashamed to tell
her friend she's moved into a shelter. "It's not good," she said. She
won't look up.</TE>

<HD>In New Era of War, Pilotless Planes Soaring</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER H. KING</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>In early November the front page of this newspaper carried a
remarkable photograph from Yemen. Taken from television footage, the
shot depicted a bearded Yemeni in white robe and sandals, bent at the
waist, picking with a stick at a black spot in the desert sand.</LD>
<LD>   The black spot, the caption explained, was all that remained of
what had been, moments before, a vehicle packed with suspected Al
Qaeda operatives. The car had been hunted from on high by a
CIA-operated airplane, which hit it with an antitank missile.</LD>
<LD>   The attack, for many reasons, marked a big day in the war on
terrorism, but there would be no medal for the airplane's pilot. This
was because there was no pilot. The plane was a drone or, more
specifically, a Predator -- one in a line of pilotless aircraft being
designed and largely handmade here in San Diego by a company very
much on a roll.</LD>
<TE>   "Up until September of last year," Thomas J. Cassidy Jr., the head
of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., said last week, "things
were kind of flattening out in the world of producing these
airplanes.... And then all of a sudden 9/11 hit, and everybody
started making tons of these things."</TE>
<TE>   Every war produces a signature piece of equipment or two. In the
Persian Gulf War, Patriot antimissile systems were an early media
darling, only to be replaced at center stage by the Humvee. In
Vietnam, of course, it was the helicopter, and in World War II the
jeep and the aircraft carrier (and, for that matter, nuclear bombs).</TE>
<TE>   The line can be traced back through the biplanes of World War I,
the Ironclads of the Civil War, and on and on to the innovative
bronze body armor of the ancient Greeks.</TE>
<TE>   Now, with the prospects of war in Iraq looming larger every day,
and with the amorphous "war on terrorism" only begun, it would seem
to be the time of the drone.</TE>
<TE>   Once-skeptical Pentagon officials have begun to speak of a future
in which a third of all U.S. military aircraft are flown by remote
control.</TE>
<TE>   Other aerospace companies have begun to gear up to get into the
game. President Bush has praised Predators by name.</TE>
<TE>   And the workshops of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems now
fairly hum with activity, as workers in blue and white lab coats mold
wings, wire up software, install landing gear, mount missile carriers
and generally build almost from scratch Predators and Predator Bs,
the latest variation on the design.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have cranked out 82 Predators so far," Cassidy said,
"and we will probably continue to build a dozen a year. And now we
are ramping up Predator Bs.</TE>
<TE>   "We've added 300 people to this company, went from 500 to 800, in
the last year, just to meet increased demand on production. We have
added additional plants and equipment and facilities."</TE>
<TE>   The company was started 10 years ago as an affiliate of General
Atomics, a nuclear power contractor.</TE>
<TE>   The owner, Cassidy recalled, wanted to explore the potential of
unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs: "He kind of told me we need to do
this. Go do this."</TE>
<TE>   So Cassidy, beginning with five hires, did.</TE>
<TE>   "I had been a fighter pilot for 35 years," he said, "and I had
been around airplanes all my life. And I knew that a lot of people
had tried to do this before, and a lot of big companies had tried it,
and nobody had been very successful. I didn't think they went about
it the right way."</TE>
<TE>   There were, of course, stumbles and setbacks along the way, but
what developed over the decade was an aircraft, roughly the size of a
small private plane, that can hover for hours, transmitting by
satellite television-like images of battles in progress or targets on
the move.</TE>
<TE>   The planes are operated from "cockpits" on the ground hundreds, if
not thousands of miles away. While they can be flown by computer,
like commercial airliners on automatic pilot, in clear conditions the
on-board cameras make it possible for an operator, half a world away,
to fly a Predator as if looking out the window. If there were a
window.</TE>
<TE>   In Bosnia-Herzegovina, Predators were first deployed for
surveillance missions and later for marking targets. In Afghanistan,
they were rigged with air-to-ground missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Cassidy said, they could be developed to attack other
airplanes and operate from aircraft carriers.</TE>
<TE>   Before his pursuit of the drone, the Bronx, N.Y.-born Cassidy had
commanded a carrier-based fighter squadron in Vietnam, served at a
high level in the Pentagon and retired from the Navy as a rear
admiral. Despite his background, Cassidy has no problem with the idea
of forcing pilots to share combat airspace with his drones.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a lot of pilots say, well, why would anybody want to mess
with those things?" he said. "But we only use these unmanned
airplanes in situations where piloted airplanes have no business
being -- on very dull and dangerous missions, on very long, endurance
missions.</TE>
<TE>   "See, the beauty of these things is that they go to an area and
they stay there.... A tactical airplane with a pilot has to go out,
refuel, go to an area, come out, refuel, go back in, come out. It's
just hours and hours of boredom, interspersed with moments of stark
terror, as the saying goes.</TE>
<TE>   "With these things, with the unmanned airplanes, there is no
terror. They go, they stay, they dwell, they persist. And now that we
have weapons on them, we shoot."</TE>
<TE>   As demonstrated by the black spot in the sand of Yemen.</TE>
<TE>   Also, should a drone be shot down -- and it has happened -- there
is no downed pilot to rescue from the woods or sea, no prisoner of
war to be trotted before cameras. And no body bag to ship home.</TE>
<TE>   "You get a pilot on the ground," Cassidy said, "and it's a big
deal. But if one of these airplanes goes down, there is no loss of
life. There is no political nonsense trying to get the poor guy out."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond any technical capabilities, this feature alone would seem
to make the Predator the ideal U.S. warplane for its time. The Gulf
War and Bosnia sold many Americans on the comforting concept of
relatively bloodless combat. Push a button, kill an enemy, see it all
on TV.</TE>
<TE>   A Times Poll last week showed that nearly half those Americans who
now support sending troops into Iraq would change their minds if
American losses were to exceed 5,000. And for these people -- who
want the war but not the casualties -- what better weapon to send
into harm's way than a plane without a pilot?</TE>

<HD>Frist's Ties to Drug Firm Face Test in New Senate</HD>
<DH>Likely next GOP leader must decide whether to honor a deal
brokered by his predecessor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The expected Senate majority leader in the new Congress, Sen. Bill
Frist of Tennessee, will immediately face a controversy left over
from the last legislative session in which he played a prominent
role.</LD>
<LD>   At issue is a provision of the new homeland security law that
limits liability for makers of vaccine additives that some parents
allege caused autism in their children.</LD>
<LD>   When the provision was inserted into the bill last month, just
before final votes in the House and Senate, no one stepped forward to
claim authorship. Critics denounced the provision as a giveaway to
Eli Lilly &amp; Co. and other drug manufacturers. The bill passed
Congress with the controversial language and was signed into law by
President Bush.</LD>
<TE>   Frist, an ally of the pharmaceutical industry, had written nearly
identical language in a separate bill on vaccines. While he disavowed
any responsibility for inserting the language into the homeland
security bill, Frist twice spoke strongly in favor of the provision
during a Senate debate on whether to kill it.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Frist spokesman Nick Smith said the senator has
spoken with GOP colleagues who voted reluctantly for the provision in
the homeland security bill but want to alter it when Congress
returns.</TE>
<TE>   "They've already been talking," Smith said. "There's a number of
things being discussed" to address the concerns. He declined to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Frist had no public appearances scheduled Saturday, a day after he
became the consensus choice to replace Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi
as the Senate Republican leader. He spoke with colleagues and
well-wishers by telephone from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The vaccine additive issue is alive because of a back-room deal
brokered by the man Frist is expected to succeed.</TE>
<TE>   In the waning days of the 107th Congress, Lott was eager to get
the homeland security bill passed and sent to Bush's desk. But he
faced a potentially crippling amendment from Sens. Tom Daschle
(D-S.D.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). The amendment would have
killed the vaccine-related language and a handful of other
controversial provisions.</TE>
<TE>   Had the amendment passed, the homeland security bill might have
been in jeopardy. Centrist Sens. Lincoln Chafee (R-R.I.), Susan
Collins (R-Maine), Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) and Ben Nelson (D-Neb.)
provided crucial votes to help defeat the amendment. But they
extracted a promise from Lott, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas) and House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to revisit the
matter when Congress returned.</TE>
<TE>   One change under discussion would scale back the vaccine additive
provision to protect the interests of plaintiffs who filed lawsuits
before the law was enacted.</TE>
<TE>   Whether Frist would consider himself bound by any deal Lott
brokered is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   The provision requires people who allege damages from certain
vaccine additives -- including the mercury-based preservative known
as thimerosal, made by Lilly -- to first seek compensation out of
court through a fund created under a 1986 federal law. The law does
not bar potential plaintiffs from filing lawsuits after going through
that process.</TE>
<TE>   Thimerosal is being phased out of use in vaccines. Dozens of
lawsuits blame it for health problems, including autism. Lilly and
other defendants reject the allegations and say no research has
proved a link between vaccines and autism.</TE>
<TE>   This month, House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), who is
days away from retirement, said he was responsible for putting the
provision into the homeland security bill. Others point a finger at
the Bush administration -- a claim the White House denies.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.), a critic of the provision, called
it "government at its worst."</TE>
<TE>   Frist has close ties to Lilly. The company bought 5,000 copies of
a Frist book concerning bioterrorism and has also given money to a
Republican committee Frist recently chaired.</TE>
<TE>   But Frist, a former heart-transplant surgeon, also is an expert on
public health. During the floor debate in November, he said the
provision was essential for vaccine makers to stay in business.</TE>
<TE>   He called it a matter of national security and said the American
Academy of Pediatrics backed him.</TE>
<TE>   "I will say that, without this clarification [provision]," Frist
said, "litigation outside the program -- and that is what is
happening today -- will continue and the supply of vaccines could
well be jeopardized as we have these huge lawsuits."</TE>

<HD>New Yorkers Find Some Country in Heart of City</HD>
<DH>They flock to farmers markets. 'It feels like an old-time
village,' says one hardy shopper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Jensen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Every Saturday for the last two years, Carolyn Walker, a medical
researcher who lives in East Harlem, has bundled up a week's worth of
kitchen scraps into a big shopping bag and lugged it to the subway
for the four-mile, 20-minute trip to the Greenmarket at Union Square.</LD>
<LD>   There, as she did Saturday, with shoppers swirling around her, she
added her vegetable peelings and dead houseplant leaves to a bin of
scraps that will be made into nutrient-rich compost. "It's part of my
responsibility as a citizen of the planet to keep the Earth as clean
and recyclable as possible, with the least amount of toxicity,"
Walker said, explaining why she would go to such seemingly
considerable hassle.</LD>
<LD>   New York can be a city of ultimate convenience, with seemingly
everything one could desire available within one city block at all
hours of the day or night. That urban handiness extends down to
household garbage: Many apartment buildings have porters who will
pick it up right outside the apartment door.</LD>
<TE>   Nonetheless, each Saturday, thousands of New Yorkers converge on
Union Square for the farmers market, many going considerably out of
their way to have the full country experience in the heart of
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   Composting is just one small part of it. At this time of year, New
Yorkers will even get into their cars to come here to buy winter
vegetables, sip hot cider and pick from the rows of Christmas trees,
wreaths, poinsettias and even pine cones -- the kind you can pick up
for free on country roads -- for 25 cents each.</TE>
<TE>   Patricia Brophy, dressed in high heels, pink patterned stockings,
elegant costume jewelry and a fur collar, hailed a cab Saturday while
trying to not get blown over as a strong wind caught the 5-foot holly
branch she had just bought. A Wall Street broker, she said the market
"is the place to come; it's kind of an event."</TE>
<TE>   Christmas trees are available even in the wee hours of the morning
on practically every block, sold by French-speaking guys from Canada;
they'll even deliver. Nonetheless, the Musumeci family drove 20
blocks to the market to pick out their 8-foot tree Saturday, as they
do every year. "It's more Christmasy to buy it here than in front of
the supermarket," Claudia Musumeci said.</TE>
<TE>   The city's privately funded Council on the Environment started the
Greenmarkets program in 1976; today there are markets at more than 24
locations on varying days. Monica Bernheim, a psychotherapist, bought
apples in the pouring rain Friday at her Upper West Side Greenmarket.
The produce is fresh, and "it feels like an old-time village,"
Bernheim said of her dedication, even in bad weather.Apple vendor
Chip Kent, of Locust Grove Farm in Milton, N.Y., has been selling at
the Friday market since he was a teen; he's now 42. Customers can
recall his various girlfriends before he married.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Bialas, at his family's neighboring stand, recently married a
woman who had been a customer for several years.</TE>
<TE>   Hella and Carl Ossenberg, sharing an umbrella, have been customers
since the beginning. "It reminds me of small-town Russia," said
Hella, a psychoanalyst, about her affinity for the market, before
allowing that she's from the not-so-small Ukrainian town of Kiev.</TE>
<TE>   The Saturday Union Square market (the site hosts smaller markets
on Monday, Wednesday and Friday) is the biggest, with about 60
vendors per week, manager Cathy Chambers said.</TE>
<TE>   The customers' dedication to the fresh produce comes easily, but
the composting program demands more. Nonetheless, about 500
households bring in about 1,500 pounds of compost-ready material each
week to Union Square, said Christine Datz-Romero, director of the
Lower East Side Ecology Center, which runs the composting program.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about habits," she said. Making it easy for people to
participate in the program, which started in 1994, the center asks
them to bring their garbage in plastic bags, which are then emptied
into bigger bins, as aggressive squirrels jockey unsuccessfully for a
meal.</TE>
<TE>   The bins are carted to a park on the East River near the
Williamsburg Bridge, where the material is mixed with sawdust, then
later with earthworms that turn the mess into compost over three
months. The center sells the compost and uses some in a community
garden.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the composting bin had a steady stream of visitors. One
woman, wearing a bright fuchsia coat and purple hat, said she shares
a 450-square-foot apartment but still finds room in the bottom
refrigerator shelf for her scraps. "It drives my husband crazy," she
said. "He says, 'It's garbage, throw it out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Her dedication is motivated by budget-driven cutbacks in the
city's recycling program, which no longer picks up glass and plastic,
only metal and newspapers. A program that collected discarded
Christmas trees from curbside to turn them into mulch also has been
abandoned.</TE>
<TE>   Caspar Henselmann, a sculptor, and his wife, Evangeline, a retired
city planner, bring their scraps sometimes twice weekly 10 blocks to
the market. "I grew up in the country," he said, "and that's what you
did."</TE>

<HD>Ohio District Confiscates Copies of School Newspaper</HD>
<DH>Despite their free press policy, officials pull an issue
containing an article about students drinking alcohol. The
journalists object.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WOOSTER, Ohio</DL>
<LD>School officials in a district where the policy allows students
freedom of speech confiscated thousands of copies of the high school
newspaper after learning it contained an article in which students
talked about drinking alcohol at a party.</LD>
<LD>   Student editors said the article quoted the daughter of a school
board member saying she had consumed alcohol, and they believe that
was the reason about 4,500 copies of the biweekly Wooster Blade were
seized Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. David Estrop said the newspapers were taken on the advice of
lawyers who said the publication had inaccuracies and was potentially
libelous.</LD>
<TE>   At least two students said they were misquoted with statements
that "attributed to them acts of misconduct and potentially acts of
criminal behavior," Estrop said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   James Jackson, the principal at Wooster High School, said the
papers were taken after a teacher told him about a possible
confidentiality problem with the story.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law forbids naming students who face disciplinary action
without parents' permission, and at least one student claimed to have
been misquoted, Jackson said. Violating privacy rights could leave
the school vulnerable to lawsuits, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The student journalists disagreed and called the Student Press Law
Center.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hiestand, an attorney for the Arlington, Va.-based center,
said he reviewed the reporting at the student editors' request and
saw nothing in the Blade that violated libel laws.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very good reporting," Hiestand said. "It's just another one
of those cases of school officials wanting nothing but happy news in
the newspaper and abusing their authority."</TE>
<TE>   According to a policy labeled "Student Publication Rights" on the
Wooster City School District's Web site, an "unfettered student
press" is essential and "student journalists shall be afforded
protection against prior review and/or censorship."</TE>
<TE>   It says that freedom does not extend to material that is obscene
or defamatory or would disrupt school activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very privileged to have an open forum policy, but
personally I am disappointed that it has been violated," said Darcy
Draudt, 17, a senior and editor of the Wooster Blade.</TE>
<TE>   Whether school administrators can insist on prior review of a
students' publication has been a hot issue in high school journalism
since 1988, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that limits can be set
on the press rights of high school students.</TE>
<TE>   The Wooster school newspaper's advisor normally reviews the paper
but was called away last week on a family matter, Estrop said.</TE>

<HD>US Airways Files Reorganization Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Va.</DL>
<LD>US Airways Group said Saturday it had filed a proposed reorganization
plan that hinges on the airline obtaining a $1-billion federal loan
guarantee, a $240-million investment from the Alabama state pension
fund and pay givebacks from its employees.</LD>
<LD>   The plan was filed in federal Bankruptcy Court after two more
labor unions accepted cost-cutting measures Friday.</LD>
<LD>   US Airways in August became the first airline to declare
bankruptcy following last year's terrorist attacks that put the
industry in a tailspin. The airline lost $2.1 billion in 2001 and
said it needs to cut costs by $1.6 billion to remain viable.</LD>
<TE>   The company reiterated Saturday that it must receive $1 billion in
loan guarantees from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, a
reduction in its pension fund liabilities estimated at $3.1 billion
over the next seven years, and ratification of all the pay giveback
agreements it negotiated with its unions to emerge from bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Another reorganization provision calls for canceling its existing
common stock and a $240-million investment from the Alabama
retirement system, which will own 36.6% of new stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We've worked very closely with our creditors and with our equity
partner, the Retirement System of Alabama, and although they haven't
endorsed it yet we think the plan meets their concerns," said Chris
Chiames, the airline's senior vice president of corporate affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The $25-billion Alabama fund handles pensions for about 300,000
public employees. It was the sole bidder in a September sale of part
of the bankrupt airline and purchased the nearly 37% share for $240
million.</TE>
<TE>   "Needless to say, many sacrifices have been made," US Airways
President and Chief Executive David Siegel said. "Despite having to
work to get more cost savings than originally anticipated because of
the industry's prolonged downturn, I am actually more optimistic than
ever about our proposal."</TE>
<TE>   A new, 15-member board of directors will have eight nominees from
the Alabama pension system, four representatives of the labor unions,
Siegel and two independent directors to be named by the company.</TE>

<HD>3 days and counting</HD>
<DH>There's still time for procrastinators to tuck a few
things under the tree. Here are 15 great ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslee Komaiko</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are those who finished their Christmas shopping in November or
even July. Let's call them ... annoying. They throw off the curve for
the rest of us, the professional procrastinators who wait and wait
and wait some more, until the process becomes a breathless exercise
that begins with finding a parking spot and ends, in the best-case
scenario, in a long line of fellow procrastinators, waiting for shiny
red gift wrap.</LD>
<LD>   While we have no medicine for the laggard, no magic salve, we do
have ideas to make the final sprint a little more pleasant. Turn the
page for 15 fabulous gifts, priced from $9.99 to $385 and divided
into five handy categories.</LD>
<LD>   Some require actually getting into a car; others require just a
telephone or PC -- and a few extra dollars for express shipping. All
can be under your tree in time for the big day.</LD>
<TE>   Whether faux wood grain wallet from Plastica, Los Angeles'
grooviest boutique de plastique, or Venus Fly Trap Kit from the Smith
&amp; Hawken catalog, know that each item can be yours by Christmas,
which is just about upon us (time to freak out). That said, it
doesn't hurt to make a call before you drive across the city.</TE>
<TE>   Of course the easy way out is gift certificates, the gift few like
to give but nearly everyone loves to get. If all else fails, we have
found solace this time of year in Starbucks' eggnog latte. May the
elves be with you.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kids</TE>
<TE>   Venus Flytrap Kit: $10, Smith &amp; Hawken, 519 S. Lake Ave.,
Pasadena, (626) 584-0644, and South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, (714)
437-9526; mail order (800) 981-9888 or www.smithandhawken.com. Sure
it's gory. But gore is cool if you're a pre-teen. Besides, this
present is educational. Children grow their own dionaea muscipula
plant from seeds, then wait for an unsuspecting fly to land. Snap
crackle pop. An added bonus: Retire your swatter.</TE>
<TE>   Wildkin Curious George Backpack: $34.95, Barnes &amp; Noble stores,
most locations. (Visit www.barnesandnoble.com for addresses and phone
numbers.) Really two backpacks in one -- George sports his own
miniature (and usable) red backpack -- this plush monkey looks
adorable on both girls and boys. The only downside is that mom might
try to co-opt it for herself.</TE>
<TE>   Geomag 184: $99.99, Zany Brainy stores (multiple locations). This
will no doubt strike some as heretical, but compared to Geomag, Legos
are so yesterday. Geomag, like so many of life's best things, is made
in Italy and features magnetic balls that allow young architects to
build any which way they can imagine. Create cool constructions as
well that spin endlessly. Even adults will be intrigued.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hipsters</TE>
<TE>   Atomic Bonzai Kit: $14, Giant Robot, 2015 Sawtelle Blvd., Los
Angeles, (310) 478-1819, and L.A. Eyeworks (multiple locations). This
low-maintenance cardboard puzzle designed by Los Angeles artist Joji
Okazaki is perfect for those who want a little greenery but are too
cool for such mundane tasks as watering.</TE>
<TE>   Faux wood grain and polka-dot plastic wallets: $28 to $40,
Plastica, 8405 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles, (323) 655-1051. Cooler than
Coach and cheaper than Prada, these plastic wallets come in a variety
of sizes and styles. The polka-dot designs are fashioned from 1960s
op-art pillows. So you're kind of recycling.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Frank bicycles: $319 to $329, Paul Frank stores, 8101 W. 3rd
St., Los Angeles, (323) 653-6471, and 960 W. 16th St., Costa Mesa,
(949) 515-7950, Ext. 567. These new retro-style unisex cruisers, from
the same man who brought us Julius the Monkey, promise to put a smile
on the face of even the most jaded style-monger. Who needs unleaded
when you have one of these? Just remember your helmet.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foodies</TE>
<TE>   White Truffle Oil Dressing: $21, La Cachette, 10506 Little Santa
Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, (310) 470-4992. Here's a compelling reason
to eat your vegetables: a topping that gives bottled salad dressing a
good name. Just drizzle a little over simple greens or cold seafood
and you'll be thanking the Frenchman responsible: chef Jean Francois
Meteigner of La Cachette. Pawn it off as your recipe at dinner
parties. We won't tell.</TE>
<TE>   Bamboo cutting boards: $32 to $74, Soolip Bungalow, 548 Norwich
Drive, West Hollywood, (310) 360-1512. These cutting boards, crafted
by Los Angeles artisans Tom and Joanne Sullivan of Totally Bamboo,
are handsome enough to be displayed sans cheese and crackers. But
they look mighty nice sporting a hunk of brie as well. Give one on
its own. Or accompany it with a gift certificate from one of the
city's top cheese purveyors, such as Say Cheese in Silver Lake or the
Cheese Store of Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Mini Hat Box: $95, Vosges Haut-Chocolat, (888) 301-YUMM (9866) or
www.vosges chocolate.com. Not to be blasphemous, but Godiva, Teuscher
and the rest can't touch these confections from Chicago-based Vosges.
We're especially enamored of the exotic truffles made with unlikely
spices such as paprika and Indian curry. (Take our word, it works.)
The colorful hat box also features caramel toffee, Aztec Elixir cocoa
made with cinnamon and chilies and other treats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gadget gurus</TE>
<TE>   Bit Char-g Remote Control Cars and Trucks: $34.95 to $46.95,
Robotoys, 12023 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 769-5563. These
itty-bitty remote-control vehicles are just like the real thing: The
car is zippy; the truck, with working scoop, rumbles along. Keep one
in your top desk drawer for slow work days. But be sure the boss
doesn't catch you. Or give him his very own. With two trucks, you can
wage battles.</TE>
<TE>   Accu-Gage Digital Talking Tire Gauge: $9.99, Sears stores
(multiple locations) or www.sears.com. Checking your tire pressure
has never been this much fun. Perhaps it's the novelty of hearing a
woman's voice announcing just how inflated or deflated your tires
are. Best of all, if you need to check your wheels after dark,
there's no worrying about making out a tiny arrow pointing to some
microscopic print.</TE>
<TE>   Digi Pen 2: $99.95, the Sharper Image stores (multiple locations)
or (800) 344-4444 or www.sharperimage.com. Despite the name, this
sleek item is not a writing instrument but a pen-size digital camera.
Very James Bond. It stores up to 400 color pictures, features flash
memory and can even record video clips of up to 120 seconds. Takes up
minimal purse space and, at just under 2 ounces, won't weigh you
down.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Homebodies</TE>
<TE>   F.R. Industry pillows: $25, Fiesta Specialties, 12401 Ventura
Blvd., Studio City, (818) 752-7200. Inspired by vintage neon signs,
matchbook covers and the like, these rhinestone-embellished pillows,
available in dozens of designs, add a sense of fun and lightness to
any room.</TE>
<TE>   Black and red lacquer vases: $30, Sabi, 8606 Melrose Ave., Los
Angeles, (310) 659-9838. These elegant, understated vases are equally
at home in the dining room and the powder room. Each one holds a
single stem, perhaps an orchid.</TE>
<TE>   Cashmere throw: $385, Red Envelope, (877) 733-3683 or
www.redenvelope.com. We always thought cashmere socks were the
ultimate indulgence, until we saw this 5-by-6-foot throw, available
in lavender, taupe or wine. This is the perfect something for wannabe
princesses and princes alike, as well as shameless hedonists.
Monogramming is available but then it won't arrive before Christmas.</TE>

<HD>When teachers give and their students reciprocate</HD>
<DH>Pupils think and think, trying to come up with ways to
thank their educators. Some of the surprising choices can linger with
an instructor for years to come.</DH>

<LD>Lexi Derrickson, a Bethesda, Md., third-grader, labored for hours
over her teacher's Christmas present this year. Cookies made from all
the good stuff -- flour, sugar, butter, chocolate chips, peanut
butter and almonds -- aren't that easy to stir, she discovered,
especially if you're staying with your dad on weekends and he doesn't
have "one of those blender things."</LD>
<LD>   What will Kirsten Crabtree, her teacher at Wood Acres Elementary,
think about her gift? Lexi has worried about this for days. "I know
she'll like the cookies. Well, actually, I'm not sure. I think she
will like them." Her round face turns somber.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, the anticipation -- and agony -- of baking, sewing, painting
or buying a Christmas present for your teacher. Shaping candy cane
ornaments out of flour, sugar and salt, snowmen out of buttons,
reindeer out of pipe cleaners. Or standing in the shopping mall
before endless shelves of bath products, completely overwhelmed by
the sheer variety of soaps, oils and powders.</LD>
<TE>   What if your reindeer ends up looking like a dog? Does your
teacher prefer the scent of lavender or rose? What if that rich girl
in the front row, the one whose scrunchies always match her sweater
and socks, gives the teacher a day at the spa? The $5 mug you bought
with your own money is going to seem mighty puny compared with that.</TE>
<TE>   Not to worry, teachers say.</TE>
<TE>   Years after students depart from their classrooms, the presents
teachers remember most are those that came from the children
themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Ruth Neikirk, a retired sixth-grade teacher, has a house in
Arlington, Va., full of such items that she brings out during the
Christmas season: a little angel needlepointed 20 years ago by a boy
named Tom; a china shoe from a boy named Tucker four years ago; a
holiday banner of felt glued together by a girl named Caitlin who's
now a freshman at the University of Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   During her 27 years of teaching, Neikirk made a point of writing
on each Christmas gift the name of the giver and the year. "I like
having my students all around me," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Ginny Berkey, a middle-school teacher in Eugene, Ore., was
surprised one December to find a white Easter mug on her desk with
the saying, "Never count your chicks before they hatch." The class
had just spent four days discussing American proverbs.</TE>
<TE>   The first year Alisha Colyer, a health instructor in a middle
school near Columbus, Ohio, was teaching, she allowed a student
having trouble at home to come to her room early in the morning to
work in peace. "Last Christmas he brought me a bag filled with
wonderful things," she says. "My favorite Pop-Tarts, a Dr Pepper,
some notebook paper and pencils" like the ones he was always
borrowing from her.</TE>
<TE>   The item that really got to her was a towel.</TE>
<TE>   "You are forever taking care of me and helping to clean up my
messes," he wrote in a note that accompanied his gift. "The next time
you use the towel remember I appreciate everything you do for me!"</TE>
<TE>   So many teachers and so many stories about kids who could have
been written off but weren't: The Michigan girl who thanked her
teacher in a card for treating her the same as the popular girls; the
Florida girl, previously a slow reader, who was grateful for being
encouraged to read great books; the boy from east Tennessee whose
stained hands handed his teacher a sack of black walnuts; the
emotionally disturbed boy in Oregon, continually underfoot in
homeroom, who presented his homeroom teacher with a light-blue resin
moose, whispering in her ear that he had paid for it with "$2 of my
own money."</TE>
<TE>   Ellen Berg, a middle-school teacher in St. Louis, keeps a cheap
plastic jewelry box in her home as a reminder, she says, "to keep
trying even when it seems all is lost."</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Kennedy, a mischievous kid with whom she'd had her share of
battles, gave her the box two years ago, wrapped in newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought it to me while everybody was working," she recalls.
"He sat and watched. I could tell it was important that I like it."
Their relationship improved over time and so did Rodney's schoolwork.</TE>
<TE>   The next year on a Sunday morning, Rodney died after being hit by
a car the previous night.</TE>
<TE>   In the days that followed, Berg hammered herself with questions.
Had she treated Rodney respectfully? Had he felt safe in her
classroom? The jewelry box suggested to her that she had and he did.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes boosts come years after a student has graduated.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Reynolds had been teaching middle and high school in
Lansing, Mich., for 10 years when she got a phone call a couple of
days before Christmas from a former student, by then in her early
20s. The young woman asked Reynolds to a holiday dinner, and when
Reynolds arrived, about 70 people had gathered to tell her thank you,
many of them former students.</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds was stunned because most of these guests had been labeled
the "burnouts" at school all those years ago. As they toasted their
favorite teacher, they filled Reynolds in on the good lives they now
led as autoworkers, lawyers, doctors, mothers and fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "In teaching, we don't always receive immediate gratification or
even an occasional thank-you," Reynolds says. "But times like this
particular evening make it very worthwhile for me."</TE>
<TE>   Lexi Derrickson need not have worried about Crabtree's reaction to
her present, which was accompanied by a piece of white typing paper,
folded exactly in half, on which Lexi had sketched a manger scene.</TE>
<TE>   "Are these angels on the card? I love homemade cards!" Crabtree
gushed with the signature enthusiasm of young teachers. Then she
popped off the Tupperware container's top.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you say these cookies have peanut butter in them? I love
peanut butter!"</TE>
<TE>   Would that we all had a third-grade teacher to give gifts to at
Christmas.</TE>
