<LD>"Ice Age," an animated tale set in prehistoric times about a
saber-toothed tiger, a sloth and a wooly mammoth who team up to
return a human baby to his parents, easily froze out the competition
by debuting with $46.3 million--the best March opening of any film
and the third-best animated opening ever behind "Monsters, Inc." and
"Toy Story 2."</LD>
<LD>   Drawing audiences of all ages, the film was a boost for animation
at 20th Century Fox, which has experienced lackluster results in the
past with "Anastasia" and "Titan A.E."</LD>
<LD>   Horror fans turned out for "Resident Evil," resulting in $17.7
million and a second-place opening. The Eddie Murphy-Robert De Niro
cop comedy "Showtime" opened with $15 million for third place.</LD>

<HD>Arditti Quartet Goes Time-Traveling</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Compelling programs performed splendidly are what we now expect from
the 28-year-old Arditti Quartet, a regular visitor to local concert
venues. The British-based ensemble--violinists Irvine Arditti and
Graeme Jennings, violist Dov Scheindlin and cellist Rohan de
Saram--returned Sunday afternoon, this time to the Coleman Concerts
in Pasadena, and delivered a thrilling program, exquisitely played.</LD>
<LD>   The agenda moved backward in time, from the recent, thorny "Sequi"
by Australian composer Mary Finsterer, who was born in 1962, to
Arnold Schoenberg's early, and tonal Quartet No. 1 (1904-05).
Connecting the two ends were works by Gyorgy Kurtag and Gyorgy
Ligeti.</LD>
<LD>   Finsterer's difficult, 11-minute piece--it replaced the originally
programmed new work by Magnus Lindberg, which was not completed in
time for the current tour--seized attention and caused irritation
with a lengthy series of buzzing motifs punctuated by pizzicato riffs
and occasional silences. None of it seemed to make any sense--then it
ended.</LD>
<TE>   Still, "Sequi" proved a perfect contrast to the comparably mellow,
equally fervent Schoenberg essay, a post-Romantic, Mahlerian work
that ends with an apparent hommage to Richard Strauss.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtag's "Officium breve in memoriam Andreae Szervanszky"
fascinates through 15 extremely short and moody vignettes that range
from the thoughtful to the melancholy, the wispy, the argumentative
and the conversational in about 13 minutes. The result is completely
engrossing.</TE>
<TE>   Ligeti's Quartet No. 2, which the ensemble played on a previous
visit here, is almost equally brief but somewhat more expansive. As
usual, Ligeti expresses much, and always effectively, but in compact
musical gestures.</TE>
<TE>   This is a work of many contrasts, textures, tempos and broad
dynamics. The program annotator, Priscilla Pawlicki, had it right
when she described it as "spellbinding in its mix of emotion and
intellect."</TE>

<LD>For most Hollywood directors, doing DVD commentaries is one of the
great perks of the job. After all, how often do you get, in effect,
to direct your movie a second time, guiding the audience through all
the clever authorial touches they might have missed without the
captain of the cinematic ship at the tiller, whispering in their
ears?</LD>
<LD>   But when the famously contrarian Robert Altman arrived at a Sony
Pictures studio recently to record his commentary for the DVD of his
Oscar-nominated "Gosford Park," he had the grim air of a man slipping
into the dentist's chair.</LD>
<LD>   You wouldn't know that the Academy Awards were just weeks away and
that Altman's movie had seven nominations, including one for best
picture and another for best director, the fifth of his career. If
Altman was excited, he wasn't letting it show. "I've never been
satisfied by any of these DVDs," he says, glumly taking a seat in
front of a microphone. "I feel like a real estate agent, trying to
tout some fancy house. I always end up saying, 'Oh, here's a nice
hallway, there's the bathroom, and there's a bedroom with a wonderful
view.'"</LD>
<TE>   He leans over and whispers conspiratorially, "But if I don't do
it, I'll just get labeled a curmudgeon, which would be bad, wouldn't
it?"</TE>
<TE>   At 77, in an era when the movie industry has been overrun by
careerists in search of their next franchise film, Altman is an
irresistible throwback to a better day: He's Hollywood's Grumpy Old
Master. Like John Huston or Akira Kurosawa, he's one of the few great
directors who has made films in his old age that are just as vital
and uncompromising as anything he did in his youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Bob's got the eyes of a 30-year-old," says screenwriter Anne
Rapp, who wrote two recent Altman films, "Cookie's Fortune" (1999)
and "Dr. T &amp; the Women" (2000). "When Bob got famous, he didn't start
living behind a big gate--he's stayed down in the fray. Bob's office
is always full of people. When it's not crowded, he sticks his head
out and says, 'Where is everybody?'"</TE>
<TE>   What really makes Altman's career path so extraordinary is that
he's perhaps the only modern-day director who's been able to work
regularly--and without interference--outside the major studio system.
Most senior citizen directors, if lucky enough to be employed, have
begun to repeat themselves or lost their connection with the pop
culture of the moment. But Altman, who became a star in 1970 with
"MASH," hasn't lost a step. Since he turned 65 in 1990, he's made
nine movies as well as several TV projects.</TE>
<TE>   His artistic vigor is an inspiring lesson for young, independent
directors, showing that it's possible to flourish outside the
increasingly insular Hollywood machinery. As Rapp puts it: "Bob's
like a farmer--he's out there planting a new crop every spring."</TE>
<TE>   Altman remains in vogue because he has the restless artistic
instincts of a Young Turk, not an Old Master. Altman abhors
predictability. Whether it's a British murder mystery like "Gosford
Park," a Southern Gothic comedy like "Cookie's Fortune," a Hollywood
satire like "The Player" (1992) or a meditation on artistry (and a
model of how to avoid the pitfalls of the biopic) like "Vincent and
Theo" (1990), he's always exploring new genres and experimenting with
new techniques. Altman is one of those artists--like Bob Dylan or
Picasso or Miles Davis--who've retained their youthful intensity long
after their contemporaries have become parodies of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like Bob has created a new genre--the Robert Altman film,"
says his agent, ICM's Ken Kamins, who has played a key role in
helping Altman stay in the game. "If you want a film with a
left-of-center story, a fresh visual approach and a great ensemble
cast who'll work on the cheap, then you want Bob. He operates on pure
artistic instinct. His approach to each film is basically the same:
What story do I think is interesting, and what actors do I want to
work with?"</TE>
<TE>   Altman hasn't made a film financed by a major studio since "O.C.
and Stiggs," a stinker he made at MGM in 1983 that sat on the shelf
for four years before being released. He spent much of the '80s
reviving his career by doing theatrical adaptations until he hit pay
dirt again in 1992 with "The Player," which brought him a new
generation of fans and actors eager to be in his films. Even after
reviving his career, he's steered clear of the big studio machines.
("Gosford Park" was released by USA Films). "They sell shoes, and I
make gloves," he says. "Basically, we're not in the same business.
But I've been lucky. I've never done a film that wasn't of my own
choosing or successfully taken away from me. You'll never see a DVD
of stuff anyone cut out of my films, because it hasn't happened."</TE>
<TE>   'A Short Fuse and a Big Mouth'</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean the prickly director hasn't had his share of
tiffs and showdowns. He admits there have been times when "I didn't
handle success very well and was completely arrogant."</TE>
<TE>   He sued Miramax in 1995 in a dispute over the company's refusal to
pay him a box-office bonus for the film "Ready to Wear." In 1997 he
attacked Fine Line Pictures for not running Oscar ads for several
cast members in Altman's film "Kansas City"; Altman ended up
personally spending $18,000 to send out videocassettes to academy
members. When PolyGram tried to re-cut "The Gingerbread Man" that
same year after a bad screening, Altman publicly threatened to take
his name off the movie, forcing the company to back off.</TE>
<TE>   As Altman puts it: "I've got a short fuse and a big mouth." Asked
about George W. Bush earlier this year, the director called the
president "embarrassing," adding, "I'm proud to say Bush has never
seen any of my films." When a reporter recently asked if Altman had
seen many recent Oscar-winning films, he replied, "I thought
'Titanic' was the most dreadful piece of work I've ever seen in my
entire life."</TE>
<TE>   Altman has flourished without studio support because he's beloved
by actors, who flock to his films, knowing he will put them at ease.
At the end of each day on "Gosford Park," Altman would serve drinks
as the actors watched dailies. Before he even had a finished script,
Altman went to London and lined up most of the actors he cast in
"Gosford Park," describing their parts to them over coffee or lunch.
The all-star ensemble, which included Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren
(both nominated for supporting actress Oscars), Alan Bates, Emily
Watson and Kristin Scott Thomas, had all agreed to work for scale
even before Kamins began to approach any financiers.</TE>
<TE>   Because Altman's films have a modest profit potential, the
director has often had to scramble for funding. Even though "Gosford
Park" is the third-biggest moneymaker of his career, after "MASH" and
"Popeye" (1980), (it's grossed just over $35 million so far), Altman
says he still hasn't found a backer for his next project, "Voltage,"
an Alan Rudolph-scripted ensemble film about the construction of a
New York skyscraper. Altman is holding out for a budget of roughly
$20 million, but so far, no one has been willing to go above $15
million.</TE>
<TE>   "I assumed with all the accolades coming in that I could make the
film," he says. "But nobody is interested [at the budget I need] and
I had to release all the actors and come back with my tail between my
legs."</TE>
<TE>   But history is on his side. Altman's films, even the ones that
initially flopped, like "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" (1971) and "The Long
Goodbye" (1973), have aged better than their more conventional peers,
perhaps because Altman has never catered to the popular taste of the
moment. His movies are too idiosyncratic to be reduced to a
commercial formula. With "Short Cuts," a film made from a collection
of Raymond Carver short stories, Altman put the stories on flashcards
and shuffled them around so the characters all ended up in different
places.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're adapting something, you can't present it in its pure
form, because it exists differently in each person's mind," he says.
Altman's best films take a familiar genre and give it a surprise
twist. "The critics get upset, because they see it as sacrilegious,"
he says. "But that's what works for me, taking something that exists
and playing around it so the film goes in a direction you'd never
expect."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it's this unpredictability that has kept Altman's artistry
from going stale. When I ask him about the value of experience, he
scoffs, saying white-haired wisdom is overrated. "Knowing your craft
is great, but if you get too good at the mechanics, you lose the
artistry," he explains. "I like young directors like Paul Thomas
Anderson and Wes Anderson because they're all over the place--they
haven't learned to polish their films too much. They keep things that
everyone else would've wanted them to cut, but those are the things
that make their films great."</TE>
<TE>   Altman has a serene self-knowledge--he knows the light at the end
of the tunnel is growing brighter. But he doesn't feel his age.
Altman recalls a conversation he had with one of his uncles, then in
his 60s. "Pointing to his heart, he said, 'In here, I'm 32. And I'm
shocked when people look at me and don't see it.' And I feel the same
way whenever I pass a mirror or see a photo of myself. Inside your
head, you don't get older, not when you're doing something you love."</TE>

<LD>At one point during Sonic Youth's set, which closed the All
Tomorrow's Parties festival at UCLA's Ackerman Grand Ballroom on
Sunday, strobe-light shadows of the amps on a screen behind the stage
resembled the pre-Sept. 11 New York skyline.</LD>
<LD>   Later, as the New York band--which curated the wide-ranging,
four-day festival--engaged in a signature noise excursion to conclude
a song, the cacophony seemed to echo emergency alarms and the
scraping of collapsing metal.</LD>
<LD>   Those may have been accidental allusions. But there was no
mistaking the impact of the World Trade Center attacks on the new
songs that made up the bulk of the influential outfit's 90-minute
performance.</LD>
<TE>   Specific references were but shadows and shards in the lyrics.
Little this band has done in its 20-year career has ever been prosaic
or explicit. Yet proximity to the tragedy seems to have given the
group new clarity, focus and grounding.</TE>
<TE>   Songs premiered Sunday--ranging from guitarist Thurston Moore's
"Disconnection Notes," about displacement, to the punk-toned "Plastic
Sun," sung by bassist Kim Gordon-- were marked by a new sense of
directness of emotion and even warmth. And the noise/atmosphere
passages contained a new sense of beauty and increased nuance and
control, without losing any of the sense of adventure that has been
integral to the band's music. Where much WTC-related art has been
saccharine or hokey, the sound sculptures Sonic Youth created Sunday
were both haunting and exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   As curators, the group members had assured that the rest of
Sunday's closing concert would have the same sense of purpose.
There's little fault to find in Sonic Youth's bookings for All
Tomorrow's Parties--an eclectic array of often challenging acts,
which on Sunday ranged from the feedback manipulation of Australian
trio Dead C to the sexually provocative, low-tech performance art of
Peaches.</TE>
<TE>   But for the most part, the acts simply played their usual sets and
gave little air of occasion to their appearances. No one in an event
like this should do anything expected, but should rise to the
occasion and present something unique.</TE>
<TE>   One thread that did run through some of the day was a sort of
ad-hoc reunion of artists associated with SST Records, the Los
Angeles label that was at the forefront of the pre-Nirvana
alternative rock movement. It was Sonic Youth's home through most of
the '80s, and the band brought fellow SST alums Saccharine Trust and
Mike Watt onto the bill.</TE>
<TE>   The former, re-formed five years ago by founding singer Jack
Brewer and guitarist Joe Baiza, pushed forward its high-precision,
edge-skirting mesh of neo-Beat poetry and angular, jazz-rooted music.</TE>
<TE>   Bassist Watt paid tribute to punk progenitors with a spirited
series of songs originated by such acts as the Velvet Underground,
Wire, Television and Watt's own former band the Minutemen.</TE>
<TE>   The best set Sunday other than Sonic Youth's, though, may have
been from Peaches. While her willfully semiprofessional, sexually
frank hip-hop persona is entertaining in itself, the show
incorporated cartoonish art "performed" live by Shary Boyle on an
overhead projector, often incorporating the live, posing Peaches into
the art on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe next year they could try an entire evening of overhead
projector art--anything to transcend the hodgepodge nature of the
festival.</TE>

<HD>'Andy Richter' Delivers Witty Observations</HD>

<LD>Fox giveth and taketh.</LD>
<LD>   Tonight the network grants viewers the premiere of "Andy Richter
Controls the Universe," a sneaky funny workplace comedy starring the
soft pillow of a comic who spent seven years as late-nighter Conan
O'Brien's sidekick on NBC. Unfortunately, it replaces "Undeclared," a
sneaky funny college-campus comedy that has ended its first season
prematurely and is expected to be canceled because of thin ratings.</LD>
<LD>   Too bad, for it deserves long life. Yet one sneaky funny is better
than none.</LD>
<TE>   Richter is a straight-faced clown who gives blobs a good name in
this series created by Victor Fresco. As a writer of industrial
manuals who narrates his life here, he's someone who controls his own
universe only in Walter Mitty daydreams that have him getting the
beautiful girl he probably will never get in real life. Heading that
list is Wendy the office receptionist (Irene Molloy).</TE>
<TE>   His other co-workers are Jessica the boss (Paget Brewster), Keith
the hunk (James Patrick Stuart) and Byron the illustrator (Jonathan
Slavin), a sad-sack, tied-in-knots neurotic who in a coming episode
has a session with a grief counselor that turns out to be lethal ...
for her.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you know what it's like to kill someone with your pain?" he
says with a groan. "It hurts."</TE>
<TE>   That brand of unforced, sly humor typifies early episodes of this
series, along with brotherly Andy's self-effacing comments about
Keith and others with good looks getting all the breaks in life. "I'm
a bigot," he acknowledges tonight. "I assume things about the
attractive I shouldn't."</TE>
<TE>   The writing is witty, Andy's fantasies creative and the good cast
in tune with the urbane material. And as a bonus, no irritating laugh
track, meaning viewers must decide for themselves when to guffaw.
It's a crushing burden, but somehow you'll be up to it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Richter Controls the Universe" premieres tonight at 8:30 on
Fox. The network has rated it TV-PG (may be unsuitable for young
children).</TE>

<DH>The actors have a tough time rising above 'The Blue Room's'
surprisingly shallow exploration of sexual themes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes a play about sex is just a play about sex. Case in point:
David Hare's "The Blue Room," which caused a stir on both sides of
the Atlantic several years ago, mostly because of the marquee status
it accorded Nicole Kidman's bare bum.</LD>
<LD>   But, at least in the L.A. premiere production that's vamping
around the Pasadena Playhouse these days, "The Blue Room" offers
little to get hot and bothered about, unless perhaps you're a male
reviewer on the far side of adolescence ("Pure theatrical Viagra,"
one London critic labeled it). What makes "The Blue Room"
disappointing, finally, isn't that its mix-and-match fornications
lack heat, but that its conception lacks freshness and specificity,
and its dialogue is surprisingly short on wit and dramatic punch.
"The Blue Room" scores a few rounds below the belt, but it's pretty
much dead above the waist.</LD>
<LD>   That's a pity, because the play's theatrical pedigree held
lip-smacking possibilities. Based on a series of sexually themed
sketches by fin de siecle Viennese scribe Arthur Schnitzler, and
adapted by Max Ophuls as the landmark 1950 film "La Ronde," Hare's
sort-of-updated version probes the nature of male-female relations in
a shadowy dreamscape of modern urban anomie.</LD>
<TE>   Among the most humane, intelligent and politically astute of
contemporary English-speaking playwrights, Hare would seem to have
been the ideal man for the job. In previous works such as "Plenty"
and the superb "Skylight," he has demonstrated an unusual capacity to
write gripping character dramas that embody deeper social, and even
moral, conflicts.</TE>
<TE>   But while the 10 characters in "The Blue Room," played by just two
quick-changing actors, Arabella Field and Lenny Von Dohlen, offer an
occasional peek at psychological depth, they remain stubbornly
two-dimensional and archetypal, and the performers seldom manage to
rise above the shallow material they've been given. Neither does
David Schweizer's aggressively stylized direction bring emotional
credibility to a play that badly needs it, if the audience is to feel
something more than a kind of smirky, detached superiority.</TE>
<TE>   Conveying a suitably claustrophobic feel, the 90-minute
intermissionless production unspools against Christopher Acebo's boxy
set design, an all-purpose, three-walled configuration where
furniture (mostly beds and other horizontal devices) slithers on and
off, and Geoff Korf's noir-ish lighting bathes the various couplings
in melancholy tones. The set's most expressive feature, at stage left
and right, are his and hers changing rooms, where the actors
disappear between scenes while donning new clothes and assuming new
characters as casually as they swap lovers.</TE>
<TE>   Following Schnitzler's original concept, "The Blue Room" observes
a round-robin string of affairs involving a more or less
interchangeable cast of people from all walks of life. A cabdriver
couples with a young girl, then seduces a ditsy au pair in the back
room of a nightclub. The au pair then has a quickie with a young
student, who implausibly shambles around in short pants and bites his
fingernails. The student beds down a conservative Dixie politician's
wife. The politician subsequently cuts loose with a 17-year-old
model, who's fallen under the spell of a pompous playwright. And so
on.</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing the adversarial, even brutal nature of these erotic
encounters, each scene is punctuated by a clanging bell, like the
rounds of a boxing match. Above the stage, a screen flashes the
elapsed time, from a shameful "0 Seconds" to a Kama Sutran two hours,
20 minutes. By invoking these theatrical tropes, "The Blue Room"
seeks to equate sexual activity with performance, as lovers project
their delusional needs and wishes onto each other. "Are you acting?"
the playwright pointedly asks his actress paramour in one of the
sharpest written and best realized scenes, a verbal jousting match
that suggests a post-Playboy version of Noel Coward's "Private
Lives."</TE>
<TE>   The sophisticated satirical sensibility of this scene, and another
involving the playwright and the young model (which includes the
production's longest stretch of sustained nudity) contrasts sharply
with the shrill, almost farcical antics of the earlier vignettes. And
Field and Von Dohlen bring a sublime comic pathos to the drug-addled
interlude between the hypocritical politician and the young model.
But in the majority of scenes, the production opts for a type of
over-the-top, pret-a-porter attitudinizing that reduces the
characters to cutouts.</TE>
<TE>   More crucially, what's missing from these mostly joyless gropings
is a contemporary social backdrop that would lend relevance to an
essentially turn-of-the-century scenario. Schnitzler's implication
was that all this frenzied libidinal activity constituted a form of
political subversion, that sex, along with its ugly handmaiden,
venereal disease, had become the great leveler in society. He was
concerned with what his contemporary and admirer Sigmund Freud
identified as the struggle between eros and thanatos, the sexual urge
and the death wish, as it played out between lovers and within
cultures.</TE>
<TE>   What "The Blue Room" really could use is an id, a subtext that
would make what was scandalous and prescient in 1900 seem equally
provocative in 2002. By choosing to emphasize the universality of
sexual betrayal and bad faith, "The Blue Room" casts itself adrift in
time and place. The grab bag of American and British accents, and the
periodic "thunk!" of dated references, like the aristocratic
stage-door Johnnie in the penultimate scene, heightens the sense that
neither the playwright nor the production has a strong sense of where
it's supposed to be.</TE>
<TE>   You can't really blame "The Blue Room" for wanting to have its
cigar and smoke it too, to be timeless but timely, topical yet
titillating. Who'd have thought those desires, and a playwright of
passionate ability, could produce a work of such full-frontal
tameness?</TE>

<HD>Oscar Ticket Crunch Hits Particularly Hard</HD>
<DH>Awards* High demand for seats at the new Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood leaves about 275 academy members out in the cold.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Approximately 275 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences will not be having a Kodak Theatre moment this year because
the move of the Academy Awards into the new venue has caused an
enormous ticket crunch.</LD>
<LD>   According to academy executive director Bruce Davis, allocating
tickets to academy members "is never a fun part of the job." But
things are worse this year because the academy members have a "real
interest" in the new venue.</LD>
<LD>   "We have had more members request tickets than we have had in the
past," Davis said. "That has been a problem."</LD>
<TE>   The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion could seat nearly 2,700 people for
the Academy Awards; the Shrine had a capacity for 5,600 guests. The
academy, though, would leave the top of the expansive balcony empty,
thus eliminating 1,600 seats. The Kodak Theatre at the Hollywood &amp;
Highland complex seats 3,300, but the number for the Academy Awards
has been reduced by 200 because of special requirements for the TV
broadcast of the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, the nominees, presenters, sponsors, members of the
academy's board of governors and "lots of other basic constituents"
each receive a pair of free tickets. "The studios also have a modest
block of seats that is expanded a little depending on how many
nominations they have," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Seats that are left over go to academy members, who pay anything
from $50 to $350 apiece for tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Davis said the academy worked with the architects to get the
maximum number of seats in the theater. "But it was a finite space,"
Davis said. "There are more than 3,300 seats, but we still have to
strike a few of those. We have always known the first two rows [in
the orchestra] would go because the stairs go up to the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the whole thrusts of the design was to have that central
camera position in the middle of the orchestra not obscure the seats
behind it. We think we have pretty much accomplished that, but we did
have to kill a row in front of [the camera]. That wasn't supposed to
happen. They were afraid that during a standing ovation, if people
stood up they cover the TelePrompTer in front of that camera."</TE>
<TE>   Whenever the demand outweighs the supply of tickets, the academy
holds a lottery. "We put the names in a kind of drum," Davis said.
"The scary thing was when we had drawn out as many this year as we
could accommodate, the drum was still very full. We looked at each
other and said, 'Oh, my Lord.' We try to exempt them from the lottery
in the subsequent year, but that is a lot of people. And next year is
our 75th anniversary, so it's not going to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Still, academy members think a simple phone call will get them a
ticket.</TE>
<TE>   "Unconsciously, people sort of equate the Academy Awards with the
Super Bowl," Davis said. "They think if they make enough calls there
are going to be tickets around somewhere. The Super Bowl has around
100,000 tickets and we have around 3,000, and you just hit a
point--which we hit a couple of weeks ago--where there are simply no
tickets. To say 'yes' to anybody [for tickets now], somebody has to
call in and say, 'I won't be able to use the ones you promised me.'
That does happen. People are very good about letting us know if they
are not going to be able to use their tickets."</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't the case in the 1980s. "Fifteen years ago, there
was a fairly thriving black market," said Davis, adding that academy
members and members of the press would often scalp their tickets.
"They would be sold openly and offered in newspapers," Davis said.
"We really cracked down on it starting about a dozen years ago. It
was a tremendous hole in our security net. You didn't know who was in
the room. In the era of celebrity stalkers, it was a danger all the
time."</TE>
<TE>   None of the national ticket brokers will trade in Oscar tickets.
"None of the concierges in hotels will attempt to get tickets for
guests," Davis said. "Maybe even more importantly, the L.A. Times and
trade papers and [other] respectable papers have agreed to respect
this as a private event. They will not carry ads offering either to
sell or buy tickets."</TE>
<TE>   Plus, Davis said, members must sign at three points that they are
going to use the tickets personally. "If a member violates that
[agreement]," Davis said, "they are really putting their fellow
members in danger, and the board will expel them from the
organization."</TE>

<LD>   Maher Says His Show's Days Are Numbered</LD>
<LD>   "Politically Incorrect" host Bill Maher says he has known since
September that the late-night show's "days were numbered" at ABC, and
that, with news available now around the clock, the show that
precedes his, "Nightline," has become expendable.</LD>
<TE>   Maher, who has stayed mostly silent since it was learned that ABC
was pursuing David Letterman--a move that, had it succeeded, would
have displaced "Nightline" and "Politically Incorrect"--is in Seattle
as part of a live tour. He told the Seattle Times that "Nightline"
anchor Ted Koppel has always been unwilling to promote "Politically
Incorrect," but that what is "a little galling" is that after six
years of being told that Koppel was above such concerns, "suddenly,
he's not a sacred cow. He's a slaughtered cow."</TE>
<TE>   Since Letterman decided last week to remain at CBS, ABC has
expressed support for "Nightline" but has made no comment about the
future of "Politically Incorrect," which lost advertisers and some
ABC affiliate coverage in the fall after Maher criticized America's
approach to foreign policy before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Maher reiterated in the interview that his use of the word
"cowardly" to describe U.S. policy has been distorted. He also
acknowledged that he is considering a radio show, saying that he
speaks his mind and that "the best place for that may be radio."</TE>
<TE>   MOVIES</TE>
<TE>   New Movie Awards for the Over-50 Audience</TE>
<TE>   You've heard of the Palme d'Or, the top prize at Cannes. Now comes
the "Chaise d'Or," honoring the best of the silver screen for the
silver-haired.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the glut of film awards, Modern Maturity magazine is offering
the "Best Movies for Grown-Ups"--or, more specifically, for the
publication's over-50 audience.</TE>
<TE>   Its pick for best film last year: "Lantana," which "stands out as
a moral fable in which betrayal has consequences, integrity is
rewarded and we all learn that day-to-day decisions can bless or
bedevil us at any age."</TE>
<TE>   "Under the Sand" was deemed best foreign film for being "about
reaching an age where you realize life's most nagging questions might
never be answered." And as "best movie for grown-ups who refuse to
grow up": "Shrek."</TE>
<TE>   ENTERTAINMENT</TE>
<TE>   Barbie's 'Rapunzel' Set; Is There a Role for Ken?</TE>
<TE>   Barbie has been bitten by the acting bug. After starring last year
in her first movie, the straight-to-video "Barbie in the Nutcracker,"
the famous doll has announced her next project: a remake of the
classic fairy tale "Rapunzel." The computer-animated project is due
for release in October.</TE>
<TE>   Entertainment Industry in India Is Thriving</TE>
<TE>   Revenues in India's entertainment industry rose 30% in 2001, seven
times faster than the economy as a whole, the BBC reports.</TE>
<TE>   Citing figures released at a conference in Mumbai, the BBC
reported that income from film, television, music, radio and live
entertainment totaled about $2.7 billion last year.</TE>
<TE>   The country's economic growth was cited as the biggest reason for
the entertainment boom, which is predicted to continue--doubling
again in the next five years. The film industry produced more than
1,000 films last year and should be growing as new government
measures to stimulate investment in that area take effect.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Yoko Ono has purchased the Liverpool home of her late husband,
John Lennon--the place where he lived with his Aunt Mimi and where
the Quarry Men and the Beatles rehearsed--and is donating it to the
British National Trust.... Fresh from finishing his Tony
Award-winning run in "The Producers" on Broadway, Nathan Lane will be
a presenter at the Academy Awards on Sunday.... Singer-songwriter
Kristyn Osborn of the country group Shedaisy has filed for divorce,
her attorney said. She's been married to Joel Stevenett since
1994.... The "Down From the Mountain" tour, featuring music and
performers from the movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?," will return
to the Southland this summer, July 31 at the Coors Amphitheater in
San Diego, Aug. 1 at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and Aug. 2 at
the Santa Barbara Bowl.</TE>

<LD>Mixing gentle, blue-eyed soul with quiet pop and touches of weird,
spacey guitar, Nashville group Lambchop caught a Knitting Factory
audience in a delicate net of intimate ruminations on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Often tagged as alt-country, the band is the brainchild of
singer-songwriter-guitarist Kurt Wagner, who has actually blended
together not just country and folk but also elements of R&amp;B, jazz,
orchestrated pop and high concept in six albums over the past eight
years. Sunday's 90-minute show drew largely from the new "Is a
Woman," a more restrained and delicate collection in which Wagner
aims to sustain a single mood without lapsing into tedium.</LD>
<LD>   Wagner and his quintet of piano, guitars, bass and drums carefully
translated the album's reserved instrumentation and emotional
intimacy to the stage. The performance easily could have been
monochromatic but instead drew listeners in with delicately woven
sonic tapestries laid over Wagner's solitary and vividly confessional
musings on death, obsession, true devotion and self-understanding.</LD>
<TE>   The painfully sincere, however, was tempered by the fairly
surreal. Sitting in his trucker's cap and glasses, sing-speaking in a
matter-of-fact baritone, Wagner came across more a blue-collar Mr.
Rogers than a world-weary crooner. Where the music was beautiful and
poignant, his dry wit offered some laughs, and his sometimes crude
way of putting things provided another odd twist that made Lambchop a
strange delight.</TE>

<HD>The Security Rope Will Not Be Velvet</HD>
<DH>The only thing tougher than becoming a movie star will be
trying to see one in person on Sunday. Officials suggest you stay
home and watch TV.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For all you amateur stargazers out there, be forewarned: You're not
invited to Sunday's Oscars program in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   An unprecedented series of security measures involving a small
army of law enforcement officers and private security
guards--including the closing of the MTA subway station underneath
the new Kodak Theatre--will make it next to impossible for the
uninvited to crash the party.</LD>
<LD>   "If people say, 'Hey, let's drive down to Hollywood to see what we
can see,'" says John Pavlik, spokesman for the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences, "they'll just clog traffic. They'll see it
much better on television."</LD>
<TE>   All the security, which includes street closures in the area, has
caused some concern among Hollywood merchants, who had hoped to cash
in from Sunday's big party. But most think the day's headaches will
be brief and hope the longtime effect of the Oscars returning to
Tinseltown will be more visitors and more profits.</TE>
<TE>   It was 1960 when the Oscar ceremony was last in Hollywood, then at
the Pantages Theatre. Although many of the same security precautions
were subsequently carried out at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion
downtown and at the Shrine Auditorium near USC, law enforcement
officials acknowledge that extraordinary security will be enforced on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   For example, looky-loos will no longer be allowed to claim coveted
bleacher seats by camping out days in advance. This year, 500 fans
clamoring for the privilege had to fill out an application form. Then
they underwent background checks by private security personnel hired
by the motion picture academy.</TE>
<TE>   Those who were cleared get to sit in the bleachers.</TE>
<TE>   Another major security measure is the closing all day Sunday of
the MTA Red Line subway stop at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland
Avenue. Academy officials say it's a prudent thing to do.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are quick
to add that the Red Line will be operating as usual on Sunday. The
trains just won't stop at Hollywood and Highland.</TE>
<TE>   The reason for all the security is easy enough to understand,
especially in the wake of September's attacks. But Pavlik notes that
the Oscars have cast an eye toward increased security since the Gulf
War in the early 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the triggering event for us," he says, noting it was
then that metal detectors were first used at the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   This year's venue--a new, glitzy, high-profile facility in an
urban setting--required more thought and precautions than the recent
Oscar shows at the Dorothy Chandler and the Shrine. Those venues
presented few problems because they are located in less congested
spots.</TE>
<TE>   Ranking Los Angeles police commanders and motion picture academy
officials declined to detail their strategic planning for Sunday.
What they will say is that several law enforcement agencies,
including the FBI, have been in close communication to coordinate
their activities at Hollywood and Highland. Some federal agents have
gone as far as taking over rooms at one Hollywood hostel across the
street from the Kodak--affording visitors a good view of Hollywood
and Highland.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk every day," Capt. Mike Downing, commander of LAPD's
Hollywood division, says of the conversations with other law
enforcement agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Downing won't talk about the number of uniformed LAPD officers who
will be on duty as the Oscar envelopes are opened. That's different
from November, when the LAPD said that 1,000 uniformed police
officers would be on duty at the annual Hollywood Christmas parade.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to see an overwhelming strength of police presence
in the area of the Kodak Theatre," Downing said. "If something
happens, we'll have the ability to respond with a lightning-strike
force."</TE>
<TE>   Because of this year's security measures, it has been suggested
that some celebrities won't even show up at the Oscars.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense, says the academy. The major Oscar nominees have said
they'll be there, as well as singer-songwriter Enya and Sting, who
will perform their Oscar-nominated songs.</TE>
<TE>   Business owners in the area aren't happy about some of the
security measures being taken, but most are trying to take the long
view.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to realize that one day of pain is likely to lead to 364
days of gain," says Kerry Morrison, executive director of the
Hollywood Entertainment District of merchants and property owners on
Hollywood Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, Steve Greco doesn't know what he's going to do after
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The supply trucks making their regular delivery of flour, cheese
and other supplies crucial to his business, Greco's New York
Pizzeria, will be stopped far from its location opposite the Kodak
Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the blocking of traffic on the street had reduced
pedestrian flow enough to affect sales. By 11:30 a.m. Monday, he had
only helped one customer, when he usually sees 15 by that time.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole week's going to be messed up," Greco said.</TE>
<TE>   Raubi Sundher, whose family owns the Hollywood Wax Museum and
Guinness World Records Museum, thinks the short-term effect of
closures will be high, but worth the exposure.</TE>
<TE>   "People are getting reaware of Hollywood," he said. "These are
like growing pains."</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to reinvent and reestablish yourself," you need to
make some sacrifices, Sundher said.</TE>

<HD>A Yearning for the Unheard Voices in 'Talking Heads'</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are staged monologues half full or half empty?</LD>
<LD>   While I watched the first two or three of Alan Bennett's "Talking
Heads" monologues at the Tiffany Theaters Sunday, they seemed more
than half full. Speaking directly to the audience, each solo actor
created a character and also told a compelling tale with just a few
simple strokes. The compression was impressive.</LD>
<LD>   As the monologues continued, however, the empty side of the ledger
became apparent. In my unspoken thoughts, I was talking back to the
talking heads: "OK, we've heard your side. Now let's see and hear
directly from the other characters." Sometimes we want to see the
whole play.</LD>
<TE>   Because of their appearances on television, Bennett's "Talking
Heads" are some of the best-known monologues of recent years. Yet
three of the seven that are staged at the Tiffany by Michael Engler
(six opened Saturday and Sunday, and a seventh will be added next
weekend) have never been presented on any stage, even in Bennett's
native England.</TE>
<TE>   Only three of the seven are on any one program. So if you want to
see all seven, you'll have to pay three admission prices. The order
will vary. To find out who's performing on any given night, call the
box office or check the Web site at www.tiffanytheaters.com.</TE>
<TE>   Bennett's prevalent tone toward his characters is warm but amused.
He's fascinated with these peoples' capacity to deceive themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Only one of the six that opened last weekend strays from a wry
fascination into darker territory. In "The Outside Dog," Annette
Bening plays the wife of a slaughterhouse employee. We soon learn
that her husband is suspected of extending his slaughter to human
beings, on dark country roads.</TE>
<TE>   In plain, housewifey clothes and severe makeup, Bening looks less
glamorous than any of the other women in "Talking Heads." She takes
care to let us see how much this woman has repressed over the years.
This was one of the monologues, however, where I felt most keenly the
wish that it could be opened up. Without the woman's husband on
stage, the piece seems clinical, stopping short of frightening. On
Sunday, Bening stumbled over a couple of lines, but she recovered
well.</TE>
<TE>   Brenda Wehle works wonders with "The Hand of God," as an antiques
dealer who thinks she knows how to outfox her customers (think
again). This was the one monologue where I least felt the desire to
see the other characters. True, it also was the first monologue I
saw, but the mordantly sly way in which the story is constructed
helps deter such desires. More details might spoil this one.</TE>
<TE>   Swoosie Kurtz leads us through the most surprising odyssey on the
bill, "A Lady of Letters," about a middle-aged biddy who can't stop
writing hectoring letters to strangers. The left turn that this story
takes is the least realistic as well as the least predictable moment
in all of these monologues, and the necessary costume change
momentarily retards the pacing. But remember that Bennett co-created
the comedy revue "Beyond the Fringe," and take it in that spirit.
Then you'll enjoy Kurtz's masterful transformation from a busybody
into a body that's busy.</TE>
<TE>   Daniel Davis is the only male soloist. In "A Chip in the Sugar,"
he plays a man whose chief occupation is taking care of his
72-year-old mother, interrupted only by occasional sessions of group
therapy. He squirms when a new and aggressive suitor of his mother
appears. The narrative twist is more conventional than those in many
of the other monologues, but the rueful shadows on Davis' long cheeks
and his raised eyebrows enhance this simultaneously glum and funny
situation.</TE>
<TE>   In "Her Big Chance," Valerie Mahaffey portrays an earnestly
cheerful actress who never quite catches on that her big chance is in
an extremely disreputable movie. With L.A. containing its own ranks
of somewhat self-deluded actors, this piece may have more of an edge
here than elsewhere. But the narrative isn't woven together with as
much discipline as the other monologues; Mahaffey meanders.</TE>
<TE>   Kathleen Chalfant plays a vicar's bored and unbelieving wife in
"Bed Among the Lentils." She unleashes her caustic views on us--and
also shacks up with a young Asian grocer. That this was the last of
the monologues I saw may have increased my feeling that the
flesh-and-blood presence of the men characters would have helped.
Chalfant is excellent, but Bennett slights the husband's and even the
grocer's perspectives to the point of condescension.</TE>
<TE>   The seventh monologue, to be added next weekend, will be "Miss
Fozzard Finds Her Feet," starring Tyne Daly. This will be the final
production on the Tiffany's North Stage. The theater is scheduled to
be demolished to make way for a real estate development but may
eventually be rebuilt as part of the new development.</TE>

<HD>Alda Dominates as Science Learns How to Play Ball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT SANDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alan Alda just does it. Tennis. Golf. Basketball. Apnea.</LD>
<LD>   Apnea? That's what the French call the sport of holding one's
breath under water. And Alda does it. For one minute and 45 seconds,
which is pretty good after just a little training but doesn't begin
to compare with the seven minutes the champion breath-holders can
manage.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to science and technology, those times are becoming longer.
And that's where Alda comes in, as host of tonight's "Scientific
American Frontiers" (10 p.m., KCET), an installment of the series
that examines this collaboration of the so-called nerds and jocks.</LD>
<TE>   The show opens at the University of Calgary, where Joan Vickers is
conducting research into where athletes focus their eyes during golf,
hockey, basketball and tennis. She and her team do this by equipping
a player with a helmet that contains a video camera and a device to
track the eye's pupil. In this way, researchers and coaches receive
video of what the athlete sees and precisely where his or her
attention is focused.</TE>
<TE>   Top golfers, for example, putt by looking at the ball, then at the
hole for a second or two, then back at the ball. They keep their eyes
fixed at the spot where the ball is struck, rather than follow the
ball's path to the hole. And when Alda, basically a non-golfer, tries
this "quiet eye" technique, he starts sinking putts like Ben
Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   For the remainder of the hourlong show, Alda looks in on research
into how brain activity relates to golf swings; how baseball umpires
use missile-tracking technology to help them analyze whether a pitch
is a strike; how the sound of a baseball hitting a bat varies and can
indicate to players how to field the ball; and how a French apnea
team applies technology and biology to its sport.</TE>
<TE>   If all this sounds like a lot of Alda, it is. His gee-whiz
reactions sometimes take up so much camera time, especially in the
early portion of the show, that there isn't much left to clearly
explain the science.</TE>

<HD>Radio Days, Yiddish-Style</HD>
<DH>Broadcasting* NPR recalls an era of rhyming news reports,
lively music and emotional tales of assimilation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone knows what Charles A. Lindbergh accomplished in the summer
of 1927. But what about Charles A. Levine?</LD>
<LD>   Who knew that Levine, a self-made millionaire in the junk
business, flew the Atlantic just two weeks after Lindbergh? Who
knew--or, more to the point, even cared--that, too late to sponsor
the first pilot, Levine settled for being the world's first
transatlantic passenger?</LD>
<LD>   The listeners to Yiddish radio, that's who knew. And cared.</LD>
<TE>   As detailed in one segment of National Public Radio's irresistible
"Yiddish Radio Project," Levine's feat gave him celebrity status in
the Yiddish-speaking world. Numerous songs were written about him,
including the delightful "Levine and His Flying Machine," with the
lyrics: "Levine, Levine, just an ordinary name, but you brought it
everlasting fame. We welcome you home from over the foam, Levine and
your flying machine."</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Yiddish-language radio, which thrived in the U.S. from
the mid-1920s through the mid-1950s, was a world all its own, a world
that is visited in loving detail in a 10-part series to be broadcast
as part of "All Things Considered" every Tuesday evening starting
today. Vintage material, some unheard for decades, will be deftly
interwoven with translations read by actors such as Eli Wallach and
Carl Reiner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like opening up King Tut's tomb," co-producer David Isay of
Sound Portraits Productions says of the breadth and surprise of what
the radio segments cover. Co-producer Henry Sapoznik adds, "It's a
parallel universe where stuff was handled so differently. What else
but Yiddish radio would think of rhyming the news?" ("Grammeister"
Zvee Scooler did it for years on New York' s WEVD.) Noting that the
CBS radio network broadcast Yiddish programming nationwide for a
brief period, Sapoznik adds, "I can only imagine what people in Sioux
City, Iowa, thought when [cantor] Yossele Rosenblatt came on the air.
That was the real 'War of the Worlds.'"</TE>
<TE>   Everyone knew about Yiddish radio, especially in cities with large
Jewish populations (24 stations existed at one time or another in New
York City alone, some with power as low as 50 watts.) But no
systematic attempt to collect it was made until Sapoznik, a key
player in the klezmer music revival and at the time working as the
sound archivist for the YIVO Yiddish archive, went to a clearance
sale put on in 1985 by New York radio and television personality Joe
Franklin.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe was being cleared out of his Broadway Danny Rose offices
looking right out over the center of the universe, Times Square,"
Sapoznik remembers. "The place looked like it was decorated in early
Visigoth, it was completely chaotic," so much so that he literally
stumbled on a pile of 30 extra-large, acetate-covered recorded discs,
some made of aluminum, some even of glass.</TE>
<TE>   "They were 16 inches in diameter, so at first blush I thought they
were Vitaphone records made for early sound films, but there were
Jewish words on the label, and though the Warner brothers were
Jewish, they weren't that Jewish."</TE>
<TE>   Sapoznik eventually determined that these were one-of-a-kind air
checks, reference recordings mandated in case the Federal Radio
Commission received any complaints about a given broadcast. Though
many of them had been melted down during World War II scrap metal
drives, Sapoznik over the next 15 years collected some 1,000 discs
containing approximately 500 hours of programming.</TE>
<TE>   One of the rediscoveries he is proudest of are the radio dramas of
Nahum Stutchkoff, whose long-running series "Round the Family Table"
is excerpted on NPR. A polymath who wrote for eight weekly series and
still found time to compile a landmark Yiddish thesaurus, Stutchkoff
specialized in emotionally wrenching tales that often dealt with the
pains of assimilation.</TE>
<TE>   "In Jewish radio," Stutchkoff's son Mischa explains, "we didn't
escape from our problems, we would escape into them." The younger
Stutchkoff remembers frequently seeing his father in tears as he
wrote his scripts. "'If it doesn't make me cry,' he would say, 'my
audience won't cry either.'"</TE>
<TE>   Stutchkoff also wrote mouth-watering commercials for his sponsor,
the Manischewitz matzo company, and that and other ads are featured
prominently on "Yiddish Radio Project." Among Sapoznik's favorites
are a promotion for something called home diathermy, which promised
to cure what ailed you with the aid of radio waves, and, in a
boggling cross-cultural collaboration, a Yiddish musical spot for
celebrated clothier Joe and Paul arranged by Tito Puente.</TE>
<TE>   One of Yiddish radio's longest-running shows, lasting from 1938 to
1955, was the remarkable "Yiddish Melodies in Swing," which succeeded
with its ability to, in Sapoznik's words, "reference both sides of
the aisle." The program's opening, with references to traditional
Yiddish melodies and current hipster slang, shows how it was done:
"They do it to 'Elimelech.' They do it to 'Reb Dovidl.' They even do
it to 'Yidl Mitn Fiddle.' 'Yiddish Melodies in Swing' takes old
Yiddish folk songs and finds the groove to them in merry modern
rhythm." Only in America.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the most emotional of the "Yiddish Radio Project"
episodes concerns "Reunion," a short-lived program that reunited
Holocaust survivors with family members they had not seen and often
assumed were dead. We hear young Siegbert Freiberg reunited with his
father, and we hear him today, age 74, talking about what that
experience was like.</TE>
<TE>   Vital as this project is, Sapoznik found it was not universally
supported. He remembers meeting the late Irving Howe, author of the
definitive study of Eastern European Jews in America, "World of Our
Fathers," and asking him why there was no section on Yiddish radio.</TE>
<TE>   "He looked at me," Sapoznik reports, "like I'd asked about Jewish
circus geeks. It was something he didn't consider important. But this
is like archeology. You can only learn so much if you excavate
palaces and temples. Only in garbage dumps do you find out what
ordinary people were doing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Yiddish Radio Project" can be heard during "All Things
Considered" Tuesdays at 5:30 p.m. on KCRW-FM (89.9), and at 3:30 and
5:30 p.m. on KPCC-FM (89.3). KCRW also is co-sponsoring a live
"Yiddish Radio Project" performance event on April 15 at the Skirball
Cultural Center. The evening will include clips from the series and
music by the Yiddish Radio All Star Band, four of whose members are
age 75 or older.</TE>

<LD>From his corner office on the 50th floor of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers building in downtown Los Angeles, Gregory
Garrison can see to the Pacific Ocean and beyond. By Friday, his view
will reach into the future.</LD>
<LD>   Garrison and fellow accountant Rick Rosas are the only two souls
who will know the outcome of the Oscar race early. Final Oscar
ballots are due in their offices by 5 p.m. today. On Wednesday, they
start counting.</LD>
<LD>   Pricewaterhouse has tallied the Oscar ballots for the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences every year for the last 70 years.
Consequently, it takes its role in this event very seriously. There
is no Oscar betting pool at the office, no "Russell Crowe versus Ben
Kingsley" gossip around the water cooler. And definitely no loose
lips. (Garrison admits that "when I first started doing this [seven
years ago], my kids and friends would joke around. But [now] they
know I'm not going to give them any hints or anything.")</LD>
<TE>   Accountants, weary from tax season, covet the appointments to the
elite five-member preliminary ballot-counting team. "One of the ways
we work to keep this thing a secret--in a town with very few
secrets--is we don't get many people involved," Garrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Once all 6,000 ballots have arrived, they're stacked in a
conference room and divided among the young staffers, who are
forbidden from talking or consulting one another. "We also put the
fear of God into them before they start," Garrison said.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, it's just Garrison and Rosas. Their final tally
determines the winners. "It's easy," Garrison said. "You just add
them up and whoever has the most votes wins."</TE>
<TE>   By Friday, Garrison and Rosas are stuffing envelopes. The
envelopes, that is, that will be handed to award presenters during
the show.</TE>
<TE>   By Saturday, the two accountants are memorizing the winners'
names--just in case the envelopes don't make it to the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Actually at the end of the day ... you're familiar enough with it
then, that most of them you'll know," Garrison said. They won't, of
course, write down anything that could get into the wrong hands.</TE>
<TE>   Then the envelopes are locked in a safe at the Pricewaterhouse
offices. On Sunday afternoon, Garrison and Rosas will travel
separately to the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood, each with an armed
guard and a briefcase full of Oscar winners. Once inside the theater,
they will be posted on either side of the stage, handing out
envelopes to award presenters throughout the show.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot of fun," Garrison said. "It's different than what we
do the rest of the year. You're part of the biggest party in town."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Space for a Classic</TE>
<TE>   The audience had grown slightly restless. In some rows, popcorn
flew between the seats. Then, the 100-piece symphony orchestra took
the stage, striking the well-known opening bars. A hush fell over the
crowd, and even those whose feet did not reach the floor fell silent
in anticipation.</TE>
<TE>   Five-time Academy Award-winning composer John Williams conducted
the Recording Arts Orchestra of Los Angeles in a live performance of
the soundtrack during the premiere of the 20th anniversary version of
"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" at the Shrine Auditorium on Saturday
afternoon. The event, which benefited Special Olympics, drew 3,600
people, including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver as well as
Melissa Etheridge and Melissa Joan Hart.</TE>
<TE>   At the after party, a replica of E.T.'s spaceship doubled as a
diner, and the exposition hall, decked out in fir and leaves, doubled
as a camping ground for families, who munched on pizza and hotdogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I cried," said Neve Campbell about the movie, as she passed by.</TE>
<TE>   At one end of the hall, a crowd had gathered around E.T.'s
creator.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Barrymore threw her arms around her godfather, Steven
Spielberg, kissing his cheek and whispering in his ear. Then it was
his wife Kate Capshaw's turn at the ear. She whispered, Spielberg
smiled.</TE>
<TE>   As Barrymore made a beeline out of crowd where well-wishers,
friends and family competed for the director's attention, waves of
people almost knocked over Haley Joel Osment.</TE>
<TE>   Producer Ron Meyer made his way toward Spielberg, shouting
salutations across the table that stood between them. He introduced
his family.</TE>
<TE>   "Families don't change," said Spielberg, explaining the movie's
status as a classic.</TE>
<TE>   With its re-release, the movie has changed, though, as some scenes
have gotten a digital facelift. But the original will be preserved on
the DVD release of the movie, which will contain the updated film and
the 1980 original--for the purist, Spielberg said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of purists out there," he said. "I respect that."</TE>
<TE>   C. Thomas Howell, who played Tyler, one of the children in the
movie, tried to get past handlers and security guards. "I just wanted
to say hi to my boss."</TE>
<TE>   As the evening wore on, big people pressed flesh and exchanged
business cards. And on chairs scattered around the replica spaceship,
little people slept.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quote/Unquote</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to sit here and pretend that everything's great,
that I'm some sort of enlightened person," Ben Affleck says in the
April issue of Details magazine due out next Tuesday. "I have a lot
of struggles. I'm conflicted. I think about things. I wake up in the
middle of the night. I have regrets. I'm very insecure. So it's not
like I'm living in some great tranquil state out in my rock garden."</TE>

<LD>IN THE STACKS</LD>
<LD>   Short Stories About</LD>
<LD>   Libraries and Librarians</LD>
<TE>   Edited by Michael Cart</TE>
<TE>   Overlook Press</TE>
<TE>   288 pages; $26.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's ironic to anyone who's found a home in libraries, who's
discovered the wild realms and the tumultuous call of words
thundering off the printed page amid the cherished stacks, that the
very place where one's imagination is so fired is so shrouded in
silence. And yet, it's wholly fitting.</TE>
<TE>   "In the Stacks," an enchanting anthology of short stories about
libraries and librarians written by a host of well-respected authors,
fits perfectly into this hushed world. The narratives limned here are
quiet yet suggest the turbulent roar of life just beyond the
library's doors. Edited by Michael Cart, former director of the
Beverly Hills Public Library, the stories span from 1906 to 1998 and
represent a "mini-United Nations of countries," including writers
from Argentina, Canada, England, Italy, Poland and Russia.</TE>
<TE>   The oldest story in the collection, Zona Gale's "The Cobweb,"
traces the life of two sisters, Lissa and Kate, in turn-of-the-20th
century America. Lissa serves one hour nightly as the town's
librarian, loaning books out of the local store where the shop owner
has "kept sacred to books a section of shelves, beyond the canned
goods and above the salt-fish barrel." Kate, known to be the less
brainy of the two but impeccable at housekeeping, serves as Lissa's
replacement for a few minutes one evening. The townspeople tease Kate
for being unable to find a particular book, though, as she reflects,
"nobody had laughed at the dust on the City Library books."</TE>
<TE>   Kate envies her sister's ability to penetrate books and ideas, to
have her imagination stirred by words. Though Kate is read to in the
evenings by Lissa, she's unable to enter the worlds her sister finds;
words never transport her the way they do Lissa. When Kate falls ill,
though, and Lissa must take over the day-to-day housekeeping of their
home, the reader sees just how little book-learning will earn you
when work needs to be done. Being a genius in the realm of text adds
up to diddly in the hard-and-fast world of keeping home and hearth.</TE>
<TE>   Northern California writer Gina Berriault's powerful contribution,
"Who Is It Can Tell Me Who I Am?," chronicles a male librarian on the
verge of retirement. The librarian's life is disturbed by a homeless
man who comes to his desk regularly, wanting to discuss the esoterica
of poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Illuminating the affluence usually associated with reading along
with the democratic accessibility of library books to even the most
downtrodden, the story is disquieting in a pensive way. Then there's
Francine Prose's "Rubber Life," telling of a stereotypically
unattached female librarian who's bored with both her recent reading
choices and life. "I skimmed these books as fast as I could and let
their simple sentences wash through my brain like shampoo," she
explains of her perusal of "fat non-fiction bestsellers detailing how
rich people contract-murdered close relatives." Her uneventful
existence is destined to continue until Lewis, an intriguing library
patron with eclectic reading tastes, captures her attention and she
begins to check out and read every book he returns.</TE>
<TE>   Even the loudest of the stories--Anthony Boucher's playful
hard-boiled whodunit involving a murdered librarian, and the
co-workers and patrons under suspicion, "QL 696.C9,"--is subdued in a
jocular way. Throughout the tales collected here, the librarian
characters are unassuming and helpful yet human and complex. In Alice
Munro's "Hard-Luck Stories," we're given a glimpse into the other
lives of librarians--the ones that take place outside the library,
and in Munro's telling, involve illicit love and well-kept secrets.
Ray Bradbury's "Exchange" is a sentimental tale of a solider
returning to his hometown only to be disappointed by the lack of
connection he finds. When he walks into the library, though, he
encounters what he'd been looking for. The elderly librarian
remembers him, and he recalls her. "I used to think you were Mrs.
God," he confides, "and that the library was the whole world, and
that no matter what part of the world or what people or thing I
wanted to see and read, you'd find and give it to me."</TE>
<TE>   Library lovers will find a similarly quiet yet abiding place in
this anthology. The stories here echo the magical near-silence we
seek, the stillness that allows imagination to take flight.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, novelist and poet Kate Braverman chose 25 students from
her UCLA Extension classes to participate in a private writing
workshop. The writers met twice a month and were initially hesitant
to be exposed to Braverman's sometimes ruthless critiques.</LD>
<LD>   But they soon forged a bond and embraced Braverman's credo: Proper
punctuation, structure and pat characters are easy to come by; it is
the difficult emotions, the complexities of human life and characters
so real they should be getting mail that constitute the hard words.
So when three years later Braverman moved to New York, 11 of the
students, all women, closed ranks rather than disband.</LD>
<LD>   They created their own writing group, Hard Words, and met every
other Saturday to help shape and critique each other's work. Like
most writers, they wanted one thing: to write well. That was enough
to keep them together.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like a riddle," says member Samantha Dunn. "What do you get
when you put a bakery assistant, a couple of Manhattan Beach moms, a
communications consultant, an owner of an ad agency, a struggling
fitness writer and a software analyst together? I didn't know the
answer then. We had nothing but wanting to write something meaningful
in common. Now, of course, we have everything."</TE>
<TE>   Not the least of which is a solid taste of success.</TE>
<TE>   Dunn's memoir, "Not by Accident," which probes the nature of being
accident prone, was released this month by Henry Holt to positive
reviews. Kirkus Reviews called it "a lively and personally revealing
tale" and Publishers Weekly said Dunn writes with "intelligence and
wit." The book is excerpted in the current O magazine and is being
considered for excerpting in Brick, a literary journal co-edited by
author Michael Ondaatje and his wife, journalist Linda Spaulding.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Rakow's first novel, "The Memory Room" (Counterpoint Press),
will hit bookstores today. Literary heavyweights such as Howard
Norman have given it glowing cover blurbs containing such phrases as
"brilliant book" and "literary master."</TE>
<TE>   The bakery assistant? That's Julianne Ortale, who was accepted
last year into the highly competitive master's program in fiction
writing at UC Irvine and is now working on a short-story collection.
Her first piece, "How Sin Is Unsaid," will appear in the summer issue
of the literary journal Salmagundi. Ad agency owner Anita Santiago
and Colleen Burns, a retired teacher, have also had their work
published in journals. Other members of Hard Words--Karen Horn, Nancy
Spiller, Candace Pearson, Lola Willoughby, Josephine "Jody" Hauber
and Rochelle Low--are in various stages.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's bestselling author Janet Fitch, who started her novel
"White Oleander," which became an Oprah Book Club pick, while she was
an active member. (Fitch calls herself as an alum because she no
longer attends meetings.)</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for writers to establish ties with other writers,
to partake in the conversation that is literature," Fitch says. "I
believe the work coming out of Hard Words is some of the best fiction
in Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Award-winning short story writer Lee K. Abbott met several of the
members when they attended the New York State Summer Writers
Institute at Skidmore College last year. He says he is impressed with
the group's lack of sentimentality, which, he contends, is one of the
marks of a true pro. "My experience with most writing groups is that
it's the blind leading the blind. Clearly, there is nobody blind in
this group."</TE>
<TE>   Hard Words members offer critique, encouragement and insight to
each other. Despite the obvious influence they have on one another's
work, their writing voices are distinct as are the structures of
their works. Some members are working on family dramas told from
various points of view. Santiago is working on a novel of magical
realism; Dunn is starting a second novel (her first was "Failing
Paris"), which takes on developers and is set in the natural beauty
of New Mexico. Rakow's work is written entirely in verse (a
combination of poetry and prose) and Abbott has compared Ortale's
short story writing to that of the late Donald Barthelme (on the
unconventional side with an "odd eye for how we are to each other").</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing we definitely have in common," Burns says, "is that
in some major sense we mean to be literary." Meaning, you probably
won't find Hard Words members writing about murders, spy games or car
chases. As Braverman disciples, their writing is organic. They eschew
plot outlines. They write what they write scene by scene and decide
later what they are trying to say and how the work will ultimately
fit together.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, what we've done for each other over the years is to force
each person to dig deeper, to write about the emotional truth of a
situation. We don't let anyone gloss over an opportunity for that,"
says Hauber, who is putting the finishing touches on her first novel
for adults. She published a book for young adults in the '80s.</TE>
<TE>   Their efforts show, says Russell Banks, the author of "The Angel
on the Roof," "Affliction" and "The Sweet Hereafter." Banks worked
with the women in a writing workshop and "was impressed with [their]
work because it was quite sophisticated in literary terms. It wasn't
conventional, straightforward writing that you typically find in
first novels. They're trying to make works of art."</TE>
<TE>   But even with the gains they've made, the members confront the
same obstacle every writer faces: to be heard and recognized. There
is a publishing establishment that seems to set the tone for what is
deemed literary and thus taken seriously. This establishment seems
monolithic. It seems impenetrable. It seems like it's not in L.A.
"The so-called literary world is probably still thought of as the
providence of New York even though so much literature doesn't really
come from New York," says Jim Rutman, a literary agent with Sterling
Lord Literistic in New York City. "And Los Angeles probably does
still inspire some brow wrinkling."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, we have the likes of T.C. Boyle, Christina Garcia and
now David Foster Wallace, who is teaching at Claremont College, but
there's often still an instant association made with the
entertainment industry. If you're in Los Angeles and you don't write
for a sitcom, what kind of writer are you?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, we have to deal with that. But there are also benefits to
being in Los Angeles and trying to write serious fiction," Rakow
says.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like leaving the kids home alone. We can do anything we
want. We're unchaperoned. We don't necessarily have the reputation of
being a literary hotbed, but the truth is that there is a surprising
number of writers here who are already literary figures and there are
even more coming up that will reinforce that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>An Assignment to Rethink the Idea of Homework</HD>
<DH>More parents are questioning whether there aren't better
ways to help in their kids' education.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE STRAUSS</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Parents, so goes one of education's mantras, must be involved in
their child's schooling. But when it comes to homework, David Martin
isn't so sure.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-year-old, an honors student who attends a suburban middle
school, spends about two hours a night on homework. He occasionally
asks his parents, both doctors, to proofread reports, but sometimes
he regrets it.</LD>
<LD>   "They screw up as much as they help," David said.</LD>
<TE>   Karen Chaisson isn't sure, either. Her daughter is a fifth-grader,
and the stress of getting homework done--for two to three hours a
night--is too much for both of them.</TE>
<TE>   "Homework is the bane of my existence, because it seems to be more
of a hindrance than a help to my daughter," Chaisson said.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard to find anything more contentious about the school
experience than homework. Though studies are inconclusive about basic
principles, such as whether and what kind of homework is effective,
teachers in recent years have laid it on with increasing vigor: A
1999 University of Michigan study found that from 1981 to 1997, the
average amount of time spent rose from one hour, 25 minutes a week to
two hours, 14 minutes. Increasingly, parents are expected to become
involved.</TE>
<TE>   Homework is intended to be a bridge between home and school, to
expand learning opportunities and allow parents to see what their
child is doing. The importance of parent involvement in education has
become so great that schools cannot receive federal Title I funds
without forging "contracts" with parents that, in part, extract
promises that homework will be done.</TE>
<TE>   Yet a 1998 study by the nonprofit Public Agenda showed that half
of the parents said they have pushed their child to do homework to
the point of screaming, and 34% said it has become a source of
struggle.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of students and parents wonder whether there
aren't better ways to involve parents in a child's education.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole idea that homework is a bridge needs to be challenged,"
said Etta Kralovec, co-author of "The End of Homework" and vice
president for learning at Training and Development Corp. "Our
research shows that rather than providing a bridge, homework confused
parents about what their kids are doing in school and led to a
tremendous disconnect between the family and the school."</TE>
<TE>   Working and single parents say time constraints often make it
impossible to help. Some students say their parents can't understand
their homework. And some parents concede that even when they do, they
can confuse their children by trying to teach them how they learned
it decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   David could ask his mother, Lisa, who majored in math at Harvard
University, for help in geometry, but he opts for his twin brother
instead.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tension inherent in the parent-child relationship is another
factor. In many households, it is fraught with enough difficulty
without giving the parent a new role as teacher.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Public Agenda survey, 22% of adults admitted
doing part of their child's homework. Many teachers say they can
tell, but students complain that they get no credit for doing the
work themselves.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Priscilla Vail, a longtime teacher and learning
specialist, urges teachers to tell their students: "'If you are one
of the people lucky enough to have involved parents, please put your
project here on this table. If you have to do your work all on your
own, getting your own materials and doing it yourself, would you
please put your project on this table.' Nobody is going to cheat, and
it dignifies both approaches."</TE>
<TE>   Educators say parents must provide the proper environment and
materials, said Harris Cooper, chairman of psychological sciences at
the University of Missouri-Columbia.</TE>
<TE>   They should also ask their children about their work and make sure
they have time to do what is assigned, educators said.</TE>
<TE>   Parents say teachers must coordinate homework assignments so
students don't have too much any one night. Dorothy Rich, creator of
MegaSkills, a Washington-based program used in thousands of U.S.
homes and schools, said many teachers pile on homework to make up for
deficiencies in the classroom, which robs students of valuable time.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are doing homework, you are not doing something else,"
Rich said. "You are not riding your bike, you are not reading other
materials for pleasure, you aren't exercising. These things are as
important."</TE>

<LD>Making a Tide Pool Scope</LD>
<LD>   Tide pools are full of life and waiting to be explored. Living in
Southern California offers many opportunities to investigate this
amazing world. Crabs, sea stars, urchins, baby fish and even octopus
can be found living in our local tide pools. You can view them
without disturbing their homes by making a tide pool scope. Follow
the directions below to make your own window into the underwater
world.</LD>
<LD>   What You Will Need: half-gallon plastic milk jug; heavy-duty
scissors; black paint; clear plastic food wrap; heavy rubber band;
duct tape; paintbrush; craft paints; some help from an adult.</LD>
<TE>   Step 1: Ask an adult to cut off the bottom of the jug and then cut
off the top, leaving only the handle.</TE>
<TE>   Step 2: Paint the inside of the milk carton with black paint. Let
dry.</TE>
<TE>   Step 3: Tear off a piece of clear plastic food wrap large enough
to cover the bottom opening of the jug.</TE>
<TE>   Step 4: Stretch the plastic wrap over the bottom edge of the jug
and secure it by wrapping the rubber band over the plastic. This will
become the viewing window.</TE>
<TE>   Step 5: Apply the duct tape around the jug over the rubber band,
making your viewing window watertight.</TE>
<TE>   Step 6: Fold the duct tape around the rim of the handle side of
the container to dull the edge.</TE>
<TE>   Step 7: Using craft paints, decorate the outside of your tide pool
scope.</TE>
<TE>   Step 8: Take the scope to a tide pool. To use, hold the jug by the
handle and press the bottom under the water. Let the water come up
the side of the jug but not into it. Look for tide pool animals. If
you're lucky, you may see a sea anemone like the one shown here.</TE>
<TE>   To learn more about tide pools, visit the Southern California/Baja
Gallery at the Aquarium of the Pacific. For tickets and information,
call (562) 590-3100 or visit www.aquariumof pacific.org.</TE>

the Statue of Liberty. It is in New York in the middle of the water.
I've only seen pictures of it, but I hope to see it in person

<HD>Street Barriers Erected to Reduce Traffic, Not Promote
Racism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding Al Martinez's column on "Walls of Shame" (Feb. 26): Mr.
Martinez, I am one of those white South Pasadenans about whom you
write. I don't know how Charles Erickson knows that the barrier at
Alpha Street was racist, but he should be informed that it was
erected by Los Angeles, not South Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   As for speeding cars, they are a problem here and everywhere. Via
Del Rey resembles a boulevard, not a city street, and is therefore
conducive to speeding. Fighting the inroads of heavy traffic is not
unique to South Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   I am a transportation commissioner in South Pasadena and am
against all street barriers, including the barrier on the street on
which I live. This barrier separates my street from Pasadena. It was
not erected as a racist barrier to keep out Pasadenans but a
wrong-headed attempt to reduce traffic. All it did was divert traffic
to other streets.</LD>
<TE>   I signed the petition requesting that closure many years ago
because I did not know any better. We live and learn. I fought very
hard (and lost) to disallow street closures for the Gold Line light
rail. I will try very hard to have all barriers removed, even though
my neighbors will never speak to me again and my friends on Van Horne
will not be pleased.</TE>
<TE>   Racism is ugly and hurtful and downright stupid. Those who feed
upon it, such as politicians and columnists, are repugnant. Those who
tell little children that barriers were erected to keep them out are
abominable.</TE>

<HD>Bridge Column Helpful to Nonexpert Players</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I must strongly disagree with Richard Young's criticism (Letters,
Feb. 25) that Frank Stewart's bridge column is "too cutesy and
advanced for most readers."</LD>
<LD>   I am far from an expert player, but I find Stewart's column
consistently provides valuable learning experiences to readers of all
bridge levels. Stewart's columns generally contain multiple levels of
instruction, first showing the reader a respectable way to bid and
play (or defend) a hand, and then a better way. Stewart's column is
unique in its frequent inclusion of intelligence and wit on a wide
range of nonbridge subjects. If Young wishes to characterize these
aspects of Stewart's column as "cutesy," then it is apparent that he
is using a different dictionary than mine.</LD>

could decimate a library's irreplaceable collection and cats were
therefore a necessity.</LD>

<HD>It's a Mad World of Endorsements</HD>
<DH>Alfred E. Neuman, the grinning symbol of a satire magazine
for which nothing is sacred, is the darling of some advertisers who
consider him an irreverent icon for baby boomers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROY RIVENBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"What, me sell out?" Apparently so. Alfred E. Neuman, the gap-toothed
mascot of Mad magazine, has officially joined the Establishment.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in a preppy blue polo shirt, he can now be found on the
cover of a Lands' End catalog, hawking chinos, button-down Oxford
shirts and tasseled loafers. He also had his teeth fixed for a new
"Got milk?" campaign. And PepsiCo plans to plaster his lopsided mug
on bottles of its SoBe drinks. The list goes on.</LD>
<LD>   Although Mad's founder, the late William Gaines, once vowed to
teach kids not to believe in ads, his cartoon protege has chosen
another path, dishing out product endorsements for everything from
Lucky jeans to Tang to computer gear.</LD>
<TE>   "Advertisers are realizing Neuman puts a smile on people's face
and creates immediate brand recognition," says Joel Ehrlich, senior
vice president of advertising and promotions for DC Comics and Warner
Bros., Mad's parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Neuman's journey from Mad to Madison Avenue is also putting a
smile on Warner Bros.' face, thanks to the loot he hauls in. But his
handlers insist that Neuman isn't simply being offered to the highest
bidder.</TE>
<TE>   "At the end of the day, we do have integrity about his image,"
Ehrlich says. "The product has to be a good match."</TE>
<TE>   For example, a proposal for Mad condoms was vetoed. And given
Mad's longtime ridicule of the tobacco industry, "I don't see us
[allowing Neuman to endorse] cigarettes or liquor," says Mad
co-editor John Ficarra.</TE>
<TE>   Are there any other products Neuman wouldn't promote? "The Los
Angeles Times," Ficarra jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Although some Mad readers might wonder why Neuman is endorsing any
products, his role as an advertising pitchman isn't entirely out of
character. In fact, that's how he got his start.</TE>
<TE>   Neuman predates Mad magazine by decades. One of his earliest known
appearances was on the side of a 19th century traveling dentist's
wagon, accompanied by the motto, "It didn't hurt a bit." He also
popped up in a 1939 ad for Thom McAn shoes, as well as on various
billboards and even in anti-Franklin Roosevelt campaign literature.</TE>
<TE>   Mad founder Gaines tried to reform the boy. After adopting Neuman
in 1955, Gaines schooled him in Mad's anti-advertising ethic. Gaines
refused to let his magazine carry any ads, a policy that didn't waver
until last year, when Mad switched to an all-color format.</TE>
<TE>   Neuman went along with the program, but in 1994, two years after
Gaines' death, he had a relapse, becoming the official spokesman for
a Syquest computer memory device.</TE>
<TE>   Next, he endorsed Tang, a breakfast drink that Mad had spoofed
years earlier. More recently, the National Fluid Milk Processor
Promotion Board recruited Neuman for a milk mustache ad. But first,
they did some oral surgery. According to dentists, Neuman suffers a
diastema--a space between the upper central incisors caused by too
low an attachment of the labial frenum, which is the fibrous fold of
tissue connecting the upper lip to the upper jaw.</TE>
<TE>   In the milk ad, which premiered last month, he sports a full set
of gleaming choppers, above a caption that says milk is "great for
strong bones and toothy product endorsement smiles."</TE>
<TE>   Other Neuman ads include a plug for the American Library Assn.'s
reading campaign and an endorsement for Lucky jeans. "In Mr. Neuman,
Lucky has found an icon that mirrors its youthful, irreverent
attitude," said Advertising Age magazine.</TE>
<TE>   OK, but what about Lands' End? "Youthful" and "irreverent" aren't
the first words that spring to mind for side-elastic jeans and "frost
blue" seersucker shirts.</TE>
<TE>   Is it possible the catalog company meant to hire Paul Newman but
got confused?</TE>
<TE>   No way, says Lee Eisenberg, a former Esquire magazine editor who
now serves as Lands' End's creative director. The company was looking
for a baby boomer icon to promote its new polo shirt. The choice was
between Neuman and the late Vice President Spiro Agnew. Mad's poster
boy carried the day.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not tuned into the Alfred E. Neuman frequency, it may
seem unusual," Eisenberg says. But for Lands' End's core customers,
who grew up during Mad's heyday, Neuman "mirrors the youthful,
irreverent attitude each of us used to have 20 or 30 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Mad's "usual gang of idiots" even wrote captions for the polo
shirt: Eight great colors to choose from! (One for every day of the
week!) Carefree comfort. (It will have you saying, "What, me worry?")</TE>
<TE>   The main draw, though, is Neuman.</TE>
<TE>   His idiotic grin is so recognizable that someone in Europe once
put his face on an envelope with no other information, and the letter
still made it to Mad headquarters in New York, Ficarra says. Then
again, that incident happened several decades ago. If the same stunt
were tried today, the envelope might land on the desk of Neuman
look-alike Ted Koppel or David Letterman, Ficarra says.</TE>
<TE>   So when Eisenberg sent out several million copies of the March
Lands' End catalog, he felt "some degree of wariness and
trepidation." Not to worry. The response has been "phenomenal," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   The catalog has already turned up on EBay.com as a collector's
item. One sold for $10.77, and several others are being offered for
$3 to $4. "I'm thinking of putting him on every cover," Eisenberg
says.</TE>
<TE>   At Mad headquarters, editor Ficarra sees no conflict of interest
between Neuman's dual roles as product pitchman and Mad mascot. "If
Lands' End did something shoddy or ridiculous tomorrow, we'd make fun
of it," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Neuman is apparently in such demand that the front of
Mad's April issue shows his blank silhouette with a note to readers:
"Due to the slumping economy, we cannot afford the services of mascot
Alfred E. Neuman on this cover."</TE>

<HD>Silver Tones and Golden Arches</HD>
<DH>A piano man regales New York diners with jazz, classical
and mambo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNNE DUKE</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Consider the piano man. Just listen for a while. From jazz to
classical to mambo, from Ellington to Chopin to Puente, just about
any kind of music rolls off his nimble fingers. He scats sometimes,
too, and croons a bar or two of the blues. He bounces lightly as he
plays, as if dancing with the latest in a long line of baby grands
he's partnered all his life.</LD>
<LD>   He's the piano man of the Golden Arches, the maestro of
McDonaldland. He is David George Preudhomme, 66. Six days a week,
from his balcony perch overlooking the financial district in the
atrium of a huge, pink-neon-lit McDonald's restaurant, he churns out
his many tunes. McDonald's officials aren't totally sure, but say
they don't think any of their other restaurants has a regular
pianist.</LD>
<LD>   He plays as if he's still jamming in one of the hot jazz clubs of
his past. Completing a lovely "Satin Doll" the other day, he mumbled
the name "Billy Strayhorn," one of the Duke Ellington song's
composers. Though no one even applauded, the piano man said later,
"Sometimes I like to imagine I'm playing in a big place again."</LD>
<TE>   Lovers of Latin jazz will remember the New York-based Joe Panama
Sextet he led to some critical acclaim. His music was popular and
respected in the 1950s and '60s, until times changed and music styles
with it.</TE>
<TE>   And after a long journey through the ballrooms, stages, hotel
lounges and cafes that are the pianist's life, "Joe Panama" landed
here in 1999, beneath the golden arches. He's prepared to play
wherever there's a piano and a paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care where I play my piano," Preudhomme says, doubling
over with laughter. But seriously, he says: "I take it like this. I'm
giving it my best effort, wherever I play. It could be the middle of
the street. I'll still be kickin'." He bobs and weaves as he speaks,
still kickin' indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's a block from ground zero, many of the customers are
firefighters, and other workers at the Trade Center site. They wear
hard hats, carry respirators and are covered with ash. Sometimes the
piano man plays patriotic tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Lots of other working stiffs, in suits and ties, eat there, too.
The Nasdaq building is just across the street and the New York Stock
Exchange is three blocks away.</TE>
<TE>   Lower Manhattan passes outside his perch, and he looks to it for
inspiration. In fact, from inside the McDonald's at 160 Broadway you
see Panama's back more than his front. He doesn't look at the diners
much. He's too high up to really interact with them, save for the
occasional patron who'll yell up a request. So he watches the world
outside and plays a spontaneous soundtrack.</TE>
<TE>   "Out there gives me a push. It inspires me," he says of the bustle
of lower Broadway. "I look at the people and I think about the World
Trade Center and I look at the expressions of people walking by and I
think to myself how it's changed."</TE>
<TE>   In his long list of many gigs around town, he says, he played
several months in 1998 at Windows on the World, the restaurant at the
top of the trade center's north tower. Around the same time,
Preudhomme got a job filling in on piano at the McDonald's, becoming
the latest in a line of piano men going back to the restaurant's
opening in 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Last July Preudhomme was on his perch, wailing away on a fast
tune. "I made one of those big piano moves and wham! It hit me like a
bomb. Pain! You can't breathe. You start sweating."</TE>
<TE>   The heart attack was huge. He attributes it to a life of eating
pig knuckles and pig feet, though smoking and drinking might have
played a part, too. After weeks of hospitalization, and open-heart
surgery, he returned to the Brooklyn apartment he shares with Bullet,
his German shepherd. That's where he was Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The McDonald's, virtually buried in the blanket of ash that
covered lower Manhattan, managed to reopen a couple of weeks after
the attacks. Preudhomme finally, returned to work in early November
and wore a mask for a time to filter out smoke and dust.</TE>
<TE>   He was born in the Bronx. It was his father who came from Panama.
And it was his mother, from Dominica, who pushed him toward music
when he was 5. He started playing the Latin jazz circuit as a teen.</TE>
<TE>   He was never a star. But he had a name back in the 1950s, '60s,
even '70s. With timbales, vibes, conga, bass, piano and vocalist, the
Joe Panama Sextet swirled in the musical ferment that, for a time,
built a bridge between black and brown New York. The Latin jazz
groups, whose leading lights were the likes of Tito Puente and Tito
Rodriguez, were all the rage in the '50s in the Harlem social clubs.
Preudhomme played the circuit, in places like the St. Nicholas Arena
and Celebrity Club, even the famous Savoy Ballroom. Downtown he
played the Palladium at 55th and Broadway. Max Salazar, a Bronx-based
Latin music historian and journalist, remembers hearing Panama play
and says Joe was a "Class A" pianist very much in the music mix of
those times.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a great pianist," says Salazar, who writes for Latin Beat
magazine. "I remember hearing him one night in Harlem. He sounded
great. He was swinging. He could have made it. But there's a lot of
politics in music. They fight for top billing, all those things."</TE>
<TE>   Preudhomme cut one boogaloo/Latin soul album in 1967, "The
Explosive Side of Joe Panama." He worked resorts in the Catskills
upstate and a few lengthy gigs in Manhattan. Widowed in 1991, he
spent most of the 1990s at the piano bar of Mimi's Restaurant on the
East Side.</TE>
<TE>   He will remain, he says, a man trying to improve his craft. "After
watching all the greats playing--the Ellingtons, the Brubecks, the
Oscar Petersons, the Billy Taylors--I realized that you can't play at
all compared to them. I still view myself as a student of music."</TE>
<TE>   Sure, deep down, who wouldn't want to cut another album? But he
doesn't think it's in the cards. So each day, he takes the subway in
from Brooklyn. He climbs the stairs to his perch, leaning heavily on
the banister. His heart is still a concern. He walks down a long
corridor that leads to the front of the restaurant, where his latest
dance partner, his latest piano, awaits.</TE>

<HD>A Missed Lesson in Limits of Vile Speech</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't what Janis Adams had in mind when she taught students in
her media classes at Palisades High about the power of the press.</LD>
<LD>   She didn't realize an underground student newspaper would be her
undoing; that she would be drummed out of a career she loved by
harassment posing as free speech; that both students and grown-ups
would bungle basic concepts like authority and responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, Adams didn't even see the paper--its title a slang
reference to an act of oral sex--when it first began circulating on
the Pacific Palisades campus two years ago. The rogue newspaper used
the most vulgar and insulting terms imaginable, its articles advised
how to humiliate girls during oral sex, how to make a teacher cry,
how to slap a girl into submission, how to finagle sex with a
teacher's wife.</LD>
<TE>   Because two of the paper's creators were students Adams had
bounced from her class for being disruptive, they were out to even
the score.</TE>
<TE>   I cannot, in a family newspaper, do justice to the vile insults
directed at the teacher. One front-page photo superimposed Adams'
face on the body of a nude woman graphically engaged in a sexual act.
One article said that Adams, a former actress, had "probably" starred
in porn flicks and had performed a certain sexual act so often that
she now has to wear diapers at work. Adams was not the only teacher
vilified, but she became a central target, and the attacks became
more vulgar the more she fought to stop them.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the boys expelled," she said. "I'd refer them [for
discipline], call their parents ... but nothing would be done. And
they just got more and more brazen."</TE>
<TE>   One administrator told her "boys will be boys"; another
characterized their antics as "senior pranks," she said. When one
mother was called in for a meeting, she denounced Adams for hurting
her son's chances to get into the college of his choice.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of the school year in June 2000, Adams was afraid to
leave her classroom. A trip across the quad forced her through a
gantlet of students yelling curses and making sexual remarks. There
were phone calls at home, a death threat taped to her classroom door.
She was convinced she was being stalked, and she got a restraining
order against the boys.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she planned to return to the school that September, "until
I tried to prepare my lesson plans, and I just fell apart," she said.
She sued the Los Angeles Unified School District, charging that
officials allowed Palisades High to become a hostile workplace by
failing to protect her from sexual harassment.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days ago a jury agreed and awarded her $4.35 million for lost
wages and emotional damage. "It's the first time in the nation," said
her lawyer, Gloria Allred, "that a teacher has won a case against a
school district because of sexual harassment by students."</TE>
<TE>   District officials are still scratching their heads over what went
wrong. "I have no question that Janis Adams was hurt emotionally by
being pilloried in this way," said Los Angeles Unified attorney Hal
Kwalwasser. "But does the district deserve financial liability?"</TE>
<TE>   The students printed their newspaper off campus and carried it in
hidden in their backpacks. When Adams complained that spring, the
school banned the paper, suspended six students and transferred five
others.</TE>
<TE>   But new editions kept showing up on campus. Then the transferred
students were allowed to return within months, after their parents
hired lawyers and the ACLU took up their cause.</TE>
<TE>   "We did everything we could to keep these kids from harassing this
teacher," Kwalwasser said. "No one has told us yet what reasonable
steps we failed to take."</TE>
<TE>   Even teachers are divided. "Anybody who expects to work in a
public high school and not face hostility, insults and bias is out of
their mind," said one teacher, whose campus, like Palisades, is
considered one of the district's best. "These are ugly little
teenagers, and they've grown up in a world where anything goes."</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the students involved seem to have a hard time
understanding what all the fuss is about. "Maybe it's the generation
gap that makes it look worse to adults than to us," said one boy.</TE>
<TE>   Another complained about being transferred, arguing that he should
have just been made to apologize or "do community service, like
helping the teachers that were insulted.</TE>
<TE>   "I realize that the newspaper had some very malicious and cruel
things in it, which I thought would be funny and just a joke," he
wrote in an opinion piece published, along with other points of view,
in The Times when the controversy first emerged.</TE>
<TE>   After all, haven't teenagers always felt the urge to push the
limits, to break rules just to show they can? Maybe these obscene
rantings reflect little more than a bunch of immature kids getting
their thrills by putting grown-ups on edge. "Spoiled rich kids,"
their teachers call them, trying to show that they're renegades.</TE>
<TE>   Adams still gets teary-eyed when she talks about how "hurt and
humiliated" she felt as she read of her fictional sexual exploits.
But what also hurt, she said, was watching the procession of girls
who showed up in her classes, sporting buttons pinned to their shirts
supporting the newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried to talk to them about the newspaper, how hurtful it was,
how they could support something so hateful and insulting and
demeaning.... They just didn't get it," Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's what is most tragic about this story... not that it
ended Adams' seven-year career or that the $4.35 million it will cost
the district is enough to buy the land for a new elementary school,
but that no one seems to have seized the chance to make this the
teaching moment it could have been.</TE>
<TE>   A firm, unbending stand by school officials against the offenders
would have taught students about limits and boundaries. And a hard
look at the publication might have provoked discussions among
students and teachers, and in families, about the nature of sexual
harassment, the consequences of cruelty, and the responsibilities of
free speech.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think anybody learned anything," Adams said last week.
"Somebody has to be in charge, to say, 'This is not acceptable.'
Otherwise, kids just push and push to see how far they can go. What's
the lesson in this? That nobody wants to take responsibility?"</TE>
<TE>   I think she's right, and I hope her former students listen:
Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing, part of what makes our
country great. But take another look, kids, at the message you're
sending, because freedom's not worth much if that's all you've got to
say.</TE>

<LD>After the principal left, Mr. Thomas the giant sat down at his tiny
desk and picked up the first book he saw. "Open up your readers to
... Page 36," he said. "OK, you in the blue shirt [he pointed to
Billy Ochoa]. Begin reading."</LD>
<LD>   Billy was one of the best readers in the class but he was so
nervous he started reading on Page 63 instead. A low rumble filled
the classroom.</LD>
<LD>   "No!" Mr. Thomas said so loudly that the world map jumped up off
the blackboard and began to flap around its pole. "Page 36, not Page
63!" That's when half of us turned our arithmetic books to Page 36
and the other half of us forgot how to read altogether.</LD>
<TE>   "You notice Mr. Thomas never seems to smile," Robin Chang said as
she sat eating her lunch in the lunchroom. "Mrs. Chappelle, our old
teacher, smiled all the time."</TE>
<TE>   "When he stands over my shoulder at my desk, he is so big he
blocks out the sun," Jerome Haskins said.</TE>
<TE>   "But that's not the worst of it," Cherie Fontaine said. "He makes
us study and work too hard in his class. And he gives us homework to
do at home. What kind of teacher is that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Let's ask Mr. Dawkins the principal if we can have another
substitute," Maria Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   "You ask him, Billy," Jerome said. "You're one of his favorites."</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Billy said. He motioned for the principal to step closer.
"Mr. Dawkins," Billy said as politely as he could. "Could you, sir,
consider getting rid of Mr. Thomas? We don't want a giant for our
teacher."</TE>
<TE>   "Are you speaking for everyone?" Mr. Dawkins asked.</TE>

<HD>2 Airlines Join Delta in Commission Cuts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, the world's largest carrier, and
Continental Airlines Inc. said Monday they matched Delta Air Lines
Inc. and stopped paying basic commissions to domestic travel
agencies, making it all but certain that the rest of the airline
industry will follow.</LD>
<LD>   Although other airlines eventually were expected to adopt Delta's
change, American and Continental waited only four days before saying
they no longer would pay a basic commission for tickets issued by
agents in the U.S. and Canada. Most carriers had been paying a
maximum base commission of $20 for a round-trip ticket.</LD>
<LD>   The rest of the airlines--which collectively are forecast to lose
an additional $3 billion this year as air travel slowly recovers from
Sept. 11 and the recession--will take the same step "sooner rather
than later," said Richard Bittenbender, an analyst at Moody's
Investors Service.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Copland, president of the American Society of Travel
Agents, said the cutoff was expected and that agents will sell fewer
tickets, "at least in the short term," without the commissions.</TE>
<TE>   Agents also will start charging travelers higher fees to book
seats.</TE>
<TE>   "The one who's going to get the short end of the stick is the
traveling public, because what the airlines are doing is raising the
price of airline tickets indirectly," said Copland, whose group
represents 26,000 agencies.</TE>
<TE>   American and Continental, the nation's fifth-largest carrier,
declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   The airline industry "is trying to return to profitability, and if
there is any way they can see to lower costs or increase their
revenues without affecting passenger traffic, they're going to take
it," Bittenbender said.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines had shaved commissions several times in recent years
to save money. The carriers also have pushed travelers to book via
the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   American last year spent $835million on commissions, down 20% from
$1billion the prior year. Some of that decline reflected the plunge
in air travel after Sept. 11, but part also stemmed from commission
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   Like Delta, American indicated it will keep paying bonus
commissions to agents who drum up exceptional business. To survive,
some agencies probably will merge to generate the ticket sales that
will earn those bonus fees, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   At Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a Minneapolis-based network of 1,400
travel agency offices, spokesman Steve Loucks said agencies will have
to focus more on planning vacation packages and providing other niche
services. He also said nearly 100 agencies have joined the Carlson
Wagonlit franchise in the last six months to boost their sales. Once
they join, they are treated like one large operation and entitled to
the same preferred relations with airlines, he said, adding: "It's
really become more difficult to go it alone out there."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Bonnie Harris in Orange County contributed to
this report.</TE>

<HD>Andersen, KPMG Outline a Deal</HD>
<DH>Merger: Executives acknowledge they have a plan that would
join their foreign operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HIRSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Andersen accounting firm, fighting for its life under a criminal
indictment, on Monday reached the outline of an agreement for rival
KPMG to absorb its international operations, according to executives
at the accounting firms.</LD>
<LD>   The deal is expected to stop the splintering of Andersen's
international confederation of accounting firms but leaves unanswered
the fate of its U.S. business.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen executives, however, said last week the foreign
acquisition might pave the way for KPMG to acquire their U.S.
operations once Andersen's liabilities from its Enron Corp. audit are
resolved.</LD>
<TE>   Andersen has faced the threatened defection of its international
partners after its federal indictment last week on an obstruction of
justice charge for destroying documents sought in the investigation
of its work for energy trader Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen Worldwide is a network of independent partnerships linked
together through licensing and branding agreements. Although
Andersen's U.S. operations are part of this network, KPMG believes
Andersen's international partners are not likely to be held liable
for the Enron audit.</TE>
<TE>   In statements, both firms said they would benefit from joining
forces. The firms would combine operations throughout the major
markets of Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Canada, Asia and Latin
America.</TE>
<TE>   "Such a combination would be complementary in terms of geographic
coverage and industry expertise," Mike Rake, a senior KPMG executive,
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Most of Andersen's 84-member firms worldwide are expected to agree
to the merger though there could still be a handful of defections,
according to one source familiar with the talks.</TE>
<TE>   "Any such combination would create a global network that can
continue to provide outstanding service in every part of the world
and represents an outstanding opportunity for our partners and
people," Aldo Cardoso, chairman of the board of Andersen Worldwide,
said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement between KPMG and Andersen was negotiated over the
weekend.</TE>
<TE>   The firms decided to create due diligence teams that will start
reviewing Andersen's foreign operations April 1. That work is
expected to be completed in June and the deal is scheduled to close
Oct. 1, according to people familiar with the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Whether KPMG will eventually absorb Andersen's U.S. operations is
still unclear because of the large liabilities the firm faces for its
Enron work, including suits from shareholders and employees who lost
billions of dollars in the Houston energy company's collapse.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen offered to settle civil claims by paying $750 million
over five years, but the deal was rejected by plaintiffs in the
shareholder suit. Andersen also is seeking a speedy trial on its
federal obstruction of justice charge so that it can resolve some of
the uncertainty facing the firm.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has looked for ways to protect a potential merger partner
from also taking on any Enron liability but has failed to come up
with a plan that would reassure suitors.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, merger talks with Deloitte &amp; Touche and with Ernst &amp;
Young broke down over the liability issue.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen continues to reel from erosion in its domestic business.
On Monday, the giant drug manufacturer Wyeth announced it was taking
its roughly $16-million account to PricewaterhouseCoopers, ending a
33-year relationship with Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   Andersen has lost about 50 clients and about $200 million of its
$4.3 billion in U.S. business since December.</TE>

<HD>Mean Streets, Sweet Profits</HD>
<DH>Investors find opportunity in apartment renovations in
troubled areas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB HOWARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors hoping to profit by owning apartment buildings are
venturing into some of Southern California's meanest streets to
rehabilitate neglected properties, including one complex involved in
the Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division scandal.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the economic slump, these investors say, demand remains
high for apartments that working-class renters can afford, especially
in many parts of the Southland where primarily Latino populations
have outgrown the housing supply.</LD>
<LD>   This demand often is greatest in neighborhoods near downtown Los
Angeles and in parts of the San Fernando Valley and Orange County
that have reputations for drugs, gangs and crime.</LD>
<TE>   Many investors avoid these neighborhoods, but some are finding
profits there--without public subsidy--by following one of the oldest
strategies in apartment investing: Buy a neglected building, renovate
it, and raise below-market rents to market levels.</TE>
<TE>   Such investors are most often individuals and small groups, but
they include at least one sizable company, Beverly Hills-based
Kennedy-Wilson Inc., which has been a joint-venture partner with Los
Angeles-based Hanover Financial Co. in nine apartment renovation
projects in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the Kennedy- Wilson/Hanover deals is a 253-unit project
in Panorama City that the partners bought for about $10 million in
2001, spent $1.4 million renovating, then sold a year later for
slightly less than $14 million.</TE>
<TE>   The partners were able to sell the property at a profit because
rents were boosted from an average of $500 before the renovation to
$625 at the time of the sale, said Robert Hart, a senior vice
president at Kennedy-Wilson. He said rents would continue to climb as
tenants turn over.</TE>
<TE>   Panorama City still is considered by many to have a crime problem,
Hart said, but Kennedy-Wilson and Hanover viewed the project as a
good investment because the neighborhood has been improving.</TE>
<TE>   "We recognized that there is a large market of people who would
like to live in a nicer place if it were available," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy-Wilson and Hanover have rehabilitated and sold several
apartment projects in San Fernando Valley neighborhoods, and the two
companies recently began new projects there and in Santa Ana.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there is a lot of unrehabilitated property that people
will pay a little bit more rent for if it is renovated," Hart said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the worst properties to be renovated in recent years is a
94-unit apartment complex at 1209 S. Lake St. in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It gained notoriety as the building where former LAPD Officer
Rafael A. Perez claimed he and another officer shot an unarmed man in
late 1996 and planted a weapon on the victim, Javier Francisco
Ovando, who was paralyzed by the shooting. The other officer, Nino
Durden, pleaded guilty to framing Ovando, who later won a $15-million
settlement in connection with the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   The Lake Street complex is clean, neat and filled with renters
today, including half a dozen Latino women who were washing clothes
in the building's brightly lighted laundry room when owner Ted
Kolchier led a reporter on a tour of the property.</TE>
<TE>   But 1209 S. Lake was in wretched shape when Kolchier and partner
Roman Celusta took it over in 1997, said Kolchier, who got into the
apartment renovation business more by chance than by choice.</TE>
<TE>   The pair operate Woodland Hills-based Track Mortgage, which held a
loan on the Lake Street property and foreclosed in early 1997 after
the borrower stopped making payments.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment house was empty except for about 20 squatters who
weren't paying rent, Kolchier said. The building was waterlogged
because vandals had cut fourth-floor fire hoses, flooding the
complex, which was a hangout for the 18th Street Gang. Doors were
ripped out, walls were smashed, carpets were torn up, and graffiti
was everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   "The building was pretty much destroyed inside, so we knew nobody
else would want it," Kolchier said. "The only way we could recoup any
of our original investment was to do a complete renovation."</TE>
<TE>   Kolchier said he and Celusta spent about $2 million, gutting the
complex and replacing the plumbing and electrical systems, installing
new kitchen and bathroom fixtures and appliances, and making other
repairs.</TE>
<TE>   Once the renovation was completed, Kolchier said, tenants quickly
filled the building at rents ranging from $375 to $575 a month for
its 94 bachelor and studio units.</TE>
<TE>   Kolchier still had problems at the building, however, because
gangs and crime spilled over from a nearby apartment house at 1200 S.
Hoover St. that was almost as much a mess as the Lake Street
complex--so he bought that 67-unit building and renovated it.</TE>
<TE>   During the renovations of both buildings he worked closely with
police to make the properties safe.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized that we would have to improve the whole
neighborhood," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kolchier and Celusta now own a dozen apartment complexes where
renovations have been completed or are underway, including a 54-unit
building at 2121 W. 11th St. around the corner from the Lake Street
and Hoover Street properties.</TE>
<TE>   "When we bought the 11th Street building, we had to have armed
guards on the door 24 hours a day for the first month" to keep out
drug dealers and gang activity, Kolchier said. "We were calling
narcotics officers every couple of hours to take drugs and
paraphernalia out of the place as we were doing the rehab."</TE>
<TE>   The 11th Street building, like several others Kolchier has
rehabilitated, is a 1920s-era apartment complex that stands out from
most of the drab, neglected neighboring structures.</TE>
<TE>   Like Hart at Kennedy-Wilson, Kolchier said apartment renovations
in rough neighborhoods demonstrate the huge demand for decent housing
by the region's large and growing working-class Latino population.</TE>
<TE>   Increasing the number and quality of affordable apartments for
blue-collar and entry-level white-collar workers is one of the
biggest challenges facing Southern California, said Stephen Cauley,
associate director of UCLA's Ziman Real Estate Center, who said a
large portion of the region's growing Latino population "will never
be able to afford a house in the Los Angeles area."</TE>
<TE>   Hart's and Kolchier's projects were financed entirely with private
funds and without government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Investors generally prefer to finance rehabilitation projects
privately if they can, said Laurie Lustig-Bower of CB Richard Ellis,
who brokered the recent sale of the Panorama City apartments.
Government funding programs typically involve complex and
time-consuming paperwork that can delay and complicate deals.</TE>
<TE>   Housing experts such as Cauley say affordable apartments will
remain in short supply in Southern California for a long time because
little vacant land is available for building moderately priced units.
Even where it is available, land and construction costs often are too
high to make new construction profitable.</TE>

<HD>Conseco Seeks Extension on Repayment of Debt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>CARMEL, Ind.</DL>
<LD>nsurance firm Conseco Inc. on Monday asked bondholders for more time
to repay as much as $2.54 billion of debt.</LD>
<LD>   The offer would replace existing bonds with securities that have
identical principal amounts and interest rates, but mature one to
two-and-a-half years later.</LD>
<LD>   The new securities would have priority if the company became
insolvent.</LD>
<TE>   Conseco proposed the exchange as it tries to sell assets and boost
earnings in the face of rising defaults on mobile-home loans it owns.
The company, which hired Chief Executive Gary Wendt in 2000 to turn
the business around, said earlier this year it will get a qualified
opinion from its auditors unless it shows it can raise $410 million
from asset sales by March 31.</TE>
<TE>   "If it allows Conseco some breathing room and improves its
survivability, then it would be foolish for bondholders not to take
this deal," said John Devaney, who holds $50 million of Conseco debt
at United Capital Markets Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco bonds were largely unchanged in trading Monday, signaling
investors haven't decided what the fallout would be if the
restructuring doesn't go through. The exchange offer, which expires
April 12, will be made only to "qualified" institutions, the firm
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moody's Investors Service said it may lower Conseco's debt
ratings, as the proposed restructuring "highlights the fragility of
the company's financial position."</TE>
<TE>   Conseco still needs to reach agreements on asset sales and
negotiate with its banks to approve the exchange and release it from
loan covenants that it may breach at the end of the month, analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Conseco shares, which have gyrated wildly in recent weeks as
investors have speculated about the company's future, fell 65 cents
to $3.40 on the New York Stock Exchange Monday. The stock was as high
as $20 last May.</TE>

<HD>Gemstar-TV Guide Posts Wider Loss in 4th Quarter</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gemstar-TV Guide International Inc. on Monday reported a wider
fourth-quarter net loss and said it will take a write-down for
amortization of goodwill of up to $5 billion in the current quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which operates an interactive TV program guide and
publishes TV Guide magazine, also announced the resignation of its
co-president and co-chief operating officer, Peter Boylan.</LD>
<LD>   Gemstar's shares fell on the news, dropping by $1.97, or 9.1%, to
$19.76 in after-hours trading. The shares had closed up $1.04 at
$21.73 on Nasdaq. The stock had fallen 37% over the last year.</LD>
<TE>   Pasadena-based Gemstar- TV Guide posted a net loss of $210.2
million, or 51 cents a share, compared with a loss of $126.1 million,
or 31 cents, in the year-earlier period.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue declined 3.3% to $346.4 million. Lower sales at TV Guide
amid an advertising slowdown offset rising revenue at the company's
technology division, which makes software to run on-screen television
program guides.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding depreciation and the amortization of goodwill, Gemstar
said it had a profit of $118.6 million, or 27 cents a share, down
5.6% from $112.3 million, or 25 cents, in the year-earlier fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The results surpassed by 2 cents the average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar had depreciation and amortization expenses of $243.5
million in the recent quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that under new rules regarding the treatment of
goodwill, it will write down as much as $5 billion of the $8.6
billion in goodwill it had on its books as of Jan. 1.</TE>
<TE>   That write-down will wipe out more than half of the $9.7 billion
in assets the company said it had as of Dec. 31. Most of the related
goodwill came from the company's $14-billion purchase of TV Guide in
mid-2000, Gemstar said.</TE>
<TE>   Boylan will remain as a consultant after his resignation, which is
effective April 1, Gemstar said. Boylan said in a statement that he
wanted to spend more time with his family.</TE>
<TE>   For the current quarter, the company did not provide guidance
except to say it expected revenue of $200 million in its media
sector, with a 10% to 15% year-over-year decline in technology and
licensing revenue, and 50% year-over-year revenue growth in
interactive platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Henry Yuen said these were "low baseline
expectations."</TE>
<TE>   On a conference call, the company's newly named general counsel,
Jon Orlink, also said Gemstar expects a ruling Thursday in a petition
filed with the International Trade Commission against Echo- Star
Communications Corp., Scientific-Atlanta Inc., Pioneer Corp. and SCI
Systems Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Gemstar filed the ITC complaint last year, alleging the four
companies were violating Gemstar's patents on on-screen interactive
programming guides for television.</TE>

<HD>Home Sales at Scorching Pace</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Prices soar as Southland buyers are driven by
a sense of urgency in February.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL STRICKLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Home sales surged last month across much of the Southland, lifting
prices for almost every type of housing and putting the market on a
scorching pace through the early part of the year that is ahead of
last year's robust levels.</LD>
<LD>   Sales of existing homes, condominiums and new homes jumped in Los
Angeles County by 21% to 7,898, marking the best February since the
previous boom in 1989. The median price for all types of homes, or
the point at which half sell for more, half for less, was a record
$237,000, up 15% from a year earlier, according to DataQuick
Information Systems Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County also recorded double-digit gains in sales, which
grew by 29% from a year earlier to 3,497, the highest mark reached in
a February since the La Jolla firm began keeping figures in 1988. Led
by condos, prices also rose across the board, with the median up
nearly 11% to $317,000.</LD>
<TE>   "The market is on fire. I don't know how else to say it," said
Leslie Appleton-Young, chief economist for the California Assn. of
Realtors. Such strength is reflected in almost all major metropolitan
areas statewide, she said. With prices rising sharply, interest rates
creeping higher and inventories stretched thin, a "sense of urgency"
exists among buyers to make a purchase before housing eludes their
financial grasp, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the February activity surprised analysts by its
strength, the monthly results showed once again how resilient real
estate has been, buffering the region from a sluggish economy.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts now are saying that home values in Orange County have
grown at a slightly higher pace than average incomes on a historical
basis, causing some to believe the market, after 56 consecutive
months of year-over-year gains, is overheating.</TE>
<TE>   The strength of the market in Orange County is reminiscent of the
late-1980s price bubble, some analysts say. That was followed by a
sharp drop in home values when the economy crumbled in the
early-1990s. It took several years for homeowners to regain lost
equity, and some walked away from homes that were worth less than the
mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in a mini-bubble," said Irvine real estate consultant John
Burns. If the market continues to grow by double digits for more than
a year, he said, the county "will get to a point where home prices
are no longer sustainable." He added, "We are starting to enter that
period."</TE>
<TE>   But John Karevoll, the DataQuick analyst who compiled the February
report, disagreed. Orange County buyers would gravitate toward
adjustable-rate mortgages if their finances were stretched, he said,
but the percentage of buyers using such mortgages has not passed 25%,
a fairly small share. The number of people entering the first stage
of foreclosure remains low and monthly mortgage payments for a median
home still are within range for many buyers, Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   "None of these indicators show any imminent change in the market,"
Karevoll said. "The market is rock solid. The only issue is supply."</TE>
<TE>   With a dearth of new construction, prices are expected to rise in
the region unless mortgage rates shoot to 8% or more from the current
7% range, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   But the February rate of increase in sales isn't expected to last
all year. In Los Angeles, resales rose by more than 17% in February,
and in Orange County they also were up sharply.</TE>
<TE>   If sales in December, January and February are combined, DataQuick
said, the two counties saw an increase of more than 11%, or about
3,600, from the same period a year earlier--a slower but still strong
pace that Karevoll believes can be sustained this year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the surging market is causing some buyers to alter their
plans. Beth Gilmartin and her husband, Dan, moved to suburban Denver
three years ago from Valencia. They hoped to move back this summer
and to purchase a home in the same area for a few thousand dollars
more than the approximately $248,000 they received when they sold
their last one. But now, after searching the market, the family
believes they will have to spend more than $300,000 for a
single-family home.</TE>
<TE>   "We were shocked to hear how much housing has gone up," Beth
Gilmartin said. "It's discouraging because there's not much for sale
in our price range."</TE>
<TE>   Neal Weichel, an agent at Remax in Valencia, said he's advising
clients to offer full prices on resale homes in the Santa Clarita
Valley. The number of potential buyers far outnumbers homes available
for sale in his area, he said, prompting stiff competition.</TE>
<TE>   When a condo priced at $175,000 hit the market last week, he said,
the unit elicited two offers at $195,000 and one that ultimately was
accepted by the sellers at $200,000. He expects to see such premiums
for resales until more new homes hit the market later this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the strongest seller's market I've ever seen," Weichel said.
"To be a buyer under $350,000 is very tough."</TE>
<TE>   Even the market for high-end homes is starting to pick up, said
Steven High, president of Strada Properties in Newport Beach. He said
buyers are showing "renewed interest" in the market since late last
year, when the market paused.</TE>
<TE>   "Many buyers who were on the sidelines have jumped back into the
market because they're not seeing a reduction in prices," he said,
"and right now our market doesn't show any sign of stopping or
slowing."</TE>

<HD>Workers Rejecting Deal, Hewlett Says</HD>
<DH>Tech: Spokeswoman for dissident director says employees are
voting 2 to 1 against merger. Firm says it's confident about today's
final tally.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH MENN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the proxy fight over Hewlett-Packard Co.'s $21-billion bid for
Compaq Computer Corp. went down to the wire Monday, deal opponents
said HP employees were voting 2 to 1 against the acquisition.</LD>
<LD>   Shares voted through the 401(k) plans of HP workers and workers at
HP spinoff Agilent Technologies were due Friday and counted over the
weekend, said a spokeswoman for dissident HP director Walter Hewlett,
who is trying to stop the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Of the more than 25 million shares voted, 16.7 million opposed the
combination and 8.6 million favored it, according to Hewlett
spokeswoman Joele Frank.</LD>
<TE>   The margin in Agilent's plan was even greater, at 8.1 million
against and 1 million for, Frank said.</TE>
<TE>   HP said workers also own shares directly and through an employee
stock purchase plan.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a barometer of how employees will vote," said HP
spokeswoman Rebeca Robboy. "They are mischaracterizing what the
overall employee vote will be."</TE>
<TE>   The final votes in the hotly contested fight will be cast this
morning at an auditorium at De Anza College in Cupertino, Calif., not
far from HP's Palo Alto headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Investors can change their vote until that meeting ends.</TE>
<TE>   There appeared to be some substance behind Hewlett's claims of
employee opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Robboy said HP and Agilent employees hold 2% of HP's 1.941 billion
outstanding shares. The tally relayed by Hewlett totals almost 1.8%
of the eligible shares, meaning that if both sides' figures are
correct, there would not be enough uncounted shares to swing the
employee vote to HP.</TE>
<TE>   "HP employees have consistently shown that they do not support
this merger," Hewlett said in a statement, citing earlier surveys.</TE>
<TE>   "HP stockholders see through empty claims of being No. 1 in size
without being No. 1 in profit and growth."</TE>
<TE>   Also on Monday, Hewlett picked up last-minute public support from
the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which had 0.3% of HP's shares
in December.</TE>
<TE>   Robboy said the company still believes it has the support of a
majority of the company's biggest 20 holders. "We remain confident
about a favorable outcome, and we look forward to the vote," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 23% of Hewlett-Packard shares are confirmed against the
acquisition. That includes 18% owned by Hewlett, founder's heir David
Packard and trusts and foundations associated with them.</TE>
<TE>   About 9% of the shares have declared public support.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to concerns about the risks of integrating Compaq and
its troubled personal computer business, HP employees have  reason to
worry about their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina, who has led the campaign for the
deal, has projected the elimination of 15,000 jobs if it goes
through. As the proxy fight intensified, she suggested that massive
layoffs might also be in store if the deal fails.</TE>
<TE>   At today's special stockholders' meeting, Fiorina will give her
last pitch to as many as 2,000 shareholders who will attend.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett also will be allowed to speak, Robboy said, and a
question-and-answer session is expected.</TE>
<TE>   Either or both sides may declare victory after the voting.</TE>
<TE>   The final, certified results won't be known for weeks.</TE>
<TE>   HP shares rose 20 cents to $19.25 on Monday, while Compaq added 3
cents to $10.36, both on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Minority Firms to Get 'Magic' Johnson Tips</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ROBINSON-JACOBS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hundreds of small and minority business owners are expected to gather
today for the first installment in a 12-city tour designed to give
entrepreneurs the tools to be more successful.</LD>
<LD>   Ex-Lakers great Earvin "Magic" Johnson, chief executive of Magic
Johnson Enterprises, will be the face of success presented to
participants at the "Tour for Success," a free seminar that will
include advice from Johnson and others on topics ranging from getting
started and securing financing, to becoming a minority supplier and
finding franchise opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson's company has secured partnerships with many marquee
companies to open everything from movie theaters and Starbucks coffee
shops to T.G.I. Friday's restaurants.</LD>
<TE>   He said at a news conference Monday that he hoped to be able to
offer participants advice that he didn't get when he began as an
entrepreneur 15 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I put up a [sports memorabilia] store in the Baldwin Hills
Crenshaw Plaza, but I didn't do the research," said Johnson, who now
owns a movie theater in that same complex.</TE>
<TE>   "Foot Locker was there selling the same thing. We never really
made any money. You've got to do the research," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the conference at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in
downtown Los Angeles will give him a chance to "share my knowledge."</TE>
<TE>   "If you have the information before you get started, you won't
lose a lot of money."</TE>
<TE>   The tour is being organized by the Global Diversity Group Inc., a
networking organization for minority entrepreneurs and is sponsored
largely by $150,000 from Volvo of North America. Other cities include
Atlanta, Philadelphia, Chicago and Washington.</TE>

<HD>Producer to Pay Hefty Back Taxes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Hollywood's biggest spenders now has a hefty tax bill to pay.</LD>
<LD>   Mario Kassar, producer of such extravaganzas as the upcoming
"Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines," has formally agreed to pay
the Internal Revenue Service nearly $45 million to settle tax
disputes dating back 14 years in some cases, according to U.S. Tax
Court papers.</LD>
<LD>   Kassar will pay $38 million in taxes for the 1988 through 1990 tax
years, the documents say, with the remainder of the settlement
covering penalties. Kassar's biggest hit is for the 1989 tax year,
for which he will pay $29.7 million in additional taxes and $5.9
million in penalties.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a satisfying resolution for both sides. It took a long
time, but we're happy it's just done," said Steven Toscher, Kassar's
tax lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement ends one of the entertainment industry's longest
and most bitter tax disputes, stemming from an IRS investigation into
the byzantine financing structures and liberal executive lending
practices of Carolco Pictures, the production company Kassar headed.</TE>
<TE>   The Times reported in December that the tax cases against Kassar
and producer Andy Vajna, who was Kassar's partner at Carolco, were
being wrapped up and that federal authorities had abandoned criminal
tax investigations against the two men with no charges being filed.</TE>
<TE>   The often-convoluted tax case centered on a web of companies with
ties to Carolco, as well as loans and company-paid expenses the IRS
said should have been classified as income.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS contended, for example, that Kassar used company loans for
art and real estate purchases--in one case even for paying gambling
losses--and that the money should have been considered income, court
records show. The criminal investigation began unraveling after
federal authorities failed to get a conviction against former Carolco
President Peter Hoffman on four felony tax charges in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Carolco produced such
expensive blockbusters as "Terminator 2: Judgment Day," "Total
Recall," the "Rambo" series and "Basic Instinct." But burdened by
huge overhead expenses and such money-losing bombs as "Chaplin" and
"Cutthroat Island," Carolco filed for Bankruptcy Court protection in
1995 and has since been liquidated.</TE>
<TE>   Although the amount Kassar is paying is a hefty one, it's less
than the $68.6 million the IRS originally sought from the producer.
Because many tax disputes are settled quietly before details become
public, it's unclear where the Kassar settlement stacks up in the
annals of Hollywood tax disputes. But Toscher said he believed it
would not be a record amount.</TE>
<TE>   An IRS spokeswoman declined to comment, citing agency policies
prohibiting comments about individual cases.</TE>
<TE>   As previously reported, Vajna last year agreed to pay more than
$6.5 million in back taxes with no penalties. Vajna left Carolco in
1989. He and Kassar have teamed up again with C2 Productions to
produce "Terminator 3."</TE>
<TE>   Toscher said Kassar is relieved to have settled the case with
"Terminator 3" starting production.</TE>
<TE>   "This couldn't come at a better time. With the amount of energy
required to launch a production like that, it would have been a major
distraction," Toscher said.</TE>

<HD>A Procrastinator Gets Proactive</HD>
<DH>Inger Jensen seeks a new approach after her salary drops in
half and her tech and real estate investments falter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inger Jensen always considered herself pretty self-reliant, but
lately she's been thinking she may need a little help.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to some career missteps, Jensen, 33, earns $21,000 a
year--less than half the money she did four years ago. Her stock
portfolio has fallen 57% from its peak, due largely to her love
affair with technology companies and other highfliers.</LD>
<LD>   "I had Enron, and that was supposed to be my blue-chip play," the
single Huntington Beach resident said. "I made some very irrational
decisions during the 'tech revolution.'"</LD>
<TE>   Jensen's major investment outside the stock market was in rental
real estate, and that too ended badly when she had to evict her
tenants.</TE>
<TE>   All this led Jensen to consider getting some professional advice
about her investments--and her life.</TE>
<TE>   "I've dropped the ball completely," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Not quite, said financial planner Joel Framson after reviewing
Jensen's finances. In fact, the West Los Angeles planner said, Jensen
has done plenty of things right over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen started investing early, purchased a condominium in a good
neighborhood and avoided debt, except for her mortgage. Even though
she lost $70,000 in the stock market, her net worth is $250,000,
thanks mostly to the rapid appreciation of her condo.</TE>
<TE>   This strong financial foundation--and Jensen's youth--will help
her rebound from her mistakes, Framson said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is somebody who's showing signs of being a successful
person," he said. "She has issues ... but she's always been a saver
and even though she's not making a lot of money, she's avoided the
temptation [to get into debt]."</TE>
<TE>   Getting Swept Along in Investing Fads</TE>
<TE>   Jensen's biggest financial sin was that she didn't take the time
to set financial goals and build a sound strategy for achieving those
ends, Framson said. Instead, like many other investors during the
bull market, she let herself get swept along in investing fads.</TE>
<TE>   "She abandoned any prudent long-term investment strategy," Framson
said, "and chased what was hot."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen's portfolio is a virtual who's who of crashed technology
and telecom companies. She lost $8,000 on JDS Uniphase Corp., $3,200
on Cisco Systems Inc. and $7,500 on AT&amp;T Corp., among others. And
then there's the $3,100 she lost on Enron Corp., the formerly
highflying energy trader.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of picking through the wreckage, Framson first asked
Jensen to talk about her goals. When she had trouble defining them,
he suggested she think about where she wanted to be three years from
now in her finances, her work and her life.</TE>
<TE>   After a weekend of soul searching, Jensen realized she wanted to
be employed in a job that challenges her intellectually and
creatively, while giving her plenty of time off for leisure travel.
She also envisioned living a more comfortable life financially, with
enough money to save for retirement while also enjoying a few
luxuries.</TE>
<TE>   Although she has a roommate to help pay her mortgage, Jensen's
$2,300 monthly salary doesn't go far in pricey Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to be able to go out to dinner," Jensen said, "and not
worry about it."</TE>
<TE>   Jensen used to know what that was like. After college, she made
$50,000 a year or more as a production coordinator, setting up photo
shoots for catalog companies and other clients.</TE>
<TE>   The long hours and work-related travel eventually took their toll,
however. Jensen tried her hand at being a real estate agent, but
after 18 months of few sales and little income she took a job as an
office manager.</TE>
<TE>   Although the job doesn't pay well, it does offer
flexibility--something Jensen prizes. She arranged to set her own
hours and take two months off each year to visit her boyfriend's
mother in France and his father in South America.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen and her boyfriend stay with his parents, which reduces
lodging costs, and use frequent flier miles she accumulated as a
production coordinator to buy plane tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Real Estate Investments Should Be Pursued</TE>
<TE>   After discussing Jensen's desires, Framson suggested she consider
a career as a public schoolteacher. Although not stress-free,
teaching would give her a couple of months off each year, plus
excellent benefits, such as a retirement plan that would replace up
to 70% of her working salary.</TE>
<TE>   The average starting salary for California schoolteachers is about
$33,000; a mid-career teacher makes about $48,000. Jensen said a job
helping other people appeals to her, and the salary would be enough
for her to reach her goals.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to make more money, but she doesn't have an extravagant
lifestyle," Framson said.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen probably would have no trouble finding a teaching job.
California is expected to hire 260,000 to 300,000 teachers over the
next 10 years, according to the California Teachers Assn., a union
that offers career information at www.cta.org. The California Center
for Teaching Careers offers additional information at
www.calteach.com.</TE>
<TE>   To get her teaching credential, Jensen could apply for financial
aid, such as a governor's teaching fellowship that covers her
education costs if she promises to teach at a poorly performing
school.</TE>
<TE>   She also could pay for her education herself, tapping her $190,000
in home equity or her $65,000 stock portfolio.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen should sell her stocks anyway, Framson said, because she
doesn't have enough time to monitor individual stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the stock-sale proceeds should be used for an emergency
fund, Framson said. Jensen should set aside at least three months'
worth of expenses, and preferably six months.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen can invest the rest of the money for retirement, said Scott
Brewster, a financial planner in Framson's firm. Jensen's taxable
portfolio would supplement the $25,000 she has saved in a Roth IRA.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen should invest both accounts in a mix of stock and bond
index mutual funds, Brewster said. Index funds, which mimic market
benchmarks, tend to have lower expenses and pay out less in annual
taxable capital gains, making them a good match for most long-term
investors, Brewster said.</TE>
<TE>   The planners also encouraged Jensen to pursue her interest in
buying more real estate.</TE>
<TE>   She could use some of her considerable home equity, Framson said,
to help make the down payment on a rental property such as a duplex
or single-family house.</TE>
<TE>   Not only would a rental property help further diversify her
investments, but such a project also could give Jensen an outlet for
her do-it-yourself skills.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen bought her first rental at 22, doing most of the repairs
herself. After four years and a run-in with "the tenants from hell,"
Jensen barely broke even when she sold the home. Jensen believes she
will do better next time--particularly if she buys a place with her
mother or sister so she has someone to share the costs and repairs.</TE>
<TE>   After years of doing it all herself, Jensen said she was ready to
accept some help. She said the process of discussing goals and
strategies with Framson had helped her make decisions instead of
procrastinating.</TE>
<TE>   "With my portfolio, I did nothing for so long, and that just made
it worse," Jensen said. Having a game plan "gives me more confidence
to make these changes because I'm not just doing it on my own."</TE>
<TE>   Editor's Note: In the Money Make-Over published Feb. 19, the
make-over subject was incorrectly advised that she could contribute
as much as $12,000 annually to a Roth IRA. In fact, the Roth IRA
contribution limit for individuals is $3,000 a year.</TE>

<HD>Trading Is Light as Investors Wait for Fed</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Major stock indexes end day mixed. Oil prices
top $25 a barrel, helping boost energy shares. The dollar rebounds
against yen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Action on Wall Street slowed sharply Monday as investors awaited
Federal Reserve policymakers' meeting today.</LD>
<LD>   In commodities trading crude oil futures rose above $25 a barrel.
In currency markets the dollar resurged against the yen after recent
weakness.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials ended down 29.48 points, or 0.3%, at
10,577.75. The Nasdaq composite inched up 8.76 points, or 0.5%, to
1,877.06.</LD>
<TE>   Winners topped losers by 18 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange
and by 19 to 16 on Nasdaq. But trading volume was light.</TE>
<TE>   Smaller stocks showed more strength than blue chips: The Standard
&amp; Poor's small-cap 600 index gained 0.9%. It's up 6% this year,
compared with a 1.5% gain for the blue chip S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark short-term interest
rate unchanged today at a 40-year low of 1.75%.</TE>
<TE>   But given the surprising strength of economic data in recent
months, the central bank also is expected to shift its "bias" on
rates to neutral--meaning that it believes the risks now are balanced
between further economic weakness and stronger-than-expected growth
that could fuel inflation.</TE>
<TE>   For the last year the Fed's bias has been to assume that the major
risk is of a weaker economy.</TE>
<TE>   "People are nervous about the Fed raising rates" in the near
future, Mark Bronzo, who oversees $2.9 billion at Groupama Asset
Management, told Bloomberg News. If the Fed shifts to a neutral
stance "it will not be interpreted positively" by investors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other analysts, however, argue that markets already are braced for
the Fed to change to a neutral stance. Still, stock and bond
investors alike will be focusing on the language the Fed uses in its
official statement (expected to be released about 11:15 a.m. PST) for
clues as to how soon the central bank may begin raising rates.</TE>
<TE>   Longer-term Treasury bond yields have risen sharply in recent
weeks, in part on the assumption that the Fed will be tightening
credit by mid-year. On Monday long-term yields were little changed.
The 10-year T-note yield ended at 5.30%, down from 5.33% on Friday.
The yield hit 5.41% on Thursday, the highest since June.</TE>
<TE>   In other trading, oil prices continued to rise after the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday said it
had no plans to boost production soon. Near-term crude futures in New
York gained 60 cents to $25.11 a barrel, the highest in nearly six
months. The price was $19.84 a barrel at year's end.</TE>
<TE>   Oil's advance helped boost energy stocks. ChevronTexaco added 56
cents to $90.36 and Amerada Hess rose $1.17 to $75.91.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers also were attracted to shares in such industries as
biotech, health maintenance organizations and entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   Gainers in biotech included Amgen, up $1.07 to $62.48, and
Genentech, up $1.86 to $53.31.</TE>
<TE>   Among HMOs, Anthem rose $1.40 to $58.30 and Coventry Health gained
$1.56 to $27.30.</TE>
<TE>   In the entertainment sector Viacom class B shares gained $1.48 to
$51.02 and Hispanic Broadcasting surged $2.55 to $31.65.</TE>
<TE>   Gold mining stocks also were strong, after recent profit-taking.
Goldcorp jumped $1.12 to $15.65.</TE>
<TE>   In currency markets the dollar jumped to 131.33 yen in New York
from 129.18 on Friday, the biggest one-day gain in 11 months, as more
traders shifted back to the dollar after recently favoring the yen.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said rising conviction about a U.S. economic recovery,
while Japan continues to struggle, may encourage Japanese investors
to invest in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Nikkei 225 stock index, which has surged in recent weeks, fell
1.3% to 11,498.38 on Monday.</TE>

<HD>States Fight for More Microsoft Penalties</HD>
<DH>Antitrust: Judge is urged to force firm to reveal
blueprints of its Internet Explorer browser and bundle rival
software.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER Jr.</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Pressing their landmark antitrust battle against Microsoft Corp.,
nine states Monday urged a federal judge to force the company to
release the code for its Internet Explorer browser and include some
rival software products with each copy of Windows.</LD>
<LD>   On the first day of an unusual court proceeding to determine how
to stop the software giant from violating federal antitrust laws,
nine states and the District of Columbia said the company should face
tougher remedies than have been proposed in a separate settlement
reached by Microsoft and the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   "Internet Explorer, your honor, is the fruit of Microsoft's
statutory violations and it should be denied to them," said Brendan
Sullivan, the lead attorney for the nine states that have refused to
settle with Microsoft.</LD>
<TE>   Sullivan said forcing the company to bundle the competing Java
programming language with Windows and reveal the blueprints for
Internet Explorer, which dominates the Web browser market after a
bitter battle with rival Netscape, would level the playing field with
other competitors.</TE>
<TE>   But Microsoft lead trial lawyer Dan K. Webb denounced the states'
proposal, saying it would force the company to offer more than 4,000
"mutant versions" of its flagship computer operating system.</TE>
<TE>   "It will have a devastating effect on Microsoft," Webb said.
"They're actually much worse than the structural remedy" of breaking
Microsoft into two companies that the Justice Department and the
states initially sought.</TE>
<TE>   Webb added: "It would damage Microsoft's ability to innovate ...
which is to the detriment of consumers."</TE>
<TE>   The proceeding Monday before U.S. District Judge Colleen
Kollar-Kotelly was held to outline the arguments and evidence that
will be presented by both sides during a trial that is expected to
last two months.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides made opening statements and the first witness in the
proceedings, Sun Microsystems Inc. executive Richard Green, was
cross-examined by Microsoft lawyer Steve Holley.</TE>
<TE>   Holley quizzed Green for nearly three hours about the intricacies
of Sun's Java programming language, saying that licensing terms for
Java were similar to Windows and suggesting that Microsoft should be
free to develop its own substitute for Java.</TE>
<TE>   The unusual proceedings come a week after Kollar-Kotelly heard the
Justice Department and nine other states present a 21-page settlement
accord that, among other things, prevents Microsoft from barring
computer makers from installing some non-Microsoft products on
Windows computers.</TE>
<TE>   The accord also bars Microsoft from retaliating against PC makers
for using non-Microsoft products and requires the software giant to
reveal some technical details about Windows so software developers
can make compatible products.</TE>
<TE>   The dissenting states--California, Iowa, Utah, Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Kansas, Florida, Minnesota, West Virginia and the
District of Columbia--say that deal does not protect consumers or
restore competition for computer operating systems, where Microsoft's
flagship Windows runs more than 90% of all personal computers.</TE>
<TE>   To address the alleged shortcomings, the dissenting states want
Microsoft to sell a "modular" version of Windows that would allow
computer makers to select their own substitutes for so-called
middleware products such as Web browsers and media players.</TE>
<TE>   They also want to force Microsoft to disclose more technical
details to rival developers about the inner workings of Windows as
well as details about Microsoft's key Internet commerce initiative,
.Net, which critics fear could dominate the market for Web services.</TE>
<TE>   In a spirited defense with a flurry of charts and graphics
displayed on screens in the courtroom, Webb asserted that the states'
plan would result in the confiscation of billions of dollars worth of
Microsoft's intellectual property and force the company to withdraw
Windows from the market.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly, who is overseeing both the settlement and the
state trial phases of the penalty proceedings, must decide whether to
impose tougher penalties or modify or finalize the settlement deal
already on the table.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's trial she cautioned both sides that the goal of
the proceedings "is to restore competition; punishment is not the
goal under antitrust."</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said it plans to call its top Microsoft executives as
witnesses. It is uncertain if company Chairman Bill Gates will
testify. During a videotaped deposition four years ago, Gates turned
in a damaging performance, appearing detached and evasive.</TE>

<HD>Andersen Workers Reeling</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Facing possible job losses, the firm's
employees in Los Angeles say a criminal indictment represents unjust
punishment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying they have been betrayed by the federal government, Andersen
employees in Los Angeles on Monday vowed that their 88-year-old
accounting firm would battle a criminal indictment until "the bitter
end."</LD>
<LD>   Employees said the indictment of the firm on charges of
obstruction of justice for its destruction of Enron Corp.-related
documents represented an unjust and oversized punishment for the
actions of a handful of individuals. Most fear the loss of their
jobs, retirement investments and personal reputations.</LD>
<LD>   At Andersen's Los Angeles office, employees had posted photos of
company founder Arthur Andersen and his successor, Leonard Spacek, on
a wall near a bank of elevators. Workers had scribbled dozens of
quotations underneath, including one from formerly imprisoned South
African leader Nelson Mandela.</LD>
<TE>   Outside, scores of workers also marched through downtown L.A. at
midday, with a few carrying signs claiming the indictment was
unfounded. Already stunned and fearful over the swift fall of their
employer, Andersen workers lately have begun injecting their public
comments with rage.</TE>
<TE>   "What concerns me is that our government, which I've always had
faith in, would indict an entire firm and hurt 88,000 people because
of a few, with really no facts to back it up," said Laurie Carlson, a
56-year-old administrative assistant who has been with the company
for more than seven years. "It's not justice at all."</TE>
<TE>   Carlson was one of 10 Los Angeles area employees assembled by
Andersen to be interviewed together by a Times reporter Monday.</TE>
<TE>   To the workers, the indictment represents a shocking turn for a
firm that has cultivated an image as a by-the-book accounting company
with Midwestern values. Indeed, many said they applauded management
when Andersen disclosed that it had shredded documents.</TE>
<TE>   "When that first broke, and the firm said, 'We're standing up for
what we did wrong, we did things wrong, we need to take
responsibility for it,' I said, 'That's the firm that I work for.'
We're not hiding. Now all of a sudden we're put out as a scapegoat,
and that's ridiculous," said Nathan Matthews, 30, a single father of
two who works as an audit manager in the firm's Woodland Hills
office.</TE>
<TE>   But many of the employees said they had expected the company to
receive only a modest punishment, such as a settlement of civil
charges with regulators. The SEC reached such a settlement with
Andersen last year, fining the company $7 million and censuring it
for its handling of the financial statements of trash hauler Waste
Management Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Such settlements are fairly routine in the accounting industry.
Criminal charges are more unusual--and far more devastating, because
a conviction is more likely to result in the company being barred
from auditing public companies.</TE>
<TE>   Employees in the Los Angeles office said they were led to believe
Andersen was moving closer to a settlement until last week, when news
reports indicated an indictment was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until that point, all of our communications were along the
lines of, 'We're working through this,'" said Barbara Cabello, 37, an
auditor whose husband is a partner in the firm. "I don't think the
partners ever saw this coming."</TE>
<TE>   Cabello and other employees said they planned to remain at the
firm even while acknowledging that some colleagues have been seeking
to jump to rival accounting giants. The workers said they did not
begrudge those who tried to depart--Andersen is expected to lay off
thousands of employees worldwide beginning as early as this week.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone has their own needs to look out for," said Paul Sachs,
48, a partner who has been with Andersen for more than 25 years.
"You've got a young father over here, who certainly has to be
concerned about his future. I've got kids ready to go to college.
Everyone's needs are different.</TE>
<TE>   "But think of the message this holds for corporate America. If you
come forward with issues or problems, look at the consequences you
create for your organization."</TE>

<HD>Qwest Amends $4-Billion Bank Credit Agreement</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scrambling to relieve a cash crunch, Qwest Communications
International Inc. said Monday it had amended its $4-billion bank
credit agreement to allow it to carry a higher percentage of debt on
its books.</LD>
<LD>   The Denver-based company, the dominant local phone company in 14
states from Minnesota to Washington state, whose accounting practices
are the subject of a preliminary probe by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said it has enough cash and borrowings under its credit
pact to pay debt maturing in the next 12 months and to fund its
capital and operating expenses.</LD>
<LD>   Under the amended bank credit agreement, Qwest is allowed a
maximum debt-to-cash-flow ratio of 4.25 through Sept. 30. It must
lower that ratio to 4.0 in the following two quarters.</LD>
<TE>   Without the amendment, Qwest ran the risk of defaulting on the
previous limit of 3.75, analysts said. Its total debt stands at about
$25billion.</TE>
<TE>   Although Qwest won more breathing room, analysts said the company
faces several long-term challenges, such as the SEC probe, weak
investor confidence and slim revenue growth.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Qwest closed at $9.01, up 33 cents, or 3.8%, on the New
York Stock Exchange. The shares have plunged about 77% over the last
12 months.</TE>

<LD>Business travelers quickly adjusted to the changes in the nation's
air travel system after Sept. 11. But the biggest challenges may lie
ahead as airport security measures tighten further and passenger
traffic returns to previous levels. In the meantime, frequent fliers
have launched a quiet rebellion against the airlines' fare system by
finding cheaper alternatives. For more, please see Business Travel,

<LD>Diversified Marketing Service Corp., an Oklahoma telemarketing
company, and its subsidiaries were ordered to pay $39 million for
misleading consumers about the costs of magazine subscriptions.</LD>
<LD>   A U.S. district judge in Oklahoma City said Diversified and
President H.G. Kuykendall Jr. violated terms of a 1996 Federal Trade
Commission settlement barring the company from using deceptive
selling practices.</LD>
<LD>   The penalty is the largest assessed since new telemarketing
guidelines were put in place six years ago, the Federal Trade
Commission said.</LD>
<TE>   An attorney for the defendants did not return a call for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers who think they have been billed improperly by the
companies can call a special FTC hotline at (202) 326-2853.</TE>

<LD>Ms., the feminist magazine founded in 1971, will accept advertising
for the first time in more than a decade under its new owners, the
nonprofit Feminist Majority Foundation.</LD>
<LD>   Ms. will accept advertising only from nonprofit companies and will
itself become a nonprofit, said Feminist Majority President Eleanor
Smeal. The Feminist Majority bought Ms. in November from a group of
women investors who had owned it since 1998. The organization is
moving the magazine from New York to Beverly Hills.</LD>
<LD>   Ms. will be published quarterly the first year, then return to
publication every two months in the second year, Smeal said.</LD>

<LD>The Treasury Department sold $13 billion in three-month bills at a
discount rate of 1.84%, up from 1.825% last week. An additional $13
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 2.07%, up from
2.02%.</LD>
<LD>   The three-month rate was the highest since Nov. 26, when the bills
sold for 1.92%. The six-month rate was the highest since Oct. 22,
when the rate was 2.13%.</LD>
<LD>   The new discount rates understate the actual return to
investors--1.874% for three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,953.50, and 2.12% for a six-month bill selling for $9,895.40.</LD>
<TE>   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said that the average
yield for one-year constant-maturity Treasury bills, the most popular
index for making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, rose to 2.58%
last week from 2.41% the previous week.</TE>

take to TRW Inc.'s shareholder meeting in April, urging TRW's board
to reconsider its $5.9-billion takeover offer.</LD>
<LD>   The resolutions call for TRW to set up a committee of independent
directors to consider Northrop's $47-a-share unsolicited bid and to
give Northrop access to key financial information.</LD>
<LD>   Northrop said in its filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission that it's willing to engage in discussions with TRW,
"including evaluating a potential increase in the proposed
consideration if TRW provides nonpublic information which warrants
such an increase."</LD>
<TE>   TRW rejected Northrop's offer last week and announced its own
plans to boost shareholder value, including spinning off its
automotive parts unit within nine months.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said TRW's proposal makes the company more valuable and
that Northrop Grumman will have to raise its offer.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts expect TRW's breakup proposal to deliver a value of
$50 to $55 a share for shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop Grumman's bid values TRW at $47 a share.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop, which owns a handful of TRW shares, plans to present its
proposals at TRW's annual general meeting on April 24.</TE>
<TE>   Separately Monday, British aerospace and defense company Smiths
Group was reported to be seriously considering a bid for TRW's
aeronautics business.</TE>
<TE>   "A business like this does not come up for sale very often," a
person familiar with the talks told Reuters.</TE>
<TE>   Much of TRW's aeronautics business is the former Lucas Aerospace
operation in the West Midlands region of Britain, making a bid from
Smiths logical.</TE>
<TE>   If Smiths puts in a bid and succeeds, it would further strengthen
its ties with European aircraft maker Airbus as a customer. Smiths
already has strong ties with Boeing Co .</TE>
<TE>   TRW has not stamped a price tag on the business but analysts and
bankers say the Ohio-based group could get $1.3 billion to $1.5
billion.</TE>
<TE>   United Technologies Corp. and Honeywell International Inc. also
have been described as potential buyers.</TE>
<TE>   A sale of TRW's aeronautics business combined with progress in
spinning off its auto parts business could influence TRW shareholders
from refraining from voting in favor of the Northrop bid.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, Cleveland-based TRW rose 53 cents
to $51.37. Los Angeles-based Northrop fell 40 cents to $108.75.</TE>

<HD>Two L.A. Law Firms Expand Office Space</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two downtown Los Angeles law firms extended their office leases and
expanded to larger quarters recently to accommodate growing
practices.</LD>
<LD>   Howrey, Simon, Arnold &amp; White signed a 14-year, $41-million lease
extension that increases its space to 100,498 square feet from 63,000
square feet on the 11th, 12th, 14th and 15th floors and half of the
10th floor at 550 S. Hope St.</LD>
<LD>   Howrey Simon needs the space to accommodate growth in its core
practice groups of intellectual property, antitrust, insurance
recovery, securities, white collar crime and environmental
litigation, said Tom Nolan, managing partner.</LD>
<TE>   The expansion is the third in Southern California in recent months
for Howrey Simon, which expanded its Century City and Irvine offices
in the fall, recently opened a London office and plans to open a
Brussels office in May.</TE>
<TE>   Howrey Simon, which includes 500 attorneys in eight offices
worldwide, was represented by Clay Hammerstein and Steve Bay of
Insignia/ESG. The landlord, Equity Office, was represented in-house
by Brendan McCracken.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, D'Amato, Brisbois &amp; Bisgaard signed a six-year, $25-million
extension that increases its space by 20,000 square feet to 117,000
square feet at 221 N. Figueroa St.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis D'Amato was represented by Craig McKenna of Julien J.
Studley Inc. Landlord W9/Figueroa Realty was represented by
Hammerstein, Bay, Derek Graham and Eric Duncanson of Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   The firm includes 280 attorneys at six offices in California. The
two law firm leases are among a number of large, long-term
commitments to office space by downtown L.A. tenants in recent
months, according to an Insignia/ESG report, which called the
downtown market "one of the few exceptions to" the downturn in U.S.
office markets.</TE>
<TE>   The vacancy rate in downtown office space remains at 20%, but the
amount of occupied downtown office space rose last year while falling
in most office markets in Southern California and the nation.</TE>

<HD>Citigroup to Ease Banking for Mexicans</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citigroup Inc., the No. 1 U.S. financial services firm, said Monday
that it will ease the way for Mexican immigrants to open bank
accounts, a step that could help them send billions of dollars back
to Mexico every year.</LD>
<LD>   The move comes as the U.S. government increases efforts to monitor
cross-border financial activity after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The plans will help Citibank, Citigroup's consumer finance unit,
gain access to the almost $8.9 billion wired across the Mexico-United
States border and allow it to market other simple banking products to
communities long left out of the banking loop, said Robert
Lacoursiere, Latin American banking analyst at Lehman Bros.</LD>
<TE>   "This speaks volumes about how Citibank is trying to tailor itself
to the Mexican market," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup, which last year acquired Mexico's leading bank, Grupo
Financiero Banamex Accival, for $12.5 billion, said the plan was a
way to tap the Latino market in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup has a long history in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to deepen our relationship with the Hispanic community
and look forward to providing a wide range of financial services to
this vibrant and growing sector of the U.S. population," said Maura
Markus, president of Citibank North America.</TE>
<TE>   Citibank's initiative will allow Mexican immigrants with
identification cards from Mexico's 44 consulates in the U.S. to open
an account at Citibank's 445 financial centers around the country.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican government officials welcomed the deal, saying it will
help its citizens gain access to the financial system.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Citigroup fell 14 cents to $49.55 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>California Hotel Sales Down 13% in 2001</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The number of California hotel properties that changed hands in 2001
dropped 13% from the previous year but the value of the transactions
continued to rise, according to an industry survey.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly 270 individual hotel properties were sold last year for
$1.31billion, a nearly 20% increase from the year before, according
to Atlas Hospitality Group, a Costa Mesa-based hotel broker and
consulting firm. The increase in volume surprised analysts and
reflected the effect of some large sales, including the 492-room La
Costa Resort &amp; Spa in Carlsbad that sold for $120 million--last
year's biggest transaction. Another major sale involved Le Meridien
in Beverly Hills, which fetched $82.3 million.</LD>
<LD>   In Southern California, the number of hotel sales fell by more
than 15% to 175 properties but the dollar volume surged by more than
30% to $811.9 million.</LD>
<TE>   Sales dropped sharply after the Sept. 11 attacks and transactions
have remained depressed this year, said Alan X. Reay, president of
Atlas. However, Reay said he expects activity to pick up, in part
because of the growing number of bankrupt and poorly performing hotel
properties.</TE>

<HD>Metromedia Fiber May Seek Protection</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Dow Jones, Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. said Monday that it might be forced to
seek bankruptcy protection if it can't restructure its debts.</LD>
<LD>   The New York-based company, which builds fiber-optic networks in
cities, also said it may default on notes held by Verizon
Communications and intends to defer payment of about $30 million in
interest that was due Friday on $975million of convertible notes
issued to Verizon. Metromedia is negotiating with Verizon, but the
company said it could default on the debt if it fails to reach an
agreement or doesn't make an interest payment within a 30-day grace
period.</LD>
<LD>   Metromedia said it had $3.3 billion in consolidated debt and about
$37.3 million in cash as of Feb. 28. If it is unable to restructure
its debt, the company said, it may be required to file for protection
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Metromedia closed Monday down 18 cents, or 67%, at 9
cents on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Though backed by billionaire investor John Kluge, Metromedia has
had a difficult time attracting funding during the downturn in the
telecommunications sector.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal court hearing on Walt Disney Co.'s request for an
injunction to prevent satellite broadcaster EchoStar Communications
Corp. from dropping Disney's ABC Family channel has been postponed so
the two sides could pursue a deal, the companies said.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing, scheduled for Monday, was postponed for two more
weeks, an EchoStar spokesman said. A spokesman for Disney said both
sides asked U.S. District Judge Gary Feess for more time to pursue a
deal.</LD>
<LD>   In December, EchoStar, the No. 2 U.S. satellite broadcaster, said
it would drop ABC Family because of what it claimed were low ratings.
EchoStar also cited a provision in its affiliate agreement with ABC
Family that allows the broadcaster to drop the channel after a change
in its control.</LD>

<HD>Disney Confirms Animation Cuts</HD>
<DH>Media: More than 200 layoffs are planned. Schumacher tells
employees that the company is not forsaking its traditional
hand-drawn style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER and RICHARD VERRIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walt Disney Studios Animation President Thomas Schumacher officially
informed his senior executives and top creative staff Monday of plans
to lay off as many as 265 employees at its Burbank facility over the
next year.</LD>
<LD>   The cuts will reduce the staff from 1,300 to about 1,000 by May
2003, are part of Walt Disney Co.'s ongoing retrenchment of its
cornerstone animation business.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, Disney animation shed 500 jobs because of escalating
production and labor costs and slashed animators' salaries by 30% to
50%.</LD>
<TE>   The cutbacks come as the animation industry is redefining itself
at a rapid pace as computer-generated movies have overshadowed those
made in the traditional hand-drawn style that Disney invented. This
was underscored lastweekend by the blockbuster $48-million debut of
20th Century Fox's "Ice Age" and by 2001's runaway hits "Monsters,
Inc.," from Disney/Pixar Animation Studios, and DreamWorks/PDI's
"Shrek."</TE>
<TE>   In Monday's meetings Schumacher said Disney was not pulling out of
the traditional animation business.</TE>
<TE>   "We're an ambidextrous studio that can create traditional and
digital movies," Schumacher said in an interview Monday. "We're not
going out of the traditional business but we are expanding our
digital business."</TE>
<TE>   Studios such as Disney no longer are putting animators under
expensive, long-term contracts and increasingly are outsourcing work.
For example, Disney's lower-cost sequel, "Jungle Book 2," due next
year, is being animated in Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Schumacher said Disney is committing $1 million to retrain
traditional artists to work on computers.</TE>
<TE>   This year, Disney will release two traditional animated features,
"Lilo &amp; Stich" and "Treasure Planet."</TE>
<TE>   In 2003, Disney and Pixar will roll out a computer-animated
underwater adventure, "Finding Nemo," followed by Disney's
traditionally made "Sweating Bullets."</TE>
<TE>   The job cuts were anticipated in the animation community.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no surprise to anyone in our business considering what's
been going on in the last two years at Disney," said Ron Diamond,
co-publisher of online news outlet Animation World. "I don't think
they're losing confidence in animation.... they're restructuring
their whole business organization."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hulett, business representative for the local cartoonists
union, said the mood among workers was one of "glum resignation,"
noting "the world of animation is changing dramatically from what it
was four or five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 18 months, Disney has not only scaled back its
animation ranks but also slashed 4,000 jobs companywide in response
to the sluggish economy.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Adds to Plan for Corporate Reforms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Public Employees' Retirement System added a number of
staff recommendations to a corporate-governance reform agenda
announced in February, as the giant pension fund seeks to pressure
companies to change oversight procedures in the wake of Enron Corp.'s
collapse.</LD>
<LD>   CalPERS last month said it would use its vast shareholdings to
block auditors from also performing consulting for clients, and would
draft a proposal to reform standards for accounting and disclosure.</LD>
<LD>   The program additions adopted Monday include demands that
corporate board audit committees have full access to company books
and records, and that the committees should have access to their own
resources subject only to overall budgetary control by an independent
board.</LD>
<TE>   The $150-billion fund said audit committees should meet at least
once a quarter, review the firm's internal audit functions at least
annually, and have at least one meeting a year with the external
auditor that does not include any company employees.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Diageo, the biggest distiller, has been approached by buyout firms
Bain Capital Inc., Blackstone Group and Texas Pacific Group about a
possible purchase of the company's Burger King unit, according to
people familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   London-based Diageo has said it plans to divest itself of the
second-largest hamburger chain through a share sale or buyout after
unloading its Pillsbury food unit last year to focus on drinks such
as Smirnoff vodka and Guinness beer.</LD>
<LD>   Management also may participate in a buyout, which may fetch as
much as $2.1billion, analysts said.</LD>
<TE>   Spokesmen for Bain, Blackstone and Texas Pacific Group declined to
comment. Diageo executives didn't return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Diageo said it sold its Glen Ellen wine business to
Franzia Winery of Ripton, Calif., for an undisclosed sum. The
transaction includes the Glen Ellen and MG Vallejo brands, global
trademark rights and all Glen Ellen inventory but does not include
vineyards.</TE>

<LD>Online ticket seller Travelocity.com Inc. urged shareholders to
accept a $420-million takeover bid from Sabre Holdings Corp. after
the reservations giant sweetened its offer by 22%.</LD>
<LD>   Should shareholders follow Travelocity's recommendation and accept
the $28-per-share bid, the merger would create one of the world's
most far-reaching travel companies, offering reservation services to
everyone from travel agents and corporate clients to Web-savvy
bargain hunters.</LD>
<LD>   It also would reunite two former allies. Sabre spun off
Travelocity.com in March 2000 through a reverse merger with Preview
Travel but maintained a 30% equity stake and a 15% voting stake in
the company.</LD>
<TE>   Travelocity shares rose $1.07 to $27.97 on Nasdaq. Sabre fell 1

Hollywood Boulevard and Western Avenue in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   * The renovation of the Aliso Village public housing project in
East Los Angeles into a mixed-use project that includes 400 units of

<HD>Investors Eyeing Junk Securities</HD>
<DH>Funds: The sector continues to get new cash, with $1.23
billion last week. A reduced risk of default fuels interest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With the economy apparently reviving, some investors are betting that
the corporate junk bond sector will be a big beneficiary.</LD>
<LD>   Junk bond mutual funds attracted $1.23 billion in net new cash in
the week ended Wednesday, the most in five years, according to a
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. report of AMG Data Services figures.</LD>
<LD>   The surge of new money into junk funds has helped drive yields on
the bonds sharply lower in recent weeks, as fund managers bid
aggressively for securities.</LD>
<TE>   A yield index of 100 junk bonds tracked by KDP Investment Advisors
closed at 10.34% on Monday, down from 11.29% on Feb. 22. The index is
at its lowest level in more than one year.</TE>
<TE>   Falling yields have boosted the value of existing junk securities,
in turn helping returns on junk bond funds to rebound. The average
total return (interest earnings plus net share price change) of junk
funds year to date was 0.8% as of Thursday, according to Lipper Inc.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, many other bond fund categories have negative total
returns so far this year, as yields on higher-quality bonds
(especially U.S. Treasuries) have risen even as junk yields have
declined.</TE>
<TE>   Air carrier Northwest Airlines Corp. and clothing maker Perry
Ellis International Inc. are part of a flood of junk-rated firms
selling new debt to take advantage of rising demand.</TE>
<TE>   Investors are hungrier for junk debt in part because strong
economic data suggest that fewer junk-issuing companies will be at
risk of default. Defaults soared last year as the economy fell into
recession and more companies struggled to pay their bills.</TE>
<TE>   Junk bond yields still are historically high relative to other
interest rates, reflecting the risk that the economic recovery will
falter, analysts said. The KDP yield index now is more than five
percentage points above the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. In
mid-1999 the "spread" between the KDP yield and the 10-year T-note
was 4.10 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Heavy buying of junk bond funds shows that "people are making a
bet that the market has bottomed," said Brendan White, a fund manager
at Fort Washington Investment Advisors Inc., which manages $1.1
billion of junk assets.</TE>
<TE>   With the window open for junk-rated companies to issue new debt,
total junk offerings last week almost doubled from the prior period,
to about $3.1 billion. Investors suddenly are finding that there's
not enough new supply to go around.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, fund manager Kurt Havnaer tried to buy $2 million of
a $300-million offering from Graphic Packaging Corp. last month for
the high-yield assets he helps manage at Columbia Management Co.
Demand was so strong that the banks managing the sale allotted him
just $500,000, he said. "There's so much demand for new issues, the
allocations are not very good," Havnaer said.</TE>
<TE>   But the rate of junk fund cash inflows may not last, some analysts
warn. Many market timers play junk funds for quick returns.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately some of this could be the hot money, that may go
back out a week later," said Martin Fridson, a high yield bond
strategist at Merrill Lynch. "It's not unusual to see a couple of
weeks where it's realistic to suppose the money is a lot of market
timers."</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Invesco Funds Group has replaced Trent May and Doug McEldowney as
managers of Invesco Growth Fund, which lost 49% last year and ranked
in the bottom 1% in its sector. Invesco said the fund will be managed
by Timothy Miller, Peter Lovell and Fritz Meyer, other growth-fund
managers at the firm.</TE>

<DH>Packing a Little Differently Keeps Chicago Traveler From
Having to Check Bags</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT CROSS</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At 6:15 a.m., Judy Langford pulls her little black carry-on bag and
attached briefcase down the back steps of the Evanston, Ill.,
condominium she shares with her husband, Bob Thompson, the pastor at
nearby Lake Street Church. Coffee in hand, Thompson waves goodbye.
Mornings like this have long been part of the family routine. In the
alley, driver James Nesbitt opens the trunk of his red Lincoln Town
Car, which easily swallows the baggage.</LD>
<LD>   The big monthly meeting would be taking place as usual, so
Langford is facing a four-day week at the Washington headquarters of
her employer, the Center for the Study of Social Policy. It's a big
place--part think tank, part social service advocate funded by major
foundations.</LD>
<LD>   As a senior fellow, Langford initiates and implements projects
"having an impact on the most disadvantaged people." That can cover a
broad area--whether figuring out ways to use day-care centers to help
prevent child abuse or helping local social welfare agencies get
together to share ideas.</LD>
<TE>   Once a month, the project managers meet for a few days at the
headquarters on I Street and report on their progress. At other
times, Langford may be running around the country to work with
community leaders in poor areas.</TE>
<TE>   At any rate, Langford travels a lot, and when it came time for
another routine visit to the office March 4, she was ready. She
booked a ticket on United Airlines' 8:15 a.m. Flight 604, from
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, through the airline's
Internet site. She reserved a ride from J&amp;J Limousine, an Evanston
car service. And she packed. Carefully.</TE>
<TE>   The terrorist attacks hardly made a dent in Langford's routine.
Almost as soon as airliners were flying again, she was riding them
and feeling no fear.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been sort of fatalistic that way," she says. In fact,
she arrived at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport the day it
reopened after being closed because of the attacks. "The terminal was
almost totally empty. United employees stood there and applauded us
when we came out of the jet way."</TE>
<TE>   The attacks mainly affected the way she handles luggage: "I do pay
more attention to not ever checking a bag if I can help it. I pack a
little differently. If I'm going to be gone four days, I try to find
jackets and scarves that will go with the same pair of black slacks.
I only bring one pair of shoes--that's the key."</TE>
<TE>   On the way to O'Hare, Langford and driver Nesbitt talk about how
their children are doing. Nesbitt also tells her that business lately
has been good.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Sept. 11, I'm back to about 90% of what I had before," he
says. "The days afterwards, I was down to 75%. The business people
kept on traveling, but the vacationers just stopped."</TE>
<TE>   At O'Hare, after making some tentative arrangements for a Thursday
evening pickup, she marches off to join the long, snaking security
line.</TE>
<TE>   A lot of the travelers appear dressed for business, and many have
their notebook computers out of their cases by the time the line
nears the X-ray machines. Langford often travels without her
laptop--especially when she is bound for headquarters, which has all
the latest communications gear. Now that security can take so long,
Langford wants nothing to impede her progress any more than
necessary, and sometimes the presence of electronic equipment
triggers a thorough inspection.</TE>
<TE>   But today it goes smoothly. Langford is striding up the B
concourse only 17 minutes after arriving at the terminal door. She
has time for a yogurt and orange juice at United's Red Carpet Club, a
sprawling gray expanse filled with travelers working cell phones and
laptops.</TE>
<TE>   Langford picks up her boarding pass and eats her breakfast. Soon
she is back on the concourse. She buys a Chicago Tribune and a New
York Times at a newsstand and pulls her trolley toward the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Flights to Washington these days get an extra dose of security. A
man with a badge inspects Langford's boarding pass and photo ID. She
takes a few more steps, and a security inspector motions her aside;
she is asked to put her cases on the table for a search. Meanwhile,
another inspector tells her to spread her arms while he runs a metal
detector over her gray-and-black outfit.</TE>
<TE>   This is a "selective inspection." Not every Washington-bound
passenger has to undergo one. Langford asks the woman pawing through
her suitcase, "Why did you select me?"</TE>
<TE>   "Well, you were walking toward me. You were right here," the
inspector replies. She holds up a tiny black object. "What's this?"
"Those are tweezers," Langford informs her. "I've been carrying those
with me for years."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how they let you," the inspector says. "I'll have to
keep it."</TE>
<TE>   Langford shrugs and boards the plane.</TE>
<TE>   It's not quite full this Monday. Sometimes she sees the same
people on the morning Washington flight. It's like a regular commute.
Once she was squeezed into a middle seat between U.S. Reps. Henry J.
Hyde and Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois. ("They were both quite
nice.")</TE>
<TE>   Today it's all strange faces, so she reads the papers--including
the sports sections, to get a leg up on the office March Madness
pool--and feels certain that the plane will get there in an hour and
20 minutes as promised.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing that is very different since Sept. 11," she says, "is
that now there's a reasonable number of airplanes flying. You're on
time! You're basically on time. And people tell you what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Flight 604 arrives at 10:57, two minutes ahead of schedule.
Without a glance at baggage claim, Langford joins the taxi line and
boards one in less than five minutes. Twelve minutes later she is
standing in front of her office building.</TE>
<TE>   She'll be about 25 minutes late for her 11 a.m. meeting with the
other project managers, but that was to be expected. Getting up at
5a.m. for an 8:15 flight is early enough. Besides, the way things
tend to go these days, she could have been much later.</TE>

<HD>A Day of Clear Skies / For businesspeople who still need to
fly, keeping up with the many changes is a must. Four frequent fliers
who hit the tarmac March 4 offer insights on navigating the nation's
airports.</HD>
<DH>Getting an Early Start Keeps L.A. Traveler Organized</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Accustomed to gaining a head start, David Lizarraga thinks nothing of
beginning this particular work week on a Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   As president and chief executive of the East Los Angeles Community
Union, a Los Angeles nonprofit community development corporation
known by its acronym Telacu, Lizarraga is the host of a fund-raising
dinner for L.A. Opera at the company-owned restaurant Tamayo.</LD>
<LD>   Between taking occasional jabs at his plate of sizzling carne
asada, Lizarraga whispers intimately with his wife, Priscilla, chats
up potential donors and then uses a microphone to address the group
of 150 about the importance of giving back to their community. He
pledges the use of the restaurant on a yearly basis for the
fund-raiser and then introduces a current Telacu scholarship
recipient whose soprano voice wows the audience.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, Lizarraga tears himself out of the beautiful room. He
kisses his wife, waves to some attendees and briskly heads for the
door. He has a plane to catch. He is late.</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that it is 7:45 p.m. and his red-eye flight to
Washington on United Airlines departs at 10:20 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to be there at least two hours ahead of time," says a
hurried Lizarraga, jumping into his black Ford Explorer.</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga--dressed in his evening garb of black linen shirt, black
dress pants and a dressy black blazer--points out his favorite route
from the Eastside of Los Angeles to Los Angeles International Airport
about 25 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   He dashes on Olympic Boulevard to the 710 Freeway and connects to
the 105, coasting along a clear freeway to the Airport Boulevard exit
that leads him to Wally Park, a garage where he will drop off his
car.</TE>
<TE>   The car attendant, Neil, greets Lizarraga with a familiar smile
and asks him if he has everything he needs from his SUV. "You have
your cell phone with you?"</TE>
<TE>   He does, and he thanks Neil for asking as he boards the garage's
shuttle bus to the airport. He is at LAX Terminal 7 in less than five
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   During the quick ride, Lizarraga pulls out a zip-up plastic bag
from his black leather briefcase and empties his pockets. Everything
goes into the clear plastic bag, including his favorite pen, cell
phone, Palm Pilot, jewelry, wallet and some change, and then the bag
goes into his briefcase. A few pounds lighter, he is ready to breeze
through the airport security scanner with no problem.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all in one Ziploc bag. Now there's nothing in my pockets,
except for paper money. I've got everything organized. I have no
metal, I have my ID out, I have my ticket. By the time I get there, I
have everything I need."</TE>
<TE>   Checking in at the United counter, he says he has no luggage to
check. By packing light with apparel that can be mixed and matched,
Lizarraga never checks his baggage.</TE>
<TE>   Although he is president of a $150-million company with 1,200
employees, Lizarraga never books anything but coach class. Instead,
he uses his frequent-flier miles to get upgraded and usually gets his
request.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are the only perks you get. I mean, I would never pay what
it costs to go business class or first class. We have a budget. You
watch your miles and try to save, especially when you fly as much as
I do."</TE>
<TE>   With three people ahead of Lizarraga, his garment bag, roll-on
suitcase and briefcase get scanned quickly and he is past the check
point in three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   He then immediately retrieves the plastic bag from his briefcase
and empties it, replacing the cell phone in his coat pocket, the
wallet in his pants, the pen, his ring, his watch.</TE>
<TE>   "You put everything back right away so things are where they
belong," Lizarraga says, stepping onto the escalator that leads him
to United's Red Carpet Lounge area.</TE>
<TE>   By 8:15 p.m., he is relaxing in the executive lounge filled with
other frequent fliers.</TE>
<TE>   "I stay away from the bar," says Lizarraga, nursing a cappuccino
instead. He has two hours to spare and seems perfectly content with
that.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Sept. 11 you could afford to get [to the airport] an hour
before and get on the plane. Now it's two hours at least. Sometimes
you move pretty fast, but you never know. You just can't take a
chance.</TE>
<TE>   "To be quite honest, because of my features they usually check me
closer. I'm Mexican but I look a little Arabic, I suppose, because I
have a beard. I don't let none of that bother me. We all want to be
safe and we want to be secure, so you just go along with it."</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga, 60, has been flying for 30 years, racking up more than
a million miles on United and American Airlines, he says. He flies
three or four times a month, mostly within California but also to the
East Coast.</TE>
<TE>   His air travel has not changed since Sept. 11, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't stop flying. I just didn't feel that I should live in
fear. I need to live my life and do what I do. I think the air is
very, very safe."</TE>
<TE>   A few changes he has made in packing include using an electric
shaver instead of razors and leaving behind the scissors he used to
carry to trim his beard.</TE>
<TE>   When he travels during the day, Lizarraga uses the flying time to
work. But he deals with red-eye flights by hitting the pillow as soon
as he can. He avoids heavy dinners and drinks only water.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before boarding, he makes last-minute calls home and some
business calls.</TE>
<TE>   This night, the plane is delayed briefly and sits on the runway
for about half an hour before takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the air, Lizarraga leans his head back and knocks off
until the next morning when the captain says he is making his descent
into Dulles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   Groggy but perking up with each passing minute, Lizarraga deplanes
and is sitting inside a taxicab by 6:35 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is the middle of the night by Los Angeles time, he now
faces three days of meetings. Travel is not as glamorous as some
might think, he says.</TE>
<TE>   "Jet lag can catch up with you, especially when you're older. But
you have business to do and you get a big adrenaline rush. You crash
on the way back.</TE>
<TE>   "People say, 'Wow, what an exciting life you live lead, David. You
get to travel all over the United States....' When you come right
down to it, they're just airports and hotels," he says, as the cab
whizzes past the Pentagon and the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga is in town to attend the quarterly meeting of the board
of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.Just as the sun is rising in
chilly D.C., he arrives at the Grand Hyatt Hotel downtown by 7a.m.</TE>
<TE>   By 7:59 he has changed his clothes and trimmed his beard and is
seated at a table for six, waiting for other members of a chamber
committee. He is excited about the agenda, to talk about helping
Latino-owned companies get government contracts.</TE>
<TE>   To save time, he decides to start eating and chooses a power
breakfast from the buffet line: a double helping of scrambled eggs
with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top, bacon and sausage.</TE>
<TE>   "I do the Atkins diet once in a while to lose weight," he says. A
cup of black coffee helps further wake him up.</TE>
<TE>   But by 8:19, he begins to get antsy and calls to make sure the
chairman of the committee is on the way. Voicemail picks up. He
leaves a message.</TE>
<TE>   After eating and reviewing committee documents, Lizarraga sees it
is 8:50 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, this meeting is not going to happen," he sighs, looking at
his watch one more time. He is upset. He grimaces and says he will
take it up with the committee chairman. Is he upset he went through
the trouble of a red-eye flight to make an early meeting that did not
happen?</TE>
<TE>   "No, because I would have lost all day traveling if I left this
morning," Lizarraga says. "And now I have time to catch up, to be
prepared."</TE>
<TE>   If he had left later, a potential security breach at LAX about
6o'clock that morning probably would have delayed Lizarraga by hours,
or even a day.</TE>
<TE>   In this traveler's world, where delays are akin to sin, being on
time is worth it even if he is the only one.</TE>
<TE>   "Change happens every day, everywhere you go. I don't like the
changes after Sept. 11. But I think they're proper and we have to
work to make ourselves secure in view of the circumstances. There's
no sense crying over it. It's a fact and you deal with it."</TE>

<HD>As Delays at Airports Mount, Lounges Beckon</HD>
<DH>Restricted-access clubs offer reprieve from crowded gates
and bars but require membership for those flying coach.</DH>

<LD>With all the extra time required these days at airports for security
checks and other delays, what are travelers to do if they find
themselves ready to board but still with an hour or two to wait
before departure?</LD>
<LD>   That hallowed institution, the restricted-access airport lounge,
suddenly looks inviting. What better way to wait for a plane, instead
of being perched on a bar stool or at the crowded waiting area by the
gate?</LD>
<LD>   A quiet luxury lounge with newspapers and magazines, data ports
for laptops, free local phone calls and work desks, not to mention
free snacks and nonalcoholic drinks, offers a much more
desirable--and productive--retreat.</LD>
<TE>   "If the choice is a crowded airport bar or, heaven forbid, the
boarding area, then an airport club is a no-brainer. Choosing the
relatively calm, comparatively commodious surroundings of an airport
club makes me feel like the smartest man alive," writes Randy
Peterson, publisher of InsideFlyer magazine and a veteran frequent
flier, in a recent column.</TE>
<TE>   "That said, I feel like an absolute fool when I'm in an airport
terminal and I don't have access to an airport club."</TE>
<TE>   Most airlines offer complimentary lounge use for first-class
passengers and for those flying business class on international
flights. But what about the rest of us weary domestic travelers
paying coach steerage?</TE>
<TE>   There are several ways to join, depending on the level of
frequent-flier status obtained. Starting prices vary widely among the
top five carriers, from $325 to $475 a year; memberships with
frequent-flier status are cheaper. (The higher your status, the less
the annual fee.)</TE>
<TE>   Members can pay or use frequent-flier miles. All clubs allow
members to bring in spouses and children younger than 21, or two
guests.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a look at the five biggest U.S. airlines in terms of
passenger volume (prices given are for basic membership, which is the
most expensive):</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   American Airlines Admirals Clubs (www.aa.com, [800] 237-7971):
$450 a year, 43 clubs around the world. Many have children's
playrooms with computers for the kids. No reciprocal agreements with
other airlines, but accepts valid Ambassador Club memberships of TWA,
which American absorbed last year. Day rate: $50 per person.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   United Airlines Red Carpet Clubs (www.united.com, [866] 822-5827):
$450 a year, 44 locations in North America. United also offers
reciprocal privileges with 13 partners including Air Canada, All
Nippon Airways, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines.
Day rate: $50 per person.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Northwest Airlines WorldClubs (www.nwa.com, [800] 692-3788):
Annual membership on sale for $375 a year through April; a 60-day
trial is $85. Access to 94 WorldClubs and certain lounges run by KLM,
Continental Airlines, America West Airlines and Air China. Day rate:
$45 per person, or $65 for a day pass good at multiple airports.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Delta Air Lines Crown Room Clubs (www.delta.com, [800] 496-2225):
$475 a year, lounges at 34 airports, mostly in the U.S. Members can
cash personal checks for up to $50 at the ticket counter. Reciprocal
agreement with United's Red Carpet Club. Day rate: $50 per person.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Continental Airlines Presidents Club (www.continental.com, [800]
322-2640): $325 a year, eight private clubs and 40 affiliated lounges
including reciprocity with Northwest. Day rate: $45 per person.</TE>
<TE>   Other programs to consider:</TE>
<TE>   Two credit cards also offer airline club privileges: the
$300-a-year American Express platinum card ([800] 843-2273) allows
access to Northwest and Continental lounges, along with immediate
family or two guests. The catch: You have to be flying Northwest or
Continental that day.</TE>
<TE>   Diner's Club card ($95 a year, [800] 234-6377) also offers access
to 100 lounges worldwide, but the only ones in the U.S. are in
Newark, N.J., and Miami. One guest or family member is allowed;
additional guests cost about $10 each.</TE>
<TE>   A sensible program for travelers who tend to use two or more
airlines is the Priority Pass for $99 a year (www.prioritypass.com,
[800] 352-2834), which allows a $24 per-person, per-visit charge for
participating lounges at 41 U.S. airports and 300 lounges around the
world, or a $295 membership that grants free access to all
participating lounges.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., these include all lounges of Northwest and America
West and most Delta, United and US Airways clubs. Overseas, the clubs
are run by other airlines such as AeroMexico and Korean Airlines, or
are independently operated.</TE>
<TE>   Priority Pass is also available through the International Airline
Passengers Assn. (www.iapa.com, [800] 821-4272). Membership includes
discounts on hotels, car rentals and insurance. IAPA costs $49, $99
or $299 a year; the lowest two levels allow a Priority Pass standard
membership for $75 instead of $99; members still pay $24 per lounge
visit. IAPA's top membership includes free access to Priority Pass
lounges.</TE>
<TE>   So, examine your travel patterns to see what approach fits best.
If you travel a lot on a specific airline, consider a direct
membership with the carrier. Using a lounge at least seven to nine
times in a year with the basic, most expensive membership is cheaper
than paying as you go.</TE>
<TE>   If your travel is primarily on Northwest, Continental or both and
you would use one of their lounges at least eight times a year, then
the American Express platinum card also saves money over paying per
visit. Diner's Club makes sense if you pass through a number of
cities overseas, regardless of the airline. (Francophiles, note,
however: No lounges available with Diner's Club in Paris).</TE>
<TE>   If you travel on a variety of airlines, consider the $99 Priority
Pass and pay $24 per visit if you use a lounge 10 times a year or
less. If you use a lounge more than that, consider the full Priority
Pass or IAPA membership. But if you would visit lounges primarily at
Los Angeles International Airport, consider what airlines you use; in
L.A., the Priority Pass is only accepted at the Northwest lounge in
Terminal 2 and the Delta lounge in Terminal 5.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, if you would use a lounge only once or twice a year, just
pay as you go.</TE>
<TE>   Check also to see if the airlines you fly have closed any of their
lounges as part of cost-cutting campaigns since Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Excess Baggage</HD>
<DH>Passengers could be in for big headaches in coming months
as new airport security measures are put in place across the country.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONI STROUD</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The majority of flights are on time. Passenger complaints are down.
Most days, security lines move at a tolerable pace. In short, things
aren't that bad at U.S. airports. And, most days, America's business
travelers are experiencing fewer hurdles than they did in the
immediate aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   That's what we found March 4, when we shadowed four veteran road
warriors flying on routine business trips. (See related stories,
Pages S4-5.)</LD>
<LD>   A big reason for the smooth transits is simple: There are fewer
planes and passengers today than a year ago.</LD>
<TE>   As of Jan. 31, there were about 10% fewer people boarding planes
than in January 2001. This has helped improve the on-time arrival of
most flights and has helped curb the number of complaints.</TE>
<TE>   But the real test is to come. Airport security has been in the
hands of the federal government for barely a month, and the first
order of business is to hire and train a new security force and have
a trustworthy method for screening checked baggage--without
increasing the hassle factor for travelers.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, passenger ranks are expected to swell as we head into
the summer vacation season.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, mindful that the air
travel disruptions have affected business travelers the most, told
the travel industry in a recent speech that "the one-day business
trip needs to be viable" and described a vision of a world-class
screening process "without requiring a wait of longer than 10
minutes."</TE>
<TE>   But as most frequent business travelers know, that day is a long
way off.</TE>
<TE>   Within the first two weeks after the new Transportation Security
Administration took over the airports Feb. 17, terminals in Los
Angeles, Salt Lake City, Chicago, Buffalo, N.Y., and Boston had to be
evacuated after it was discovered that some passengers had passed
through inoperative metal detectors.</TE>
<TE>   At Los Angeles International Airport and O'Hare International in
Chicago, unplugged equipment forced the evacuation of 10,000
passengers in all and affected more than 440 flights.</TE>
<TE>   That excludes other evacuations and countless security sweeps made
necessary because careless passengers have packed dangerous items,
behaved suspiciously or left baggage unattended.</TE>
<TE>   "These terminal evacuations are causing literally tens of millions
of dollars in damage," said Terry Trippler, an airline regulations
consultant and head of Minneapolis-based Trippler &amp; Associates.
"We'll never know the real cost [of those evacuations] to individual
lives."</TE>
<TE>   The disruptions have added enough hassle to tip the scales for Tim
Winship, editor and publisher of FrequentFlier.com. The Los Angeles
resident, who spent 20 years developing airline and hotel loyalty
programs before launching his Web site for frequent fliers, has
decided flying is "a lot less worthwhile than it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   "Until these problems are fixed, a lot of people are going to tone
down their travel. And it's not like it was all that great before,"
Winship said.</TE>
<TE>   The first wave of newly hired and trained security screeners will
arrive at airport checkpoints May 1; all positions are to be
filled--and all contract labor phased out--by Nov. 19. Congress wants
all screening of checked baggage done by explosive-detection system
machines by Dec. 31, a deadline the Transportation Department says is
impossible to meet. And already there are money problems.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Transportation Department Inspector General Kenneth
Mead told the House aviation subcommittee that "the cost of good
security will be substantially greater than most had anticipated."</TE>
<TE>   Mead's figures put the tab for fiscal 2002 between $6.2 billion
and $7 billion. Yet the projected revenue for fiscal 2002, Mead said,
is $2 billion to $2.3 billion--about half of which is to come from a
new $2.50-per-passenger security fee.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the uncertainty, business travelers apparently plan to
soldier on. A recent survey by the U.S. Bureau of Transportation
Statistics and the Travel Industry Assn. of America found that more
regular business travelers plan to increase their travel this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Security now is better than it was on Sept. 10, and it will get
better," consultant Trippler said. "But we have only begun to see the
tip of the iceberg of problems."</TE>
<TE>   Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at George
Washington University in Washington, said travelers' patience could
reach a breaking point.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a point at which everyone's goodwill will dissipate," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That most likely will come in June, said Jenkins, who logs 50 to
100 trips a year. He predicts that the delays caused by thunderstorm
season in the Midwest and South, combined with the usual increase in
summer travelers, will make for short tempers.</TE>
<TE>   "For old-timers like myself, all of us know better than to go
anywhere near a plane in June," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the thorniest issues the government must deal with are
screening checked baggage, improving the flow of passengers through
security checkpoints and the possible implementation of traveler
identification systems.</TE>
<TE>   For checked baggage, Congress wants about 2,200 explosive-
detection systems in the country's 400-plus commercial airports by
Dec. 31. At last count, 180 of the machines, which are certified by
the Federal Aviation Administration, were in place at 53 airports;
only 165 of them were working. InVision Technologies Inc. and L-3
Communications Holdings Inc., the two firms that make the approved
machines, have said they couldn't meet the deadline even if they had
all the orders, which they don't.</TE>
<TE>   And airport authorities wonder where they will put them. Install
the SUV-sized machines in airport lobbies, and they'll crowd out the
very passengers who need to check their bags. Install the machines
behind the scenes within the baggage processing system, and airports
will have to be reconfigured.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that there are going to be headaches along the way," said
David Plavin, president of the Airports Council International-North
America. Transition from the old, familiar system to one with new
demands will be imperfect, he said. "You don't do something on this
scale and get it right the first time."</TE>
<TE>   To fulfill the requirement of screening all checked baggage, the
Transportation Security Administration is using the explosives-
detection machines it has or bomb-sniffing dogs, which also are in
short supply. Mostly, though, the TSA is relying on the airlines to
conduct so-called positive passenger bag matching to screen the
estimated 900 million to 1 billion bags checked in the U.S. each
year.</TE>
<TE>   The baggage matching means each airline assures that a checked bag
does not fly unless the passenger it belongs to boards the flight.
But this matching applies only to the first segment of a flight. The
baggage of the 15% of U.S. passengers, or about 90 million annually,
who make connecting flights is not being positively matched.</TE>
<TE>   At least one company has a way around the system. New York-based
Universal Express Inc., which owns two baggage shipping companies, is
doing a modest but growing business transporting about 300 or 400
pieces of luggage a month through its Virtual Bellhop service, said
Chief Executive Richard Altomare.</TE>
<TE>   Virtual Bellhop acts as a luggage courier, picking up bags from
homes or offices, shipping them via cargo planes and delivering them
to hotels or other locations.</TE>
<TE>   At security checkpoints, the TSA has done an about-face. The
agency allowed the airlines to reinstate VIP lines that feed into
security checkpoints at hub airports only a few days after it had
revoked the practice. Everyone goes through the same screening
checkpoints, but elite fliers wait to do so in shorter lines.</TE>
<TE>   Mineta has said VIP lines were one way the TSA would be working
with the airlines, "experimenting with existing methods that screen
frequent travelers more efficiently at passenger checkpoints."</TE>
<TE>   Convenience--and helping the airlines hang on to valued
customers--is not the only reason.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that will increase the efficiency will increase the
security," said Jenkins of George Washington University, noting that
passengers are most at risk while standing in line. "The
vulnerability is that long lines are easy targets."</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that a traveler identification system would solve the
problem. Others fear an invasion of privacy. The Transportation
Department is taking the middle ground, saying it is "open to some
type of 'trusted traveler ID card' system," as long as it doesn't
reduce the level of security.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, companies such as Visionics Corp. and Identix Inc., which
sell fingerprint scanners, are taking orders from airports around the
country--if only to conduct the required criminal background checks
on employees.</TE>
<TE>   And Logan International in Boston, earmarked by the government as
a test site for new technology, is one of at least three airports
testing a face-recognition system from Visage Technology, the
American Assn. of Airport Executives said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. And there's a sense that there's
no margin for error.</TE>
<TE>   Winship of FrequentFlier.com said he is skeptical about the future
of airport security.</TE>
<TE>   "We still read about those who have gotten through with guns or
scissors," he said. "And you have to figure that for every one they
find there may be 10 others that we don't know about."</TE>
<TE>   Consultant Trippler said the lines, waits and evacuations could
"destroy the air transportation system as we know it."</TE>
<TE>   "If we can't get John and Mary from the front door to the airplane
in less than two hours," he said, "we've got problems."</TE>

<DH>Flights Become Smooth Sailing for One New Yorker</DH>

<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's almost uncomfortable to say, for fear of sounding unsympathetic
or unpatriotic, but in some ways business travel has been easier
since Sept. 11 for advertising executive Laird Stiefvater.</LD>
<LD>   "Frankly, it's a little more predictable," he says as he starts
out a Monday morning on the way to New York's LaGuardia Airport for a
flight to Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport for a business
meeting in Virginia.</LD>
<LD>   "Before, the flights out of LaGuardia were just jammed; they were
stacked up one after another after another. You could leave the gate
at 8 a.m. and then not take off until 9:10.</LD>
<TE>   "But now," says the Manhattan father of two, "there's just not as
much congestion."</TE>
<TE>   For Stiefvater, 41, a senior vice president with Foote, Cone &amp;
Belding, it means he can set the alarm clock for as late as 7
a.m.--even when he has a 10 a.m. meeting with marketing executives
for the U.S. Postal Service in Rosslyn, Va.</TE>
<TE>   At 7:30 a.m., a driver picks up Stiefvater from his West Side
apartment and whisks him across town, up FDR Drive, over the Triboro
Bridge and into the Marine Air Terminal at LaGuardia Airport. The
trip takes about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The LaGuardia-to-National run is a trip Stiefvater has done at
least once a week for the better part of a decade. The Delta Air
Lines shuttle operates out of a terminal separate from the main
airport, with its own parking facility, and is a favorite among
travelers in the Boston-New York-Washington corridor.</TE>
<TE>   "There's good people watching on this flight," Stiefvater says.
"I've seen Bill Bradley, Charles Schumer, Bianca Jagger and Joe
Lieberman. Al Sharpton travels with an entourage like a boxer."</TE>
<TE>   It's 38 degrees out with a biting wind, but Stiefvater wears only
his suit jacket as he steps out of the car and strides into the
terminal.</TE>
<TE>   Five Delta agents are rapidly processing passengers for shuttle
flights to Boston or the nation's capital. Stiefvater steps up to an
agent and hands over the voucher from his travel agency and his
driver's license. He has his boarding pass within one minute. Walking
20 feet to security, he slips his briefcase onto the conveyor belt,
walks through the stand-up metal detector and grabs the case again
without incident.</TE>
<TE>   This time it was easy. About a week after Sept. 11, Stiefvater
arrived at LaGuardia for a business trip. Inside his carry-on, left
there after a family vacation, was a tiny screwdriver--part of the
assembly kit for a toy he bought his son.</TE>
<TE>   "My bag beeped, so then they took me aside and I got the
wand-and-shoe search," he recalls. And LaGuardia security got itself
an extra screwdriver.</TE>
<TE>   Today he is at the gate by 8a.m., precisely when the 8:30 a.m.
flight begins boarding.</TE>
<TE>   Once on board, Stiefvater stores his suit jacket in an overhead
compartment and takes a window seat in the plane's last row.</TE>
<TE>   Stiefvater has two rules for his trips: Never check baggage, and
sit as far to the rear of the plane as possible. Most Delta shuttle
fights to Washington allow passengers to "deplane" through a jet way
at the front of the aircraft or down stairs at the back. By leaving
from the back of the plane, Stiefvater can make a beeline for the
airport's attached Metro station.</TE>
<TE>   At 8:32 a.m., the plane taxis away from the gate. By 8:49 a.m.,
Stiefvater is airborne.</TE>
<TE>   "It really is a better climate for business travel than it used to
be," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan National remained closed until Oct. 4, making it the last
major U.S. airport to reopen after the terrorist attacks. For three
weeks, Stiefvater commuted to Washington by train. Stiefvater was
back on the shuttle the day Reagan National reopened.</TE>
<TE>   "There were only a few of us on the plane that morning," he
recalls. "There was a lot of camaraderie and chitchat. Stewardesses
thanking us, us thanking them.... When we landed, National was so
empty that all you could hear was the sound of the guards' boots."</TE>
<TE>   This day, there are 88 passengers on Flight 1745, which makes the
plane more than half full. A flight attendant says the number of
business passengers flying again has "crept up, week by week."</TE>
<TE>   Each time Stiefvater has traveled since September, he has become a
little savvier about his routine. After the screwdriver incident, he
now makes sure he knows that what's in his case is not on the
confiscation list. Attention to such details shaves minutes off a
commute. "You learn what makes you beep," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But what is most telling about the way Stiefvater travels now may
be the things he does not do differently, such as changing the time
he arrives at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to check in two hours early for a flight to
Washington, you might as well take the train," he says. These days,
he leaves "maybe 10 minutes earlier."</TE>
<TE>   Flight 1745 begins its descent into Washington about 9:25 a.m.,
and the wounded Pentagon comes into view. The wheels scrape the
runway at 9:35 a.m.--two minutes ahead of schedule--and the plane
taxis swiftly to the gate.</TE>
<TE>   Stiefvater is the first passenger out the back when flight
attendants open the door. He leads a few other passengers across the
tarmac and into the terminal, and by 9:50a.m. he is at the airport's

<DL></DL>
<LD>With a dozen minutes to spare, Joe Kefauver settles into his seat and
dives into a crossword puzzle as his Atlanta-bound flight prepares to
pull away from the gate at Orlando International Airport.</LD>
<LD>   He pays little heed to his aisle mates, a trio of junior high
cheerleaders giggling over a deck of Mickey Mouse cards. Like many
Orlando-based business travelers, Kefauver is oblivious to the din of
tourists heading home from Disney World vacations.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a small child. It doesn't bother me in the slightest," he
says.</LD>
<TE>   At least one thing hasn't changed in the wake of Sept. 11: Flights
out of Orlando still feature the sounds of children laughing,
screaming and crying.</TE>
<TE>   What has changed is how long it takes Kefauver, a lobbyist for
Darden Restaurants, whose holdings include the Olive Garden and Red
Lobster chains, to get to his seat.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, Kefauver, 35, would have given himself a little
more than an hour to get to the airport--16 miles from his
downtown-area home--and onto his flight. But new security measures
have translated into another hour added to his pre-boarding schedule.</TE>
<TE>   For this trip--an overnight jaunt for a series of meetings in
Atlanta--the morning starts easy enough.</TE>
<TE>   The 11:30 a.m. flight affords Kefauver the luxury of a few extra
minutes at home with his 3-year-old daughter and Newman, the family's
feisty 7-month-old pug.</TE>
<TE>   At 9:25 a.m., Kefauver sets out for the airport armed with a light
carry-on and his briefcase, which includes space for his laptop, Palm
Pilot and cell phone--any of which could add delays at the screening
checkpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Taking a roundabout route--longer but with fewer delays--he
cruises onto the airport grounds 23 minutes later and begins to
search for a space in one of the two parking towers that flank
Orlando International.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrating the savvy of a frequent flier, Kefauver heads for
the garage opposite the Delta Air Lines ticket counters. The theory
is simple: Delta is the airport's busiest carrier, so why fight with
everyone else for the closest spaces?</TE>
<TE>   "I do it as a way to stay away from the Delta mess," he says. "It
adds a 100-yard walk, but it's easier to find a space."</TE>
<TE>   Car safely stowed--and with its location recorded on his Palm
Pilot--Kefauver grabs his bags and heads for the terminal elevators.</TE>
<TE>   Pausing as he leaves the elevator, he pats the vest pocket of his
jacket, confirming that his wallet is where it should be. It's 9:59
a.m., a bit more than 90 minutes before scheduled takeoff.</TE>
<TE>   That's when his thus-far smooth trip hits a snag.</TE>
<TE>   As he scans the "departures" monitor for his flight, Kefauver, who
bought an electronic ticket, realizes he neglected to bring a copy of
his printed itinerary. Six months ago, this would mean nothing. But
these days, only passengers are allowed anywhere near a gate. And
passengers need a piece of paper to prove it.</TE>
<TE>   So with a glance toward the stern-faced screener blocking access
to the security checkpoint and the gates beyond, Kefauver takes a
deep breath, grabs his bags and weaves his way toward the Delta
ticket counters.</TE>
<TE>   At 10:03 a.m., Kefauver slides into line behind dozens of tourists
and other business travelers, just as his lobbyist partner and
traveling companion, Shannon McAleavey, enters the terminal.</TE>
<TE>   "What's the pileup here?" McAleavey asks, offering a sympathetic
smile and a promise to grab a couple of seats at the gate.</TE>
<TE>   But even as the line trudges forward, Kefauver remains in good
spirits, using the time to place a few calls on his cell phone and
make notes in his Palm Pilot.</TE>
<TE>   Looking down the span of more than two dozen ticket counters,
Kefauver sees little to complain about--virtually every position is
manned by a Delta worker.</TE>
<TE>   "That tells me they are doing everything they can," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen minutes later, Kefauver is on his way back to the
security checkpoint, with ticket in hand. Getting through is fairly
smooth, although Kefauver does attract the attention of a screener,
who asks politely if he wouldn't mind being searched a little more
thoroughly.</TE>
<TE>   Post-Sept. 11, this is not unusual.</TE>
<TE>   He appreciates the extra attention paid to passengers. He does,
however, see inconsistencies in how thoroughly workers do their jobs
and wonders why he is selected for a search three of every four times
he passes through security.</TE>
<TE>   "I either look completely guilty or like someone who won't give
them grief if they ask me," Kefauver says.</TE>
<TE>   Having passed security, he has just enough time to grab a muffin
before rushing to catch up with McAleavey at the gate with a few
minutes to go before boarding begins. That's cutting it a bit closer
than he likes; he typically arrives with at least half an hour to
spare.</TE>
<TE>   "That way," he says, "if your flight gets canceled, you have time
to make adjustments."</TE>
<TE>   Minutes later, Kefauver folds himself into that seat across from
the cheerleaders and, after making quick work of the crossword
puzzle, plans the rest of his day.</TE>
<TE>   During the short hop to Atlanta, Kefauver rifles through a stack
of notes, working up a list of calls he plans to make from the rental
car. The plane touches down shortly after 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Although Kefauver considers Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport to be the
worst in the country--in terms of congestion and delays--he and
McAleavey are out and stepping into their rental car at 1:34 p.m., 18
minutes after exiting the airplane.</TE>
<TE>   On this day free of major glitches, fortune smiles upon the pair
as they pull out of Hartsfield and onto Atlanta's much-maligned
highways.</TE>
<TE>   "At any given time of day, it can be a parking lot," he says. "The
place just grinds to a halt."</TE>
<TE>   But today it takes only 33 minutes to cover the 35 miles between
the airport and the Darden regional office in Alpharetta, north of
downtown Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   When all is said and done, the biggest change that Sept. 11 has
wrought upon Kefauver's business travels is that it simply takes
longer to go from here to there.</TE>
<TE>   But he doesn't begrudge that extra time spent milling about the
airport.</TE>
<TE>   For Kefauver, who travels at least twice a month, the terrorism
that changed the way people fly is only little more than an
inconvenience.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got a cell phone. I've got high-speed jacks. I've got pay
phones," he says. "Obviously, I can get more done at the office, but
this isn't a waste of time."</TE>

<HD>Excess Baggage</HD>
<DH>Business travelers and their employers are fed up over
rising fares and declining service. Now they're doing something about
it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Julian figures he has flown 2.5 million miles on Delta Air
Lines in the last 15 years and spent more than $250,000 with the
carrier. Julian, the president of a Montana energy company called
Power Procurement Group, says he once even viewed Delta as a business
partner.</LD>
<LD>   Not anymore. In a scathing letter to Delta last month, Julian
decried the wide gap between business and leisure fares,
long-standing restrictions that preclude business travelers from
getting discount seats and the "indifference and arrogance" shown by
Delta toward such complaints. His frustration, he wrote, also applies
"to the airline industry in general."</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not one to write letters, and this letter came after a
considerable amount of deliberation," Julian said in an interview.
"But I got to the point where I hated to do business with any company
that treated their customers that way."</LD>
<TE>   Delta confirms the letter and defends its business fares and
service. But Julian is not alone.</TE>
<TE>   The whole business travel community has been slowly boiling over
rising fares and declining service and has launched a quiet rebellion
by finding cheaper alternatives to full-priced tickets--or by not
flying at all.</TE>
<TE>   There is a steadily growing gap between the airlines' unrestricted
business fares and what the 43 million domestic business travelers
are actually paying, now that they are increasingly adopting online
booking, advance reservations and other money-saving techniques.</TE>
<TE>   That gap, in effect, represents corporations' protest against what
the airlines keep charging for full-fare tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "The business traveler feels they're getting gouged," said Tom
McCabe, travel services director at PerkinElmer Inc., a Boston-based
maker of high-tech instruments. And what further irks many business
fliers is that they don't sense that the airlines feel compelled to
do much about it.</TE>
<TE>   But the airlines are in for a big shock, some corporate travel
experts say. Even when the economy recovers, business travel will
remain subdued until the airlines cut fares and otherwise reform the
business fare structure to make it simpler and more closely aligned
with leisure prices.</TE>
<TE>   Business travel was slumping well before Sept. 11. The attacks,
and the plunge in air travel overall that followed, certainly gave
companies even more reason to slash their travel budgets. But
business travel, and the airlines' financial health, already were
nose-diving as the U.S. economy was slipping into recession.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines note that the business travel slump--the key reason
the major carriers continue to lose millions of dollars a
day--reflects much more than fares. Companies still are capping
travel spending because of the weak economy, and they remain wary of
long delays caused by heightened airport security checks, the
carriers say.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations are high that the economy finally will recover this
year, automatically triggering a renewed surge in business travel
that would help the carriers rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Not so, assert some corporate travel experts.</TE>
<TE>   "The carriers are learning the hard way that when corporations
don't get the prices they want, they are willing to find alternatives
to traditional commercial travel, or they're willing to stay home,"
said Marianne McInerney, executive director of the National Business
Travel Assn. "Common sense illustrates to all of us that the right
thing to do is create pricing that attracts the customer back onto
your plane."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Example: Black &amp; Decker Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in lowering costs regardless of whether we
reduce the number of trips" taken by employees, said Barbara Lucas, a
spokeswoman for the Towson, Md.-based maker of power tools and
household fixtures.</TE>
<TE>   From Sept. 11 to Feb. 10, Black &amp; Decker's travel spending
plummeted 40% from a year earlier, and its employees took 35% fewer
trips. In just the last two months, the company's pace of travel has
picked up somewhat, but its spending on travel remains 20% below a
year ago, in large part because Black &amp; Decker is booking more
tickets online and pressing for bigger corporate discounts, Lucas
said.</TE>
<TE>   Companies are saving on airfare not only by booking online but by
booking further in advance and agreeing to have workers change planes
more often to obtain leisure-type discounts. They also are making
more use of videoconferencing and the telephone.</TE>
<TE>   "The airlines don't get it," said Kevin Mitchell, head of an
advocacy group, the Business Travel Coalition, and a frequent critic
of business fares. "The airlines think the falloff in business travel
is a one-for-one with the falloff in the economy," but the companies'
migration to online ticketing and other direct booking services is a
policy change intended to save money "for years to come," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And even though companies are saving cash using such techniques,
the airlines still must lower their prices, McInerney asserted.
Companies increasingly are unwilling to tolerate spending $1,500 for
a business class seat that is next to a leisure passenger who paid
$300 for the trip.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same plane, the same seat, the same meal, the same
movie," McInerney said.</TE>
<TE>   "For the airlines' future success, they're going to have to
realize that business travel no longer supplements low leisure
airfares," she added.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines counter that it is not as simple as just slashing
business fares, especially with the airlines already in such
financial straits.</TE>
<TE>   "If we did that, we could put our company out of business
potentially," because tests have shown that lower fares sparked
insufficient added business traffic to offset the lower income the
airlines received, said Tom Bach, a Northwest Airlines vice president
who sets the carrier's pricing.</TE>
<TE>   "That's also why you don't see any airline jumping on the
bandwagon" to simply cut prices across the board, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The airlines also contend that business fliers should pay a higher
price, in exchange for the airline holding seats for them. In a
response to the complaints of Julian, the Delta customer, Delta Chief
Marketing Officer Vicki Escarra noted that business travelers "demand
a high level of flexibility in scheduling and often wait until the
last minute to book their tickets."</TE>
<TE>   "Your central complaint is your view that Delta tries to charge
the highest prices it can to some business passengers," and that is
"at least partially correct," Escarra wrote. Delta tries "to find the
right balance" of prices and service that not only pleases its
customers and beats the competition but also "generates an acceptable
return for our investors," she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   But Delta, Northwest and other carriers have nonetheless been
adjusting their business fares in a bid to attract more passengers
without delivering a huge hit to revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Northwest has "BizFlex" fares that offer fewer restrictions and
deeper discounts if business travelers book ahead. The fares still
require a one-night stay-over, but it doesn't have to be the
conventional Saturday night--so businesspeople don't have to stay
away from home over the weekend. Some other carriers also have
abandoned the Saturday night stay-over and offered promotions for
business fliers who book at least a week in advance.</TE>
<TE>   BizFlex "has been received quite well" and now accounts for 6% of
Northwest's passenger traffic, Bach said.</TE>
<TE>   (Business passengers overall typically account for about 35% of
airline traffic but generate the bulk of the carriers' income.)</TE>
<TE>   "We also think about whether there should be a restructuring of
the walk-up [full-price] business fares," but they are not
financially justifiable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, typical business passengers hopped on a plane at the
last minute, and the airlines made them pay much more for that
unrestricted, walk-up ticket than they charged leisure travelers who
booked well in advance or agreed to a Saturday stay-over. But
starting in the late 1990s, as business fares were escalating,
corporate passengers began to revolt.</TE>
<TE>   "Since 1996, business fares have risen 78%, and I have yet to find
another consumer product where that's happened over the past six
years," said McInerney of the National Business Travel Assn.</TE>
<TE>   And as those full-fare prices have risen, business travelers have
flocked to online booking, advance reservations and other tools used
by leisure fliers to get cheaper seats.</TE>
<TE>   American Express Co.'s travel services arm says surveys of its
clients show that the "typical business fare"--one that's fully
refundable and has minimal restrictions--averaged $580 for a one-way
trip in December, virtually unchanged from a year earlier. Yet the
average fare paid by business travelers in December was $273, down
13% from a year earlier and the lowest fare since early 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the $307 difference between the average posted business fare
and the actual fare paid in December has more than doubled from the
$143 gap of early 1997, American Express' figures show.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the airlines were to slash their posted business fares,
they probably would have to raise leisure fares to make up the
difference--and risk a drop in demand among leisure passengers who
themselves are still not flying as much as a year ago. And with many
major carriers still losing several million dollars a day, right now
they can't afford to get less revenue from any passenger.</TE>
<TE>   But when the economy improves, will business travelers stomach
that gap between business and leisure fares and start flying more
often anyway?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not confident at all that's going to happen," said McCabe of
PerkinElmer. "Not until the [airlines'] pricing model is changed, and
they tell corporate America that it no longer has to subsidize
leisure travel, are you going to see a resumption of business
travel."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the airlines are paying closer heed to the problem, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had discussions with two airlines in the last two weeks, and
while I can't say who they are, both indicated that this [fare
controversy] is an A item" on their list of priorities, McCabe said.
"I think they're terrified at what's going on."</TE>

<HD>For Frequent Travelers, Family Often Bears the Brunt of
Stress</HD>
<DH>Some companies already have addressed workers' concerns by
cutting back trips, but they find they may have to do more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BONNIE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Beth Duncan can't decide which is more stressful these days: the
general hassles of airport security, reduced flight schedules and
hotel hops that come with traveling for her sales job--or the
emotional toll it seems to take on her family every time she leaves.</LD>
<LD>   "It's gotten so I have to hide my suitcase and briefcase from my
[9-year-old] daughter when I pack or else she'll have a meltdown,"
said Duncan, 38, a national sales representative for a pharmaceutical
company. "I hate leaving like that. I see her little face the whole
time I'm gone.... It's enough to make me want a desk job."</LD>
<LD>   Business travel remains off about 20% from last year for a mix of
reasons, including the limping economy and corporate travel budget
cuts.</LD>
<TE>   But at the same time, business travelers are facing unprecedented
family pressures since Sept. 11 that also are keeping them grounded
more. Indeed, experts say many companies may be forced to modify
travel requirements to accommodate the growing number of employees
whose families are anxious or uncomfortable about letting their loved
ones fly.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies already have addressed employees' personal concerns
by cutting back trips, allowing travelers to return home a day early
or adjusting schedules so that more teleconferencing is used in place
of face time. Some gave their business travelers time off immediately
after the terrorist attacks to regroup and spend time with family
before returning to the skies.</TE>
<TE>   But six months later, many companies realize they have to do more,
as employees continue to grapple with family pressures that show no
sign of subsiding.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Herder, chief executive of Hobbs Herder Advertising in
Newport Beach, said two of his sales representatives quit after Sept.
11--one because of additional stress related to flying once a week
all year long and the other because traveling so much was keeping her
away from an ill spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Herder said, he has watched stress levels mount among
his 12-person sales team. The burnout rate for those jobs typically
is four years, but Herder said he began to see signs in some workers
that it would happen much sooner.</TE>
<TE>   "I started to feel like a counselor for a while, because many of
our salespeople were voicing concerns from their children and spouses
and it was really getting to them," said Herder, who himself travels
about 25 times a year. "I kept trying to find ways to keep everyone
moving, because in our business we have to travel. There's no way
around it."</TE>
<TE>   Herder and his partner, Don Hobbs, decided to help their workers
stay in touch with family members while on the road--by paying for
all their cell phone calls to and from home. The executives also are
considering pay increases and additional vacation time for their
frequent-flying sales team.</TE>
<TE>   "As a company, we've got to be more sensitive about this," Herder
said. "Even if an employee's OK with traveling but his family isn't,
that's going to cause stress. We have to take care of them, not just
because it's the smart thing to do as a boss but because it's the
right thing to do as a person."</TE>
<TE>   For some, the corporate move toward sensitivity came too late.
Under what he called "intense" pressure from his new wife, James Ruiz
quit his job as a software consultant in October when his boss would
not cut back his business trips.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted a reprieve, just temporarily, to be with my family and
help them get through their anxiety," said Ruiz, who is now self-
employed in Houston. "It probably would have gotten better, with me
being fully able to travel again in time. But I wasn't given that
time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, most business travelers who have cut back on trips expect
their own safety concerns to fade by year's end. In a recent survey
of business travelers by WorldCom Group, about 70% said they soon
will feel "completely" safe flying again.</TE>
<TE>   It's different for their family members, however. About 42% of the
respondents believe their loved ones will be concerned and stressed
about their business travels for at least the next year. Nearly a
fourth of those surveyed said their families will never again be
comfortable letting them fly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the second-biggest reason business travelers are giving
for why they are flying less," said Kevin Mitchell, chairman of the
Business Travel Coalition, an advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shift that demands attention from companies, because it
isn't likely to go away any time soon. When it comes to corporate
travel right now, families are more involved than ever in the
decision-making process."</TE>

<HD>Adjusting to Security at Foreign Airports</HD>
<DH>For international business travelers, it's about rethinking
the number of trips and packing light.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM STIEGHORST</AU>
<BD>SOUTH FLORIDA SUN-SENTINEL</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Airports in the United States have made radical changes in security
since Sept. 11, forcing domestic travelers to adapt. But how have
foreign airports changed? And what are the new ground rules for
international business travelers?</LD>
<LD>   Here's what four global road warriors say:</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Andre LaCroix, president, Burger King International</TE>
<TE>   LaCroix said Sept. 11 has forced travelers to be more efficient
about planning their trips. LaCroix flies two or three times a week
from Munich, Germany, where he oversees 3,066 Burger Kings in 56
countries.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest impact of Sept. 11 is that it forced us to reassess
our travel needs," LaCroix said. "It forced us to use the video
conference call. We learned to do things differently."</TE>
<TE>   Though he still flies as much as in the past, LaCroix packs more
activity into each trip and tucks in intermediate stops. For example,
on a recent trip to corporate headquarters in Miami, he flew via
Madrid to get in a quick meeting there instead of going nonstop.
"We're more organized," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Security checks at Munich International take 10 minutes to 15
minutes at early-morning rush hours. He had some razor blades
confiscated in Frankfurt, Germany, recently, but generally he hasn't
changed his packing habits.</TE>
<TE>   Although European airports have a reputation for being more
security-minded than their U.S. counterparts, LaCroix said it is not
monolithic. "There are some differences between airports," he said.
LaCroix also is accustomed to seeing armed police at airports in
Europe and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Asia</TE>
<TE>   Philip Shen, president, Asia- Pacific division of Leggett &amp; Platt,
Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Shen travels every other month from South Florida through Chicago
or airports on the West Coast to Asia in his job for Leggett &amp; Platt,
a $5-billion maker of fabricated parts and furniture components based
in Carthage, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Shen has observed few changes in security at airports in Asia
since Sept. 11, but he noted that they tend to be laid out
differently from U.S. terminals. Rather than have travelers put bags
through metal detectors at concourse entrances, he said, airports in
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, screen at each departure gate.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the gate waiting areas are enclosed by glass walls.
Anyone leaving once admitted must be rescanned. "It's better in terms
of security," Shen said.</TE>
<TE>   As for packing, Shen has long limited himself to a single carry-on
even though he is gone for up to three weeks on his Asian tours. He
gets by with four interchangeable outfits. With more, he said, "you
just end up carrying dirty laundry from country to country."</TE>
<TE>   Doing it that way saves a few hours on every trip, he said, with
the extra advantage that he never loses luggage along the way.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Latin America</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Roof, aviation attorney, Shutts &amp; Bowen, Miami</TE>
<TE>   Roof said security in Latin America has become more like Europe's
since Sept. 11, while security in Europe is more like Israel's.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you almost never encountered security searches" while
checking baggage in Latin America, he said. But on a recent trip
through Mexico City, Roof said, both his check-in and carry-on bags
were opened. "The search was pretty thorough too," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, U.S. airlines operating abroad seem less willing to accept
transfers of luggage from foreign carriers without re-screening the
bags, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, he said, there is "definitely heightened vigilance,"
although security generally has been tougher since the 1988 bombing
of Pan Am Flight 103.</TE>
<TE>   One change, Roof said, is in the profiling interviews passengers
face before getting in line for check-in. Before Sept. 11, local
employees of U.S. carriers conducted the interviews. Now one or more
American workers join in. "It's a more skillful interview, more
probing. People are actually paying attention to your answers," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Roof has changed his flying routine little, but he does allow more
time to get through London's Heathrow Airport. "Connections that used
to work no longer work," he said, because of the extra time needed to
do screenings.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Europe</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo Gonzales, director of international sales, Greater Fort
Lauderdale (Fla.) Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Gonzales relearned how to pack. "I will not take
anything I don't need," he said. That means two suits instead of
four, and he has pared his three suitcases to one. "Take very little
in your hand--just a briefcase, your laptop and a cell phone."</TE>
<TE>   "Now you pack a Reader's Digest version of what you packed
before," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales also pays attention to things that might result in his
getting pulled out of line. He buys fewer duty-free items as gifts
and strictly follows written customs guidelines. "You don't want to
push the envelope now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He learned his lesson in Amsterdam. Gonzales was taking a British
bobby's hat as a gift to a friend in England. The souvenir was packed
in a hatbox. Both hat and box drew attention, but he was allowed to
keep them after a five-minute interview.</TE>
<TE>   Gonzales said he is flying less, partly because of the hassle.</TE>
<TE>   "I've learned to combine three trips into one," he said, "so I
don't have to fly so much."</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Appier Finally Feels Sharp</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>After several erratic performances, Kevin Appier on Monday showed the
form the Angels envisioned when they traded Mo Vaughn for the veteran
right-hander.</LD>
<LD>   Appier worked out some mechanical problems and gave up two hits in
five scoreless innings in a 4-3 exhibition victory over the Oakland
Athletics. Appier struck out five and walked two.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt a lot better, a lot more normal," said Appier, who started
the game with an 11.57 earned-run average in seven innings over three
appearances. Appier, 34, has a 147-115 record and a 3.63 ERA in 13
seasons. He went 11-10 with a 3.57 ERA last season for the New York
Mets and was unbeaten in his final 12 starts, with six wins and six
no-decisions.</LD>
<TE>   But Appier did not look the part in his first three outings. In
his previous start, last Wednesday against the San Diego Padres,
Appier gave up five runs, five hits, walked three and hit a batter in
two-plus innings.</TE>
<TE>   "My location was 10 times more consistent today," he said. "Still,
it could be better."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia was happy with Appier's progression.</TE>
<TE>   "His stuff is picking up to where it's very, very crisp," Scioscia
said. "He put it together with command today."</TE>
<TE>   Catcher Jorge Fabregas played for the first time since a foul ball
hit him on his right big toe March 9.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got size 13 feet, so my foot is a big target," Fabregas
said. "I got hit a million times on the toe, but this one just hit me
square."</TE>
<TE>   He lost the nail and was unable to wear a shoe on his right foot
until Saturday. He wore a protective flap fashioned from a shin guard
over the toe area of his right cleat Monday and caught two innings.
He also had a sacrifice bunt in the ninth inning that set up Jose
Nieves' game-winning sacrifice fly to center field.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any problems today," Fabregas said.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Shawn Wooten, who injured the joint in his right
thumb, was examined in Los Angeles and will undergo surgery today,
General Manager Bill Stoneman said.... Designated hitter Brad Fullmer
hit his second home run of the spring, a two-run shot against former
Angel Mike Fyhrie that tied the score, 3-3.... Aaron Sele is
scheduled to start today against the Padres. The last time Sele faced
them, on March 9, he hit Ryan Klesko, precipitating the first of two
brawls. Sele was one of seven players suspended or fined for their
roles in the brawls.... Scioscia said that third baseman Troy Glaus,
who has not played since straining an abdominal muscle last Thursday,
will probably sit out tonight's game, then take advantage of the
Angels' scheduled day off Wednesday and return to the lineup Thursday
against the Colorado Rockies.</TE>

<HD>Bell Has Issues With Pirates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Derek Bell, who batted only .173 last season, said he'll go into
"Operation Shutdown" and won't risk injuring himself if the
Pittsburgh Pirates do not give him the starting job in right field.</LD>
<LD>   Manager Lloyd McClendon and General Manager Dave Littlefield said
Bell, Armando Rios and Craig Wilson are competing and the starter
hasn't been decided. But Littlefield said Bell has done little to win
the job.</LD>
<LD>   "Nobody told me I was in competition," Bell told the Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. "If there is competition, somebody better let me know.
If there is competition, they better eliminate me out of the race and
go ahead and do what they're going to do with me. I ain't never hit
in spring training and I never will.</LD>
<TE>   "If it ain't settled with me out there, then they can trade me. I
ain't going out there to hurt myself in spring training battling for
a job. If it is [a competition], then I'm going into 'Operation
Shutdown.' Tell them exactly what I said. I haven't competed for a
job since 1991."</TE>
<TE>   Littlefield told the Post-Gazette that Bell is "certainly"
competing for a job.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, he hasn't done a lot to show he deserves a lot of
playing time. He just hasn't performed," Littlefield said. "Last
year, he was injured. He looks healthy. We just have to see more
production."</TE>
<TE>   Ray Knoblauch, the father of Kansas City outfielder Chuck
Knoblauch and the coach who led Houston's Bellaire High to four state
titles in 25 years, died of Alzheimer's disease. He was 74.</TE>
<TE>   Knoblauch left Bellaire in 1986 with a 598-225 record but returned
as the team's pitching coach from 1994-97, when he retired.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia third baseman Scott Rolen is shrugging off an
apparent dispute with another member of the Phillies.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, who has had an on-again, off-again feud with Manager Larry
Bowa, had a long and sometimes loud discussion under the stands at
spring training Saturday with third-base coach John Vukovich, the
Philadelphia Daily News reported Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Rolen, who can become a free agent at the end of the year,
shrugged off the discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle Manager Lou Piniella traveled to Tampa, Fla., from the
team's spring training camp at Peoria, Ariz., after his 83-year-old
father, Louis, was hospitalized with pneumonia.</TE>
<TE>   Texas acquired right-hander Luis Vizcaino from Oakland for
right-hander Justin Duchscherer. Vizcaino, 26, was 2-1 with a 4.55
earned-run average last season. Duchscherer, 24, was 1-1 with a 12.27
ERA in five games with the Rangers.</TE>
<TE>   The Houston Astros will dismantle today one of the four largest
remaining signs bearing the former Enron Field.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros bought back the naming rights to their ballpark Feb.
27. They paid about $2.1 million to get back the naming rights from
Enron, the energy company that went bankrupt in December.</TE>
<TE>   The stadium will be called Astros Field until a new naming rights
sponsor is selected.</TE>

<LD>Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle says he has a new
favorite team after a group of Native American students at Northern
Colorado named their intramural basketball squad the Fightin' Whites
as a satiric response to nearby Eaton High's nickname, the Fightin'
Reds:</LD>
<LD>   "[But] the Fighting Whities might have screwed their chances of
winning the upcoming school tournament.</LD>
<LD>   "How are they going to win if they can't jump?</LD>
<TE>   "They'll have compensate by going back to white-guy fundamentals,
like crisp chest passes, well-executed backdoor picks, and
locker-room psych-up music by Journey."</TE>
<TE>   More Ostler: "Stereotypes are wrong for two reasons:</TE>
<TE>   "One, they don't hold true. I'm a white guy from the 'burbs, but
when I played basketball, I had plenty of inner-city street game. I
threw all kinds of passes behind my back and between my legs, though
never intentionally.</TE>
<TE>   "Two, stereotypes divide, and these days we're supposed to be
about uniting."</TE>

Commission's decision to grant Mike Tyson a license to hold a

pocket his portion of a multimillion-dollar payday. Giving Tyson a

<TE>   "Nevertheless, Washington did the right thing. Because doing
what's right only counts when it goes down hard and tastes lousy."</TE>
<TE>   Still the man: The Atlanta Braves made some highly publicized

because of a shoulder injury.</TE>

<HD>Clippers Run a Post Pattern</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Olowokandi scores 20 of his 26 points in
the first half, and L.A. defeats Houston, 93-86.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their steps were tentative, their movements unsteady Monday. Then the
Clippers threw the ball to center Michael Olowokandi on the low post
and they began to resemble something approaching a playoff contender.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi swept past Houston Rocket defenders again and again,
dropping short hooks and jump shots into the basket. He was polished
and poised and unwilling to let another game get away from the
Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   By game's end, Olowokandi would score 26 points and take 11
rebounds, hoisting the Clippers on his shoulders and leading them to
a 93-86 victory over the game Rockets before a sellout crowd of
19,208 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi's sure hands kept the Clippers firmly entrenched in the
Western Conference playoff race. A loss would have been devastating
to the ninth-place Clippers' hopes, but their victory brought them
within two games of the eighth-place Utah Jazz.</TE>
<TE>   "Excellent," Elton Brand said of Olowokandi's play. "I was even
trying to get him the ball in the first half so I could get assists
for myself. He was that hot."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, Brand was credited with one assist. He also had 20
points and 12 rebounds for his 12th double-double in 13 games and his
47th this season. His streak of consecutive double-doubles ended at
11 in the Clippers' loss Saturday against the Seattle SuperSonics.</TE>
<TE>   When things got tight late, the Clippers got a key runner from
reserve guard Doug Overton and two free throws apiece by Brand and
Jeff McInnis and maintained at least a three-point lead in the final
two minutes.</TE>
<TE>   When it counted most, the Clippers came together and subdued the
Rockets, taking the lead for good at the end of the third quarter and
making the plays playoff teams make down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to be struggling a little bit," Coach Alvin Gentry said.
"We don't have the same zip in our steps as we did last week. But we
came up with a way to win. It seems to be different guys stepping up
for us. Obviously, Doug Overton's basket was huge and Michael played
great."</TE>
<TE>   Gentry expressed disappointment that the Clippers failed to feed
Olowokandi after he scored 20 points on 10-of-15 shooting in the
first half. Olowokandi took only three shots in the second half and
made two.</TE>
<TE>   "When a guy is going as good as he was, we've got to find ways to
get him the ball," Gentry said. "It doesn't make good basketball
sense not to throw it to him when he's that hot. We have to do a
better job of milking what's best for us."</TE>
<TE>   When Olowokandi missed two free throws with 1:40 to play, it
seemed the Clippers were staggering. They led by 87-83, but Houston
got only a three-point basket from Cuttino Mobley the rest of the
way. Overton's short jumper pushed the Clippers toward their third
victory in four games against Houston.</TE>
<TE>   "The lane kind of opened up," Overton said with a shrug. "I've
been around long enough to know to be ready. I tried to contribute
any way I could."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's 20 points notwithstanding, the most impressive part
of the Clippers' first half was their defense. They held the Rockets
to 37 points, which was just the sort of springboard they needed
heading into the second half.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry spoke before the game about tightening up on defense.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get back to playing the good team defense," he said.
"That's what's carried us the last few months. Our defense fuels our
offense."</TE>
<TE>   That certainly was the case in the first half, when the Clippers
took a 45-37 lead. They ran after forcing turnovers and finished with
dunks or layups.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Darius Miles blocked Eddie Griffin's jump shot,
raced down court, accepted Eric Piatkowski's long pass and dunked for
a 36-30 Clipper lead. Moments later, McInnis fed a streaking Quentin
Richardson for a layup.</TE>
<TE>   Houston Coach Rudy Tomjanovich could been seen holding his hands
over his head, signaling for his team to call timeout even as
Richardson was racing toward the hoop. Clearly, Tomjanovich wanted no
part of a fastbreaking game.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Rockets soldiered on, taking their first lead, 55-54,
on Kelvin Cato's dunk midway through the third quarter. They made 14
of 20 shots in the third quarter (70%) and led by as much as five
points.</TE>

<HD>A Bruise Can't Keep Richardson Off Court</HD>

<LD>Quentin Richardson performed a series of stretching exercises at the
Clippers' shoot-around Monday morning, and when that went well, he
decided to play later in the evening against the Houston Rockets.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, he probably would have played anyway. At this point,
it's going to take a good deal more than a bruised left thigh to keep
Richardson off the floor.</LD>
<LD>   "I've just got to get loose, get the adrenaline going and I'll be
all right," said Richardson, who was kneed in the upper part of his
left leg in the second quarter of Saturday's loss against the Seattle
SuperSonics.</LD>
<TE>   Richardson did not return to Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a little sore," he said before Monday's game. "But we
all know the importance of these games. We've had enough injuries."</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were already without forwards Corey Maggette and
Lamar Odom and guard Keyon Dooling. Odom (wrist and ankle) and
Dooling (ankle) could be out for the rest of the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   Maggette's status is less certain, although Coach Alvin Gentry
said last week Maggette (hand and knee) could be fit to play again in
two weeks. Maggette has been shooting on his own the last few days.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry dismissed the notion that the Clippers must slow their
often frenetic pace in order to cut down on their turnovers. Although
he's not pleased the Clippers had 15 turnovers Saturday against
Seattle, Gentry's not about to change the game plan.</TE>
<TE>   "If we're going to be a running team, then we're going to turn the
ball over some," he said. "We can't change the way we play now. We've
all got to understand that. It took some getting used to for me too.
I understand that everyone says it's playoff basketball and
possessions are so important, but we can't change the way we play."</TE>
<TE>   Guard Steve Francis was in the Rocket starting lineup. He did not
play in their loss Saturday against the Chicago Bulls because of a
migraine headache.</TE>

<LD>   What: ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding 2002</LD>
<LD>   System: Playstation 2</LD>
<TE>   Price: $49.95</TE>
<TE>   Imagine yourself whipping down the slopes, the wind chilling your
face, a trail of snow behind you. The thrill of executing the perfect
move on your snowboard while admiring onlookers gasp in amazement.</TE>
<TE>   Do you have that image in your mind? Good. Because you won't find
anything like that in this game.</TE>
<TE>   Winter X Games Snowboarding 2002 is simply one of the worst
snowboarding games to come out for any system. Except maybe the Atari
2600, which came out about 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   As befits the name, the game borrows heavily from the telecasts of
ESPN's "X Games" and features real licensed riders and settings.</TE>
<TE>   X Games is broken up into challenges of pure racing (Time Attack),
pure tricks (Big Air/Halfpipe), and a little of each (Slope- style).
It's no surprise that the last is the best. The Slopestyle courses
are huge, and there's a lot more emphasis on linked kickers and
rails. The amount of trick potential has been expanded considerably.</TE>
<TE>   At times, it feels as if the game strays too far from the thin
line between realism and fun. The key to performing spins and flips
effectively is mastering the timing of button inputs. Hit the trick
inputs too early and you crash. The controls are as unwieldy as the
game's title.</TE>
<TE>   But everything is difficult in this game. Tricks, turning. You'll
be happy if you can make it downhill just once. Stay far, far away
from this game.</TE>

<DH>Quantrill's Accuracy Impresses Dodgers, Who Might Use the
Right-Hander as a Part-Time Closer</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VERO BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Paul Quantrill knew he hurt himself pretty badly when he lost control
of his snowmobile and slammed into a tree in the woods east of
Toronto on Jan. 6, 1999. Not until he saw the ghastly sight below his
waist did he realize the extent of his injuries.</LD>
<LD>   "I wanted to get up," Quantrill said, recalling the accident, "but
I realized something was wrong when the boot on my right foot was
facing the other way."</LD>
<LD>   Quantrill broke his right femur, which extends from the hip to the
knee and is the largest bone in the body. Three days later, he
underwent surgery in which an 18-inch metal rod--it still "sets off
all the bells and whistles at the airport," Quantrill said--was
inserted in his leg. Six months later, despite a noticeable limp,
Quantrill was pitching in the big leagues.</LD>
<TE>   Heavy mettle beats heavy metal.</TE>
<TE>   "After a bad outing, the writers would ask about the leg and
whether it affected me," said Quantrill, who will play a key role in
the Dodger bullpen this season. "If I take the mound, you're not
going to get an excuse out of me."</TE>
<TE>   Such an attitude made Quantrill one of baseball's most hard-nosed
and durable short relievers and has already endeared him to Dodger
coaches this spring. When a manager gives Quantrill the ball, he
takes it, whether he's a little tired, a little sore--or if he's
having a little trouble walking.</TE>
<TE>   A 33-year-old right-hander, Quantrill was acquired from Toronto
this winter. He appeared in an American League-high 80 games for the
Blue Jays last season, going 11-2 with a 3.04 earned-run average. He
led the majors in wins by a reliever and was named to the AL All-Star
team.</TE>
<TE>   A sinker-ball specialist, Quantrill has impeccable control; in 83
innings last season, he walked only 12, and seven of those were
intentional. He has 262 walks in 937 innings during his 10-year
career.</TE>
<TE>   "The appreciation for him will grow more during the season, when
we're playing games, because he doesn't throw balls and he wants the
ball every day you can give it to him," Dodger Manager Jim Tracy
said. "You never see this guy pitch away from a baseball bat. He's
not afraid of contact, and that's definitely a quality you need to
have."</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill, who has 18 saves in his career, is expected to be the
Dodgers' primary set-up man, but he could also share closing duties
with Matt Herges. Tracy says their contrasting styles--Herges is more
of a power pitcher, and Quantrill relies more on ground-ball
outs--will complement each other in the bullpen and give opponents
different late-inning looks.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill has been sharp this spring, allowing only two earned
runs in eight innings--a 2.25 ERA--striking out four, walking two and
giving up only six hits.</TE>
<TE>   "His command to both sides of the plate is phenomenal," Tracy
said. "He trusts his sinker so much that he'll throw the ball to a
spot where the hitter thinks he's going to rip it, and he'll pull if
foul. Guys get infatuated with the inside of the plate, then he'll
paint one on the outside corner, and they can't reach it."</TE>
<TE>   "Knowing you have a definitive ground-ball guy in the bullpen,
knowing he can take the ball three or four days in a row, that's a
marvelous situation to be in."</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill will be the pitcher Tracy turns to when there are
runners on first and second and none out in the eighth inning of a
one-run game.</TE>
<TE>   Or, he could get the ball to open the ninth inning with a one-run
lead. He has never been a closer, but Quantrill has no fear of the
responsibility and pressure that come with such a role.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't mind the attention or being in the spotlight like that;
I've been there, done that," Quantrill said. "The thing about closing
is that in many ways it's an easier job [than being a set-up man] as
long as you don't get too worked up about it or choke it off. You
have a lead and a clean inning. Just go out and pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill has never been sidelined by an arm problem, so he is
expected to provide some durability to a Dodger pitching staff that
was besieged by injuries last season. Quantrill's only stint on the
disabled list came after his snowmobile accident, when he missed the
first 2 1/2 months of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill, an experienced snowmobile driver who grew up in Canada,
said he was not traveling at a high rate of speed at the time of the
accident. While guiding three less-experienced drivers through the
woods, he glanced over his shoulder to see where they were, lost
control of the snowmobile and fish-tailed into a tree.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of thoughts went through my head; there was a lot of fear
and anxiety with spring training coming up," Quantrill said. "But it
never crossed my mind that it would end my career. An elbow or
shoulder injury would scare me a lot more. The femur is a big bone,
but I figured it's just a bone, it'll heal."</TE>
<TE>   Quantrill appeared in only 41 games in 1999, going 3-2 with a 3.33
ERA, and he struggled for much of 2000, going 2-5 with a 4.52 ERA in
68 games. By 2001, there were no lingering effects from the leg
injury, and the Blue Jays were so impressed with Quantrill they gave
him a three-year, $9.6-million contract extension last August.</TE>
<TE>   But when new Toronto General Manager J.P. Ricciardi was given a
mandate to cut payroll, Quantrill became part of a salary purge that
included Alex Gonzalez, Billy Koch and Brad Fullmer. The Blue Jays
traded Quantrill and shortstop Cesar Izturis to the Dodgers for
pitchers Luke Prokopec and Chad Ricketts.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have signed [with the Blue Jays] if I knew what they
were going to do," Quantrill said. "They traded Gonzalez, Koch, they
eventually traded Fullmer, and they were trying to trade [right

<TE>   "Everyone thought I'd be so disappointed to get traded and have to
leave home. It is hard to move your family and your kids, but I've
been playing a long time, and I'm sick of being on [awful] teams. I
want to be on a good team, and I think I am now."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were off Monday, but pitcher Eric Gagne threw five
innings in a Class-A game, giving up two earned runs and three hits,
striking out five and walking none. Gagne threw 62 pitches.... The
Dodgers resume Grapefruit League action today against the Houston
Astros in Kissimmee, Fla. Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby, who are both
recovering from elbow surgery, are scheduled to pitch for the
Dodgers.... Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, slowed by a sore right
hamstring this spring and hitless in his first 11 spring at-bats,
will remain in Vero Beach and lead off all nine innings of a minor
league exhibition game.</TE>

<TE>   Update--How much talent the Red Wings have can be judged by the
fact that Brendan Shanahan, whose next goal will be the 500th of his

Wing roster--Brett Hull (672), Steve Yzerman (658) and Luc Robitaille

a knee injury, suffered a minor setback and is not expected back for

because of a sore neck. The Ducks have not won in Detroit since

<LD>How they got here: Maryland essentially played two home games in
Washington and made it through its pod unscathed. A lot of
bracket-heads had Valparaiso upsetting Kentucky in the opening round,
but Tubby Smith's Wildcats are the only Southeastern Conference
school (of six that made it) left in the field. Kentucky followed a
15-point victory over Valparaiso by defeating Tulsa. Southern
Illinois, seeded 11th, defeated Bob Knight-coached Texas Tech in the
first round and Jim Harrick-coached Georgia in the second.
Connecticut survived a tough first-round opponent in Hampton, and
then held off North Carolina State, 77-74, in a controversial finish.</LD>
<LD>   Difference makers: This regional is loaded with them. Maryland
string-bean guard Juan Dixon scored 29 points in each of the
Terrapins' two wins; Kentucky would be watching the second weekend on
television if not for senior Tayshaun Prince, who scored 41 points in
the Wildcats' victory over Tulsa. Southern Illinois is led by a flaky
but emerging star in sophomore forward Jermaine Dearman, who
outplayed Georgia's more touted interior men in Sunday's victory.
Caron Butler has already made a difference for Connecticut, scoring
34 points in Sunday's victory over North Carolina State. Butler also
had nine rebounds and four assists and made five free throws in the
last 11 seconds to secure the Huskies' three-point victory.</LD>
<TE>   Team tidbits: Prince's 41 points against Tulsa were the most
scored by a Kentucky player in the NCAA tournament since Jack Givens
had 41 against Duke in the 1978 finals. Southern Illinois, at No. 11,
is one of the lowest seeded teams to make the Sweet 16, although
Missouri at No. 12 has the Salukis beat this year. Since 1979, the
lowest-seeded teams to make the final 16 were No. 14 Cleveland State
in 1986 and No. 14 Tennessee Chattanooga in 1997. For what it's
worth, oddsmakers Glantz and Culver rate Southern Illinois as 100-1
to win the tournament. Maryland is tied with Kansas for second at
3-1, Connecticut is 8-1 and Kentucky 30-1.</TE>
<TE>   How it shakes out: Never underestimate a team on a mission, right?
Last year, Maryland won the West Region and finally got Gary Williams
to the Final Four, but a bitter semifinal loss to Duke appears to
have the Terrapins laser-beam bent on making amends. Kentucky will
need another huge game from Prince and a lot of help to beat
Maryland. Look for the Terrapins to get the ball inside to their big
guys, Lonny Baxter and Chris Wilcox, and pound Kentucky into
submission. That will lead to open looks for guards Dixon and Steve
Blake. In the other semifinal, don't be shocked if Southern Illinois
continues this ride and upsets No. 2 Connecticut. Southern Illinois
is no Cinderella. The Salukis under Coach Bruce Weber play tenacious
defense and have two inside players, Dearman and Rolan Roberts, who
aren't afraid to mix it up. Prepare yourselves for Maryland-Southern
Illinois in a tough-as-nails regional final. In the end, Maryland's
inside strength and the guard play of Dixon and Blake will be too
much for Southern Illinois to handle. Maryland returns to the Final
Four, hoping perhaps to bump into Duke.</TE>

<HD>Skategate Case Weak</HD>
<DH>Commentary: In statement, French judge denies voting for
Russian pair under pressure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is that all there is?</LD>
<LD>   Did the decision to award duplicate Olympic figure skating gold
medals to a Canadian pair at Salt Lake City rest on a muddled
statement by French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne, as detailed in a
startling story in today's editions of the Chicago Tribune?</LD>
<LD>   Or is there something more sinister at work?</LD>
<TE>   Something such as the International Olympic Committee, eager to
give the Games a positive slant, pressuring the International Skating
Union to devise a cosmetic solution to a crisis involving the
fundamental integrity of the sport?</TE>
<TE>   Something such as ISU President Ottavio Cinquanta, a former
speedskater, overreacting in his haste to resolve a public relations
nightmare?</TE>
<TE>   Something not yet evident, although all the principals seem to
have had their allotted 15 minutes of fame, and then some?</TE>
<TE>   Because if the awarding of a second set of medals was heavily
based on Le Gougne's signed statement, which the Tribune examined,
the IOC and ISU acted on flimsy evidence that raises more questions
than it answers.</TE>
<TE>   In a Feb. 15 news conference with IOC President Jacques Rogge,
Cinquanta said the ISU recommended Jamie Sale and David Pelletier of
Canada be elevated to co-gold medalist status with Russians Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze because Le Gougne "was submitted to
a certain pressure, and we do believe this pressure resulted in
putting this judge in a condition not to pronounce, not to give the
vote in an adequate manner." Le Gougne was part of the 5-4 majority
that ranked the Russians first in the free skating finale, giving
them the gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC's approval of the ISU's double-gold recommendation was
seen as a life preserver to Salt Lake organizers, whose Games were
about to be consumed by the media-fueled frenzy. Le Gougne was
suspended indefinitely; the ISU scheduled a hearing April 29-30 in
Lausanne, Switzerland, and said it won't comment until then.</TE>
<TE>   However, in the statement seen by the Tribune--which Le Gougne's
attorney said is the only documentation he has gotten from the
ISU--Le Gougne said she had not been pressured to vote for the
Russians.</TE>
<TE>   The Feb. 13 statement, according to Tribune Olympic reporter Phil
Hersh, is sloppily written, has no official letterhead, contains
typographical errors and employs abbreviations for the names of
principals and their nationalities.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether she thought the Canadian couple deserved to win but
voted for the Russians because she had been under duress, she
replied, "No, absolutely not." She acknowledged having told Ron
Pfenning, the referee of the pairs judging panel, during the
post-event judges' meeting that she had acted under pressure from
French Federation President Didier Gailhaguet, but she said her
jumbled emotions led her to misspeak.</TE>
<TE>   Pfenning's account of the post-event meeting was one of several
forwarded to Cinquanta claiming a breach of ethics had occurred.
Sally-Anne Stapleford, chairwoman of the ISU technical committee,
also told Cinquanta she spoke with Le Gougne in a hotel lobby and
said Le Gougne admitted to having been pressured.</TE>
<TE>   The first question in the statement asks, "Is it true that you
have declared on the occasion of the review meeting that you received
instructions from Mr. DG to place the Russian team first?"</TE>
<TE>   She replied: "Yes, it is true but I wish to add that my emotional
condition at that moment was not such to give me the opportunity to
give a proper response."</TE>
<TE>   The second question reads, "Is it true that in private you told
Mr. RP (immediately after the event Review Meeting there was a
private conversation between MRLG and RP) that the CAN were the best
but you had to do what you have done?"</TE>
<TE>   She responded: "No, absolutely not when I gave the marks, I was
conscious having at that moment the RUS as the best couple of the
free skating. The fact that the day after I could have had a
different opinion this should not have any relation with my
judgement."</TE>
<TE>   The statement ends: "MRLG wished to point out that contrary to
what appeared on certain media/journalists she never ever discussed
or reached any understanding with RUS representatives."</TE>
<TE>   If there's more, the ISU should say so, as soon as possible. Her
attorney, Max Miller of Salt Lake City, said the ISU might have more
documents, "but [the statement] is all I have." It should be
embarrassed to have allowed so sloppy a document to leave its hands.</TE>
<TE>   And if that's all there was, it acted with horrifying haste. It's
skaters who are supposed to have supple spines, not ISU
administrators. If it's proven they gave in to public pressure
without airtight and sufficient evidence of misdeeds, they will have
set the sport back more than any crooked ice dance judge ever did.</TE>

<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The Kings would rather not tinker with their nucleus but will
continue to discuss deals with other teams right up until today's
noon PST trade deadline, General Manager Dave Taylor said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're open and we're listening," Taylor said from El Segundo,
"but we don't necessarily want to mess with our core or the chemistry
we've had to this point. We're just talking to see if there's
anything out there that makes sense."</LD>
<LD>   If the Kings did make a deal, Taylor said, "we'd probably be
offering draft picks or prospects, as opposed to players off our
roster."</LD>
<TE>   The Kings acquired left wing Cliff Ronning from the Nashville
Predators on Saturday for seldom-used defenseman Jere Karalahti and a
2003 draft pick.</TE>
<TE>   Predator defenseman Kimmo Timonen told the Nashville Tennessean
that Karalahti, who had played in only nine games since November, had
been asking the Kings for some time to trade him.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a talk with him earlier," Taylor said. "His first choice
would be to stay here, but at the same time he wanted to play. And if
he wasn't going to be playing for us, he [said he] wouldn't be
against going somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   Karalahti told the Tennessean, "I had a good couple of years in
L.A., but this year around Christmas time it started turning bad. The
team was winning all the time and it was hard to break into the
lineup. There was a lot of talk about trades."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Heinze, who has one assist in his last 17 games and no goals
in his last 20, was benched Monday night for the third time in six
games.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing you can really do if the performance level is not
there is try somebody else," Coach Andy Murray said.</TE>

<DH>Hockey: Tough guy Belanger's two unlikely goals and
Deadmarsh's winner give L.A. crucial 3-2 victory at San Jose.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>The Kings' long climb from oblivion in the Western Conference moved
to within steps of the Pacific Division summit Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   Getting two unexpected goals from tough-guy left wing Ken Belanger
and the third-period winner from Adam Deadmarsh, the Kings held off
San Jose, 3-2, in front of a sellout crowd of 17,496 at the Compaq
Center to pull to within two points of the first-place Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   In pursuit of their first division championship since 1991 and
only the second in franchise history, the Kings are 3-0 against the
Sharks. The teams will play two more games in the season's final
three weeks, on Saturday at Staples Center and the finale back at the
Compaq Center on April 13.</LD>
<TE>   "Somehow, we've got their number right now," said King center
Bryan Smolinski, who survived a nasty second-period collision that
sent Shark winger Stephane Matteau to the hospital. "But all that
could change."</TE>
<TE>   The victory, their fourth in a row overall and fifth in six games,
improved the Kings' road record to 18-10-4-3, 16-5-4-2 since the end
of October. They've earned points in all but one of their last 11
road games.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger, who makes his living as an enforcer and hadn't scored in
more than 16 months, also figured indirectly in the winning goal.
With Owen Nolan in the penalty box for high-sticking Belanger, who
was left with a cut over his left eye that required stitches,
Deadmarsh scored his 26th goal on a shot from the right faceoff
circle with 5:44 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "I just had a couple of shots on net and they went in," said
Belanger, whose multi-point game was the first of his career. "It was
a big win for us. Every game now is big like that, so everyone's got
to step up."</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks have led the division race most of the season, but the
Kings have made steady progress in catching up, trimming what had
been a 14-point deficit on Dec. 9 by going 26-8-5-2 while the Sharks
have gone 22-15-3.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Kings' surge had caught the Sharks by surprise.</TE>
<TE>   "They're a very good team," Shark Coach Darryl Sutter said before
the game. "They were a better team than we were last year [in the
playoffs], so to think they're not going to be with us, somebody's
smoking the bad stuff....</TE>
<TE>   "Two things with L.A. that don't get talked about enough: They
play a really physical, hard game; it gets overlooked, I think. And
No. 2, how good they are defensively. They don't give up many scoring
chances."</TE>
<TE>   One area of concern for the Kings has been scoring, but they moved
to address that need Saturday, acquiring left wing Cliff Ronning in a
trade with the Nashville Predators. A 15-year NHL veteran, the
5-foot-8, 165-pound Ronning had been the Predators' leading scorer in
each of their four seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In his first game as a King, Ronning started on the second line
with Ziggy Palffy and Smolinski, with Jason Allison, Craig Johnson
and Deadmarsh making up the top line and rookie Jaroslav Bednar
sliding down to the fourth with Adam Mair and Belanger.</TE>
<TE>   Ronning, who had one shot on goal in 151/2 minutes, also saw time
on the top line after Johnson suffered a cut above his left eye and
left the game in the first period, complaining of blurred vision.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't Ronning or Allison or any of the other top scorers
who gave the Kings a 1-0 lead 3:37 into the game. It was the
6-foot-4, 231-pound Belanger, whose shot from the right circle gave
him his first goal in 33 games with the Kings; his first since Nov.
11, 2000, with the Boston Bruins, ending a 56-game drought; and only
his 10th in 229 NHL games.</TE>
<TE>   The score was still 1-0 less than 31/2 minutes into the second
period when Smolinski was sandwiched between Matteau and Shark
defenseman Bryan Marchment in a neutral-ice collision.</TE>
<TE>   "I just got my bell rung," Smolinski said.</TE>
<TE>   Matteau, however, got the worst of it. While the game was delayed
for about 10 minutes, he was lifted onto a stretcher and carried off
the ice. Though he was moving on his own and did not appear to be
seriously injured, Matteau was taken as a precaution to a local
hospital, where he was expected to be kept overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the teams battled on, Belanger giving the Kings a 2-0
lead at 3:23 of the third period on a shot from the left point.</TE>
<TE>   The Sharks, limited to nine shots on goal in the first two
periods, came alive in the third and pulled even on goals by Scott
Thornton and Marco Sturm.</TE>

<HD>In a Maverick State of Mind</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Tim Brown</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a terrific recklessness about the Dallas Mavericks, their
owner, their coach, their many-colored philosophies and strategies.
First in scoring, last in preventing it, there is frenzy in
everything they do, except winning championships, about which they
are apparently more methodical.</LD>
<LD>   So, there is no telling Don Nelson, a man with nothing to lose
that he hasn't lost before.</LD>
<LD>   One day, he'll beat the Lakers but good, and then maybe he'll
dance off to his beloved Maui, never to hack again.</LD>
<TE>   Until then, he schemes. And he stands before his bench, before his
funky owner and his posse of coaches and his loaded basketball team,
and he folds his arms and rocks on his heels and nods.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this is exactly how he planned it, from Shaq-a-Dope, to all
zone defenses all the time, to 40 three-point tries, the last played
so gallantly to the 300 sections at Staples Center on Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   Then, he tilts his head and snaps his tongue and says he'll be
back soon, with something fresh, something that will get him six more
points, or three, or even one.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, that's Don Nelson basketball," Laker Coach Phil Jackson
said. "They used to call it Donny-ball, back when he was at Golden
State and Milwaukee. It's a very unusual game and a fresh look at
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to play against and has its own merit."</TE>
<TE>   They'll play again tonight, the Lakers and the Mavericks, this
time in Dallas, not 48 hours after they played a riveting game in Los
Angeles, won by the Lakers. Of course.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks, improving as quickly as Mark Cuban's savings
account will allow, are 0-3 against the Lakers, 46-17 against the
rest of the NBA. Amazingly, Nelson has had three extreme game plans
for the Lakers, all remarkably unlike the one before, all terribly
entertaining.</TE>
<TE>   In the first game, in Los Angeles, Nelson ordered his defense to
front Shaquille O'Neal, hoping O'Neal would tire and the Laker
offense would stall. O'Neal made 18 of 23 attempts, scored 46 points
and the Lakers won, 98-94. "I should have had 60," O'Neal groused.</TE>
<TE>   In the second game, in Dallas, Nelson zoned the Laker offense for
more than 30 minutes, hoping O'Neal would tire and, well, you know.
O'Neal scored 31 points and the Lakers won, 101-94. "I'm not going
back to the drawing board," Nelson promised.</TE>
<TE>   Back in L.A. for Sunday's game, the Mavericks jacked all those
threes, and zoned, and screen-and-rolled, and fretted, and lost,
105-103. "We were right where we wanted to be," Nelson said.</TE>
<TE>   The question is, are they closing in on the Lakers? Or, do they
simply shoot well sometimes?</TE>
<TE>   "They shot the ball very well," O'Neal said Monday afternoon. "In
order for them to beat us, they're going to have to shoot the ball
perfectly."</TE>
<TE>   Time, and perhaps the playoffs, will tell.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to have a better structure on our screen-and-roll
defense," Jackson said. "They broke us down, they got the kinds of
looks they wanted, and we just had to survive with it. You can say,
'How well can a team shoot three-pointers over the course of a game?'
They can shoot them well, and they're a team that's capable of doing
it. So, we're going to have to be attentive."</TE>
<TE>   For what, exactly, tonight?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," Robert Horry said. "With Nellie, you don't even
try to get into his mind and try to out-think him."</TE>
<TE>   It is unlikely that the Lakers would ask for substantial--if
any--compensation were Jerry West to leave his consulting job to
become president of another organization.</TE>
<TE>   West spent his adult professional life with the Lakers, building
two separate winners in the process, and team owner Jerry Buss is not
expected to complicate an agreement should West conclude he would
pursue a challenge elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Out of the basketball management side for nearly two years, West,
63, is said to be mulling several situations outside of the Lakers,
including a potential club presidency with the Atlanta Hawks. If none
felt perfect to him, according to sources, West happily would remain
in Los Angeles and with the Lakers. Those close to him, however, say
West for the first time is curious about and willing to consider
other opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, the Art Garfunkel era: 61 games, 7.3 scoring average,
40.2% shooting, 31.4% three-point shooting, 4.9 rebounds per game.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, the Paul Shaffer era: four games, 14 scoring average,
63.9% shooting, 60% three-point shooting, 6.8 rebounds per game.</TE>
<TE>   Fox, who sheared himself before a fashion shoot last week, has
scored 12 or more points in four consecutive games. In the 61 before,
he scored at least 12 in seven.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey Hunter, who strained his left Achilles' tendon late in the
third quarter Sunday, practiced Monday and said he expected to play
tonight.</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Dallas, 5:30 PST, Channel 9</TE>
<TE>   Site--American Airlines Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 47-18, Mavericks 46-20.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Mavericks--3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Mavericks are 25-9 at home, though one of the losses
was to the Lakers, by seven points on Feb. 3. The Lakers have won
three in a row in Dallas, and seven in a row and 41 of 44 in the
series.</TE>

<LD>How they got here: Top-seeded Kansas survived a big scare, trailing
Holy Cross by five points on two occasions in a first-round game at
St. Louis. The Jayhawks, though, got it together in time to pull out
a 70-59 victory over the Crusaders before thumping No. 8-seeded
Stanford, 86-63. No. 4-seeded Illinois, meanwhile, had the easiest go
of it in the region playing in Chicago. The Fighting Illini spanked
San Diego State, 93-64, and then handled surprising Creighton, 72-60.
No. 6-seeded Texas is the region's lone party-crasher. The Longhorns
built a 22-point lead against Boston College and settled for a 70-57
victory, and they led by 23 against No. 3-seeded Mississippi State
before hanging on for the 68-64 upset in Dallas. No. 2-seeded Oregon
had to overcome first-round jitters at Sacramento but settled down to
beat Montana, 81-62. The Ducks then played catch-up all afternoon
with Wake Forest before catching and passing the Demon Deacons,
92-87.</LD>
<TE>   Difference makers: Kansas guard Kirk Hinrich, who severely
sprained his left ankle in the first half against Holy Cross and was
on crutches afterward, gave the Jayhawks an emotional lift when he
came off the bench against Stanford, scoring 15 points with eight
assists and five rebounds in 21 minutes. Illinois guard Frank
Williams will have to avoid another first-half nap, in which he was
held scoreless by Creighton, if the Illini hope to duplicate last
year's regional semifinal victory over Kansas. Texas point guard T.J.
Ford had 31 points and 13 assists in the Longhorns' two wins, not bad
numbers for a freshman. But he also committed a freshman-like 11
turnovers. Oregon point guard Luke Ridnour led the Ducks'
high-powered Quack Attack, scoring 46 points and making nine
three-pointers in Oregon's two victories.</TE>
<TE>   Team tidbits: Kansas, which has had a No. 1 seeding five times in
the last 14 seasons and been in the Final Four twice (1991 and 1993)
in that time frame, seemingly has its best shot at winning its first
national title since 1988. Second-year Illinois Coach Bill Self is in
his fourth consecutive NCAA tournament, having taken Tulsa in 1999
and 2000. The Fighting Illini have been to the Sweet 16 five times
(1981, '84, '85, '89, '01), the Elite Eight three times (1984, '89,
'01) and the Final Four once (1989). Texas is in its third Sweet 16
since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The Longhorns won
three NCAA tournament games in 1990 and two in 1997. Oregon, which
won the first NCAA championship in 1939, is in its first Sweet 16
since 1960.</TE>
<TE>   How it shakes out: A focused Kansas, with its inside-out game of
Hinrich and forward Drew Gooden, should be too much for Illinois to
handle, especially if Hinrich is sound and Williams goes to sleep for
a half again. Oregon's Ridnour, a seasoned sophomore, should exploit
the freshman Ford and force him into enough turnovers to get the
Ducks' transition game going and send Texas home. In a fast-paced and
three-point bombs-away regional final, the Ducks, who have been
gaining confidence with every tournament game, should outrun and
outgun the Jayhawks. Oregon's perimeter players--Ridnour, Luke
Jackson and Frederick Jones--are taller and more physical than
Kansas' guards.</TE>

<DH>Motor racing: Busy calendar features IRL, CART, Winston
Cup, other major series in coming weeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Move over basketball, tennis and hockey.</LD>
<LD>   Make room for motor racing. The vroom-vroom season is here. It
might not be "March Madness," but it's certainly "Spring Speed," and
there's never been anything like it in Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Over the next six weeks, virtually every racing series of national
significance in the country will be appearing either in Fontana at
the California Speedway or on the city streets of Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   A unique combination of oval and road racing at the same venue
will get engines revved up this weekend when two sanctioning bodies
make their Southern California debuts at California Speedway. The
3-year-old Grand American Road Racing series will test the new
21-turn, 2.8-mile infield road circuit on Saturday, with Tony
George's Indy Racing League running its Yamaha Indy 400 on the
two-mile oval Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's Grand American 400 will be four races in one, with
200-mph Ferraris, Lolas, Reynards and other exotic makes mixing it up
with street-going GT cars that include Corvettes, BMW M3s, Mazda
RX-7s and a variety of Porsches.</TE>
<TE>   The IRL race will be a preview of the Indianapolis 500. For the
first time since 1980 at Ontario Motor Speedway, the Indy cars will
be running a pre-Indy 500 race on a track as long as two miles.</TE>
<TE>   Not only will the full IRL cast, including defending Indy 500
champion Helio Castroneves, be on hand, but also Jimmy Vasser from
Bobby Rahal's CART team, getting acclimated to the IRL car he will
drive at Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   If the race follows the early 2002 pattern, it will be a showdown
between Sam Hornish Jr., the defending IRL champion, and Roger
Penske's twosome of Castroneves, winner of last Sunday's Phoenix 200,
and Gil de Ferran, last year's CART champion. Penske switched his
team from CART to the IRL after last season.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish won the season opener at Homestead, Fla., followed by the
two Penske cars. Last week it was Hornish following the Penskes,
finishing third.</TE>
<TE>   Speeds are expected to exceed 220 mph as the Dallara and G Force
cars, powered by Chevrolet or Infiniti engines, make their first
appearance in California.</TE>
<TE>   After a weekend off for Easter, racing returns to California
Speedway April 6-7 with the superbikes, AMA's most prestigious
road-racing event.</TE>
<TE>   Although the superbikes have been at Willow Springs Raceway in
Rosamond for several years, this will be their first appearance in
the greater Los Angeles area since a 1988 race on an artificial
course set up on the Pomona Fairgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Nicky Hayden, winner of the Daytona 200 two weeks ago, and
two-time AMA champion Mat Mladin will head the all-star field for a
pair of 100-kilometer championship events. Mladin, who was injured in
a prerace crash in Daytona, is expected to be at full strength for
Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   The motorcycles will run on a 21-turn, 2.3-mile course
specifically designed for two-wheelers. Both days will be full of
racing, with AMA-sanctioned events for 600cc supersport, 250 Grand
Prix and Formula Xtreme on both days, besides the superbike main
events.</TE>
<TE>   "The new road course is really incredible," said former world
champion Eddie Lawson after a test ride. "The layout ensures that
every race will be close and intense. With long straightaways and
slow right turns, you'll get a great mix of speed, hard braking and
passing opportunities. This track actually makes me wish I was still
racing."</TE>
<TE>   The 28th Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach on April 14 will give
Southland fans their first opportunity to compare the street-racing
CART champ cars on a 1.968-mile circuit with the oval-racing Indy
cars that will run on the two-mile oval in Fontana.</TE>
<TE>   It will also be the first chance to see what changes Chris Pook
has made in CART since taking over from Joe Heitzler in December as
president of the 23-year-old sanctioning body. Pook's footprints will
be everywhere, since it was in Long Beach that the former British
travel agent first produced a successful street race that became the
model for similar races worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Spectator grandstands to seat more than 63,000 people are already
becoming part of Long Beach's landscape. More than three miles of
fencing and 14 million tons of temporary concrete walls will define
the circuit, with 16,000 tires lashed together to minimize car crash
damage.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach will be CART's first U.S. race this year, the season
having opened in Monterrey, Mexico, where Cristiano da Matta won his
third consecutive raceafter finishing 2001 with wins in Australia and
at California Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time since CART was established in 1978, however,
there will be no Penske cars. When Penske, one of the founders of
CART, switched to the IRL, that left CART without its defending
champion, de Ferran, and its Long Beach winner, Castroneves.</TE>
<TE>   "Roger is an incredibly capable guy, but don't cast the other guys
in the CART series out of the window," Pook said shortly after taking
over the reins. "We've got some quality guys, really solid citizens,
in this series. Just look at the number of winners we had last year
in the CART series. There were 11 different winners."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Tracy, the Long Beach winner in 1993 and 2000, and Vasser,
the 1996 winner, will be in the field.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, NASCAR arrives with its Winston Cup spectacle
expected to attract more than 115,000 stock racing fans into
California Speedway for the April 28 NAPA Auto Parts 400.</TE>
<TE>   Rusty Wallace is defending champion, but the driver to watch will
be Sterling Marlin, the 44-year-old campaigner who nearly won the
Daytona 500 and then came back to win in Las Vegas and last Sunday in
Darlington, S.C. He will be leading the Winston Cup old-timers
against an under-30 group that includes Ryan Newman, Dale Earnhardt
Jr., Kurt Busch, Kevin Harvick, Jimmie Johnson and Elliott Sadler,
runner-up at both Daytona and Darlington.</TE>
<TE>   The day before the Winston Cup race will be a busy one. The
International Race of Champions, matching the best of NASCAR against
the best from open-wheel racing in identically-prepared Pontiac
Firebirds, will share the spotlight with Busch Grand National and
Winston West stock cars. NASCAR's Tony Stewart won the opening IROC
race at Daytona, closely followed by Hornish and Scott Sharp of the
IRL.</TE>
<TE>   And if four weeks of nationally prominent racing isn't enough,
there are the weekly Saturday night shows at Irwindale Speedway,
Perris Auto Speedway, Orange Show Speedway in San Bernardino and
Ventura Raceway. Of special note is a two-day appearance by the
American Speed Assn., a stock car organization, April 6-7 at
Irwindale.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Portland Trail Blazers are playing so well that they even beat
the Boston Celtics in a three-point contest.</LD>
<LD>   Bonzi Wells and Derek Anderson each made two three-point shots in
the fourth quarter and the Trail Blazers finished with 11 on Monday
night to beat the Celtics, 100-91, at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   It was Portland's 15th victory in its last 16 games.</LD>
<TE>   "We'd rather get inside and take high-percentage shots," said
Wells, who made a three-pointer with 11 seconds left to clinch the
victory and finish with 20 points. "But they won't let you get
anything in the lane."</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Kemp had 12 points and 11 rebounds in his second game
subbing for the suspended Dale Davis, and Rasheed Wallace scored 18
as Portland beat Boston for the first time in two tries this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We owed Boston," Wells said. "They came into our house and beat
us, and we wanted to return the favor."</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce had 28 points and eight rebounds for the Celtics, who
have attempted 1,575 three-pointers, by far more than any other team
in the league. Portland has tried 1,033.</TE>
<TE>   Portland was 11 for 32 from three-point range and four for 11 in
the fourth quarter. Boston finished five for 23.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 98, Denver 91--Jerry Stackhouse had 24 points and 11
assists, and led a fourth-quarter Piston surge at Denver, which lost
for the fifth consecutive time.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 113, Milwaukee 110--David Wesley made a three-pointer
with 28 seconds to play and two free throws with one second left to
lift the Hornets at Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 99, Golden State 96--Chris Whitney scored 20 points,
including five in the final 12.8 seconds, to lift the Wizards at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Whitney made a three-pointer that gave Washington its first lead
since the third quarter, 97-96.</TE>

<LD>The Phoenix Suns put forward Tom Gugliotta on the injured list Monday
because of a stress fracture in his right foot, probably ending his
season.</LD>
<LD>   Gugliotta has been sidelined for 33 of the Suns' 67 games because
of injuries, including the last three after injuring the foot against
Miami on March 12.</LD>
<LD>   The Minnesota Timberwolves signed free-agent point guard Robert
Pack, who played at USC, to a 10-day contract and put guard Will
Avery on the injured list because of tendinitis in his right knee.</LD>
<TE>   Commissioner David Stern says he is pleased with the direction of
the Denver Nuggets despite the team's struggles in recent years, and
that the city would be an excellent site for the All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Stern made the comments during an informal news conference before
the Nuggets' game with the Detroit Pistons.</TE>
<TE>   Stern said he is not concerned about owner Stan Kroenke's low
profile because he believes General Manager Kiki Vandeweghe has the
franchise headed in the right direction.</TE>
<TE>   Denver has not reached the playoffs since 1995 and has finished no
higher than fourth in the Midwest Division for the last 12 seasons.</TE>

<HD>Judge: NFL Can't Force Lawsuit Into Arbitration</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge ruled Monday that the NFL cannot force a $200-million lawsuit
into arbitration by saying that a union contract governs a player's
claim that his career was ruined when his eye was hit by a referee's
penalty flag.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Gerard E. Lynch in Manhattan
moves the case brought by former Cleveland Brown offensive tackle
Orlando Brown from federal to state court.</LD>
<LD>   Lynch rejected arguments from the NFL that the case should be out
of the courts altogether, decided instead by an arbitrator according
to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement between players and
teams.</LD>
<TE>   Brown brought the lawsuit against the NFL after referee Jeff
Triplette threw his penalty flag and it hit Brown's right eye during
a Dec. 19, 1999, game against Jacksonville.</TE>
<TE>   Brown never played again and was cut by the Browns in September
2000. At the time, he had a $27-million, six-year contract, from
which he collected a $7.5-million signing bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Brown has said he still feels pain and sees white flashes whenever
he exerts himself, and that he didn't learn of nerve damage and
damage to the viscous in his right eye until doctors in New York
examined him.</TE>
<TE>   Qadry Ismail, who led Baltimore in receiving last season with a
career-high 74 catches for 1,059 yards but became a victim of the
league's salary cap, agreed to terms with Indianapolis. Terms were
not disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland hired former quarterback Jim Harbaugh as an assistant
offensive coach.</TE>
<TE>   Harbaugh played 15 seasons with Chicago, Indianapolis, Baltimore,
San Diego and Carolina, passing for 26,288 yards and 129 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears' first-round pick out of Michigan in 1987, Harbaugh
started 140 NFL games. He joined the Panthers midway through last
season, but the team didn't invite him back for next season.</TE>
<TE>   Harbaugh, 38, probably will replace Marc Trestman, who is the
leading candidate to be new Coach Bill Callahan's offensive
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Former USC and San Diego State coach Ted Tollner was hired by San
Francisco as quarterbacks coach.</TE>
<TE>   Tollner had a 43-48 record the last eight years at San Diego
State. He resigned in November after the Aztecs' third consecutive
losing season.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Coach Steve Spurrier snagged another former Florida
Gator, receiver Jacquez Green, who signed a $4.3-million, three-year
contract. Green played four seasons with Tampa Bay, which tried to
re-sign him.</TE>
<TE>   Soccer</TE>
<TE>   Javier Aguirre, coach of Mexico's national team, soon will name
the 23 players he intends to take to the World Cup in Japan and South
Korea this summer.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he does, he will bring them to a 45-day training camp
and their Mexican league club teams no longer will have access to
them.</TE>
<TE>   Chances are that tonight's 7:30 game at the Coliseum between
Chivas of Guadalajara and UNAM Pumas of Mexico City will be the last
time Los Angeles fans will be able to see many of those players in
person, at least in their club colors, until after the May 31-June 30
World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   Chivas features such standouts as Oswaldo Sanchez, Ramon Morales
and Joel Sanchez, and Pumas feature the likes of Jorge Campos and
Emerson Dos Santos.</TE>

<TE>   Jeff Gordon confirmed that his wife has filed for divorce after
seven years of marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Brooke Gordon filed for divorce Friday in Palm Beach County, Fla.,
saying the marriage is "irretrievably broken." They have no children.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Brooke Sealey was a Miss Winston when she met Gordon in
victory lane after a race at Daytona International Speedway. Because
she was forbidden to date drivers under her contract, the two met
secretly for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Stewart was released from a hospital at Florence, S.C., a day
after hurting his back in a crash during the Carolina Dodge Sealers
400 at Darlington Raceway.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of Mike Tyson and heavyweight champion Lennox
Lewis met with officials of The Pyramid in Memphis, Tenn., to discuss
a possible title bout June 8 at the arena.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee had granted Tyson a boxing license before Washington did
likewise last week.</TE>
<TE>   The Court of Arbitration for Sport in Geneva said six Norwegian
athletes, Canada's Beckie Scott, and the Norwegian and Canadian
Olympic associations are demanding that medals be stripped from
cross-country skiers accused of using banned drugs at the Salt Lake
City Winter Olympics. Some of those who filed would receive gold
medals if the complaints are upheld.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Spain's Johann Muehlegg appealed his disqualification from
the 50-kilometer event, in which he finished first. Russians Olga
Danilova and Larissa Lazutina also have appealed.</TE>

<DH>Pro football: Meeting between NFL, Anschutz representatives
leaves Tagliabue encouraged about stadium prospects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ORLANDO, Fla.</DL>
<LD>NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Monday league officials met
recently with representatives of the Philip Anschutz-backed group
interested in building a football stadium in downtown Los Angeles and
expressed confidence things are moving in the right direction.</LD>
<LD>   "It is [encouraging]," Tagliabue said, briefing reporters on the
first day of the NFL owners' meetings. "One of the issues [in Los
Angeles] has been the ability to get a new stadium, and one that
would be extremely well received by the fans. So that's a positive
development."</LD>
<LD>   Anschutz, the Denver billionaire who built Staples Center, is
working with a high-powered coalition that includes Ron Burkle, Ed
Roski and Casey Wasserman. The group has yet to disclose the exact
site of the proposed stadium, but such a project would require
roughly 55 acres. Tim Leiweke, president of Anschutz Entertainment
Group and Staples Center, stopped by NFL headquarters last week while
on business at an unrelated convention.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas Cowboy owner Jerry Jones, a friend of Wasserman's, said he
has confidence the coalition has the wherewithal to build a privately
financed stadium, which could cost as much as $500 million.</TE>
<TE>   "That team is very qualified," he said. "I'm very impressed. I've
had a chance to work firsthand with Casey. So that combination of
energy right there, plus the skill that's involved, has a good chance
of getting it done. Seriously. I just like the whole idea of it."</TE>
<TE>   Anschutz owns four Major League Soccer franchises and last month
broke ground on a $120-million sports complex on the campus of Cal
State Dominguez Hills, where it's likely the San Diego Chargers will
move their training camp, beginning next summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know L.A. politics," said New England Patriot owner
Robert Kraft, who also owns an MLS franchise. "All I know is Phil
Anschutz is top drawer in any category. If he's involved, I bet good
things will happen."</TE>
<TE>   But Ralph Wilson, who owns the Buffalo Bills, thinks the lack of a
suitable stadium is only one of the things L.A. needs to change.</TE>
<TE>   "There was so much apathy the last time," he said, referring to
the city's failed bid to land the expansion franchise awarded to
Houston in 1999.  " ... There's got to be a show of enthusiasm.
They've got to want a team."</TE>
<TE>   Tagliabue said important late-season games this season might be
switched from Sunday afternoon to Monday night to attract more
viewers. The schedule, he said, probably will allow one Sunday game
in each of the last four weeks to be switched to the Monday night
game.</TE>
<TE>   The switch has been sought by ABC's "Monday Night Football" for
years because of the unpredictability free agency and the salary cap
have brought to the NFL. Late-season games that looked attractive
before the season, when the schedule was set, turned out to be duds
because one or both teams involved were not as good as they had been
the previous season.</TE>
<TE>   The new plan must be signed off on by CBS and Fox, and in the
past, Fox has indicated strong opposition to such a proposal. Said
Said Tagliabue: "We will ensure that there will be attractive games
in all the time slots on Sunday and on Monday nights."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Rangers acquired forward Pavel Bure in a trade with the
Florida Panthers on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   New York, which also acquired a second-round pick, sent defenseman
Igor Ulanov and young defenseman Filip Novak to Florida, along with
its first- and second-round picks in June's draft, and a fourth-round
pick next year.</LD>
<LD>   The Rangers, who have fallen to ninth place in the Eastern
Conference, missed the playoffs the last four seasons.</LD>
<TE>   New York trails Montreal in the race for the final playoff spot in
the East.</TE>
<TE>   Bure, who turns 31 this month, has two years left on a contract
that will pay him $10 million per season, as well as an option in the
2004-05 season for $11 million.</TE>
<TE>   The "Russian Rocket" led the league in goals each of the last two
seasons. The speedy All-Star right wing has 22 goals in 56 games this
season. He had 59 last season and 58 in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlanta Thrashers traded captain Ray Ferraro to St. Louis for
a fourth-round draft pick, giving the 18-year veteran a chance to
finish his career with a playoff team.</TE>
<TE>   Ferraro, in the midst of his worst season with only eight goals,
hasn't scored since Feb. 8. He has 27 points in 61 games.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo Sabre captain Stu Barnes is expected to be sidelined for
up to two weeks because of a concussion suffered against Tampa Bay on
Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Philadelphia 3--Sheldon Keefe scored with 1:36 left
in the third period to complete the Lightning's three-goal rally at
Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 4, Atlanta 2--Milan Kraft scored 1:14 into the third
period at Atlanta and the Penguins went on to end a three-game losing
streak.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 1, Carolina 1--Sami Kapanen scored with 10.4 seconds left
in regulation and the Hurricanes extended their NHL record by tying
for the seventh consecutive time at home.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas 2, Chicago 2--Derian Hatcher scored with 5:43 left in
regulation, giving the Stars a tie at Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Calgary 2--Richard Park scored two goals for the Wild
at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>

<KH>Lonnie White ON THE NHL</KH>
<HD>Granato Can See It From All Sides</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tony Granato knows all about the rivalry between the Kings and the
San Jose Sharks.</LD>
<LD>   As one of the few players in the NHL who has played for both
franchises, Granato considers the Kings vs. Sharks one of the
league's most underrated matchups.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a good solid rivalry," said Granato, who played nearly seven
seasons with the Kings and five with the Sharks before retiring after
last season. "Even if the teams were out of the playoff race, it
would still be exciting. But this is really great. Both teams are
having success this season and fighting for home ice position in the
playoffs. That's a rivalry to me."</LD>
<TE>   Granato has been impressed with how well the Sharks have come
together this season. San Jose has been the Pacific Division leader
since December.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best Sharks team that I've seen," said Granato, who
had 248 goals and 492 points in 774 NHL games. "I've watched this
team develop for the past six years. And this year's team has been
getting it done on a daily basis. The team has the ingredients to
win. The Sharks have great goaltending and players who are committed
to each other and willing to make the sacrifices to accept roles that
they might not like in order to help the team win."</TE>
<TE>   But before the Sharks can think about the playoffs, they have to
hold off a late-season charge by the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   A 3-2 victory Monday in San Jose moved the Kings to within two
points of the Sharks. The teams meet two more times this season,
including Saturday at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Granato credits Los Angeles' run this season to King General
Manager Dave Taylor, a former teammate, and Coach Andy Murray.</TE>
<TE>   "They have done a great job of turning the Kings from a mediocre
team that everyone kind of counted out before the season into a real
contender," Granato said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the teams meet in the playoffs, it would just be great for
both organizations and hockey in the state of California."</TE>
<TE>   Working as a pregame and postgame radio host for the Sharks,
Granato has been enjoying his first season as a broadcaster, although
he admits that nothing replaces playing.</TE>
<TE>   "It is nice to still be a part of hockey, and around so many of my
friends," he said. "There are still some days when I think that maybe
I should have stuck around for another year. But I understand that
when you make a decision to put closure to your career, it's
important to be ready to move on to the next part. The next part is
not easy, especially because I played hockey for so long. But, so
far, I'm really having fun."</TE>
<TE>   Still a Waiting Game</TE>
<TE>   The chances of backup goaltender Jamie Storr getting another start
this season for the Kings are pretty slim.</TE>
<TE>   Starting netminder Felix Potvin wants to play every game, and
Murray is in agreement. Murray has played Potvin in 95 of 105 games
since he was acquired by the Kings on Feb. 15 of last year and is
likely to stick with him right into the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   That adds up to a lot of tough nights sitting for Storr, who would
rank second in the league with 2.05 goals-against average if he had
more starts.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to know that you've done everything that you can where
your stats are great, but yet there isn't any reward of playing
more," Storr said. "But I'm starting to understand that maybe it's
just taking a little longer for me. Maybe it will take two years
before the reward."</TE>
<TE>   Watching Potvin lead the Kings' stretch run is nothing new to
Storr. Last season, he watched Potvin start 23 consecutive games to
close the regular season and all 13 playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tough situation here because I know no matter what I do,
I'm not going to get an opportunity to be No. 1," Storr said. "I am
not satisfied with where I am, but I know that the best thing I can
do is continue to play well in games so everyone can see that I have
what it takes to play in this league."</TE>
<TE>   Storr was drafted by the Kings with the No. 7 overall pick in 1994
and made his NHL debut on Jan. 24, 1995. For years, he has been
regarded as the Kings' goaltender of the future, but that's starting
to change.</TE>
<TE>   At 26, Storr has the longest tenure of any current King and is no
longer considered a young phenom. IHe has been one of the league's
most consistent goaltenders this season and has a 72-59-19 record in
his eight-year career, but to Murray, that's not enough to get him
more playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the situation isn't the way I want it to be," Storr
said. "But I also know that anything can happen in the game of
hockey. I've been through three owners and three different coaches.
I've been through every one of my teammates coming and going. I know
what seems to be the best today, might not be that way tomorrow. That
could happen with me. Today it might look like that I won't play for
the rest of the season. Then tomorrow, I could suddenly look like the
guy who's going to be playing every day."</TE>
<TE>   For now, Storr understands that he has to be a team player.</TE>
<TE>   He could tell people he wants to be moved before the league's
trading deadline today at noon, but doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got time on my side. I am not aging quickly right now, I'm
aging slow," Storr said. "My wife has helped me understand that if I
sit there and sulk and feel sorry for myself, I won't be ready when
my opportunity comes." But with a 1.98 goals-against average and a
7-2-2 record in his last 11 starts this season, Storr's not ready to
wait forever.</TE>
<TE>   "I love L.A., and I would love to end my career here," he said. "I
would love to be here eight or nine more years. But if you talk to
anyone who has played the game, you're only happy when you play. I'm
not looking to sit like this and not play for a long period of time.
Four years can fly by and all of the sudden, I'm 30 years old and
still waiting for an opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Line Shifts</TE>
<TE>   * Something that has never made sense is the NHL's use of a
video-replay judge rather than an on-ice official to decide
controversial plays near the goal. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman
should borrow from the NFL, so the referee who made the call has a
chance to review the play on video.</TE>
<TE>   * Deals that reportedly may be made before the trading deadline:
Dallas goalie Ed Belfour to St. Louis; Washington center Adam Oates
to either Chicago, Phoenix or St. Louis; and Pittsburgh defenseman
Darius Kasparaitis to Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   * Toronto's recent acquisition of goaltender Tom Barrasso raises
questions about the Maple Leafs and their No. 1 goalie, Curtis
Joseph, who has been sidelined because of a fractured left hand.
According to Bill Watters, Maple Leaf president, Barrasso was picked
up to back up Corey Schwab until Joseph returns. But the message is
clear: Joseph's injury may be more serious than initially thought,
and management does not have confidence in Schwab as a playoff
goaltender. With Joseph and Barrasso both becoming unrestricted free
agents this summer, the Maple Leafs are skating on thin ice.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chicago Blackhawk forward Al Secord, 44, who enjoyed
several great seasons skating on a line with Denis Savard and Steve
Larmer in the old Chicago Stadium, is now a pilot for American
Airlines.</TE>

<KH>Robyn Norwood ON COLLEGE BASKETBALL</KH>
<HD>On Game's Biggest Stage, the Players Are the Thing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's about the players.</LD>
<LD>   While the debate rages on--Steve Lavin can't coach, Steve Lavin
can coach, Lavin, Lavin, Lavin--let's pause to remember.</LD>
<LD>   No matter how many sideline shots you see of Mike Krzyzewski, Lute
Olson or Tubby Smith, keep in mind that the closer we get to the
Final Four, the more it is about the guys who dribble the balls and
not the ones who roll them out.</LD>
<TE>   Don't misunderstand: Krzyzewski is in the Hall of Fame and Olson
belongs there, especially after this season.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon and Pittsburgh are in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16 for
the first time in eons because Ernie Kent and Ben Howland have shaped
those programs with sharp, analytical minds.</TE>
<TE>   And UCLA is going to San Jose because Lavin gets talented players
and gets the best out of them come March. (As they say, "scoreboard:"
At the moment, Lavin's .688 NCAA tournament winning percentage is
better than Jerry Tarkanian's .679.)</TE>
<TE>   But it is about the players.</TE>
<TE>   Even Krzyzewski could not get to the Sweet 16 with Siena's team.</TE>
<TE>   What's odd about this season is how wrong so many have been about
so many players.</TE>
<TE>   The Associated Press preseason All-America team consisted of Jason
Williams of Duke, Casey Jacobsen of Stanford, Kareem Rush of
Missouri, Frank Williams of Illinois and Tayshaun Prince of Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   Not one of them was the player of the year in his
conference--though it's worth noting that all but Jacobsen are still
alive in the tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The honors went to Maryland's Juan Dixon in the Atlantic Coast
Conference, USC's Sam Clancy in the Pacific 10, Kansas' Drew Gooden
in the Big 12, Indiana's Jared Jeffries in the Big Ten and Alabama's
Erwin Dudley in the Southeastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Of the five players on the preseason All-America team, only Jason
Williams made the postseason team. The others were Gooden, Dixon,
Cincinnati's Steve Logan and Gonzaga's Dan Dickau.</TE>
<TE>   As the tournament goes on, you're going to see more players who
were very little talked about during the season--spectacular athletes
such as Maryland's Chris Wilcox, Missouri's Rickey Paulding and
Oregon's Frederick Jones, who is only now being discovered east of
the Willamette Valley.</TE>
<TE>   There's Oklahoma power forward Aaron McGhee and Connecticut
shot-blocker Emeka Okafor, and that's assuming you know the Sooners'
Hollis Price and the Huskies' Caron Butler.</TE>
<TE>   It might be that when careers are shorter and there are fewer
great players, it is easier for surprises to emerge.</TE>
<TE>   Talk of the Bruins having the most talent is a stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not the most talented, by far," one prominent NBA talent
evaluator said.</TE>
<TE>   "At least five programs have talent equal to or better than UCLA's
talent.... Yes, they are talented. The most? I don't think so.
Maryland, Duke, Kansas, Arizona for sure."</TE>
<TE>   Who would you want?</TE>
<TE>   Cedric Bozeman? Or Duke's Chris Duhon?</TE>
<TE>   Billy Knight or Jason Williams?</TE>
<TE>   Jason Kapono or Mike Dunleavy?</TE>
<TE>   Matt Barnes or Dahntay Jones?</TE>
<TE>   Dan Gadzuric or Carlos Boozer?</TE>
<TE>   Only Barnes comes out ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Try it with Maryland, Kansas, even Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Who would you want?</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman or Maryland's Steve Blake?</TE>
<TE>   Knight or Dixon?</TE>
<TE>   Kapono or Byron Mouton?</TE>
<TE>   Barnes or Wilcox?</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric or Lonny Baxter?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe you'd take Kapono and Barnes, though Wilcox gets more NBA
buzz.</TE>
<TE>   Who would you choose?</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman or Kansas freshman Aaron Miles?</TE>
<TE>   Knight or Jeff Boschee?</TE>
<TE>   Kapono or Kirk Hinrich?</TE>
<TE>   Barnes or Gooden?</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric or Nick Collison?</TE>
<TE>   If they played the way they did against Cincinnati, maybe Bozeman
and Gadzuric.</TE>
<TE>   Try Arizona, even.</TE>
<TE>   Bozeman or Jason Gardner?</TE>
<TE>   Knight or Salim Stoudamire?</TE>
<TE>   Kapono or Luke Walton?</TE>
<TE>   Barnes or Rick Anderson?</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric or Channing Frye?</TE>
<TE>   Barnes and Gadzuric, maybe.</TE>
<TE>   It generally takes two to three great players--great by college
standards, not necessarily NBA potential--to win the NCAA title.
(Villanova in 1985 was probably the last exception.)</TE>
<TE>   Duke, Maryland and Kansas all have that.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, UCLA, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Missouri and Oregon lead
everybody else in the maybe category.</TE>
<TE>   Throw all the coaches' names in a basket and give them a new team
in the Sweet 16.</TE>
<TE>   There are four who've won a national championship: Krzyzewski,
Olson, Smith and Jim Calhoun.</TE>
<TE>   No one would be betting on them if they had Southern Illinois.</TE>

<DH>Lavin Might Not Be a Textbook Coach, but He's Obviously
Doing Something Right</DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You knew it was an amazing game.</LD>
<LD>   But not until reading and listening to the accounts of UCLA's
upset of Cincinnati did you realize how amazing.</LD>
<LD>   Not only had the eighth-seeded Bruins come back from a 13-point
deficit and survived two overtimes to beat the top-seeded Bearcats in
this spring's first felling of an NCAA tournament giant.</LD>
<TE>   But they apparently had done so without a coach.</TE>
<TE>   The seniors took over. The freshmen grew up. The talent kicked in.</TE>
<TE>   And Steve Lavin?</TE>
<TE>   Well, um, er, hmm, ah, er, um....</TE>
<TE>   After each of the Bruins' mostly awful 11 losses this season,
Steve Lavin was the target.</TE>
<TE>   Yet after their biggest victory Sunday, he was a footnote?</TE>
<TE>   C'mon people. Fair is fair.</TE>
<TE>   If we're going to rip him for not calling the right plays in
losses, then we must commend him for empowering his players to
improvise in victories.</TE>
<TE>   If we're going to say he's too close to his players after losses,
then we must congratulate him when that positive approach becomes a
victory.</TE>
<TE>   If we're going to fire him after a midseason stinker to Arizona
State ...</TE>
<TE>   Then what now?</TE>
<TE>   Shouldn't we at least say that he's doing, I don't know, something
right?</TE>
<TE>   With five Sweet 16 appearances in his six years as coach, could we
even say he's doing something special?</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to coach at a school where you receive a lot of
adulation, UCLA is not the place," Lavin said Monday with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   But still ...</TE>
<TE>   In the 27 years since John Wooden retired, no other UCLA coach has
made it to the Sweet 16 in consecutive seasons.</TE>
<TE>   In the current basketball environment, only Duke's Coach Mike
Krzyzewski can match the current five-for-six streak.</TE>
<TE>   Notice I didn't put Lavin's name in the same sentence as that Duke
guy's. There's only so much Lavin loathers can handle right now.</TE>
<TE>   I understand. Nobody has ripped Lavin as much as I have. I even
once spent an entire season burying him, with every column written
about him containing the words, "But can he coach?"</TE>
<TE>   That was the 1999-2000 season, when his team lost a dozen times.</TE>
<TE>   Before, of course, stunning heavily favored Maryland by 35 points
in a second-round tournament game.</TE>
<TE>   Just as they had stunned Michigan two years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Just as the Bruins stunned Cincinnati on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   It's no longer coincidence. It's no longer luck. And in watching
some of the country's best players cower under the streaking Bruins
in March, you can no longer say it's simply talent.</TE>
<TE>   Can Steve Lavin coach?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps not precisely in the way that UCLA fans have long defined
coaching.</TE>
<TE>   But certainly in a way that works today.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe he doesn't coach textbook strategy. But he certainly can
give his players the confidence to find the answers themselves.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, as in every other big tournament victory, his veterans
owned crunch time. Dan Gadzuric, Matt Barnes and Jason Kapono simply
wouldn't let the Bruins</TE>
<TE>   lose.</TE>
<TE>   Does that come naturally? If it did, then Cincinnati's veterans
would have done the same thing. Yet they wilted under dictator Bob
Huggins' glare.</TE>
<TE>   It is no coincidence that the only time in the last six years
Lavin did not make the Sweet 16, he was bounced out in the first
round with the youngest team in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "You hope your players develop a leadership quality during the
season, so in March, they can become an extension of the coaching
staff on the floor," Lavin said.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Lavin also isn't the master of organization during timeouts.
But his teams certainly get the message when it counts.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruin victory Sunday was the ninth consecutive overtime win
under Lavin. In Lavin-coached games in which they have been leading
with five minutes remaining, they are 115-5.</TE>
<TE>   "This time of year, the hay's in the barn, you don't need to make
any dramatic changes," Lavin said. "You are who you are."</TE>
<TE>   And, certainly, maybe his star players don't always get better
under him. But as Sunday's game showed, some players do.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Knight has clearly found himself under Lavin, much as Earl
Watson did last season.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Gadzuric might not have learned a lot of footwork, but he
certainly runs and works harder than ever.</TE>
<TE>   And at the beginning of the season, not even one of Lavin's
45-minute postgame monologues could convince me that Cedric
Bozeman--who didn't really play the position even in high
school--would ever be a point guard.</TE>
<TE>   After Sunday, it now seems possible.</TE>
<TE>   For all of his perceived shortcomings, Lavin annually reminds us
that all things seem possible.</TE>
<TE>   Does that make him another John Wooden, a sideline genius, a
conventionally brilliant coach wielding brightly colored markers and
a dark frown?</TE>
<TE>   While traveling to San Jose this weekend to watch a team that
could steal a national title, ask yourself another question.</TE>
<TE>   Does it matter?</TE>

<HD>It Was So Close to Rush Week</HD>

<DL>COLUMBIA, Mo.</DL>
<LD>It might have made a wonderful weekend. Glenda Rush gets a soft,
dreamy sound to her voice when she imagines it.</LD>
<LD>   "Two of my boys playing against each other in the Sweet 16. UCLA
against Missouri and me cheering for both teams. Kareem and JaRon,
they never played against each other. They were always on the same
team. When UCLA beat Cincinnati, that's the first thing that came to
my mind. I wish JaRon was still at UCLA."</LD>
<LD>   Kareem Rush, a smooth, strong, wiry 6-foot-6 forward for Missouri,
took two elbows to his lip, endured 21 stitches and still managed to
star in the Tigers' two upsets--over No. 5-seeded Miami and No.
4-seeded Ohio State--in the first two rounds of the NCAA West
Regional last weekend.</LD>
<TE>   For their efforts, the No. 12-seeded Tigers play No. 8 UCLA on
Thursday night in San Jose in the regional semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   From the moment the Bruins finished their double-overtime
elimination of top-seeded Cincinnati on Sunday, Kareem Rush felt
flutterings in his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   He felt tremendous joy in the way he and his teammates had rallied
from a stumbling stretch of late-season basketball that almost left
Missouri in the NIT. He felt delicious anticipation for a basketball
meeting against good friends. Kareem almost went to UCLA. He felt a
rapport with Bruin Coach Steve Lavin. He became buddies with UCLA
junior Jason Kapono.</TE>
<TE>   But Kareem also feels some deep sadness and a little regret. His
big brother, JaRon, could have been a UCLA senior. "Me and JaRon, we
used to talk about playing against each other in the NCAA
tournament," Kareem said Monday afternoon. The words came hard,
partly because of his injured lip and partly because it hurts a
little to speak about JaRon.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it would have been cool to play JaRon and I think he
wishes he was still at UCLA," Kareem said. "We talked yesterday. He
was all bragging about how UCLA will take us, but I could tell he
wishes things were different."</TE>
<TE>   The story of JaRon and Kareem, the talented brothers from Kansas
City, is well-known to Los Angeles basketball fans. JaRon was the
massively admired, ardently recruited star who verbally committed to
Kansas, then changed his mind and came to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Two years of ugly controversy followed. Both JaRon and Kareem were
caught up in a Kansas City scandal involving their AAU coach, Myron
Piggie, who last May went to prison on a felony count of conspiracy
to commit mail and wire fraud and a misdemeanor count of failure to
file income taxes.</TE>
<TE>   JaRon, after sitting out part of his freshman year because of
injuries, spent much of his sophomore year at UCLA under NCAA
suspension and finally, having given up on class and fallen terribly
out of shape, JaRon hired an agent and declared he wanted to play in
the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   Kareem too served an NCAA suspension, but it was shorter and only
served to convince Kareem that his college career and his basketball
were too important to lose. Kareem had almost come to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "But I was more a small-town boy," Kareem says. "Los Angeles, it
scared me a little, the fast pace and the temptations. And when Coach
Q [Quin Snyder] got the Missouri job and we met, we clicked. I was
tempted to play with JaRon but ultimately I felt better at Missouri."</TE>
<TE>   JaRon went undrafted by the NBA. He became a basketball vagabond,
bouncing between minor pro leagues and stints in alcohol rehab. Now,
Glenda says, JaRon isn't playing basketball at all, isn't working, is
living at home with her and searching for something.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a little lost," Glenda says. "Truth be told, I think JaRon
would love to be at UCLA right now. Truth be told, JaRon can hardly
watch college basketball on television. It hurts him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's proud of Kareem, but he has those thoughts. JaRon was always
the best, better than Kareem in high school and I know it makes him
sad when he sees what he could be doing this weekend."</TE>
<TE>   JaRon wasn't available to talk, Glenda says. "He's out for the
night, I guess. He always comes home in the morning, though."</TE>
<TE>   Kareem says he thinks JaRon might come to San Jose on Thursday.
Glenda says no.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think he could stand it," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Kareem would like for his big brother to watch him play. Kareem
would love for JaRon to celebrate with Kareem, for this has not been
an easy season for Kareem.</TE>
<TE>   This basketball year was expected to be a breakout for both Kareem
and Missouri. A year ago, Kareem played the best game of his career,
of his life, against Duke in the NCAA tournament. Even though his
hand was partly covered in a splint because of a broken bone, Kareem
was dazzling. He scored 29 points. He made five of eight
three-pointers. He kept Missouri in the game longer than it should
have been and afterward all the Duke players were saying things like
Kareem was already good enough to be starting in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   So Kareem was supposed to play that way every game this year. And
Missouri, which was ranked as high as No. 2 this season, was supposed
to ride Kareem to at least the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   "Because of that Duke game," said Snyder, who himself played at
Duke, "Kareem was the target of everybody's defense this year. Kareem
had to learn how to persevere through that and through some
criticism. He's learned how hard work can prepare and improve his
mental toughness and when his mental toughness increased, Kareem
found joy in the game again."</TE>
<TE>   Kareem heard himself ripped on the radio and whispered about
around the Big 12. He heard people say the worst thing: "Kareem's no
different than his brother. He's not going to make it."</TE>
<TE>   "That hurt," Kareem says, "but just because JaRon has made
mistakes, it doesn't mean I</TE>
<TE>   will."</TE>
<TE>   And, as Snyder says, Kareem was the No. 2 scorer in the Big 12,
which still has four teams alive in the Sweet 16. He does average 20
points a game and 5.2 rebounds and he does have 83 assists. He did
make two free throws after suffering the mashed lip and did play two
days later even though Glenda couldn't watch the game. "I was so
afraid," she said, "that Kareem was going to take another elbow to
the mouth. And then what?"</TE>
<TE>   And then what? "Oh, I'd play," Kareem says. "Nothing's keeping me
off the floor now. But I kind of wish JaRon was going to be on the
floor Thursday too. That would be something to see."</TE>

<HD>El Toro Has Some Early Momentum</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Few who followed the Ramada Express Best of the West softball
tournament last week in Bullhead City, Ariz., could have imagined
that a team that lost four of its expected starters would emerge as
the most impressive in the field.</LD>
<LD>   But it was Lake Forest El Toro's kind of week, beginning with its
stunning, tournament-opening victory over Tucson Flowing Wells,
Ariz., the nation's second-best team, according to some ranking
organizations.</LD>
<LD>   With sophomore pitcher Tanza Lewis leading the way, and the
development of the infield behind her, El Toro is off to an 8-3 start
after its third-place finish in the Best of the West tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "I wanted to continue building the confidence level of the team,
continue the learning that we have going on with the young players to
get them to the point where I have confidence in them as a team and
they have confidence in each other to compete for a league
championship," El Toro Coach Jim Daugherty said.</TE>
<TE>   But third place? Against that field?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a realist," Daugherty said. "There are a lot of new faces in
our infield. I was confident our pitching was competent, we had good
catching, a stable outfield.... It was just the infield that needed
retooling, and they've come along really well."</TE>
<TE>   At the end of last season, El Toro lost only one senior, third
baseman Bryttani Lindheim, to graduation. But then came losses that
weren't expected.</TE>
<TE>   The player Daugherty had penciled in for third base was deemed
ineligible. The first baseman decided to get an after-school job. The
second baseman contracted mononucleosis.</TE>
<TE>   The shortstop, Stephanie Churchwell, one of the most talented
sophomores in the state and the team's leading hitter, had a
protruding disk in her back and is out for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Andrea Forrest, a 4.0 student, stepped in at third base
and drove in the winning run against Anaheim Canyon in the
third-place game on Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Every game you can see the confidence building in her," Daugherty
said. "I don't even remember the other girl's name."</TE>
<TE>   The shortstop is sophomore Danielle Quimby and the second baseman
is senior Krystal Hurtado. They platooned at second base last year.
Hurtado made the transition to left-handed batter, and drove in the
winning run against Flowing Wells.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Erin Maurer and senior Robyn Ford-Feitz, who also pitches
and plays outfield, share first base depending on which of El Toro's
three pitchers is in the circle. Each is vastly different. Ford-Feitz
relies on her control, Lewis is the power pitcher and senior Jennifer
Churchill, 10-2 last season, favors off-speed pitches.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis' emergence is most intriguing. She was 22-1 last season on
the junior varsity. Lewis not only beat Flowing Wells, but she also
defeated Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the star of the tournament," Daugherty said. "This girl
has so much focus. I didn't even call her pitches, I let [senior
catcher] Rachel Greyson call the game [against Flowing Wells]. It was
a thing of beauty."</TE>
<TE>   Tough schedule: Newhall Hart may have had the worst schedule of
the Best of the West participants. Its game against Santa Ana
Foothill ended after 10:30 p.m., and the Indians had to be at the
field the next morning at 6:30 for a 7:30 game.</TE>
<TE>   Close rivals: The Marmonte League is consistently one of the
deepest, most competitive leagues in the state, and it is living up
to that reputation this season. The six games in the opening week of
league play included five one-run decisions--two were extra-inning
games, including a scoreless tie between Westlake and Royal.</TE>
<TE>   One wasn't actually a league game--Simi Valley upset Royal, 2-1,
in the championship game of the Simi Valley tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Hueneme? Why not? Oxnard Rio Mesa (4-4), ranked No. 21 last week
by The Times, played three games last week, all against Oxnard
Hueneme. Rio Mesa won the first game, 1-0, but lost the second,
2-0--both league games. Then Hueneme beat Rio Mesa in the
seventh-place game of the Simi Valley tournament, 5-1.</TE>

<LD>One by one, they sprint, shivering in their surfer shorts, from the
locker room to the steaming pool, where they dive in like polar bears
seeking refuge.</LD>
<LD>   It's 6:15 a.m. at Agoura High, and 43 students are working
feverishly on their freestyle and breaststrokes.</LD>
<LD>   Except these are no ordinary swimmers. They are baseball players.</LD>
<TE>   For nearly 60 minutes, in a brisk but low-key workout, they follow
the directions of their youthful coach, Zach Miller, who's wearing a
ski cap and holding a giant cup of coffee to keep warm.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the second inning," Miller says to his players. "Go hard."</TE>
<TE>   Coughing and giggling, they splash away.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the bottom of the third. There's been a leadoff walk. We
have to defend it," Miller says.</TE>
<TE>   They push off from the wall, swimming in groups and acting as if
they know what they're doing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the bottom of the fifth. Don't let up. Nine outs to go,"
Miller says.</TE>
<TE>   Since the second day of school in September, Agoura baseball
players have been rising at dawn three times a week to engage in swim
workouts. There are no bats or balls in sight. Miller uses baseball
terminology to remind his players what sport they are really focused
on.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about work ethic," Miller says. "We're working on endurance,
on the mental aspects. We're working on breathing. We're working on
pushing our level of competition, the ability [to understand that]
when you can't go any more, you find a way to keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there were skeptics who wondered if Miller knew what he
was doing by starting swim workouts for the baseball team in his
rookie season as coach.</TE>
<TE>   Few question his wisdom these days. Agoura finished 18-8 and took
second place in the Marmonte League, a dramatic improvement over its
last-place finish in 2000. This season, the Chargers are 4-0 and
considered Marmonte title favorites. Miller has already accomplished
his goal of building his team's self-confidence and teaching that
hard work can produce positive results.</TE>
<TE>   "We almost feel like we need to do it," outfielder Brian Grant
said. "If we just stopped, it would hurt us."</TE>
<TE>   Said pitcher Brandon Canning: "It's a little strange, but we feel
it strengthens our arms a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Miller, 31, played baseball at Nevada Las Vegas and remembers
early morning lifting workouts. His players lift weights on the days
they don't swim. The swimming workouts are not mandatory, but most
attend because they know that not participating could give the edge
to a competitor.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful swimming helps hitters hit fastballs or curveballs
any better, but that's not the point.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's anyone that's going to outwork us in
preparation for a game," Miller says. "I'm about trying to be a
champion and [develop] a champion's work ethic. We're just trying to
improve every day."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's father, Larry, is a football coach at Oxnard Hueneme
High. You'd never guess they are father and son because their
personalities are so different. Larry is calm and quiet; Zach can't
stand to be either.</TE>
<TE>   Zach Miller has clearly made an impact. Agoura doesn't have
players who are 6 feet 3 and throw 90-mph fastballs, but they can
score lots of runs. With senior Canning and sophomore J.T. Trelatsky,
the pitching staff might be good enough to win a league title.</TE>
<TE>   And the swim workouts are worth it, if only for the smiles they
provide.</TE>
<TE>   One time it was so cold in the morning that outfielder Casey
McCarthy and pitcher Steve Crump showed up wearing wetsuits. By the
end of their workout, they were so hot they could have stripped.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the weekly fun of watching 6-2, 215-pound second
baseman Bryan Huston perform a cannonball from the platform to see
how big a splash he can produce.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I've been crowned champion," Huston said.</TE>
<TE>   The players benefit from the innovative approach.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm giving them every opportunity to succeed," Miller says.
"There will be no excuses when they graduate."</TE>

<LD>How they got here: Top-seeded and No. 1-ranked Duke defeated Winthrop
easily but had trouble with Notre Dame in the second round, raising a
few eyebrows. Still, Duke won a game in which Mike Dunleavy wasn't
close to his best, Carlos Boozer had foul trouble and Jason Williams
had to go to the free-throw line down the stretch. The Blue Devils
came from behind to beat the Irish, 84-77. By comparison,
Indiana--Duke's opponent Thursday--beat Notre Dame, 76-75, in
December. The fifth-seeded Hoosiers reached the Sweet 16 fairly
easily, beating Utah and holding off a North Carolina Wilmington
rally after USC stumbled to the Seahawks in the first round. Kent
State, seeded 10th, cleared out the region by upsetting No. 7
Oklahoma State and No. 2 Alabama. But the Golden Flashes figure to
run out of upsets against No. 3 Pittsburgh, which advanced by beating
Central Connecticut State and California.</LD>
<TE>   Difference makers: It's fashionable now to consider other players
for national player of the year, but ask any coach picking a team
whose name he'd call first: It's Williams. Dunleavy has guard skills
in a big-man's body with a great basketball mind--a combination that
makes him extremely valuable and able to take advantage of the
inevitable mismatches. Indiana relies on 6-foot-10 forward Jared
Jeffries. With his inside-outside NBA skills, Jeffries might average
more points in the pros than his 15 in the Hoosiers' deliberately
paced game. Brandin Knight does everything for Pitt but make free
throws: He shoots 44% from the line, which makes Williams look
brilliant at 67%. Trevor Huffman is a nice player for Kent State, but
it's hard to forget his flame-out against Cincinnati in last year's
NCAA tournament after a first-round upset of Indiana: He went two for
11 and scored only seven points.</TE>
<TE>   Team tidbits: Duke is one of the nation's top-scoring teams,
sandwiched between Kansas and Oregon at 90 points a game. Indiana,
far more deliberate in its style, averages 70. No team in the
tournament attempts more three-pointers than the Blue Devils, though
Missouri isn't far behind. Pitt--playing in a regional semifinal for
the first time in 28 years--is one of the nation's best defensive
teams, giving up 60 points a game. In two NCAA tournament games, the
Panthers gave up 54 and 50. Pitt is 17-1 this season when holding
teams under 60 points. Kent State is remarkable for winning at least
one game in the tournament two years in a row despite a coaching
change. Stan Heath, a former Michigan State assistant, replaced Gary
Waters when he left for Rutgers.</TE>
<TE>   How it shakes out: If anyone had told Mike Krzyzewski before the
tournament all Duke would need to do this week to reach his 10th
Final Four would be beat Indiana and either Pittsburgh or Kent State,
he would have been thrilled. The Pittsburgh players will actually
have to get on a plane this week after playing the first and second
rounds in Pittsburgh, but the Panthers will be favored over Kent
State. (By the way, it's still home for Pittsburgh forward Jaron
Brown: He went to Lexington's Bryant Station High.) Pittsburgh's
defense is good, but not good enough to stop the Blue Devils. Duke
moves on, as usual.</TE>

<HD>Future Not Tense</HD>
<DH>Young Bruins Provide a Look Ahead With Maturing Play</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The thought was as fleeting as it was appealing. Steve Lavin grinned
a week ago when asked about leaving UCLA for another job, getting out
on his own terms, head high, landing somewhere the populace would
appreciate a string of 20-victory seasons and Sweet 16 appearances.</LD>
<LD>   DePaul has an opening. Other schools will too.</LD>
<LD>   But the UCLA coach paused, contemplated what he has built in
Westwood and said, "I don't think I want to go anywhere because we
have such a great team coming back."</LD>
<TE>   The current season isn't over, thanks to the Bruins' most
determined effort in years, a 105-101 double-overtime victory over
Cincinnati, the top-seeded team in the West Regional. No. 8-seeded
UCLA will face No. 12 Missouri on Thursday in the round of 16 in San
Jose.</TE>
<TE>   But it's not too early to also consider the development of
individual players and take a peek into their future. Depending on
whether the veteran-dominated starters or the youthful reserves were
on the floor, watching the Bruins against Cincinnati and first-round
victim Mississippi was like visiting Jurassic Park or Tomorrowland.</TE>
<TE>   "Distributing playing time and coming up with effective
combinations has made this my most challenging season as a coach,"
Lavin said. "But the only challenges are on the court. There hasn't
been a single problem with these kids off the court, and that's made
the season enjoyable despite the ups and downs."</TE>
<TE>   Getting up and down the floor with extreme quickness could be the
team's signature next season. Already, UCLA goes from stodgy to
sprightly when sophomore T.J. Cummings and freshmen Cedric Bozeman,
Dijon Thompson, Andre Patterson and Ryan Walcott are in the lineup.
The tempo increases, opponents get flustered and the game is fun to
watch.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way we'll be next season," Cummings said. "I think
we'll press and run and force a lot of mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   The tournament games at Pittsburgh were a sneak preview. Bruin
reserves scored 42 points against Mississippi and 23 against
Cincinnati, with Thompson leading the way with 26.</TE>
<TE>   "What's nice is our freshmen are building confidence," Lavin said.
"They are taking shots with games on the line. That's a great sign
for the future."</TE>
<TE>   The departure of seniors Dan Gadzuric, Matt Barnes, Billy Knight
and Rico Hines will be felt; they combine for nearly 40 points, 18
rebounds and seven assists a game. And if Jason Kapono, a junior,
leaves for the NBA, he'll take with him another 16.3 points, 5.2
rebounds and 2.1 assists.</TE>
<TE>   However, Kapono sends signals that he might return. And three
players sitting out this season should go a long way toward filling
the gaps.</TE>
<TE>   Guard Ray Young, who is redshirting, will be a senior. He is a
solid defender who isn't afraid to launch three-point shots. Although
his shooting percentage dipped in each of his last two seasons, he
has spent the last 12 months honing his stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Another shooting guard, junior Jon Crispin, will be eligible after
transferring from Penn State, where he averaged 8.2 points and made
110 three-point baskets in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Fey, a 6-11 freshman center, is redshirting because it
took him until January to gain admittance to UCLA. He can't be
expected to fill Gadzuric's shoes right away, but he's strong and
skilled.</TE>
<TE>   The two players at the end of the bench, redshirt freshman Josiah
Johnson and sophomore center John Hoffart, will add depth, and
incoming freshman wing player Evan Burns of Fairfax High is expected
to contribute immediately, much the way Thompson has this season.</TE>
<TE>   "We have the makings of a really good squad," Thompson said.
"We'll all get better during the off-season. That's the key for us,
to keep improving."</TE>
<TE>   Near the top of the long list of criticisms directed at Lavin is
that his players don't improve. But a close look at the current
roster provides a forceful rebuttal.</TE>
<TE>   * Barnes and Knight, who both contemplated transferring early in
their careers, persevered and steadily polished their games, hiking
their scoring averages every year.</TE>
<TE>   Lavin has allowed Barnes to operate on the perimeter for the first
time, with mixed results. A streaky shooter, the 6-7 forward has made
41 of 98 three-point attempts and finds teammates while playing
something of a point forward, leading the team with 104 assists.</TE>
<TE>   However, he is also the leader in turnovers with 85 and his
rebounding has slipped from 7.2 a game a season ago to 6.0. He has
only 41 offensive boards.</TE>
<TE>   Knight, a full-time starter for the first time, is 60 of 147 from
three-point range, like Barnes making better than 40%. His senior
season has been beyond anyone's expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Both are also on track academically. Knight, who redshirted his
second year, has graduated and Barnes plans to finish his
requirements during the summer.</TE>
<TE>   * Gadzuric and Cummings. Big men often confound even the most
highly respected coaches with their inconsistency. Witness former
Arizona center Loren Woods and current Duke post player Carlos
Boozer.</TE>
<TE>   Gadzuric's career, to be sure, has been wildly uneven. But in his
last 18 games he has finally found consistency, scoring in double
figures in all but four games and dominating Cincinnati with 26
points and 13 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   Like Barnes, he is only a few classes short of his degree despite
not redshirting.</TE>
<TE>   Cummings has improved his scoring average from 6.4 to 7.8 and his
field-goal percentage from 48.5% to 51.4%. He is not as strong
defensively or on the boards as he should be at 6-10, but plans to
continue adding muscle mass during the off-season.</TE>
<TE>   * Kapono and Hines. Neither has an especially high ceiling, but
both get the most out of their ability.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono is one of the nation's most accurate shooters and his climb
through the Bruin record book in scoring categories is a testament to
his consistency. He has 87 three-point baskets this season after
making 84 in 2000-2001 and 82 in 1999-2000.</TE>
<TE>   And he proved during a nine-game early-season stint at point guard
that his ball-handling skills have improved--UCLA won all nine games.</TE>
<TE>   Hines, a senior, came to UCLA as an afterthought and will leave
with a legacy as a leader.</TE>
<TE>   He never did develop a shot--his seven points against Mississippi
were three more than any other game this season. But he takes more
charges than any other Bruin, dives for balls, brings tenacity on
defense and sets a great example for younger players.</TE>
<TE>   Hines, who redshirted last season, has graduated and Kapono is on
track to do so if he returns for his senior year.</TE>
<TE>   * Bozeman and Walcott. No one has taken more lumps than the
freshmen point guards, but their anticipated meltdown in Pittsburgh
never materialized and they outplayed senior foes Jason Harrison of
Ole Miss and Steve Logan of Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Their position is the most difficult to master and mistakes ripple
across all five players on the court. Both players need to hone their
outside shooting and Bozeman must become a better free-throw shooter.</TE>
<TE>   But Walcott's playmaking in the last month and Bozeman's improved
defense and aggressive ball-handling indicate the basketball will be
in good hands in coming seasons.</TE>
<TE>   * Thompson and Patterson. No one has improved more dramatically
than Thompson, who went from a turnover-prone liability to a clutch
shooter and opportunistic defender seemingly overnight.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson, a human pogo stick, is shooting 53.8% and crashes the
boards harder than any other Bruin, averaging a rebound every four
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-7 freshmen are rapidly becoming adept at the full-court
press, making the most of their athleticism and long arms.</TE>
<TE>   So Lavin most likely won't clear out his office in Morgan
Center--to the chagrin of his critics.</TE>
<TE>   The future is too bright.</TE>
<TE>   And it's a future he molded.</TE>

<LD>How they got here: No. 8-seeded UCLA's subregional victories were
startling, No. 12 Missouri's were surprising, No. 3 Arizona's were
workmanlike and No. 2 Oklahoma's were expected. UCLA had the most
exhilarating performance, beating No. 1 Cincinnati, 105-101, in
double overtime, and the biggest blowout, 80-58, over No. 9
Mississippi. Missouri followed its upset of No. 5 Miami with the most
one-sided second-round game, an 83-67 upset of No. 4 Ohio State.
Arizona turned back upstarts UC Santa Barbara and Wyoming. Oklahoma
has momentum--and perhaps a chip on its shoulder. The Sooners were
seeded below Cincinnati despite beating Kansas in the Big 12
Conference tournament final and knocked off pesky Illinois Chicago
and Xavier in the first two rounds.</LD>
<TE>   Difference makers: UCLA still might not have faced the best player
to wear a Cincinnati uniform. Oklahoma forward Aaron McGhee, who left
the Bearcats after one season, scored 25 points against Xavier and 26
against Illinois Chicago. But the Bruins won't see him unless they
get past Missouri and Kareem Rush, younger brother of former Bruin
enigma JaRon Rush. Kareem, a forward who considered attending UCLA,
averages 20.3 points and 5.3 rebounds. Although Arizona has two
freshmen starters, veterans Jason Gardner and Luke Walton were
integral to the Wildcat run to the national title game last season.
The best matchup Thursday will be Gardner against Oklahoma's Hollis
Price, an in-your-face defender who dates an Italian runway model.
But the biggest difference-maker of all might be Arizona Coach Lute
Olson, who usually has his team at its best in the second half of
close games.</TE>
<TE>   Team tidbits: Maybe UCLA can shake Missouri by yelling "Tyus
Edney" whenever a Tiger gets ready to shoot. In a second-round
tournament game in 1995 at Boise, Idaho, the UCLA point guard drove
the length of the court in 4.8 seconds and made a layup to give the
Bruins a 75-74 victory. UCLA went on to win the national championship
and Missouri did not make the tournament for the next four years. Now
Missouri can make history with a victory by becoming the first No. 12
seed to advance to the round of eight. Oklahoma was outrebounded by
Xavier but had only six turnovers. Arizona's victory over Wyoming at
Albuquerque might have been expected, but the Cowboys have won more
games at "the Pit" than any other visiting team.</TE>
<TE>   How it shakes out: The winner of Oklahoma-Arizona undoubtedly will
be favored over either UCLA or Missouri. But why not go with the
Bruins? They have gotten to the Elite Eight only once under Coach
Steve Lavin and haven't made a Final Four since that Edney-fueled
NCAA title run in 1995 under Jim Harrick. They need to end Missouri's
sudden rebirth to gain either a rubber match against Pac-10 foe
Arizona or a showdown with the Sooners, the regional's hottest team
with a 10-game winning streak. The Bruins won't fear the Wildcats,
who had to overcome a 20-point second-half deficit to beat UCLA at
Tucson and fell, 77-76, at Pauley Pavilion. Dan Gadzuric had 22
points and 16 rebounds in the Bruin victory and would relish another
matchup with Wildcat freshman center Channing Frye.</TE>

<DL>NAGANO, Japan</DL>
<LD>Russia's Alexei Yagudin, the only Salt Lake Olympic champion
competing in the World Figure Skating Championships, easily led his
qualifying group in the men's competition Monday.</LD>
<LD>   In the other qualifying group, former U.S. champions Tim Goebel
and Michael Weiss each landed quadruple jumps to finish 1-2. The
qualifying counts for 20% of the final score.</LD>
<LD>   In pairs competition, China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo won the
short program, worth one-third of the final score. Placing second
were Russia's Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin. The U.S. pair of
Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman was third.</LD>
<TE>   Both Olympic gold-medal pairs--Russia's Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze, and Canada's Jamie Sale and David Pelletier--skipped
the event.</TE>
<TE>   In men's qualifying group, Goebel, the 2001 U.S. champion, landed
two quads, including one in combination, as he performed a clean
routine to "An American in Paris." In Salt Lake City, Goebel landed
three quads, a first in the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "In qualifying it's not worth the risk of doing a third quad,"
Goebel said. "But I'm happy I did the quad-toe, because I've been
having trouble with that."</TE>
<TE>   His other quad was a salchow.</TE>

<HD>A Toxic Mess for Taxpayers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis is taking fire from cities, including Santa Monica,
for extending the deadline on removing a toxic pollutant from
gasoline in the state. Like many other small cities, Santa Monica has
seen its water wells contaminated by the chemical, MTBE, which is
used to reduce air pollution by oxygenating gasoline. What is so
frustrating about this mess is that new gasoline formulations don't
even need oxygenates to meet clean air standards. It is political
calculation that forced the state into a choice between water
pollution and gas panic.</LD>
<LD>   First, a little history. Under a 1990 federal law, California had
to choose between MTBE--methyl tertiary butyl ether--and ethanol, an
alcohol made mostly from corn, to oxygenate gasoline. At the time,
MTBE seemed safe and preferable. Now, with MTBE's dangers known, the
Bush administration has refused to lift the 1990 oxygenate
requirement, pushing the state to begin right away using ethanol to
replace MTBE. An immediate switch would probably cause statewide
gasoline shortages and price spikes to perhaps $3 a gallon because
the state's gasoline producers lack the infrastructure for massive
use of ethanol. So Davis has delayed a state ban on MTBE for one
year, until the end of 2003.</LD>
<TE>   Gasoline producers had counted on either an Environmental
Protection Agency waiver from the 1990 law that would allow them to
use newer gasoline formulations or congressional action delaying
immediate use of ethanol. What they didn't count on was the electoral
importance of corn-producing Midwestern states in the coming 2002
midterm and 2004 presidential elections.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis administration, however, should have been more candid
about its choices. State officials, in supporting the delay of the
ban, pointed to the replacement of old, corroded gasoline storage
tanks. But gasoline still leaks, even from new tanks, and 20% of the
old ones have not been replaced. There are more than 10,000 cases of
ground-water contamination by MTBE, a toxin that imparts a foul smell
and taste to water. Any cleanup would cost billions of dollars, and
little is being done because of battles over who's responsible and
who would pay.</TE>
<TE>   A pair of companion bills in the state Legislature by Sen. Nell
Soto (D-Pomona) and Assemblywoman Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park) would
help. They would levy a 30-cent-per-barrel fee on oil refined in
California, generating an estimated $200 million a year for cleanup.
California needs to be more aggressive in treating contamination
before it grows to impossible proportions. As these bills are
debated, lawmakers should consider whether 30 cents a barrel is
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Congress and President Bush should also help California pay for
the cleanup that will result from their follies. Since the ethanol
requirement is so entwined with electoral politics, true justice
would deduct the cleanup from campaign war chests. But as usual,
taxpayers will get stuck with the bill.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry and Anna Polivoda survived the Holocaust, but they couldn't
escape a speeding suspect who plowed into them Saturday in a
crosswalk near the Beverly Center. They remain in intensive care at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center while a daughter questions why the Los
Angeles Police Department was chasing the vehicle in the first place.</LD>
<LD>   We wonder too. High-speed pursuits should be reserved for
motorists suspected of serious and violent crimes--those whose
continued freedom would pose a greater risk to the public than the
immediate dangers of a chase.</LD>
<LD>   The LAPD says officers began chasing a car whose registration did
not match the license plate sticker. After a few minutes the driver
lost them. A police helicopter picked up the pursuit, and a short
time later the driver hit several other cars and the strolling
couple. Two passengers jumped out of the suspect's car, ran into the
Beverly Center and were never caught.</LD>
<TE>   Officers charged the 23-year-old driver with evading arrest and
hit-and-run and later determined that the car had not been stolen.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the American Civil Liberties Union highlighted the
increasing death toll resulting from LAPD chases. Since then, the
number of chases has decreased, a drop that law enforcement experts
attribute to a flood of lawsuits and to the deaths of suspects,
police officers and bystanders. It also stems, they say, from a drop
in crime and from better training, as required by state law. The
LAPD, once the region's leader in the number of police chases,
reported 36% fewer pursuits between 1995 and 2000, according to the
California Highway Patrol.</TE>
<TE>   Those statistics represent progress, but they provide no comfort
to Henry Polivoda, 79, who had never been hospitalized until
Saturday. They offer no comfort to his wife, Anna, 76, whose leg was
so seriously broken that doctors first thought they would have to
amputate it.</TE>
<TE>   What would comfort others who walk or drive in this city is a
common-sense pursuit policy that puts public safety first. The LAPD
says that is the policy it has. If so, did this chase follow the
rules?</TE>

<HD>Copyright War: Find a Truce</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A full-fledged war between Hollywood and Silicon Valley is breaking
out over digital copyright protection, but it isn't even
entertaining. In the past few weeks, entertainment and computer
industry executives have been facing off before Congress to excoriate
each other rather than reach a solution together to digital copyright
issues that are slowing the distribution of new technologies and
products. Hollywood complains that Silicon Valley is gutting its
business by encouraging consumer piracy; the computer companies
counter that the movie and record industries need to rethink their
business model. The pressure is being upped to have Congress pass
draconian legislation to hammer software producers.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides have it wrong. How do you keep running an ice cream
shop if people have figured out how to steal ice cream? That's what
the manufacturers of CDs, DVDs and movies are faced with as their
products get copied on home computers. But that doesn't mean you try
to prevent consumers from sampling new, more powerful flavors or from
having the product delivered to their houses, either.</LD>
<TE>   Even as the two camps denounce each other, the outlines of a
solution to this impasse started to emerge at Senate Judiciary
Committee hearings last week. Justin Hughes, UCLA visiting professor
of law, correctly noted that it is important to make a distinction
between digital piracy of works and unauthorized copying by private
citizens that is not distributed beyond a small circle of friends.
The former threatens the profitability of industry; the latter is
protected by the "fair use" doctrine.</TE>
<TE>   This is the distinction that was successfully drawn for
videotapes, allowing consumers to tape a movie broadcast on
television but outlawing street sale of that same tape. Of course,
there's a twofold difference between the videotape debate of the
1980s and the debate now: The Internet can transmit almost instantly,
and digital technology allows perfect copying.</TE>
<TE>   One thing that Congress could do is mandate certain digital
"locks" in software in exchange for the industry conceding a certain
amount of private copying at home. Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), the
top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, has noted that a so-called
flag could be used in digital broadcasts that would allow digital
home recording but prevent redistribution of such recorded programs
via the Internet. Draft legislation being proposed by Sen. Ernest F.
Hollings (D-S.C.) would go too far, crippling the ability of
consumers to copy movies and music.</TE>
<TE>   As technology races ahead, the movie and recording industries are
always going to complain that they are about to go under. But
Congress needs to realize that neither Hollywood nor Silicon Valley
has a patent on the truth about the digital era. A truce between the
two sides based on limited-use restrictions may be the best answer to
this thorny problem.</TE>

<HD>Brockovich Joins Campaign Against Ahmanson Ranch</HD>

enlists the movie namesake's aid.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Adding more star power to opposition forces against the Ahmanson
Ranch project, environmental heroine Erin Brockovich formally joined
the celebrity campaign Monday against the $2-billion housing
development.</LD>
<LD>   The environmental crusader and her employer, attorney and Thousand
Oaks Mayor Ed Masry, called for a new environmental impact report for
the 3,050-home development that would be built in the Simi Hills in
eastern Ventura County, just across the Los Angeles County line.</LD>
<LD>   Brockovich has long opposed the project, but Monday was her first
appearance on behalf of Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, which counts
movie director Rob Reiner and actor Martin Sheen among its spokesmen.</LD>
<TE>   The coalition hopes the names of Brockovich and Masry will give a
strong boost to their campaign against developer Washington Mutual.
Brockovich works as an investigator for Masry's law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Brockovich and Masry's investigation of Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's
chemical ground-water contamination in Hinkley, Calif., led to a
$333-million settlement six years ago and inspired a movie starring
Julia Roberts as Brockovich.</TE>
<TE>   Although there is no evidence of similar contamination at
Ahmanson, Brockovich argued that more testing is needed, given the
land's proximity to a former nuclear research facility at
Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Field Lab. "Any parent who goes in there
may be buying blindly," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Ahmanson spokesman Tim McGarry reacted angrily to Brockovich's
comments, calling them "a thoroughly contrived attempt to garner
additional publicity for the opposition's cause."</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason to expect ground-water contamination since
Ahmanson and Rocketdyne are fed by two separate aquifers that have no
geological connection," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Masry and Brockovich also urged retiring Ventura County Supervisor
Frank Schillo to call for a new traffic study on the Ahmanson Ranch
project or to immediately resign and let his successor take over.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks was elected earlier this
month to replace Schillo when his term expires at the end of the
year. Parks is calling for a new environmental report and an expanded
traffic study, saying the data supervisors used when they approved
the development in 1992 are outdated.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo said Monday that county attorneys and transportation
officials have determined there is no need for a new traffic study
because the scope of the development hasn't changed. To call for a
new study, Schillo said, would only leave the county open to a
lawsuit by the developer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be built," Schillo said of the project.</TE>
<TE>   Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch has filled the airwaves with radio
ads in recent weeks hoping to pressure county supervisors to call for
a new environmental impact report or for Washington Mutual to drop
the project altogether.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its approval a decade ago, the development has been
stalled by more than a dozen lawsuits and by the discovery of a rare
flower and frog on the property. Plans to protect the San Fernando
Valley spineflowers and California red-legged frogs have been drawn
up and will go before supervisors later this year.</TE>
<TE>   If supervisors approve those plans, the project may go forward
next year as scheduled.</TE>

<HD>3 Men Guilty of Trying to Kill 2 LAPD Officers</HD>
<DH>Crime: The street gang members set up an ambush following a
high-speed chase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three street gang members were convicted Monday in Los Angeles
Superior Court of trying to kill two LAPD officers in an ambush
following a high-speed chase in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph "Little Respect" Aghazadeh, 20, Mario "Little Boy" Aleman,
25, and Ramon "Chubbs" Maldonado, 22, were found guilty of attempting
to murder Officers Tom Baker and Carlos Langarica. They also were
convicted of robbing a passerby of his wallet.</LD>
<LD>   All three face maximum life sentences for each of the attempted
murders. Sentencing is scheduled April 3 before Judge Larry Fidler.</LD>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the gang members lured the officers into their
neighborhood, blocked their passage at an intersection and opened
fire on them from at least two directions. Neither officer was hurt,
and the three suspects were apprehended, including one who was shot
several times by police and severely wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very scary, well-done ambush" in which one officer
probably would have been killed if the assailant's weapon had not
jammed, Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen said in an interview
Monday after the two-month trial.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred about 3:30 a.m. on July 4, 2000, when
Aghazadeh, Aleman and Maldonado--members of the Toonerville gang in
Atwater Village--set out to retaliate against a member of the rival
Rascals gang who lived about three miles away. They believed the
Rascals were responsible for drive-by shootings in their
neighborhood, Ipsen said.</TE>
<TE>   But they aborted the plan when they discovered that a passerby had
noticed them walking toward the rival's residence. After robbing the
passerby, the three cruised the neighborhood in a Honda until they
noticed Baker and Langarica in a patrol car, Ipsen said.</TE>
<TE>   With Baker, a 22-year-veteran, driving, the pursuit reached speeds
up to 70 mph on surface streets. The defendants led the patrol car
toward their own neighborhood. "We knew we were entering hostile
territory," Langarica, a six-year veteran, said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   At Bemis Street and Brunswick Avenue, the gang members slowed
their car as they turned the corner, Langarica said. As the officers
followed, they noticed someone had pushed a washing machine or dryer
into the middle of the street while another person shoved a bicycle
in front of them in apparent attempts to slow the patrol car,
Langarica said. "I felt like we had fallen for a trap," he said. "It
was a very overwhelming feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Someone then opened fire from behind them while one of the gang
members in the Honda shot at them from the other direction. Four
bullets hit the patrol car.</TE>
<TE>   Baker reacted by driving the patrol car into the Honda to push it
out of the way. He then opened fire, hitting Maldonado five times,
Ipsen said. Maldonado was carrying an assault pistol, but never
fired, said his lawyer, Steve Seiden of Huntington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Langarica said he saw Aleman "bail out of" the Honda
and run toward the patrol car, pointing his assault pistol directly
at him. Langarica shot twice, but missed. "I thought I was going to
be dead," Langarica said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer said Aleman came close enough so that he could see the
teardrop tattoo below his left eye. "I can't forget the face, it's
like looking at death," Langarica said.</TE>
<TE>   But Aleman's gun apparently jammed, and he dropped it and fled a
short distance before backup officers, who had just arrived, stopped
him without further resistance. The driver of the car, Aghazadeh,
also was caught at the scene. Ipsen said he was carrying a toy
pistol.</TE>

<HD>Public May Gain Access to 17 Seaside Sites</HD>
<DH>Government: Laguna Beach council is to vote on accepting
easements that owners gave up to get shoreline property.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Laguna Beach City Council is poised tonight to adopt 17 stretches
of beach for public use.</LD>
<LD>   In order to win California Coastal Commission approval, seaside
landowners seeking building permits in past years had to promise that
the public could use adjacent stretches of beach. But the easements
are in danger of expiring--some in less than a year--if a local
agency or nonprofit group doesn't accept responsibility for them.</LD>
<LD>   "For these particular locations, it will clarify that the public
clearly has unfettered access and that individual property owners
don't have any special rights," said Kenneth C. Frank, city manager.
"Most of the public won't know the difference, but it's still
important to ensure those rights are protected."</LD>
<TE>   The California Coastal Commission and the California Coastal
Conservancy are working to open nearly 1,300 points of access along
the increasingly developed coast, with many points in Malibu, as well
as in Orange, Santa Barbara and Mendocino counties.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County lacks the high-profile battles over beach access
that have taken place elsewhere. But it has one of the worst records
in the state for acquiring beach easements, having accepted only a
quarter of 94 offers to dedicate coastal access, said Susan Jordan, a
board member with the League for Coastal Protection. The adopting
agency agrees to maintain the easements and accept liability.</TE>
<TE>   "You're on the low end," she said. "In a perfect world, everyone
realizes that everyone has the right to access [to] the beach.
Unfortunately, not everyone does."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Wayne Baglin recalled past years when Laguna Beach residents
put up rope barriers to keep the public off their sand because the
land was still private. Though the city hasn't had such problems for
a number of years, the expected adoption of the easements would
guarantee that the public would be able to access those areas in
perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   People strolling the coast will probably be oblivious to the
change, though it will affect residents who enjoy playing with their
dogs on the beach or having a cocktail on the sand, because the city
does not allow off-leash dogs or alcohol on public beaches.</TE>
<TE>   Baglin said he will vote for the easements, though he would like
to know more about how much the move will cost the city.</TE>
<TE>   Frank said he believes the cost will be negligible, except for a
more controversial easement at Smithcliffs, which will be the subject
of a special hearing in April. A gate to a 12-foot-wide walkway that
leads to a public park was welded shut, fencing and paving were
removed and trees were planted in the walkway. Opening this easement
could cost $50,000 per year, which Frank said is too costly.</TE>
<TE>   The county will consider adopting 12 easements in south Laguna
Beach soon, said Eric Jessen, chief of the county's Harbors, Beaches
and Parks Division. He said he hopes to bring these and other
easements still awaiting adoption in South County before the Board of
Supervisors this year.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, I'm trying to get them all done so we don't have to
dribble them in," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan said Laguna Beach should be commended for adopting the
easements.</TE>
<TE>   "The city really deserves a certain amount of praise from the
public for stepping up to the plate and picking up the public-access
easements," she said. "Part of what makes California great is the
coastline, and it's everybody's coastline, whether you're lucky
enough to live on the ocean or you live in Santa Ana."</TE>

<HD>3rd Body Pulled From Bottom of Reservoir</HD>
<DH>Search: Organized crime investigators study possible link
to another victim found last fall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>An organized crime investigation continued to yield grisly
discoveries Monday as authorities recovered a third slaying victim
from the frigid depths of a Sierra foothills reservoir.</LD>
<LD>   The three bodies were pulled from the water below a pair of
bridges that cross broad fingers of New Melones Reservoir east of
Sonora.</LD>
<LD>   Nick Rossi, a spokesman for the FBI's Sacramento field office,
said Monday that one victim appeared to be a man and seemed to have
been weighted down, but could offer no other details on the
identities, causes of death or potential motives for the slayings.</LD>
<TE>   Autopsies are scheduled today by the Tuolumne County coroner's
office.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, two of the bodies were pulled from 300 feet beneath the
lake's surface at the midpoint of the sprawling California 49 bridge.
The third was removed shortly before 5 p.m. Monday from below Parrots
Ferry Bridge, about three miles to the northeast.</TE>
<TE>   "All we know is we've recovered another human body," Rossi said.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities are trying to determine if there is a link between the
three victims and a man whose body was discovered in October in the
water near the Parrots Ferry Bridge. His wrists were lashed and a
plastic bag covered his head.</TE>
<TE>   The search started a week ago, based on a tip from another FBI
office conducting an organized crime investigation. Divers focused
initially on Lake Don Pedro, a Tuolumne County reservoir about 40
miles east of Modesto.</TE>
<TE>   When nothing turned up, the hunt switched over the weekend to
nearby New Melones Reservoir. Sonar scans of the lake bottom revealed
silhouettes that appeared to be human bodies in deep water out of the
reach of divers, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A small, remote-controlled submersible shipped in from the FBI's
New York field office managed to locate the bodies, then raise them
to about 30 feet from the surface. Divers put them into body bags and
loaded the corpses onto a boat.</TE>
<TE>   Divers from the FBI and the Tuolumne and Calaveras county
sheriff's offices struggled with low visibility and 40-degree water
that limited how long they could conduct their search.</TE>

<LD>Continuing her scrutiny of the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, city Controller Laura Chick on Monday sent another terse
missive to agency officials, this time urging them to pay their
vendors on time.</LD>
<LD>   "As I've asked before, why did the DWP advance $100,000 out of
trust funds to the Project Restore black tie gala, which doesn't take
place until April 27th, yet has not paid $6,002.11 to a small
business owner for a BBQ luncheon on October third of last year?"
Chick asked in a letter sent to DWP General Manager David H. Wiggs.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter back to Chick, Wiggs said he and his staff would
address her concerns.</LD>

<LD>A Van Nuys man convicted of running an illegal sexual-encounter
business out of his home was sentenced to 36 months probation Monday
in Los Angeles Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Debre Katz Weintraub also ordered John Lynch to pay at least
$2,500 in fines and perform 35 days of community service. Lynch, 50,
was convicted Friday on five counts of operating a sexual-encounter
business in a residential zone.</LD>
<LD>   Lynch said he accepted cash from dozens of couples who had been
invited to his home on weekends to share spouses. A jury found him
guilty last week after undercover police officers testified about
attending five parties in 2000.</LD>

<HD>3 Jewish Community Centers May Close</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD FAUSSET</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Jewish Community Centers of Greater Los Angeles said Monday that
it will close its centers in Santa Monica, Silver Lake and Granada
Hills because of inadequate funding from its main financial backer.</LD>
<LD>   However, the organization's leaders said they might consider
keeping the centers open if the Jewish Federation of Los Angeles
gives them an additional $500,000 for their operating budget and
commits more money over the long term.</LD>
<LD>   The Jewish Community Centers' board of directors voted unanimously
Friday to close three of its seven centers when the school year ends
in June. The board also has threatened to sever its ties with the
federation, its primary source of charitable funding.</LD>
<TE>   The federation, which supports the centers and 15 other Jewish
agencies, has been frustrated with the JCC since October, when the
group announced it faced a $2.8-million deficit in its $16-million
operating budget. The shortfall resulted from declining membership
and what leaders call an attempt to be "all things for everybody."</TE>
<TE>   The seven centers provide day-care services, as well as health,
fitness and education programs for adults. About 200 children are
enrolled in day care at the three centers facing closure.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the president of the federation, John Fishel, said it
already has loaned the JCC the money it needs to close its deficit.
The federation also will provide the additional $500,000, he said,
but only if the JCC opens its financial records to ensure the money
goes directly to programs, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We just want to understand where they're going to use the
charitable dollars we generate," Fishel said.</TE>
<TE>   But JCC board Vice President Randy Myer said his organization has
given the federation the information it needs.</TE>
<TE>   The JCC recently hired an outside accounting firm to keep the
centers' books, and laid off 30 full-time and dozens of part-time
workers. In other cost-saving moves, the network plans to end the
health and senior programs at its West Valley center in May and move
its offices from the Mid-Wilshire area to Sherman Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Fishel said the JCC has made some progress in fixing its finances,
but they remained troubled.</TE>
<TE>   "Their leaders refuse to acknowledge that this 'pillar institution
to the continuity of Jewish life' has cracks that grout, hope and a
little paint can no longer repair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Both groups have amplified their rhetoric over the last few days,
each hinting that a divorce may be imminent.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the federation on Friday, JCC President Marty
Jannol and Executive Vice President Nina Lieberman Giladi called the
federation's recent funding decisions "a local tragedy and a scandal
of national import."</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Giladi said her agency would break from the federation
unless the umbrella organization comes up with a long-term support
plan for the centers.</TE>
<TE>   The federation responded by saying it will offer direct funding to
individual centers if the network does decide to divorce itself from
the federation.</TE>
<TE>   The West Valley JCC's board already has voted to secede from the
JCC of Greater Los Angeles and pursue funding directly with the
federation.</TE>
<TE>   West Valley JCC board President Tsilah Burman said the parent JCC
should have complied with the federation's requests for more
financial information.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just in a reactive mode and they're hurting the
community," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Jewish leaders said they hoped all the centers
could stay open with fund-raising campaigns spearheaded by members.</TE>

<HD>Jewish Centers Threatened With Closure</HD>

rebuilding JCCs for the future of Jewish Los Angeles, and it was our
mistake to consistently convey that to our constituency," the letter
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other than the emergency loans, the JCC is upset because the
federation is only them giving $329,000 in cash to operate its
centers in 2002-03, said JCC spokesman David Novak.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Giladi said her agency would break from the federation

<TE>   Earlier this year, Jewish leaders said they hoped all the centers

<TE>   In Silver Lake, JCC members have started their own fund-raising
group, and collected $22,000 of the $60,000 the center needs to stay
open.</TE>
<TE>   Janie Schulman, president of the Silver Lake fund-raising group,
said its members are considering following West Valley's lead and
negotiating for direct funding from the federation.</TE>
<TE>   She had few kind words for either the JCC or the federation.</TE>
<TE>   "The two entities are playing a game of brinkmanship to bring this
to a resolution favorable to each side," she said. "Unfortunately,
they're using the members at the centers as pawns."</TE>

<LD>The overnight departure of a storm that cleared the air and
blanketed the mountains with snow left Southern California with one of
those brisk, sparkling, sun-washed days on Monday that chambers of
commerce love to boast about.</LD>
<LD>   Temperatures were on the cool side, hovering in the 60s throughout the
Los Angeles Basin, but gusty breezes cleared away the clouds, with
visibility of up to 120 miles.</LD>
<LD>   Residents of hillside communities were treated to spectacular views of
the offshore islands, ringed by white-capped waves. Those who live along
the coast saw a panorama of snow-clad peaks that ranged 150 miles from
Mt. Pinos in Ventura County to Mt. San Jacinto in Riverside County.</LD>
<TE>   Some of the heaviest snow fell Sunday night near Gorman in the
Tehachapi Mountains north of Los Angeles, enough to force the closure of
Interstate 5, the state's principal north-south highway, at 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Stranded motorists scrambled for motel rooms or waited the chilly
night out in their cars.</TE>
<TE>   By 2 a.m. Monday, the Castaic Inn and Motel had run out of rooms.
Dalia Corona, one of the motel's employees, said there were as many
people sleeping in vehicles scattered about the parking lot as there were
in the rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Roseann Duke, manager of a McDonald's restaurant in Castaic, arrived
at work at 4 a.m. to find streams of vehicles snarled in the effort to
find alternate routes through the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nuts," she said. "It was so crowded you couldn't park here."</TE>
<TE>    Plows finally cleared the snow from I-5, and the California Highway
Patrol reopened the route about 8 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   Corona said everyone tried to leave at once.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to check people out, answer their questions, give them coffee
or orange juice and answer the phones," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To the north, blizzard conditions forced the closure of Interstate 80
in the High Sierra for several hours, and snow levels dropped as low as
900 feet in the hills above Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Hail the size of grapes fell in Solano County. Funnel clouds were
reported near Vacaville and Antioch.</TE>
<TE>   As has been so often the case this winter, the rainfall in Southern
California was generally light. Totals from the storm included 0.51 of an
inch in Altadena, 0.48 in Malibu, 0.31 in San Diego, 0.24 in Riverside,
0.22 at John Wayne Airport in Orange County and 0.21 at Santa Monica
Airport.</TE>
<TE>   The National Weather Service said 0.11 fell on downtown Los Angeles,
raising the total for the season, which runs from July 1 through June 30,
to 4.21 inches. That's less than one-third the normal total for the date
of 12.88 inches.</TE>
<TE>   Forecasters said skies should remain mostly clear, with gradually
warming temperatures, through Thursday. They added that there's a chance
of more showers by late Friday or early Saturday, "but it will certainly
be nothing to write home about."</TE>

<HD>Condemned Inmate's Counsel Called Deficient</HD>
<DH>Courts: Appeals panel orders new sentencing hearing for
defendant on death row for 20 years, saying his attorneys failed to
investigate his childhood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Sacramento man who has been on death row for 20 years for murder
and rape is entitled to a new sentencing hearing because he received
constitutionally deficient legal representation, a federal appeals
court in San Francisco ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The decision was the fifth this year in which the U.S. 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals, which covers nine western states, has ordered a new
sentencing hearing for a death row inmate in California.</LD>
<LD>   The court ruled 2 to 1 that trial attorneys for James L. Karis,
50, had failed to adequately investigate his childhood, including
beatings and molestations.</LD>
<TE>   If the attorneys had thoroughly investigated Karis' background and
presented adequate evidence, a jury might have given Karis a life
sentence rather than the death penalty, the panel ruled.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Karis kidnapped two El Dorado County welfare department
employees at gunpoint on a Placerville Street while they were on
their lunch break.</TE>
<TE>   He drove them to a remote area, ordered the women to disrobe,
bound one of them and raped the other.</TE>
<TE>   Karis ordered the women into a hole and after one of them pleaded
for their lives, he shot them with a handgun and covered them with
stones, according to trial testimony.</TE>
<TE>   One of the women feigned death and after Karis left she crawled
out of the hole, made her way to a nearby road and was rescued. Karis
was arrested a week later in Sonoma County.</TE>
<TE>   The case was transferred to Sacramento from El Dorado County
because of extensive publicity about the gruesome crime. The
surviving victim testified against Karis at the 1982 trial.</TE>
<TE>   The conviction and death sentence had previously been upheld by
the California Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court had declined
review.</TE>
<TE>   After those actions, the defense filed claims in federal district
court in Sacramento. Monday's decision comes more than three years
after a federal judge in Sacramento first vacated Karis' death
sentence on the recommendation of a magistrate.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling, written by Judge Procter Hug Jr., said that the
magistrate was correct in determining that a defense lawyer who had
"performed a proper investigation could have offered substantial and
wrenching evidence of [Karis'] violent and abusive childhood."</TE>
<TE>   The defense lawyers could have obtained information that Karis saw
his father and stepfather "viciously beat his mother; that both men
also beat and abused him; and that [his father] molested him," the
federal magistrate judge, John F. Moulds, wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Hug, joined by Judge James R. Browning, also agreed with Moulds'
reference to a 1990 U.S. Supreme Court decision on the potential
impact of such mitigating evidence:</TE>
<TE>   "Evidence about the defendant's background and character is
relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that
defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a
disadvantaged background, or to emotional and mental problems, may be
less culpable than defendants who have no such excuse."</TE>
<TE>   The panel concluded that Karis' trial attorney had performed
deficiently and that the failures had prejudiced Karis' case, under
standards delineated by the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Karis' appellate lawyer Norman J. Hile utilized testimony from a
psychiatrist, a medical doctor and a criminal defense lawyer in the
hearing before the magistrate.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit also sustained the ruling of the federal district
judge in Sacramento upholding the guilty verdict against Karis.</TE>
<TE>   Karis has spent much of his adult life in prison. At the time of
his arrest, Karis had been free on parole six months from the 1976
rape of a 17-year-old high school student in Santa Clara County.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, he had been imprisoned from 1971 to 1975 for a rape in
Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In a dissent, 9th Circuit Judge Andrew J. Kleinfeld referred to
Karis' lengthy record and linked it to his conclusion that the
majority had improperly applied Supreme Court precedents on
ineffective counsel.</TE>
<TE>   "Counsel thoroughly investigated and prepared," Kleinfeld wrote,
referring to Karis' trial lawyers. "The problem was that the
investigation turned up little evidence. The shortage of evidence was
because Karis was a very bad man."</TE>
<TE>   He said Karis' attorney had not shown that there was a "reasonable
probability" that the outcome of the sentencing would have been
different but for the trial lawyer's errors.</TE>
<TE>   "Though a jury in this case, as in any case, could have gone the
other way, it was not counsel's fault that it did not," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for California Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer, said the office was reviewing the ruling and had made no
immediate decision on whether to seek a rehearing before a larger
panel of 9th Circuit judges.</TE>

<HD>Ernest E. Debs, 98; County Supervisor for 16 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH REICH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernest E. Debs, a stubborn, resilient man whose 32-year political
career was marked by tempests over allegiance to special interests
but also by major contributions to culture, recreation and social
services in Los Angeles County, has died at 98.</LD>
<LD>   Debs served for 16 years on the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors--from 1958 through 1974--at a time when every supervisor
was all-powerful in his own district and the board was known as "the
five little kings of the county."</LD>
<LD>   "I've outlived all my friends and most of my enemies," Debs told
his family before dying of natural causes Sunday at his retirement
home in Indian Wells.</LD>
<TE>   Debs' tenure in politics also included stints in the state
Assembly and on the Los Angeles City Council.</TE>
<TE>   At the time he retired from the Board of Supervisors, Debs' 3rd
Supervisorial District swept in a great arc from Westwood and
portions of the San Fernando Valley and central Los Angeles to such
Eastside communities as Monterey Park and Montebello. The district
had a population of 1.4 million people, more populous than 16 states
at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Among Debs' proudest achievements was his co-authorship of bills
that created Cal State Los Angeles and UCLA Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   He also was a vigorous champion of public parks. Along with the
late Supervisor Kenneth Hahn and City Councilwoman Roz Wyman, he gave
pivotal support to the effort to bring the Dodgers to Los Angeles in
1958.</TE>
<TE>   But it was his exercise of raw political power over such matters
as zoning, building permits and the like that many of his colleagues
remembered Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was tenacious," said Wyman, his former colleague on the City
Council. "He never missed a trick in the sense of how to maneuver
something through. He was a politician's politician."</TE>
<TE>   Said Ed Edelman, who succeeded Debs as supervisor after initiating
a campaign on the theme that Debs was a creature of special business
interests: "Ernie was one of the most colorful politicians we've seen
in Los Angeles.... He wasn't going to change.... He was an old-style,
old-time politician who delivered."</TE>
<TE>   Debs was born in Toledo, Ohio, on Feb. 7, 1904, and came to
California in a box car when he was 20 to work in the movies as a
dance man. He appeared in silent movies and talkies. He had no
college education, and prided himself on being a self-made man.</TE>
<TE>   He gave up show business to work among the politicians as a
sergeant at arms in the state Assembly before embarking on a
political career of his own.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, he won his election as a conservative Democrat to the
state Assembly from Silver Lake. In 1947, he was elected to the Los
Angeles City Council from a largely Eastside district, serving for 11
years.</TE>
<TE>   A decade later, he ran for the Board of Supervisors, beating
Edward R. Roybal, a seminal figure in Latino politics, after four
recounts in a bitterly contested election. He succeeded John Anson
Ford.</TE>
<TE>   The Debs style was on display in 1966 when Jack Kent Cooke applied
for a long-term lease for the Lakers to play at the Sports Arena and
also asked for a lease to play hockey there. Debs, as a supervisor,
sat on the Coliseum Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Both applications were summarily rejected. When Cooke remonstrated
personally with Debs, the supervisor replied bluntly, "Take it or
leave it."</TE>
<TE>   "My reply," Cooke recalled later, "was, 'I may decide to build my
own arena.'"</TE>
<TE>   "To this, Debs said, 'Har, har, har.' He wasn't laughing. He just
said, 'Har, har, har.'"</TE>
<TE>   On this occasion, the petitioner ended up prevailing. Cooke went
on to build the Forum in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Debs was an indefatigable attender of public events, often showing
up at as many as five gatherings a night.</TE>
<TE>   "He showed up everywhere and we rode in every parade for every
ethnicity," said his daughter, Candi Debs. "He was very proud of the
range of cultures in his district."</TE>
<TE>   The current supervisor from Debs' district, Zev Yaroslavsky,
recalled Monday, "When I was growing up in Boyle Heights, as well as
later in the Fairfax area, he was my supervisor. There were two
political names I was aware of: Jimmy Roosevelt and Ernie Debs.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember a tree-planting ceremony for the Jewish National Fund
in Griffith Park. I was 8 years old. I didn't understand what all the
fuss was when [Debs] arrived, but he certainly seemed important."</TE>
<TE>   Redistricting moved Debs farther and farther west, to areas away
from the power base of his former opponent, Roybal, and he displayed
great allegiance to his newer Jewish constituents, as well as the
silk-stocking area of Hancock Park.</TE>
<TE>   "He attended almost every Jewish event in town when he was well,"
said Rabbi Isaiah Zeldin. "He went to Israel to plant trees and when
we broke ground for the Stephen Wise Temple in Bel Air in 1964, he
was instrumental in getting all the permitting through for us."</TE>
<TE>   Debs easily won reelection to the board in the primaries of 1962,
1966 and 1970 by supporting cultural projects such as the Music
Center, bilingual education, scholarships and improved parks and
schools.</TE>
<TE>   He created what later was named the 282-acre Ernest E. Debs
Regional Park in Montecito Heights.</TE>
<TE>   "I represent the richest of the rich, the poorest of the poor, and
every nationality known to man in sizable numbers," he said proudly.</TE>
<TE>   Debs prided himself on his championship of opportunities for the
elderly, helping to create many senior citizen centers.</TE>
<TE>   "What inflation has done to our elderly is horrible," he said. "I
wonder how they keep body and soul together on the meager allowances
we allow them.... A nation as rich as ours should be ashamed with the
way we treat our elderly."</TE>
<TE>   As time went on, however, criticism grew of what some saw as Debs'
high-handedness.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the major controversies marking his last years in
office, the late mayor of Beverly Hills, Jake Stuchen, publicly
questioned how much Debs would want to be paid to stop the building
of a high-rise tower on the West Hollywood-Beverly Hills city line
that would cast a shadow on some Beverly Hills homes.</TE>
<TE>   Debs was furious, insisting that payments had nothing to do with
his support of the proposed high-rise.</TE>
<TE>   Television newscaster Baxter Ward, when he was elected as a
supervisor in 1972, began ragging Debs unmercifully on a variety of
issues, including Debs' endorsement of the probation application of
former singer Phil Regan, who had been convicted of bribery.</TE>
<TE>   Ward demanded that Debs resign from his oversight chairmanships of
three county departments--probation, grand jury and district
attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Ward also questioned Debs' support of moving the West Hollywood
sheriff's station in a way that might have benefited Southern Pacific
Railroad. Debs finally withdrew the proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 30 years of public life, I have never served with a man
like this," Debs complained in 1973. "For the last six years, I would
not allow him to tape me because of his distortions and taking
statements out of context."</TE>
<TE>   Debs assiduously defended himself, even when criticized. A call
from a critical reporter was put through in five minutes--to
Yellowknife in the Canadian Northwest Territory, where Debs had gone
on a trip sponsored by water and power interests.</TE>
<TE>   But time was catching up with Debs. After a poll showed Edelman
mounting a powerful challenge for reelection, Debs abruptly pulled
out of the 1974 race. He withdrew, he said, not because he couldn't
win, but because his doctors demanded it for the sake of his health.</TE>
<TE>   He was 70 at the time. "I want to live," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Angry at Edelman for painting him as a tool of special interests,
Debs, a longtime member of the Sons of Italy, endorsed Los Angeles
Councilman John Ferraro, but Ferraro lost the election.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy still dogged Debs after it was divulged that he had
successfully sought workers' compensation for his heart condition and
might be planning to use $100,000 in campaign contributions for
personal expenses without paying taxes on it.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare public statement, an Internal Revenue Service auditor
wanted to know whether Debs would be using any of the money for
personal purposes. Debs maintained that the donations "were a gift to
me, personally" and it was none of the tax authorities' business.</TE>
<TE>   Debs lived another 28 years, mainly in the Coachella Valley, and
maintained a lively interest in government.</TE>
<TE>   In June, at age 97, he appeared downtown to speak at a ceremony to
reopen the retrofitted City Hall. He kept in touch even with
political adversaries.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to call me," Edelman said. "He needed to feel he was part
of things."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his daughter, Debs is survived by his wife of 34
years, Betty, and a son, David.</TE>
<TE>   A public memorial is pending, his family said.</TE>
<TE>   They suggested that charitable contributions in Debs' memory be
made to St. Jude's Hospital, Shriners Hospital or the Ernest E. Debs
Regional Park/National Audubon Society Urban Preserve.</TE>

<HD>Fire Displaces About 80 Students at Concordia</HD>
<DH>University: No one is seriously injured in blaze that
destroys dormitory apartment at school in Irvine. Damage is estimated
at $70,000.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>An unattended candle apparently started a fire that destroyed a
dormitory apartment Monday at Concordia University in Irvine, forcing
about 80 students to flee their living quarters.</LD>
<LD>   One student was treated at a hospital for smoke inhalation,
authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   "We are thankful no one was [seriously] injured," said Mary Scott,
spokeswoman for the Christian liberal arts college, which has
enrollment of about 1,200.</LD>
<TE>   The fire started about 1 p.m. in a bedroom at Kappa Hall, a
residence with two-bedroom units housing four students each, Scott
said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was contained within 20 minutes but caused about $50,000
in structural damage and $20,000 in damage to the contents of the
unit, fire investigators said.</TE>
<TE>   Veronica Covington, 19, who lives three doors from the burned
unit, was in the dorm when the fire started. "An alarm went off, and
people were yelling to get out," she said. "I grabbed my purse and a
pair of flip-flops and ran. It was scary at first. I didn't know what
was going on."</TE>
<TE>   University officials said they expected most of the displaced
students to return to their rooms by the end of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The four whose unit was destroyed were to move into another dorm
on campus.</TE>

<HD>4th Suspect Is Sought in Shooting</HD>
<DH>Gangs: Three are held in Pacoima drive-by that injured
three bystanders. Girl, 2, is in guarded condition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREA PERERA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police still seek one suspect in a weekend drive-by
shooting in Pacoima that injured three bystanders, including a
2-year-old girl.</LD>
<LD>   At a midday news conference at the Foothill station, Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks commended the division's officers for their work
with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in arresting
three suspects and removing an arsenal of 16 illegal and stolen
firearms from a Pacoima home.</LD>
<LD>   A fourth suspect, who police identified as Rafael Macias, 19,
remained at large.</LD>
<TE>   ''There is a positive ending in that we have suspects in
custody,'' Parks said. ''This is also an indication of how much
firepower we have out in our community.''</TE>
<TE>   Foothill police officers on patrol about 4:30 p.m. Sunday reported
seeing two males in a car fire shots at several males standing in
front of a house in the 11100 block of Glenoaks Boulevard in Pacoima.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers in two other vehicles, who investigators said were not
connected to the shooters, were hit by return gunfire. A woman in one
car suffered a graze to the ear. In the other car, a woman was grazed
in the neck and her 2-year-old daughter suffered head wounds, police
said.</TE>
<TE>   The child is in guarded condition at an area hospital after
undergoing reconstructive surgery, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The two women were treated and released at Providence Holy Cross
Medical Center in Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Police arrested the driver of the car, Juan Lara, 20, after a
short pursuit.</TE>
<TE>   Ernesto Robles, 21, and Ernesto Calvillo, 22, were arrested at the
Glenoaks Boulevard home.</TE>
<TE>   All three are Pacoima residents who police said had prior arrests
and alleged gang affiliations. They were booked on charges of
attempted murder.</TE>
<TE>   Police said Macias was a passenger in the car.</TE>
<TE>   After the arrests, police searched the home, where they found 16
firearms, including four assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Chief Ronald Bergmann said police will test the firearms to
see if they were used in any other gang-related crimes in the San
Fernando Valley.</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Seeks to Overturn El Toro Vote</HD>
<DH>Courts: Backers of an airport at the former Marine base sue
Orange County. Supporters of the pro-park Measure W call the action a
desperate move.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a final bid to preserve eight years of planning, backers of a
commercial airport at El Toro filed suit Monday to overturn a
voter-approved measure that rezones the former military base for a
park.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit asks the court to invalidate Measure W, the Orange
County Central Park and Nature Preserve Initiative, which passed
March 5 with 57.8% of the vote. It claims that the measure usurps the
role of the Board of Supervisors as the sole entity responsible for
planning the conversion of the base under federal and state law.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed in Orange County Superior Court against the
county by the Airport Working Group, Citizens for Jobs and the
Economy, the city of Garden Grove and the Orange County Regional
Airport Authority, a coalition of 15 north county cities. Citizens
for Jobs and the Economy was formed in 1994 to promote the new
airport; the Airport Working Group wants an El Toro airport to ease
expansion pressure at John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit also asks that the matter be heard by a court outside
Orange County. Several suits involving government action on El Toro
have been heard in Los Angeles and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   Airport foes said they expected the legal challenge, which was
threatened within hours of this month's election, and said it was a
desperate move. "This is all part of their unwillingness to accept
the will of the people," said Len Kranser, spokesman for Citizens for
Safe and Healthy Communities, which promoted Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   North County Cities Still Want an Airport at Site</TE>
<TE>   Cypress Mayor Lydia Sondhi said the north county cities group
views the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station as a regional asset
that must be protected. Every city north of Irvine--with the
exception of Tustin--voted against Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation of the lawsuit is that El Toro's fate is beyond the
reach of local voters, said attorney Fredric D. Woocher, who drafted
the suit. A published opinion last year by a state appellate court in
San Diego, which invalidated another anti-airport measure passed in
2000, confirmed supervisors' authority, he said. In that opinion, the
justices wrote: "There is a strong legislative indication that the
board has been delegated exclusive authority for all actions
regarding planning for reuse of MCAS El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   "I think based on this, it's DOA," Woocher said of Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that Measure W was deceptive. For example,
the measure states that the base may be given to the county free for
a park. But the day after Measure W's passage, the Navy announced
that, without an airport at El Toro, it intended to dispose of the
base through public sale.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's filing came the day before supervisors hold their first
public discussion on El Toro since the election. Supervisors will
decide today whether to restructure the county's 30-worker El Toro
planning office and begin preparing a non-aviation plan for the base.
The Navy has set a deadline of April 23 to decide how to dispose of
the base, a decision which likely will include selling all or part of
it.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors Said They'd Follow Will of People</TE>
<TE>   A majority of supervisors said before the election that they would
follow the will of voters and pledged not to challenge passage of
Measure W in court. However, the county is now named as the defendant
in the suit filed Monday--the same position it held with the 2000
anti-airport initiative, Measure F.</TE>
<TE>   The county's defense of that suit was tepid at best, Kranser said,
and forced anti-airport forces to join the lawsuit to present a
vigorous defense.</TE>
<TE>   Among the arguments in favor of Measure W will be the 1994 voter
passage of Measure A, Kranser said, which rezoned the base for an
airport and airport-compatible uses. Measure A was upheld after a
legal challenge by a coalition of cities led by Irvine and Lake
Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Measure A was found to be legal, then it would seem
reasonable that Measure W, which overturns Measure A, is legal by the
same theories," Kranser said.</TE>
<TE>   The south county cities argued that Measure A was "preempted by
and inconsistent with" the State Aeronautics Act, but an appellate
panel ruled otherwise. "In this case," the justices said in 1997, "we
find nothing in the State Aeronautics Act [that] prevents voters from
adopting a general plan amendment which may impact an area subject to
the Airport Land Use Plan."</TE>

<HD>Lawsuit Targets El Toro Use Vote</HD>
<DH>Courts: Backers of an airport at the former Marine base sue
Orange County. Supporters of the Great Park measure call the legal
action a move of desperation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a final bid to preserve eight years of planning, backers of a
commercial airport at El Toro filed suit Monday to overturn a
voter-approved measure that rezones the former military base for a
park.</LD>
<LD>   The lawsuit asks the court to invalidate Measure W, the Orange
County Central Park and Nature Preserve Initiative, which passed
March 5 with 57.8% of the vote. It claims that the measure usurps the
role of the Board of Supervisors as the sole entity responsible for
planning the conversion of the base under federal and state law.</LD>
<LD>   The suit was filed in Orange County Superior Court against the
county by the Airport Working Group, Citizens for Jobs and the
Economy, Garden Grove and the Orange County Regional Airport
Authority, a coalition of 15 North County cities. Citizens for Jobs
and the Economy was formed in 1994 to promote the new airport; the
Airport Working Group wants an El Toro airport to ease pressure to
expand John Wayne Airport.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit also asks that the matter be heard by a court outside
Orange County. Several suits involving government action on El Toro
have been heard in Los Angeles and San Diego counties.</TE>
<TE>   Airport foes said they expected the legal challenge, which was
threatened within hours of this month's election and said it was a
desperate move. "This is all part of their unwillingness to accept
the will of the people," said Len Kranser, spokesman for Citizens for
Safe and Healthy Communities, which promoted Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   Cypress Mayor Lydia Sondhi said the North County cities group
views the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air Station as a regional asset
that must be protected. Every city north of Irvine--with the
exception of Tustin--voted against Measure W, dubbed the Great Park
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs Question Voters' Jurisdiction</TE>
<TE>   The foundation of the lawsuit is that El Toro's fate is beyond the
reach of local voters, said attorney Fredric D. Woocher, who drafted
the suit. A published opinion last year by a state appellate court in
San Diego, which invalidated another anti-airport measure passed in
2000, confirmed supervisors' authority, he said. In that opinion, the
justices wrote: "There is a strong legislative indication that the
board has been delegated exclusive authority for all actions
regarding planning for reuse of MCAS El Toro."</TE>
<TE>   "I think based on this, it's DOA," Woocher said of Measure W.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also alleges that Measure W was deceptive. For example,
the measure states that the base may be given to the county free for
a park. But the day after Measure W's passage, the Navy announced
that, without an airport at El Toro, it intended to dispose of the
base through public sale.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's filing came the day before supervisors hold their first
public discussion on El Toro since the election. Supervisors will
decide today whether to restructure the county's 30-worker El Toro
planning office and begin preparing a non-aviation plan for the base.
The Navy has set a deadline of April 23 to decide how to dispose of
the base, a decision which likely will include selling all or part of
it.</TE>
<TE>   A majority of supervisors said before the election that they would
follow the will of voters and pledged not to challenge passage of
Measure W in court. However, the county is now named as the defendant
in the suit filed Monday--the same position it held with the 2000
anti-airport initiative, Measure F.</TE>
<TE>   The county's defense of that suit was tepid at best, Kranser said,
and forced anti-airport forces to join the lawsuit to present a
vigorous defense.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A Ruling May Be Precedent</TE>
<TE>   Among the arguments in favor of Measure W will be the 1994 voter
passage of Measure A, Kranser said, which rezoned the base for an
airport and airport-compatible uses.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A was upheld after a legal challenge by a coalition of
cities led by Irvine and Lake Forest.</TE>
<TE>   "Since Measure A was found to be legal, then it would seem
reasonable that Measure W, which overturns Measure A, is legal by the
same theories," Kranser said.</TE>
<TE>   The South County cities argued that Measure A was "preempted by
and inconsistent with" the State Aeronautics Act, but an appellate
panel ruled otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   "In this case," the justices said in 1997, "we find nothing in the
State Aeronautics Act [that] prevents voters from adopting a general
plan amendment which may impact an area subject to the Airport Land
Use Plan."</TE>

<LD>Organizers of a neighborhood council in Northridge protested Monday
that city officials are blocking their proposal to have votes on
issues cast in town hall meetings by "stakeholders" rather than an
elected panel.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Neighborhood Empowerment Commission will meet
tonight in Northridge with an agenda that includes approval of the
Northridge Community Council. But organizers expect approval to be
delayed because city officials say ordinances do not allow town hall
votes instead of votes of an elected governing board. The city is
creating a citywide network of neighborhood councils.</LD>
<LD>   "It's obviously a blatant attempt to keep people from voting,"
said Walter Prince, president of the Northridge group. He said the
city wants a few select individuals to make decisions for the
community.</LD>
<TE>   Greg Nelson, general manager of the Department of Neighborhood
Empowerment, said he sympathizes with the residents but his hands are
tied.</TE>
<TE>   "They want to have a town hall concept, which runs afoul of the
city ordinance," Nelson said. Neighborhood councils are being set up
to take advisory votes on local planning, development and budget
issues.</TE>
<TE>   City ordinances require that stakeholders--residents, business
owners and nonprofit groups--elect a neighborhood council that casts
advisory votes on local issues.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson said he is open to changing the ordinance to allow for town
hall votes, but he said there are potential problems, such as how to
assemble people on short notice for a vote.</TE>
<TE>   One model Nelson suggested would have votes taken at town hall
meetings subject to overturn by a two-thirds vote of the governing
board.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting will be held at 6:30 tonight at Northridge Middle
School, 17960 Chase St.</TE>

<HD>Public Transit Users to Get Prepaid 'Smart Card'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A single prepaid fare card will let riders use any county bus and
rail system by September 2003, transit officials said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County's Metropolitan Transportation Authority,
Metrolink and 17 municipal bus operations have agreed to honor a
"smart card" to increase ridership and convenience for public transit
users, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Customers will be able to use the same wallet-size card on buses
and commuter trains from Santa Monica to San Dimas.</LD>
<TE>   San Diego-based Cubic Corp., which designed similar programs for
Chicago and Washington, D.C., won the $84-million contract to design,
manufacture and install the new system.</TE>
<TE>   Starting this summer, the MTA will supply riders with regional
passes resembling ID cards, predecessors to the computer
chip-embedded cards that will be sold next year. Riders will keep the
same card, adding money to their accounts in machines at transit
stations and online, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "Seamless travel will be an added convenience and draw for the
customers MTA shares with other agencies," said Jane Matsumoto, MTA
project manager.</TE>
<TE>   Although Chicago ordered just 300,000 smart cards and Washington
only 250,000 after yearlong pilot programs, the MTA has purchased
750,000.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a pretty aggressive roll-out," said Anita Wolff, Cubic's
senior business development manager. "But the other cities have done
the trial runs for Los Angeles and eliminated experimentation."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, D.C., the card has been linked to non-transit uses
through deals between Cubic and private companies. Cubic officials
envision someday expanding smart cards to function as university ID
cards and debit cards.</TE>
<TE>   MTA is brainstorming ideas for the name and design of the card,
created to work without being removed from wallets or purses.</TE>
<TE>   After the system is implemented, each bus and train will have a
card-reader-equipped fare box. Customers will wave their cards near
the 3-foot-tall gray machines with wireless transmitters. Transit
agencies will continue to accept cash.</TE>
<TE>   Transit operators are overcoming the historical distrust between
regional and local agencies in implementing the system, said a
spokesman for Foothill Transit, the county's second-largest bus
system. "You look at the sprawling Los Angeles area and it only makes
sense to have a transit [fare] system that's going to work throughout
the whole thing," Tom Mullen said.</TE>

<HD>Man Gets 4 Years in Credit Card Scam</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Granada Hills man was sentenced to four years and three months in
federal prison Monday for running a credit card application scam that
defrauded hundreds of people with poor credit histories.</LD>
<LD>   Victor Leroy Taylor, 39, committed his crimes at the same time he
was being prosecuted in federal court for a virtually identical
scheme.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi ordered that Taylor's
sentence run consecutively after he completes a five-year prison term
handed down in the first case.</LD>
<TE>   Taylor pleaded guilty to the most recent charges in July on the
day he was to go on trial.</TE>
<TE>   His girlfriend, Lena Harrington, 35, of Palmdale, was also
convicted. She is to be sentenced next week.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant U.S. Atty. Christine Adams said the couple targeted
people with poor credit histories, promising them pre-approved credit
cards with attractive interest rates. Applicants were required to pay
advance fees ranging from $20 to $50.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of victims mailed in a total of about $188,000 to three
bogus companies set up by Taylor: Montgomery, Montgomery Financial
Service and Montgomery Field Services. But none of the applicants
received a credit card in return.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor, acting alone, launched the first scam in 1999 under the
names Colonial Financial Services, First American Financial Services
and Fallbrook Financial Services.</TE>
<TE>   He netted about $4.5 million from that scheme, spending about
$1.25 million to buy eight houses and a Mercedes-Benz.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said Taylor operated a similar advance-fee business in
1993 under the names First Nationwide Financial and American Pacific
Financial. He was not prosecuted in that case but signed a consent
decree in which he promised not to engage in any advance-fee schemes
through the mails.</TE>

<HD>Woman Dies After a Fire at Her Oak View Home</HD>
<DH>Fatality: The retiree is found unconscious in the Grapevine
Road residence. The blaze probably started in the fireplace,
officials say.</DH>

<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Oak View resident died Monday evening after being carried from her
burning home by firefighters.</LD>
<LD>   Mary Mortensen died at Ojai Valley Community Hospital minutes
after being taken from her small brick home on Grapevine Road, fire
officials and neighbors said. They described her as a retiree, but
did not know her age.</LD>
<LD>   "She lived there for probably 50 years and is a very nice, very
sweet lady," said Rick Mitchell, a neighbor and friend who used a
garden hose on the fire until emergency crews arrived.</LD>
<TE>   When the fire started about 5 p.m., it wasn't clear whether anyone
was home because dense smoke had filled the single-story house.
Neighbors called Mortensen's son's family in Ojai, who said she was
probably inside.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the blaze appears to be accidental, probably
involving the fireplace, which neighbors said Mortensen often used.
Nearly two dozen firefighters put out the fire in about 20 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Mortensen was unconscious and in full cardiac
arrest when firefighters found her in a bedroom. An autopsy will be
performed today. Neighbors in the area, a small cluster of custom
homes on large lots along a river bottom, said the victim's husband
died several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "She grew up around here and was a longtime resident," neighbor
Bryan Bihari said. "She knows everyone in the area."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mitchell: "I remember when we first moved in and she brought
us over some plants, and I sometimes took her over some food we had
cooked."</TE>
<TE>   No damage estimate was available, but fire officials said damage
was limited to the attic, roof, chimney area and one room.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was the second in a week to claim the life of a Ventura
County woman. A 39-year-old died March 12 in a blaze in Santa Paula.</TE>

<HD>DJ Lends Voice to Boost Insurance for the Poor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A coalition of private and public organizations has called on a
well-known Spanish-speaking disc jockey to break through the
resistance that often keeps Latino children from being enrolled in a
government-funded health insurance program for working-poor families.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic Healthcare West, a large hospital chain, and the Hispanic
Broadcast Corp. are giving the program Healthy Families a new voice:
Renan Almendarez Coello, also known as "El Cucuy de la Manana."
Almendarez Coello, whose nickname, "El Cucuy," alludes to a folk
character familiar to many Mexican children, has a morning radio show
on KSCA 101.9 that draws close to a million listeners.</LD>
<LD>   Catholic Healthcare West is investing $270,000 into the campaign,
and the Hispanic Broadcast Corp. will provide air time at a reduced
cost.</LD>
<TE>   Almendarez Coello has taken the challenge of selling the state and
federally funded insurance program, which provides health, dental and
vision coverage, to working-class families whose income is too high
to qualify for insurance programs for the poor but too low to afford
private coverage.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a trusted voice," said Patricia Suarez, a marketing
representative who initiated the outreach campaign. "Renan just makes
the phone ring."</TE>
<TE>   Cultural hurdles have made it difficult for authorities to reach
Latino families. Many are immigrants who, experts say, are suspicious
of government programs. Some believe that seeking public aid for
their children might affect their chances of becoming legal
residents, or they reject assistance to prevent being perceived as a
"burden on the system."</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 1.5 million uninsured children in California.
Nearly half a million of them are eligible for Healthy Families, and
68% are Latinos, according to the UCLA Center for Health Policy
Research. The program now enrolls 506,635. Subscribers pay a monthly
premium of $4 to $9 per child, up to a maximum of $27 for one family.</TE>
<TE>   "It's affordable," said Dr. Luis N. Pacheco, medical director at
the California Hospital Medical Center who appears on
Spanish-language television. "It should cover all of the medical
needs of these families who don't qualify for other insurance
programs. Unfortunately, it's not happening."</TE>
<TE>   Almendarez Coello has recorded an ad that will air regularly for
the next year in his national morning program at KSCA-FM. His voice
is so influential that he is reputed to have persuaded drug addicts
to quit their vices. He sponsors health-care fund-raisers benefiting
Latinos and is so busy that he seldom knows what he has scheduled
each day.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, state and federal lawmakers recognized him for his
support of Healthy Families.</TE>
<TE>   He said he hadn't known about the recognition or about the news
conference at which he was scheduled to speak. But it didn't matter.
He commanded people's attention as soon as he came into the room,
making funny faces and waving his right leg as if he were dancing.
Doctors and politicians laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "My manager brings me there, gives me three words and I start
talking," he said. "It comes from the heart. In the end people cry or
applaud and I don't know what happened."</TE>

<HD>Rundown Anaheim Community Gets $54 Million in Upgrades</HD>
<DH>Urban renewal: Jeffrey- Lynne neighborhood now has a
waiting list for affordable housing --and a new name</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The former Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood, once one of Anaheim's most
crime-ridden, rundown communities, is flaunting its $54-million
make-over these days, complete with a new name.</LD>
<LD>   Decrepit, overcrowded apartments have given way to gated streets
with new buildings, play lots and a child-care center. Residents of
the old Jeffrey-Lynne were given first choice at moving into the new
Hermosa Village, with no increase in their rents for two years.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems like we won first prize," Margarita Martinez Mendez said
of her new home.</LD>
<TE>   Like the Mendezes, many families already have made the move back.
Today city officials will unveil their redevelopment project with
public tours and speeches.</TE>
<TE>   The city took an eight-block stretch of apartments, invested time
and money, and transformed a community of about 5,000 residents.</TE>
<TE>   "The results speak for themselves," said Mayor Tom Daly, who made
revitalizing Jeffrey-Lynne one of his main goals. "The residents are
thrilled. The neighborhood has been stabilized. It's much more
attractive. This is an example of what we should be doing in other
high-density apartment neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, the name Jeffrey-Lynne had became synonymous with
drugs and gangs. Shootings erupted on the streets; crime skyrocketed.
With mixed results, city officials threw code enforcement at the
problem and more cops. They tried extra foot patrols, cleaned out
garages and banned street parking.</TE>
<TE>   But that wasn't enough.</TE>
<TE>   Then, about three years ago, the city embarked on its most
ambitious redevelopment project.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of deals that Daly likened to a "complicated military
maneuver," the city negotiated with dozens of property owners to buy
or lease their property.</TE>
<TE>   They found two developers, one that oversaw reconstruction and the
other to handle property management.</TE>
<TE>   Of the $54 million, the city contributed $14.5 million with
housing authority money, city funds and a loan from the California
Housing Finance Agency. The developers secured the rest through
conventional loans and state and federal tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   The result is visible everywhere in the palm-tree lined
development that has a new image and new name. Once, people couldn't
wait to get out of Jeffrey-Lynne. Now, they're clamoring to get in to
Hermosa Village. The waiting list for the low-income, affordable
apartments is two years and growing.</TE>
<TE>   This is a tight-knit community of people who have weathered
deplorable living conditions only to be rewarded years later.</TE>
<TE>   Graffiti has been replaced with fresh paint. The dense one-bedroom
units have been gutted and rebuilt with two-, three- and four-bedroom
apartments better suited for families with children. There are about
300 more bedrooms now.</TE>
<TE>   The community center has a swimming pool, child care, a Boys and
Girls Club, a computer lab and English classes. There is also an
on-site health program, career counseling and a food-distribution
program.</TE>
<TE>   During construction, residents were temporarily relocated,
although the city negotiated with the school district to allow
children to attend the same schools.</TE>
<TE>   Although many people moved from cramped and dilapidated
one-bedroom units into larger apartments with more bedrooms, new
plumbing and appliances, their rent will remain stable for two years,
averaging $450 to $500 a month.</TE>
<TE>   Mendez, 64, lived in her same one-bedroom apartment at
Jeffrey-Lynne for 26 years, at times with six other people.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy now," Mendez said. "Much thanks. I sleep so
much better at night. In the evenings, the streets are really quiet."</TE>

<TE>   Mendez, 64, lived in her same one-bedroom apartment at
Jeffrey-Lynne for 26 years, at times with six other people.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1980s, she miscarried twins when she fell down the
stairs, running to escape a shooting on a nearby street.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very happy now," Mendez said. "Much thanks. I sleep so
much better at night. In the evenings, the streets are really quiet."</TE>
<TE>   Her son and his family live in an apartment a few yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Residents were allowed to return in phases. Maria Ramirez, 25, and
her family moved back a couple months ago. While she was gone, she
returned each month to check on progress and watch in amazement as
tot lots were added, flowers bloomed and the swimming pool took
shape.</TE>
<TE>   "Every month, I would ask, 'Are they ready? Are they ready? Where
is my apartment? Which one?'" Ramirez said. "I like the one that I
got. It's very pretty."</TE>
<TE>   But city officials and residents say they are not finished. More
than 300 units have been refurbished in what they call the "core" of
Jeffrey-Lynne. Phase 2 will be the perimeter, bounded by Cerritos
Avenue, Audre Drive, Walnut and 9th streets.</TE>
<TE>   Those residents still living on the perimeter are jealously eyeing
the changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a big change," said Francisco Ceja, who served as chairman
of the resident committee. "It's a big improvement, but it's only one
step, one part. The people on the perimeter are already saying, 'When
are we going to be able to have decent and affordable housing?'"</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim's redevelopment staff and the two developers--Southern
California Housing Development Corp. and the Related Companies of
California--are already putting together a financing plan they hope
to take to the City Council in May. And property owners in the second
phase already are being approached to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Aliberti, senior director of property management for Southern
California Housing, said the lack of affordable housing in Orange
County has become a crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "Disney is planning to build a third park," Aliberti said, adding
that those future employees will need affordable housing. "Where are
these people supposed to be housed? It's really an incredible
situation. That's why they're doubling and tripling up families in
these units, because they can't afford to live in Orange County."</TE>

<HD>Hoffman Seeks Post as Planner</HD>
<DH>Thousand Oaks: The defeated supervisorial candidate hopes
to serve on the city commission. Linda Parks objects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Millionaire businessman Randy Hoffman has thrown his name into a pool
of candidates hoping to be appointed to the Thousand Oaks Planning
Commission tonight.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman will be nominated by Councilman Dan Del Campo, who said he
supports the former technology executive "100%."</LD>
<LD>   "He's demonstrated a tremendous amount of willingness to serve his
community," Del Campo said. "He has intelligence and independence. I
believe he will serve this community well."</LD>
<TE>   Hoffman was defeated for an open seat on the Board of Supervisors
earlier this month by Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Linda Parks. Hoffman
also lost a congressional contest in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But Hoffman said Parks' six-point margin in the supervisor's race
tells him that he has plenty of support in the Thousand Oaks area.
Parks won 53% of the vote in the March 5 primary, compared with 47%
for Hoffman.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of political pundits think if we didn't have a record low
turnout, the results would have been different," Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Planning commissioners review housing projects and other
development proposals. Each City Council member is permitted to
nominate an applicant, who must then be approved by a council
majority.</TE>
<TE>   Parks, who doesn't join the Board of Supervisors until Jan. 1,
said she opposes Hoffman's appointment because he received large
contributions from developers and others with ties to the building
industry in his campaign for supervisor.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman raised $450,000 to Parks' $106,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Each council member can nominate someone who is representative of
their perspective," Parks said. "I would just like to see that he
recuses himself when voting on projects sponsored by developers he
took money from."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman said his financial independence--he sold a successful
technology company in 1997--and Ivy League education have prepared
him well to make tough decisions. If appointed, he will push for the
same slow-growth policies embraced by many Thousand Oaks residents,
Hoffman said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone in the Conejo Valley supports slow growth," he said. "My
philosophy certainly hasn't changed. I am a slow-growth advocate. I
will work hard to protect the quality of life that we enjoy here."</TE>
<TE>   Parks said she suspects that Hoffman is trying for a Planning
Commission appointment "to put something on his resume" should he
decide to run for a City Council seat. Hoffman said he hasn't thought
about that.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said she plans to nominate Janice Osterhaven to fill a
second open seat on the five-member Planning Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Osterhaven is a researcher in Mayor Ed Masry's law firm and helped
Parks organize a campaign to stop construction of a dam near the Lang
Ranch neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Parks said she fears her Osterhaven nomination will be blocked by
a parliamentary move by the council majority. Three of the council
members--Del Campo, Andy Fox and Dennis Gillette--have been at
loggerheads with Parks and Masry on a number of issues.</TE>

<HD>Home Inventory Can't Keep Up</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Sales were 28% above the previous February.
Experts say prices will keep rising because demand still exceeds the
supply.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Low inventories and interest rates, coupled with high demand, pushed
up San Fernando Valley home sales by 28.5% and median home prices by
12.1% over the same period last year, according to a real estate
report released Monday.</LD>
<LD>   With 861 sold in February, single-family homes sales dropped 4.7%
from 903 the month before but were well ahead of 670 in February
2001, the Southland Regional Assn. of Realtors report said.</LD>
<LD>   Local industry analysts attributed the month-over-month decline to
the traditional seasonal autumn-winter housing slowdown. They
predicted that the shortage in available housing would continue to
push up prices.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't see any drastic changes in the inventory in the
foreseeable, short-term future," said Jim Link, executive vice
president of the association.</TE>
<TE>   "Barring any large swing in the market, the inventory situation
won't be easing up to any large degree.''</TE>
<TE>   The possibility that the Federal Reserve Board will raise interest
rates--thus affecting mortgage rates--in the latter half of the year
could be a positive for the local market, Links said.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the strength of this market is that prices and interest
rates will be increasing in the future,'' Link said. "That is fueling
the market and getting buyers out there before the prices go up."</TE>
<TE>   February condominium sales increased 15% from January and 16.2%
compared with February 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Median condominium prices rose 13.8% to $165,000 in February over
the same period a year ago, but a 5.7% drop from January was
attributed to seasonal factors, analysts said.</TE>

suspected of being illegal immigrants. They were in a van that was
pulled over by the California Highway Patrol on the Costa Mesa
Freeway in Orange, near the Garden Grove Freeway, after it failed to
stop at the Temecula border checkpoint. Fire and smoke were seen
coming from the van, according to Highway Patrol officials.</CP>

<HD>Josie Montoya; Unflagging Friend of O.C.'s Needy</HD>

<LD>Josie Montoya, tireless defender of the poor in wealthy Orange
County, has died.</LD>
<LD>   Montoya, 60, of Anaheim, fought against police brutality, domestic
abuse and discrimination against illegal immigrants and the homeless.
She founded two Anaheim youth centers, a food program and counseled
thousands of needy people. She died early Saturday of complications
from diabetes at Kindred Hospital in Brea, relatives said.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm tired," she told one of her grandchildren Friday evening.
"I'm just very tired."</LD>
<TE>   Family members, friends and admirers--who for the last few years
had seen her go straight from her hospital bed to the streets to
distribute food to the homeless, or entertain schoolchildren or wage
another march on City Hall--seemed stunned she was gone.</TE>
<TE>   "Our community was uniquely blessed to have Josie working in our
backyard," said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Garden Grove). "The pride of
our neighborhoods was largely built on the passion and unselfish
motivation of this incredible woman."</TE>
<TE>   Montoya won dozens of awards through nearly four decades of
community work, from President Jimmy Carter to the local Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce. None of it fazed her.</TE>
<TE>   "She mixed and mingled with the rich and powerful, but she was
most comfortable with the poor and disenfranchised," her younger
sister, Rita Canales, said.</TE>
<TE>   Canales said Montoya was proud of changes she brought to the
Anaheim Police Department, including having patrol car numbers
enlarged and requiring officers to hand out business cards on request
so residents could identify individual officers. She had forms to
register complaints against police placed in local libraries because,
she said, poor Latino residents were routinely intimidated when they
tried to fill them out at police stations.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya, who often lived on just a Social Security check, was
famous for emptying her pockets to homeless people and children. One
day, she saw a family standing in the rain begging, her sister said.
They stayed in Montoya's living room for three months and are now
citizens with a permanent home here.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Montoya acted as watchdog for the impoverished
Jeffrey-Lynne neighborhood while city officials renovated dilapidated
housing stock there. Montoya was worried that longtime low-income
tenants would be permanently displaced.</TE>
<TE>   "She never stopped challenging city leaders to answer a tough
question about treating everybody with equality and dignity and
respect," Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said.</TE>
<TE>   Montoya is survived by a daughter, Jessica Castro; a son, Raymond
Montoya; eight brothers and sisters; and five grandchildren. A
funeral Mass will be said at 10 a.m. Friday at St. Boniface Roman
Catholic Church in Anaheim, with burial at Anaheim Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Contributions to defray funeral costs and to continue her work can
be made to the LULAC chapter in Garden Grove--Josie Montoya Fund.

<HD>LAPD Asks for Help in Search for Escapee</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles police are asking for the public's help in tracking down
a convicted gang member who escaped from juvenile hall in Sylmar.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives from the LAPD's 77th Street station released a picture
Monday of Kenneth Ruben Gilliam, 17, of Los Angeles, who slipped out
of the Barry J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall on March 10, two days before he
was scheduled to be sentenced for the shooting last summer of three
boys in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said he would
introduce a motion today calling on the Probation Department to
report back in two weeks on the circumstances behind the escape. He
also will ask probation officials for recommendations on improving
security at all county probation halls and camps.</LD>
<TE>   Workers at the Sylmar complex, which houses more than 500
juveniles, have raised questions about security lapses.</TE>
<TE>   Workers and the probation officers' union have complained that a
zero-tolerance policy on the use of force has created an atmosphere
in which a worker who touches a young offender, even in self-defense,
can expect a disciplinary hearing and possible suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Billy Burkert, the Probation Department's detention chief, said
department policies are meant to strike a balance between security
and a desire to treat offenders not as hoodlums, but as juveniles in
need of rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam's escape was the second at Sylmar in two months.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the boy used a part from a computer mouse to
break the window of his hillside dorm room, and then scaled a 16-foot
fence to reach a car where at least one accomplice was waiting.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Prosecutor Who Aided Drug Dealer Leaves Prison</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MONTE MORIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former star prosecutor who admitted providing sensitive information
to Orange County's biggest methamphetamine dealer was released from
custody Monday after almost three years of imprisonment.</LD>
<LD>   Bryan Ray Kazarian, 37, left federal court in Santa Ana on Monday
evening to cheers and hugs from more than 60 friends and relatives.
Kazarian, who wept as he hugged his wife, Tanya, had been held in an
undisclosed prison because authorities feared he might become a
target of the drug dealer or others. On at least one occasion, he was
attacked by a gang member, his lawyer said.</LD>
<LD>   Kazarian is the first Orange County prosecutor convicted of a
crime in 30 years. Although the State Bar of California has
classified Kazarian as "not entitled to practice law," the former
prosecutor has appealed that decision.</LD>
<TE>   Kazarian's colleagues described him as a successful gang
prosecutor. He came under suspicion when authorities discovered his
friendship with John David Ward, a high-rolling gambler and head of a
large methamphetamine ring based in California and Hawaii. U.S.
attorneys described him as the county's biggest methamphetamine
dealer.</TE>
<TE>   Kazarian allegedly accepted free trips to Las Vegas in exchange
for providing Ward with information about investigations involving
the drug ring. After becoming suspicious of Kazarian, the district
attorney's office created fictitious information about a nonexistent
informant in the Ward case to see if Kazarian would leak it. He did.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Kazarian was charged after authorities recorded
incriminating cell phone conversations between him and Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Kazarian pleaded guilty to a single federal drug-trafficking
conspiracy charge and agreed to provide key testimony at Ward's
trial. After a long trial at which Kazarian testified for an entire
day, Ward was convicted on multiple counts of narcotics violations
and money laundering. He was sentenced in February to life in prison
without possibility of parole.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities had wanted to wait until after Ward's trial to
sentence Kazarian, who was held in custody because of fears that he
was a flight risk.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Kazarian appeared in shackles before U.S. District
Judge Gary L. Taylor for sentencing. Assistant U.S. Atty. James
Spertus said Kazarian had already served the slightly more than
three-year sentence prosecutors had recommended.</TE>
<TE>   The former prosecutor said he regretted his misconduct. "I'm
deeply remorseful for abusing my position of trust," Kazarian said.
"I let John Ward manipulate me.... I never had any intent to harm
anyone in my office or anyone in law enforcement. For those who think
I put them in danger, I apologize to them."</TE>
<TE>   Kazarian says he was duped by Ward and didn't initially realize he
was a drug dealer.</TE>

<TE>   Judge Taylor approved Kazarian's release, but not before issuing a
warning.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor said that Kazarian not only committed crimes but also
damaged his career and strained relationships with both loved ones
and former colleagues, who felt betrayed.</TE>
<TE>   "Always count your lucky stars that it wasn't a lot worse than
this," Taylor said. "You could have been involved in something a lot
worse."</TE>
<TE>   Kazarian's friends and relatives , who packed the courtroom,
applauded when Taylor announced that Kazarian would be freed. They
crowded the courthouse's main floor to await his release by U.S.
marshals.</TE>
<TE>   "We're excited; we've been anxiously awaiting this day for a long
time. We can't wait to get him home and give him more kisses and
hugs," said Anahid Bouchakian, Tanya's aunt.</TE>
<TE>   Others agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "We're thankful that this nightmare is over," said Yerchen
Maldjian, Kazarian's father-in-law. "Right now he's going to take a
nice two- or three-week vacation with his family."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives closed in on Kazarian as soon as he was released,
clasping him tightly and kissing him.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to thank you," Kazarian said, his release papers and other
documents in his hand. "I love you all very much; now let's go have
some fun."</TE>
<TE>   Kazarian dodged reporters' questions, hustled into a silver
Mercedes and was gone.</TE>
<TE>   It will be several month before he will know whether he can
practice law again.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not exactly sure what his status is, but I'd expect that he'd
like to keep his license," said Brian O'Neill, Kazarian's defense
lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County District Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas has said he
believes Kazarian should not be allowed to practice law again.</TE>
<TE>   A federal prosecutor said Monday he had no opinion on the matter.</TE>

<HD>'She Was Terrified of Him'</HD>
<DH>Disappearance: Officials say a man kidnapped his girlfriend
and their two daughters in Lomita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR BECERRA and ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For authorities investigating the disappearance of Adriana Galindo
and her daughters, what happened March 6 was the denouement of a
violent relationship.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say that on that day, Jose Delacruz tracked down
Galindo and the couple's two children at her aunt's home in
Lomita--the day after being convicted of spousal abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Superior Court Judge Melvin Sandvig had just ordered Delacruz to
serve six months in jail, but had released him to get his financial
business in order, a spokeswoman for the city attorney's office said.
Delacruz, who had pleaded no contest to the charge, was scheduled to
report to jail May 29.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, sheriff's detectives say, Delacruz, his 19-year-old son,
Alejo, from a previous marriage and a man authorities have not
identified barged into the home of Galindo's aunt and kidnapped the
27-year-old woman and daughters Gypsy, 3, and Ariane, 1.</TE>
<TE>   Six months earlier, Galindo had left her Pacoima home with her
daughters for a shelter, hoping that Delacruz, a 39-year-old
construction worker, wouldn't catch up with her, family members said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was terrified of him," said Silvia Martinez, Galindo's aunt.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said her niece, a native of Durango, Mexico, was a
teenager when she met Delacruz in the Van Nuys apartment building
where they both lived. They lived together off and on for nine years,
though they never married.</TE>
<TE>   The aunt and other family members said she fled from him several
times but always returned.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Delacruz, who shared a Pacoima home with his older brother,
said he never witnessed any abuse of Galindo, although he knew she
had filed complaints with the police. But the latest incident, he
said, was "not a kidnapping; this is a rescue."</TE>
<TE>   Julio Delacruz said he was surprised by media reports that his
brother was suspected of kidnapping Galindo and the children. He said
that on March 5, the day before the family disappeared, Galindo
called Jose Delacruz and asked him to pick up her and the children
because she feared her family might try to get legal custody of the
children.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez said the family had no such intentions. "That's a lie,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Julio Delacruz said he has not heard from his brother and does not
know where he is.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Kaono said Jose Delacruz has a "very violent
history of domestic abuse." Investigators said they fear for the
safety of Galindo and her children.</TE>
<TE>   According to court records, Delacruz was convicted in 1983 of
felony domestic abuse of a previous wife and served a 16-month jail
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, talking to both sides of the family, you get the 'he
said, she said' that makes it look like a regular family fight,"
Kaono said. "But from police records, court records and our
interviews, we believe the story that the wife's family is telling.
This is a kidnapping and nothing less."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators say they don't know where the family has gone, but
they have asked the Border Patrol and the TV show "America's Most
Wanted" to help in the search.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the latest incident could be tracked back to
Oct.21, when Delacruz reportedly injured Galindo's eardrum. She told
police the next day, and Delacruz was arrested, said Ana Garcia,
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles city attorney's office, which
prosecuted the misdemeanor case. The court issued a restraining order
against him on Nov. 13.</TE>
<TE>   Despite their past and her injuries, Galindo asked that charges
against Delacruz be dropped and she refused to assist prosecutors,
Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Galindo and the girls moved into a battered women's shelter, and
Martinez said she did not hear from them for several months. Martinez
said Galindo later told her that the shelter had arranged for them to
relocate to Chicago, but that they turned back when they reached
Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Los Angeles, Galindo and her children stayed with a
friend, Martinez said. But Jose Delacruz found them and brought them
home. On March 1, Galindo fled with her daughters and called from a
pay phone at Union Station, Martinez said. From there, they took a
taxi to the aunt's Lomita home, Martinez said.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought [Delacruz] didn't know where I lived," Martinez said.
"We thought she was safe."</TE>
<TE>   On March 6, Delacruz and the other two men arrived at the Lomita
home, where Galindo and the girls were alone, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, police investigators went to the brothers' home. In
Mission Hills, near a relative's home, police found Delacruz's black
1995 Chevrolet Suburban, the car in which the the family had left the
aunt's house.</TE>
<TE>   But there was no sign of Galindo and the children.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Delacruz has traveled far and long to find Galindo
and his children, her relatives said.</TE>
<TE>   After she left him about six years ago, he showed up at the home
of her sister in the San Francisco Bay Area, her mother said. When he
didn't find her in Northern California, he went to Durango in central
Mexico, meeting Galindo's mother for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even know him. He said, 'I came looking for Adriana,'"
said Elia Martinez, 50. Galindo wasn't in Mexico at the time, her
mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Elia Martinez, who now lives with her other daughter in the Bay
Area, said she seldom heard from Galindo.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides of the family said this latest episode has gone further
than any of the previous breakups. To the Delacruzes, it is unusual
that Jose has not returned or called home. The Martinezes say they
are worried.</TE>
<TE>   "I ask our father God to look over them," Galindo's mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Anyone with information is asked to call the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department at (310) 539-1661.</TE>

<LD>A Van Nuys man convicted of running an illegal sexual-encounter
business out of his home was sentenced to 36 months' probation Monday
in Los Angeles County Superior Court.</LD>
<LD>   Judge Debre Katz Weintraub also ordered John Lynch to pay at least
$2,500 in fines and perform 35 days of community service. Lynch, 50,
was convicted Friday on five counts of operating a sexual-encounter
business in a residential zone.</LD>
<LD>   Lynch said he accepted cash from dozens of couples who had been
invited to his home on weekends to share spouses. A jury found him
guilty last week after undercover police officers testified about
attending five parties in 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Lynch's sentence was suspended until April 9 while his attorney
appeals the verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Roger Jon Diamond said he was appealing ''on principle,''
because Lynch believes evidence used to convict him was improperly
seized from his home without a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm sure if [a search warrant] was an issue, it would have come
out in the trial," countered Deputy City Atty. Deborah Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch's home, known as ''The Velvet Swing,'' is listed in swinger
magazines. Lynch told reporters that he has invited as many as 40
couples to his home on Fridays and Saturdays, but Diamond said the
parties are over.</TE>
<TE>   Lynch plans to move his sexual-encounter business out of Los
Angeles and operate within the law, Diamond said.</TE>
<TE>   ''Lynch believes this whole trial was a waste of time,'' Diamond
said. ''The parties are only a hobby.''</TE>

<HD>Defense, Prosecution Make Closing Arguments in Dog Mauling
Case</HD>
<DH>Courts: Owners' lawyers call the animals well-behaved
family pets while prosecutors say the Presa Canarios were worse than
loaded guns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNA GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors urged jurors Monday to convict two San Francisco lawyers
in the fatal dog mauling of Diane Whipple, arguing that their massive
Presa Canario dogs were more dangerous than loaded guns and that it
was only a matter of time until they killed.</LD>
<LD>   "By Jan. 26, [2001], it was not whether somebody was going to be
mauled or killed by one of these dogs," Assistant Dist. Atty. James
Hammer said during closing arguments. "The only question Jan. 26 was
when and who and where."</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys countered by arguing that Whipple's death was a
tragic accident, and that the defendants could not have known their
well-behaved family pets could kill. "The absolutely unthinkable
happened," said defense attorney Bruce Hotchkiss.</LD>
<TE>   Whipple died after being attacked last year by the dogs--Bane and
Hera--in the hallway outside her San Francisco apartment. She had
returned from buying groceries at the same time Marjorie Knoller
returned from taking one of the dogs for a walk on the roof. Bane
ripped out Whipple's throat and Hera tore at her clothes. The dogs
have since been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs' owners, Knoller and Robert Noel, are on trial on charges
of involuntary manslaughter and keeping a mischievous dog in
connection with Whipple's death. Knoller, who was in the hallway
during the attack, also faces a second-degree murder charge. If
convicted, Knoller, 46, faces a sentence of 15 years to life in state
prison. Noel, 60, faces four years.</TE>
<TE>   The closing arguments came after more than a month of testimony in
the case, which was moved to Los Angeles County Superior Court
because of publicity in the Bay Area. Prosecutors will give a
rebuttal argument this morning and jurors will begin deliberating the
case today.</TE>
<TE>   As he addressed the jurors, Hammer held up a cast of Bane's teeth
and called the dogs "time bombs." He said the defendants liked
intimidating people with their dogs and didn't worry about the safety
of their neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "They could have been warned 100 times," he said. Hammer said
Knoller and Noel deliberately ignored more than 30 incidents--which
he called premonitions of the fatal attack--including times when the
dogs lunged at a pregnant woman, bit a neighbor and charged a postal
worker.</TE>
<TE>   They chose not to put muzzles or choke collars on the dogs that
January afternoon--which would have saved Whipple's life--even though
the defendants knew "with their own eyes" the danger the animals
posed, Hammer said.</TE>
<TE>   Hammer said the defendants, who adopted a Pelican Bay State Prison
inmate as their son, were associates of the Aryan Brotherhood prison
gang and helped inmates run an attack dog breeding ring.</TE>
<TE>   He also discounted Knoller's defense that she tried to shield
Whipple from the dogs. Knoller could not have been in the middle of
the attack, he said, because she walked away with a few cuts on her
hand.</TE>
<TE>   "My mother gets worse wounds gardening," he said. "Compare those
to what happened to Diane Whipple."</TE>
<TE>   Hammer ended his argument by imploring the jury to find Knoller
and Noel guilty. "Do not let them get away with their lies. Don't let
Marjorie Knoller get away with murder."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said their clients were not warned about the
dangers of the dogs because nobody complained to police or animal
control officers. The previous encounters that neighbors and
dog-walkers said they had with the dogs were normal interactions
between people and dogs and didn't instill fear in anyone, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "They haven't been confronted by dogs of death," said Knoller's
attorney, Nedra Ruiz. "Nothing out of the ordinary was happening and
they knew it."</TE>
<TE>   In her closing argument, Ruiz said her client tried to protect
Whipple by throwing her body on top of her. Showing jurors Knoller's
ripped clothes and photos of her injuries, Ruiz said her client was
also bitten, bruised and bloodied during the attack. Her client did
not call 911 because she didn't want to leave Whipple alone in the
hallway.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz accused Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith, of lying when she
testified that Whipple was bitten by one of the dogs about a month
before the fatal attack. It is incredible to believe, Ruiz argued,
that Smith would have allowed the love of her life to live in fear.
Smith has "no right to come here with false testimony and attempt to
frame Marjorie Knoller for murder by alleging this bite," Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Ruiz also accused Hammer of hiding evidence from jurors and
prosecuting the case to cater to the gay and lesbian community in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   The dogs were docile and obedient and never showed any signs of
being vicious, Ruiz said.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll never know what made Bane go berserk ... but what we do
know is that Marjorie--when she took the dog up to the sixth-floor
roof--never, ever had noticed that this dog was liable to kill," Ruiz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Hotchkiss argued that Noel and Knoller were conscientious dog
owners who took their normally friendly and well-behaved dogs all
around the Bay Area. He added that the dogs were never out of
control, and were never trained to be aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   "From [Noel's] point of view, he didn't see anything wrong with
his dogs," Hotchkiss said.</TE>
<TE>   Hotchkiss told jurors that the witnesses who testified about their
encounters with the dogs were not lying, but remembered their
encounters "through the filter of Jan. 26 and through the subsequent
bad things that have been said about Robert Noel."</TE>
<TE>   Hotchkiss accused prosecutors of cobbling together a case against
Noel because he had a relationship with a prison inmate and wrote
letters that offended many people.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence about the Aryan Brotherhood and Pelican Bay State
Prison are not relevant to the mauling, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Noel, who arrived home after the attack, could not have
anticipated the chain of events that led to Whipple's death that
afternoon, Hotchkiss said.</TE>

<HD>Final MTA Appeal of Bus Accord Fails</HD>
<DH>Transportation: U.S. Supreme Court's refusal to hear case
means the agency probably will be forced to buy hundreds of vehicles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An action Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court will force the MTA to
improve service to Los Angeles County's mostly poor, urban bus
riders, while jeopardizing other programs, including some light rail
service to the suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   The high court declined to review a 5 1/2-year-old court order
requiring the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to buy more
buses.</LD>
<LD>   The MTA's failed appeal was the last in a string of defeats that
cost more than $1 million in legal fees and angered many bus riders,
who make up the bulk of the agency's customers.</LD>
<TE>   Now the MTA will be forced to live by the terms of a court
agreement it made in 1996 to avoid trial on a lawsuit, which charged
that it willfully failed to provide adequate service to poor and
minority riders.</TE>
<TE>   The court's action throws the dispute back to the MTA and the Bus
Riders Union, the lead plaintiff in the civil rights case, to work
out an agreement that will reduce overcrowding. In the next phase of
the plan, the agency probably will have to buy hundreds of buses to
improve service to work sites, schools and health centers, legal
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   If the two sides still can't agree on solutions, the matter will
be mediated by a special court master. Faced with a series of five
straight court decisions in favor of riders, the MTA is unlikely to
prevail with its continuing insistence that it has already bought
enough buses.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators at the agency conceded Monday that the increased
spending on buses will probably hamper at least some of its most
ambitious expansion projects--including a proposed light rail line
from near downtown to Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   Construction of freeway carpool lanes and some special services
for the disabled may also be curtailed as money is diverted to bus
purchases, said Roger Snoble, the MTA's chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, bus advocates were elated with the Supreme Court's
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't even want to see the case," said Eric Mann, head of
the Bus Riders Union. "The courts have certainly said all along that
these appeals are frivolous."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that the MTA had already lost before a special master, a
federal judge and, twice, before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   The mood was more downcast at MTA headquarters downtown. The
agency's officials have tried to put a positive face on their
appeals, saying they have simply sought "clarification" from the
courts. But the legal briefs filed by the agency's lawyers made much
more substantial objections--that the federal judiciary had
overstepped its bounds and that the MTA could not fulfill its
responsibilities, if hamstrung by the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   "It's disappointing," said Snoble, who insisted again Monday that
his agency is doing all it can to follow the agreement. He defended
the appeal to the high court, which most legal experts had predicted
stood little chance. "We were within our legal rights," Snoble said.</TE>
<TE>   The repeated appeals have created ill will among many bus riders,
fostering the impression that the MTA was blocking efforts to improve
service, even as it advertised widely about its purchases of new
buses.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks to people as if the MTA was going back on its word," Los
Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn said Monday. "People feel the MTA made
promises and hasn't lived up to them."</TE>
<TE>   Although Hahn voted against the continuing legal appeals, he could
persuade only his appointees on the agency board to go along. In
January, the board voted 8-4 (with one abstention) to make the final
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to imagine their public relations could be much worse,
and for them to continue with a very public fight over the [court
order], it's baffling," said Raphael Sonenshein, a Cal State
Fullerton political science professor and expert on Los Angeles
politics.</TE>
<TE>   Sonenshein wondered how great the public's dismay might have been
if the city of Los Angeles had continued to fight the federal court
order, known as a consent decree, that now governs reforms in the
Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Imagine if the LAPD had gone this way and appealed all the way to
the Supreme Court," Sonenshein said.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA signed the court agreement in 1996, but quickly found
itself chafing under orders from Washington, D.C., lawyer Donald
Bliss, the court-appointed mediator, to expand its fleet of about
2,100 buses.</TE>
<TE>   Each time the MTA would move ahead with plans for more rail lines
or other construction projects, totaling more than $1 billion, the
Bus Riders Union and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund
would grow more restive.</TE>
<TE>   They argued that the court agreement obliges the transit agency to
first spend money on more buses.</TE>
<TE>   But the two sides have never been able to agree on exactly how
many buses--which cost $325,000 each and $200,000 per year to
operate--should be purchased.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is an element of the federal agreement calling on the
agency to add to its bus fleet, in order to reduce the number of
people forced to stand during rush hours. The agreement calls on the
agency eventually to reduce its number of rush hour standees to an
average of about eight by June 30.</TE>
<TE>   The Bus Riders Union believes the contract requires the standard
to be strictly enforced. By this interpretation, they argue, at least
235 more buses must be bought.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA, in contrast, believes such standards should be treated
simply as planning goals. By this interpretation far fewer, if any,
buses need be bought. "We feel we may already be in compliance,"
Snoble said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   If the disparity about the meaning of the court order continues,
Bliss, the court-appointed mediator, will probably be forced to play
an increasing role in MTA management decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Bliss has tended to take a middle ground, clearly viewing the
limits on the number of standing passengers as hard goals that must
be considered when purchasing new buses. By that standard, observers
close to the case say, Bliss would probably call for more buses, but
fewer than the Bus Riders Union wants.</TE>
<TE>   In contending with a second phase of the court agreement, the
parties and Bliss face perhaps even more intractable disagreements.
That part of the order requires the MTA to increase bus service to
medical centers, hospitals, schools and job centers throughout Los
Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   Many transit experts say the agency will have to purchase hundreds
more buses to be able to deliver riders to those far-flung locations.
On Monday, Mann said he thinks it will take about 500 more buses to
meet those objectives.</TE>
<TE>   The bus rider advocate also said the agency, which portrayed
itself as under financial duress in its brief to the Supreme Court,
should stop current plans to build more rail lines.</TE>
<TE>   "We are calling for a moratorium on rail, until they finish the
[court] decree," Mann said.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is preparing in the summer of 2003 to take over operation
of a light rail line from downtown to Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   It plans to spend $329 million on a fixed roadway for buses in the
San Fernando Valley. Another $760 million is intended for a rail line
serving the Eastside of Los Angeles. Snoble said that nothing in the
federal agreement prevents his agency from pursuing such projects,
many of which are funded by federal and state dollars that he said
can be spent only on rail.</TE>
<TE>   He did say that the plan to create a route from the neighborhood
around USC to Santa Monica via Exposition Boulevard may be quashed or
delayed. Snoble added that service to physically challenged
passengers, construction of highway carpool lanes and other
big-ticket expenditures could also suffer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm relieved [the Bus Riders Union] is talking about hundreds of
buses and not thousands," said Snoble, who accused the advocates of
being "anti-transit" because they focused solely on buses.</TE>
<TE>   "If we go by what the BRU wants, we are never going to be able to
serve the needs of the people here.... We still believe we will not
be able to be successful if we are going to rely on 40-foot buses to
do the job."</TE>

<HD>Immigrant Gets Prison for Threats on Plane</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Weeping and pleading for mercy, an Iranian immigrant was sentenced to
two years and nine months in federal prison Monday for threatening to
"kill all Americans" after he was caught smoking on a plane bound
from Los Angeles to Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   Appearing in chains before a Los Angeles federal judge, Javid
Naghani, a 38-year-old Canoga Park businessman, apologized for
violating the no-smoking rule on airplanes, but denied uttering any
anti-American remarks during the Sept. 27 flight.</LD>
<LD>   "Judge, give me a chance," he pleaded. "I did a mistake. I never
did mean to harm anybody; I'm sorry about smoking."</LD>
<TE>   Naghani, a legal U.S. resident, was convicted by a federal jury in
December of interfering with the Air Canada flight crew.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorney Theodore Flier argued that Naghani would have
received a fine or a much lighter sentence if his crime had occurred
before Sept. 11. He said he would appeal the conviction.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a pre-9/11 situation, we would not be in court today
arguing over sentencing," Flier told U.S. District Judge Ronald S. W.
Lew.</TE>
<TE>   Lew said that Sept. 11 was not a factor in his sentencing
decision.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not take smoking lightly," said the judge, adding that
Naghani had never fully accepted responsibility for his actions.</TE>
<TE>   Under federal sentencing guidelines, Naghani could have received
up to three years and five months in prison. He already has spent six
months behind bars, which will count toward his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Naghani's troubles began during the start of a long-anticipated
vacation trip to Canada with his wife and their pet poodle.</TE>
<TE>   While waiting to board their plane at Los Angeles International
Airport, Naghani had several glasses of wine, his wife testified at
his two-day trial.</TE>
<TE>   Flier said Monday that his client was "completely intoxicated"
when he boarded the plane and that flight attendants were aware of
his condition. Naghani was later found to have a blood-alcohol
reading in excess of 0.20%, Flier said. The legal limit for drivers
in California is 0.08%.</TE>
<TE>   "This situation could have been avoided if the flight attendants
had simply said, 'We can't let you on the plane,'" Flier said.</TE>
<TE>   Several minutes after the Boeing 767 took off, Naghani went to a
lavatory, where he lighted a cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to a smoke alarm, flight attendants pounded on the
lavatory door and ordered him to come out.</TE>
<TE>   Two attendants testified that he initially denied smoking and
resisted telling them where he had disposed of his cigarette.</TE>
<TE>   They said he became belligerent, saying that he wanted to "kill
all Americans" or words to that effect.</TE>
<TE>   Naghani, who lives in Woodland Hills, took the stand in his own
defense.</TE>
<TE>   "I swear to God, I never say that and I never will," he told the
jury in broken, heavily accented English.</TE>
<TE>   He said he begged the crew not to have him arrested because he
needed to be available to pay employees at his Canoga Park business,
Cleaning of America.</TE>
<TE>   Flier argued that, given Naghani's thick accent, the flight crew
may have mistaken "Cleaning of America" for "killing Americans."</TE>
<TE>   Acting on the flight attendants' request, the Air Canada pilot
returned to LAX, escorted by two military jets.</TE>
<TE>   Naghani was arrested by FBI agents who stormed the plane.</TE>
<TE>   In an unrelated aircraft disturbance case, David Murdoch Boone,
36, of New Orleans pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a
charge of interfering with the crew of a Southwest Airlines jetliner
that was taxiing on a runway at LAX on Jan. 7.</TE>
<TE>   Boone was accused of hitting a flight attendant and opening an
exit door as the plane was about to take off for Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   Trial was set for April 16.</TE>

<HD>Napa Growers to Build Housing for Harvesters</HD>
<DH>Labor: Vintners say it's unacceptable to have field workers
'living under bridges.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. HELENA, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Veteran farm worker Salvador Servin wears his baseball cap pulled low
over his eyes, to protect him from the unforgiving sun and perhaps
block out injustices he's seen in his dozen years of toil in
California's growing fields.</LD>
<LD>   Whether picking oranges and lemons in the San Joaquin Valley or
apples in Sonoma County, he has watched managers dismiss the concerns
of desperate migrant laborers, often forcing them to sleep outdoors
in makeshift camps or even in the very fields they spend all day
working.</LD>
<LD>   "When it comes to providing us a place to sleep, many owners look
the other way," said the 62-year-old Mexican native, his face creased
by sunlight and age. "They tell you 'It isn't my problem.' They don't
care what happens at night as long as you show up for work at dawn
the next day."</LD>
<TE>   Napa County has been different, however. Every year, Servin and
2,500 other seasonal workers return to these fertile vineyards,
attracted by the better-than-average $11 hourly wage in a community
that has generally shown more regard for its itinerant grape pickers,
running several camps with bunk-style housing for up to 175 workers.</TE>
<TE>   In a state that has historically turned its back on the people who
harvest its food, Napa County this month took another bold step:
Voters overwhelmingly approved a move to nearly triple the available
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Measure L loosens zoning restrictions so growers can section off
small swaths of land and build shelters for a countywide total of 300
additional workers. And local agriculture interests could soon assess
themselves a new tax to pay for the dorms.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the new measure, passed March 5, bulldozers will
soon break ground on the Phelps Project--a 60-bed camp to be built on
eight acres of former vineyard land along the Napa River.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Shelton, president of Joseph Phelps Vineyards, explained why
his company stepped forward with land: "If we want these professional
field workers to return year after year, then we better take care of
them and provide them with suitable housing."</TE>
<TE>   "Napa has done well for itself, and it's embarrassing to have
field laborers living under bridges and on steps of the Catholic
church. It's unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   Passed by an overwhelming 71%, Measure L opens the way for growers
to tax themselves as much as $10 an acre to help finance worker
housing. Local agricultural interests--including more than 250
wineries--are forming an advisory committee to assess community needs
before voting on the tax.</TE>
<TE>   Experts believe Napa's plan could be used as a national model for
farm worker housing. But others say that what works for this small
and wealthy region would become unwieldy in places like the great
Central Valley, an 18-county seasonal home to tens of thousands of
itinerant workers.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Gabriel, legislative director of labor affairs for the
California Farm Bureau, said growers fear they could soon be required
to tax themselves for similar programs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to mandate growers to provide housing, every
business in the state should have to do it," he said. "It would be a
disaster. Business and industry would flee the state. What happens in
one tiny little valley really can't be applied to the rest of the
state."</TE>
<TE>   Philip Martin, a UC Davis labor economist, says the Napa Valley
has other reasons to reach out to its migrant population: Millions of
tourists who travel up and down California 29 through the heart of
the vineyards.</TE>
<TE>   "Growers can't afford to let tourists see people living in
shantytowns right next to mansions," Martin said. "But you have to
give them credit: People have worked to change laws in a county that
is very oriented toward land preservation. There's no other place in
California I know of where growers impose a tax on themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Like other areas, Napa has struggled to incorporate its seasonal
work force both economically and culturally.</TE>
<TE>   Since migrants arrived in force in the 1970s, when Napa received
its first serious recognition as a home for world-class wines,
laborers have endured a "have, have-not" existence here--shopping in
grocery stores priced for well-heeled buyers that for years did not
even stock the tortillas, refried beans and other basic staples they
eat back home.</TE>
<TE>   Housing remains a thorny issue: As local grape acreage has risen
dramatically--from 17,500 in 1976 to 40,000 this year--migrant
housing has plummeted. The number of beds has dropped by more than
half since the 1990s--from 400 to 177 beds, according to a UC Davis
study Martin conducted this year on farm worker conditions in Napa.</TE>
<TE>   Now half a dozen workers will often share cramped one-bedroom
apartments. Others sleep in cardboard boxes or vie for space at
churches or county-run shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year I turned away hundreds of people who needed a place to
sleep," said Angel Calderon, camp manager at the county-run shelter
in Calistoga. "It's hard. Because you know they have no place to go
other than to sleep under a bridge someplace. But we had no beds."</TE>
<TE>   Father John Brenkle, pastor at St. Helena Catholic Church, has
erected sleeping quarters for 50 or more workers during harvest
season to ease the housing demand.</TE>
<TE>   But not everyone in the wealthy parish is pleased with the move.</TE>
<TE>   "These workers show up here with nothing more than the clothes on
their back, but there's still a misconception among some people that
they're loafers. People think these men come just because we take
care of their needs," he said. "We're trying to educate them that
these people are paid so little, they can't find a place of their
own."</TE>
<TE>   Rosa Segura, a farm worker housing advocate, in 1999 helped open a
tent city for workers on county land as a way to bring attention to
the issue. As a result, the county formed a commission to study the
problem, eventually leading to the passage of Measure L.</TE>
<TE>   Segura said her worst moment in the struggle came the day a local
newspaper published two stories about wealth in a county she said was
dragging its heels on providing for its seasonal workers. "On the
same day there was a story about how the wine industry brings in
$33.8 billion a year into the state economy and another about how a
local grower was donating 247 acres to a land trust," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't think we were asking too much for a few acres to be
devoted to housing workers who are the backbone of this successful
local industry."</TE>
<TE>   Pat Garvey agrees. The owner of Flora Springs Winery and Vineyards
became a member of the county's migrant housing committee because he
was ashamed of the conditions he saw. "I'd drive down the road in my
tractor and see these guys sleeping along the Napa River in cardboard
boxes," he said. "I knew we could do better."</TE>
<TE>   Garvey says many newcomers don't appreciate the backbreaking labor
of picking grapes.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent shortage of workers, Garvey one Saturday hired a
dozen teenagers from the local high school basketball team. "They
were gone by noon," he recalled. "They couldn't handle the work."</TE>
<TE>   As Napa gears up for another annual grape harvest this fall, some
residents question how soon the new migrant housing will come.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the 300 beds will be added in my lifetime--and I'm
70 years old and hope I'm going to be around some time yet," said
Father Brenkle. "Who's going to donate the land?"</TE>
<TE>   At up to $200,000 an acre, growers acknowledge that Napa Valley
land comes at a premium.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at the land values," Garvey said. "Who the heck is gonna
say, 'Here, take these five acres for farm worker housing'?"</TE>
<TE>   Though the new beds may be slow in coming, Salvador Servin called
the move a good first step.</TE>
<TE>   "This time," he said in Spanish, "the migrants have won."</TE>

<LD>It was the Golden Globes, says Adam Blackman, "that put me over the
edge. All those speeches--everyone's a genius, everyone's so
beautiful, everyone loves everyone. It was so tiring." So Blackman,
co-owner of a La Cienega furniture and accessories store, put up an
"I Want to Thank ... " window display mocking Hollywood awards shows.</LD>
<LD>   One panel, "I Want to Thank My Agent," consists of a painting of a
human skull and two bags of money.</LD>
<LD>   Another, "I Want to Thank the Casting Director," includes a chaise
lounge and two champagne glasses. Then there's "I Want to Thank My
Plastic Surgeon," which incorporates a series of mirrors.</LD>
<TE>   Blackman says the display has prompted no angry speeches from
Hollywood types. Quite the contrary. One man who noticed the "Casting
Director" display walked into the shop "and wanted to give us his
8-by-10 photo. He thought we were a casting agency."</TE>
<TE>   By the way, the "I Want to Thank ... " display at Blackman Cruz

Actor-Director</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Carmelo Bene, 64, a provocative actor and director who invigorated
Italian theater with experimental techniques influenced by the
European avant-garde, died Saturday at his home in Rome. He had
suffered from serious heart problems.</LD>
<LD>   Born in the southern town of Campi Salentina in 1937, Bene made
his stage debut in Rome in 1959 in "Caligula" by French writer Albert
Camus.</LD>
<LD>   Bene directed himself in many plays, often reinterpreting
classics, such as Shakespeare's "Hamlet." While working in film in
the 1960s and '70s, he appeared in director Pier Paolo Pasolini's
"Oedipus Rex" in 1967. The next year, Bene's own film, "Our Lady of
the Turks," won a prize at the Venice Film Festival.</LD>
<TE>   He returned to the stage in the mid-1970s and later directed
performances in which he read poems to classical music.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Bene's family, Italian President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi called the actor an "extraordinary dramatic talent" who was
"provocative and constantly searching for new modes of expression."</TE>

<HD>Woman Wins Medical Pot Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN L. MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A woman who said she grew marijuana to treat the effects of
sickle-cell anemia was acquitted of several drug charges Monday
despite overwhelming evidence that her personal stash was for more
than medical use.</LD>
<LD>   Police testified that they found more than 200 pounds of marijuana
plants in Somayah Kambui's backyard when she was arrested Oct. 5.
They believed she was using her medical condition as a ruse to run a
distribution operation out of her South Los Angeles house.</LD>
<LD>   Also seized were six pounds of marijuana in large glasses, an
additional 13 pounds in packaging, 34 marijuana cookies, 32 small
brown vials of hash oil, and a pot on the stove with three liters of
oil.</LD>
<TE>   But after six days of testimony, a Superior Court jury spent only
three hours deliberating before finding Kambui, 51, not guilty on all
five counts.</TE>
<TE>   "The evidence was clear that it was a violation of the law," said
a disappointed Sean M. Carney, the deputy district attorney who
prosecuted Kambui. "But she is a very sympathetic figure. She does
have sickle-cell anemia, and the jury, I think, gave a nullification
verdict."</TE>
<TE>   The case tested the state's Proposition 215, the medical marijuana
initiative passed by California voters in 1996. The measure allowed
medical use of marijuana but did not set limits on how much could be
grown or consumed.</TE>
<TE>   Kambui said her house was merely a meeting place for the Crescent
Alliance Self Help for Sickle Cell, a marijuana club she said she
founded 20 years ago. Club members shared information on the uses of
marijuana--making cookies and oils from seeds.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel victorious, honorable and vindicated," Kambui said after
the reading of the verdict. "Now we have to see what can be done to
get my property back and get the LAPD to stop raiding my house."</TE>
<TE>   Her court-appointed attorney, Robert A. Welbourn, said authorities
"spent a lot of money and time trying to convict an innocent woman of
a crime. Maybe they will leave her alone."</TE>
<TE>   After her arrest, Kambui spent 60 days in jail awaiting trial.
Three years before, she had spent two weeks in jail after police
raided her home and seized her marijuana. She beat that case, and her
confiscated plants were returned.</TE>
<TE>   Kambui, who was twice convicted of felonies in the 1970s when she
was active in the Black Panther Party, faced a prison sentence of up
to eight years if she had been convicted this time.</TE>
<TE>   Kambui said her use of marijuana eases the pain of sickle-cell
anemia, a debilitating disease in which the blood cells become
deformed when oxygen levels are low, creating painful blockage of
blood vessels and causing organ damage. Although she once shared her
marijuana with others, she testified that she hadn't been able to
help anyone in the last year because she was too sick. The 27
marijuana plants and several gallons of hemp oil she kept at her
two-story residence were for personal consumption, she said.</TE>
<TE>   When the verdict was read, Kambui asked Judge Michael Johnson
whether "anything could be done to stop any further raids on my
house."</TE>
<TE>   Responded Johnson: "The case is concluded."</TE>
<TE>   The verdicts brought cheers of celebration from supporters outside
the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "We have reason to party now," said Bill Britt, a 42-year-old Long
Beach medical-marijuana activist. "This is wonderful."</TE>
<TE>   Kambui said she also was ready to celebrate. Standing with
cigarette paper in her hand, she said: "I've got to roll me some
medicine."</TE>

<HD>Racial Profiling Lawsuit Is Dismissed</HD>
<DH>Oxnard: U.S. judge rules that plaintiffs gave no evidence
that race was a factor in police stop.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL KELLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Finding no proof of racial profiling, a federal judge has dismissed a
lawsuit by a black Oxnard couple who alleged that 12 gun-wielding
police officers pulled them over after church 18 months ago for no
reason other than their race.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Steven V. Wilson ruled Friday that Neil and
Kim Skipwith offered no evidence that profiling was a factor when
Oxnard officers investigating a stolen-vehicle case stopped them and
demanded that he lie face down on the pavement while his wife and son
watched.</LD>
<LD>   "Even if [the] plaintiffs were correct that [one officer] was
racially motivated to stop the plaintiffs," Wilson wrote, "an
objective police officer would still have been justified in making
the stop based on other facts in the case."</LD>
<TE>   Shortly before the stop, officers were notified that a car similar
to the Skipwiths' had been stolen from a dealership.</TE>
<TE>   During the stop to identify the family's white Cadillac sport
utility vehicle, which lasted seven to 12 minutes, officers did not
deprive the Skipwiths of their constitutional rights, and excessive
force was not used, the judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "It is undisputed that [Neil] Skipwith initially refused to comply
with instructions, and by that conduct prolonged the encounter,"
Wilson noted. "Under the circumstances it was not unreasonable for
the defendants to order Neil Skipwith out of his car, to lie down, to
handcuff him and place him in a patrol car while they investigated."</TE>
<TE>   The Skipwiths could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said he did not know if the couple
will appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said the Skipwith case spotlights an issue that his
department is moving to address by adding two hours of
racial-profiling training to four classroom hours that will soon be
required annually by the state Commission on Police Officer Standards
and Training.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gratified by the federal court decision," Lopez said. "But
racial profiling is something we take seriously here in Oxnard. Since
we have so many folks who are of minority descent, we know this is a
critically important issue."</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of Oxnard's 177,000 residents are minorities. About 40%
of the city's police officers are Latino, black or Asian, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Racial profiling--the singling out of possible suspects based
solely on race or ethnicity--has gained national attention in recent
years as investigations have uncovered its alleged use by the U.S.
Customs Service and other law enforcement agencies, including the New
York City Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that last spring he issued a firm policy banning the
use of racial profiles in making patrol stops. "Our officers
understand that racial profiling is not something that we tolerate,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said minority members of his community advisory committee
will make presentations to every Oxnard police officer each year.</TE>

<LD>Finding no proof of racial profiling, a federal judge has dismissed a
lawsuit by a black Oxnard couple who alleged that 12 gun-wielding
police officers pulled them over after church 18 months ago for no
reason other than their race.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Steven V. Wilson ruled Friday that Neil and
Kim Skipwith offered no evidence that profiling was a factor when
Oxnard officers investigating a stolen-vehicle case stopped them and
demanded that he lie face down on the pavement while his wife and son
watched.</LD>
<LD>   "Even if [the] plaintiffs were correct that [one officer] was
racially motivated to stop the plaintiffs," Wilson wrote, "an
objective police officer would still have been justified in making
the stop based on other facts in the case."</LD>
<TE>   Shortly before the stop, officers were notified that a car similar
to the Skipwiths' had been stolen from a local dealership.</TE>
<TE>   During the stop to identify the family's white Cadillac sport
utility vehicle, which lasted seven to 12 minutes, officers did not
deprive the Skipwiths of their constitutional rights, and excessive
force was not used, the judge ruled.</TE>
<TE>   "It is undisputed that [Neil] Skipwith initially refused to comply
with instructions, and by that conduct prolonged the encounter,"
Wilson noted. "Under the circumstances it was not unreasonable for
the defendants to order Neil Skipwith out of his car, to lie down, to
handcuff him and place him in a patrol car while they investigated."</TE>
<TE>   The Skipwiths could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Police Chief Art Lopez said he did not know if the couple
will appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said the Skipwith case spotlights an issue that his
department is moving to address by adding two hours of
racial-profiling training to four classroom hours that will soon be
required annually by the state Commission on Police Officer Standards
and Training.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gratified by the federal court decision," Lopez said. "But
racial profiling is something we take seriously here in Oxnard. Since
we have so many folks who are of minority descent, we know this is a
critically important issue."</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of Oxnard's 177,000 residents are minorities. About 40%
of the city's police officers are Latino, black or Asian, Lopez said.</TE>
<TE>   Racial profiling--the singling out of possible suspects based
solely on race or ethnicity--has gained national attention in recent
years as investigations have uncovered its alleged use by the U.S.
Customs Service and other law enforcement agencies, including the New
York City Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   In Ventura County, black and Latino community leaders last year
asked a state mediator and a county grand jury to study cases they
believed showed racial bias by local police officers, including
Oxnard's, and by deputies in the Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   A month later, Robert Jones, a young black man who had complained
of profiling by Oxnard police, was shot to death in his home after
his mother called for police to help get her knife-wielding,
distraught son to a hospital.</TE>
<TE>   The grand jury reported in February that it had too little
information to draw conclusions about specific cases. But it
recommended that the local sheriff's academy--the principal training
facility for area police--develop a detailed curriculum for cadets.</TE>
<TE>   Lopez said that last spring he issued a firm policy banning the
use of racial profiles in making patrol stops. "Our officers
understand that racial profiling is not something that we tolerate,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   To emphasize the point, Lopez said minority members of his
community advisory committee will make presentations to every Oxnard
police officer each year.</TE>

<DH>Politics: Richard Close's proposals for Valley
representation come under fire from another commissioner.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Redistricting Commissioner Richard Close has proposed two
alternatives to plans for City Council districts in the San Fernando
Valley, but they immediately drew concerns for dividing communities
of interest.</LD>
<LD>   Close has opposed a plan to create a new 2nd District that extends
from Sunland-Tujunga to Encino, and proposed an alternative that
would combine North Hollywood and Sunland-Tujunga in the district,
put Encino in the 5th Council District and Studio City and Sherman
Oaks in the 4th District. A second alternative would put part of
Encino in the 5th District.</LD>
<LD>   However, Commissioner Ron Turovsky, who was appointed by 5th
District Councilman Jack Weiss, objected to Close's proposals, saying
one splits the Orthodox Jewish community along Chandler Boulevard
into two districts and the other divides Encino among three
districts.</LD>
<TE>   Under a plan tentatively approved by the full commission, the
Chandler Jewish enclave would remain in the 5th District.</TE>
<TE>   The full commission is scheduled to vote on a plan March 26.</TE>

<LD>A group has withdrawn an ambitious ballot initiative that would have
loosened state restrictions on gambling and ended the monopoly of
Indian tribes in the casino business.</LD>
<LD>   Craig Marlar, a Palm Springs-based spokesman for the group, said
he withdrew the measure last week after backers decided it could have
cost $5 million to $6 million to get the initiative on the ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Under the proposed measure, called the Gaming Control Act, all
currently licensed gambling establishments would have been free to
offer most forms of gambling, including craps, roulette, unlimited
slots and sports wagering.</LD>

<HD>Simi Valley Cultural Center Seeking Big Donor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center needs 10 times its current
endowment to eventually become independent of city subsidies,
according to city and arts officials.</LD>
<LD>   The foundation that supports the 240-seat center's activities
wants to raise a $2-million endowment to sustain operations, but just
$207,000 has been collected so far, said Diane Jones, the city's
director of community services.</LD>
<LD>   "Until you get a really big donation, it's really difficult," said
Mayor Bill Davis, who serves on the city's Arts Commission. "We need
to get that first big donation."</LD>
<TE>   The foundation plans a May 11 dinner and silent auction to honor
Davis for his service to the center. Organizers hope the event will
raise $100,000 for the foundation, said Councilwoman Barbra
Williamson, another arts commissioner.</TE>
<TE>   But if the Simi Valley Cultural Arts Center Foundation ever wants
to reach its endowment goal, Williamson said, it must find grants and
major donors who want to see their names on the facility. "It's not
going to be done by fund-raisers," she said.</TE>
<TE>   To help increase the 7-year-old center's financial independence
and reduce bureaucracy, the City Council on March 4 agreed to change
its financial structure.</TE>
<TE>   Under the previous arrangement, the city paid the salaries of the
center's three full-time employees, and the center reimbursed the
city for that amount through ticket sales, Jones said. The city also
paid for some improvements, including new microphones and a new
lighting board.</TE>
<TE>   Under a new three-year plan, the city will continue to pay the
workers' salaries, without reimbursement. In exchange, the city will
receive 10% of the net ticket sales--estimated at about $15,000 a
year--and the center will be responsible for buying its own
equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "They can't come to us for nickel-and-dime stuff," Williamson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with these changes, the center's struggle for financial
independence from the city is just beginning, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Do I expect the center to be self-sufficient in a year or two
years?" he asked. "No, I don't."</TE>
<TE>   During the next few months, the center plans to focus on
attracting an audience from outlying areas of Ventura County and the
San Fernando Valley, said David Ralphe, general manager of the center
at 3050 Los Angeles Ave. "We have not been able to effectively market
outside this region," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The center will use mailings and cable television advertising to
draw people to the more than 400 events it holds each year. Also,
Simi Valley residents will receive information about the center with
their water bills. Some real estate agents include information about
the center in the welcome packets they provide to new residents.</TE>
<TE>   The need to draw new visitors has been especially important since
the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, Ralphe said. During November,
December and January, the center saw a 34% drop in attendance.
Nevertheless, the center still had its best year ever in 2001, with a
4% increase in attendance from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   To get back on track, the center has targeted March through July
as a time to expand attendance. It is staging four productions--"The
Wiz," "1776," "Oliver!" and "Footloose"--designed to draw new
audiences to the center.</TE>
<TE>   Ralphe said he hopes to post an 8% increase over last year's
attendance of 38,000.</TE>

<HD>District Is Muzzling Free Speech, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH>Courts: South County community colleges' student policy
exercised prior restraint, she says. School decries decision.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF GOTTLIEB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An Orange County community college district's policy prohibiting
students from engaging in certain free-speech activities without
permission from administrators is unconstitutional, a federal judge
ruled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The judge found that South Orange County Community College
District was exercising prior restraint in requiring approval for
distributing leaflets in certain areas, posting information on a
bulletin board, putting up a banner and using a loudspeaker at a
rally.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time U.S. District Judge Audrey Collins found
the district's free-speech policy wanting. On two other occasions,
the college district withdrew versions of the policy before a judge
could rule. Collins suggested Monday that district officials consult
a constitutional law expert when redrafting the policy.</LD>
<TE>   Allan Wilion, the district's attorney, said the college district's
governing board would probably appeal the ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This case is not over," he said. "We disagree with the court's
ruling vociferously."</TE>
<TE>   But Carol Sobel, who represented the three student plaintiffs,
said the district's track record on its free-speech policy indicates
that it "is either getting bad advice [from its lawyers] or else the
advice they want."</TE>
<TE>   Most of those rules requiring permission of a college president or
the district's chancellor were put in place after Raghu Mathur was
appointed president of Irvine Valley College in 1997. His appointment
led to protests from faculty and students.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Mathur was appointed chancellor of the
district, which also includes Saddleback College.</TE>
<TE>   Sobel said the 32-page policy, adopted in May 2000, required
written permission for students to hand out the student paper or to
pass class notes to each other. The policy also allows anyone who
objects to a bulletin board posting to remove it.</TE>
<TE>   Wilion defended the rules, saying, "We're just trying to get a
speech policy passed that's reasonable.... We looked up many speech
policies. It says we have a right to control our property.''</TE>
<TE>   The board passed the policy, 4 to 3. Board President Donald
Wagner, a lawyer, voted against it.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was trouble, so the [judge's] decision makes a lot
of sense," Wagner said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   But Wilion said the judge used the wrong legal standard. "There
are certain legal rulings that are made," he said. "It doesn't mean
they are correct."</TE>
<TE>   For one of the plaintiffs, the ruling had special meaning. Pourya
Khademi, a student at Irvine Valley, saw his parents jailed in Iran
for reading a banned opposition newspaper. "Politics and freedom of
expression have in a most direct and fundamental way shaped my life,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Khademi recalled the night the authorities took away his parents,
who were both politically involved. His mother was a government
social worker; his father was a financial manager for Iran's largest
import-export company.</TE>
<TE>   The family left Iran in 1986 and came to the United States in
1995. Khademi became an American citizen a few weeks before the last
presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   "I came to America from a completely repressive government of
Iran," he said. "My imagination was this was the land of the free.
Little did know I would be confronted with things like this. It's
very emotional and personal for me, a restatement of 1st Amendment
rights.''</TE>

<HD>Calling In Bad Teen Drivers</HD>
<DH>Safety: Toll-free phone lines encourage motorists to snitch
on reckless youths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some teenagers see a driver's license as a permit to hit the open
road with wild abandon, test the limits of the internal combustion
engine and explore the road less traveled. All free of nagging
parental restrictions.</LD>
<LD>   Not so fast, junior.</LD>
<LD>   From San Diego to Green Bay, Wis., concerned parents are trying to
keep young drivers in check with a slew of new services that
encourage other motorists to snitch on teens with dangerous driving
habits.</LD>
<TE>   The services are a variation on those 800 "How's My Driving?"
numbers used to keep tabs on millions of truck drivers nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   At least a dozen toll-free teen tattle lines have popped up
throughout California and the nation in the last few
years--effectively putting Mom and Dad on speed dial. Subscribers to
such services get a bumper sticker to put on their teen's car,
emblazoned with the phone number that other motorists can call.</TE>
<TE>   The services represent just the latest example of the adult world
grasping for tools to rein in teenagers--from the movie rating system
to music warning labels to Internet blocking software.</TE>
<TE>   But such systems have been fraught with trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Porn-filtering software can be quickly disabled. Warning labels on
CDs and tapes are easily ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Even the much-touted V-chip, which allows parents to block
inappropriate television shows, has not lived up to expectations.
Only 17% of the homes with V-chip-equipped TV sets use them,
according to a 2001 survey.</TE>
<TE>   The struggles of the fledgling teen driver lines prove, once
again, that technology has its limits and can help protect youngsters
only when parents play an active role. Services such as 877-DADSEYES,
866-2TELLMOM and 800-4MYTEEN are still hard pressed to attract enough
subscribers to make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Problems Blamed on Teens' Resistance</TE>
<TE>   The parents who founded most of these services blame a lack of
advertising funds for their struggles. But the biggest hurdle remains
the stubborn resistance of rebellious teens, ever-adept at sabotaging
parental restraints.</TE>
<TE>   At least one phone service went out of business because parents
soon realized that teens were removing or covering the bumper
stickers as soon as they pulled away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the founders of the phone-in services believe the time is
ripe for a community of concerned motorists to begin watching over
the nation's young drivers. Or to torture the words of former First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton: It takes a village to tame a teen
driver.</TE>
<TE>   The founders say the idea behind the phone numbers is not to get
teens in trouble but to make them think twice before driving like
maniacs.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest part of the program is the fear that the parents are
going to find out," said Jay Van Zeeland, a part-time paramedic who
launched a teen driving line.</TE>
<TE>   Most teens, of course, hate the idea that every move they make on
the road could be reported to Mom and Dad.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's horrible," McKenzie Miller, 15, of Pasadena said as
she waited at the Pasadena Department of Motor Vehicles office to
take her driver's license test.</TE>
<TE>   Miller insisted that she will drive safely, even if a bumper
sticker does not beg other motorists to snitch on her. Miller also
worried that the bumper sticker would give other kids a reason to
tease her.</TE>
<TE>   Miller's mom, Donna, said she would consider signing on for such a
program, regardless of the ribbing her daughter might take. The
mother of six kids--five of whom drive--said her worried mind would
be put at ease knowing that other motorists were helping monitor her
kids. "I think that teaching kids to drive is a community effort,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Rekerdres, an insurance agent from Dallas, recently signed
up for 866-2TELLMOM for his 16-year-old daughter, calling it "the
best thing I've ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the service, Rekerdres received a bumper sticker
emblazoned with the words "How's My Driving?" It also included an
Internet address, www.tell-my-mom.com, and the toll-free number where
motorists can report on his daughter's driving.</TE>
<TE>   His daughter, Anne, doesn't like the idea, saying it makes her
look "nerdish."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that his daughter doesn't try to subvert his efforts,
Rekerdres said he warned her that she will lose her driving
privileges for a month if she tries to cover up or tear off the
bumper sticker.</TE>
<TE>   Rekerdres calls his daughter a "good kid" who earns top grades.
"But when kids get out in these cars by themselves, they take on a
whole new persona."</TE>
<TE>   Operators of the teen monitoring lines say the phoned-in reports
run the gamut--from compliments for safe driving to complaints about
teenagers smoking marijuana and flashing their bare bottoms out of
speeding cars.</TE>
<TE>   One recent report to 866-2TELLMOM went this way:</TE>
<TE>   "The blond girl was driving and one of the males rolled down the
passenger side window and threw out a Coke bottle. The bottle hit my
hood and then my windshield, putting a chip in it. I had to speed up
to 90 mph in order to get the vehicle's license plate number."</TE>
<TE>   Speeding Car Led to a Line</TE>
<TE>   Most of the toll-free numbers are operated by parents with good
intentions but little money.</TE>
<TE>   Van Zeeland got the idea for 866-2TELLMOM two years ago, shortly
after a teenage driver sped through a red light and narrowly missed
his car at an intersection outside Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   He caught up to the speeding teen, only to be told off "in
language you couldn't print." Van Zeeland had just one thought:
"Someone should tell her parents."</TE>
<TE>   Russell Howard, a police officer with two teenage daughters,
started his teen number in Sunnyvale, Calif., after witnessing the
deadly results of too many teen auto crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Durney, a computer programmer from San Diego, launched his
toll-free number after a traffic accident near Poway killed two
teenagers.</TE>
<TE>   One of his customers was Lori Volano, the mother of two teenagers
in Atlanta. She required her 17-year-old daughter to keep the bumper
sticker on the car for the first six months after she got her
license.</TE>
<TE>   Volano is glad she did it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a great way to have them really think what they are doing
when they are driving," she said.</TE>
<TE>   One motorist reported that Volano's daughter had been driving with
a passenger who wasn't wearing a seat belt. Volano took away her
daughter's driving privileges for a week.</TE>
<TE>   Most services charge $19 to $55 a year to take the reports from
the toll-free lines and relay them to parents. The smaller operations
have a few dozen subscribers. The most popular have up to 2,000
subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the four or five companies that operate the toll-free
monitoring numbers for commercial vehicles combine to monitor more
than 2 million commercial vehicles, according to industry officials.</TE>
<TE>   Renee Kauffman, a mother from Oakhurst, Calif., launched
877-LETMEKNOW in 1998 just after her teen son began to drive. But her
service attracted only 35 customers and quickly folded.</TE>
<TE>   "Parents loved it, but teens refused to leave the stickers on the
cars," Kauffman said.</TE>
<TE>   She started the service because teens in her community were
driving around town "with a cowboy mentality," Kauffman said. That
has not changed since her service went bust. "Now I just pray a lot,"
she said, "and hope for the best."</TE>
<TE>   There is good reason for parents to pray a lot.</TE>
<TE>   Auto accidents are the leading cause of death for young people
between the ages of 15 and 20. In 2000, 3,594 drivers in that age
group were killed and an additional 348,000 were injured in car
crashes nationwide, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.</TE>
<TE>   State Targets Teen Drivers</TE>
<TE>   Teens are more likely to be involved in crashes than any other age
group because they have little driving experience but tend to take
more risks behind the wheel than older drivers, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   And teens are more often involved in fatal crashes when other
passengers--usually other teens--are in the car, according to
accident statistics.</TE>
<TE>   For these and other reasons, 31 states, including California, have
adopted graduated driver's license programs that impose tough
restrictions on new drivers under the age of 18.</TE>
<TE>   In California, new drivers under 18 must hold their learner's
permit for at least six months before getting a provisional license.
During that time, they must spend at least 50 hours behind the wheel
practicing with a parent or guardian.</TE>
<TE>   Also, for the first year, teenagers with provisional licenses
cannot drive between midnight and 5 a.m. unless a licensed driver 25
years or older is riding along.</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by the Auto Club of Southern California showed that
the number of teenage auto deaths has dropped significantly since the
driving restrictions took effect in California in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Safe driving advocates, such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
applaud the efforts of the parents who operate the toll-free teen
driving numbers. But experts say there are no studies to show the
phone services save lives.</TE>
<TE>   Truck companies that use the "How's My Driving?" monitoring
services get a break on insurance rates.</TE>
<TE>   But teen drivers who are monitored by the new teen tattle lines do
not get the same discount.</TE>
<TE>   Auto insurance firms including 21st Century say they can't offer
teens the discounts until studies show the services work.</TE>
<TE>   The founders of the teen phone lines hope that will change soon,
giving parents an added monetary incentive to sign up.</TE>
<TE>   But it may take more than a break on insurance to make the
services succeed.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask Llewellyn P. Haden Jr., president of FleetSafe, the
Atlanta company that developed the first toll-free "How's My
Driving?" number to monitor trucks and commercial fleets.</TE>
<TE>   Haden said his firm has twice tried to branch into the teen driver
market.</TE>
<TE>   But it failed both times, he said, due to heavy resistance from
teens and an unwillingness from parents to lay down the law.</TE>
<TE>   "It does not work, for the basic reason that teenagers are
teenagers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They will put masking tape over the bumper sticker," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The service only works, he said, if parents impose tough
discipline on defiant teens.</TE>
<TE>   Truck drivers who try to cover the "How's My Driving?" bumper
stickers can lose their job, Haden said.</TE>
<TE>   Many trucking companies base the job evaluations of truckers on
the reports that come from the toll-free numbers, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Sarkar, a professor at the California Institute of
Transportation Safety at San Diego State University, agrees that the
key to the success of the teen phone lines is parental discipline.</TE>
<TE>   A bumper sticker by itself won't turn a menacing road warrior into
a straight arrow, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the parents' involvement that matters most," Sarkar said.
"If the parents do their part, then it might work."</TE>

<HD>Davis' Choice for VA Post Is Opposed</HD>
<DH>Politics: State senators say services at the Department of
Veterans Affairs have suffered under the leadership of Bruce Thiesen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Claiming that services of the Department of Veterans Affairs have
deteriorated, leaders in the state Senate are pressuring Gov. Gray
Davis to withdraw his appointment of Bruce Thiesen as the agency's
secretary.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter to Davis, Senate Leader John L. Burton (D-San
Francisco) said he believes there are not enough votes in the Senate
to confirm Thiesen.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Davis said Monday that the Democratic governor
intends to stand by his appointee, despite appeals by Burton and 10
other Democrats and Republicans.</LD>
<TE>   "The governor believes that Secretary Thiesen has made a lot of
progress and he is sticking with him," said Steven Maviglio.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabinet-level post had been vacant for 18 months in November
when Davis appointed Thiesen to succeed Tomas Alvarado, who resigned
when the Senate Rules Committee refused to confirm him.</TE>
<TE>   During Alvarado's tenure, an elderly World War II veteran choked
to death on his lunch at the Barstow Veterans Home. The death, which
department officials said was caused by a heart attack, prompted
criticism of care at the facility and eventually led the state
Department of Health Services to shut it down for 19 months.</TE>
<TE>   In a Nov. 30 letter that became public Monday, Burton told Davis
that there was "significant" opposition in the Senate to Thiesen's
confirmation and that the department's highly publicized troubles had
"persisted and even worsened" under Thiesen's tenure as the temporary
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   "I recommend you withdraw his name from consideration," said
Burton.</TE>
<TE>   In a second letter handed to Davis last week, 10 other senators
concurred in Burton's call for abandonment of the nomination. They
too charged that services to veterans in some cases had eroded under
Thiesen.</TE>

<HD>Eddie Watkins, 82; Notorious Bank Robber</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eddie Owens "Fast Eddie" Watkins, once viewed as "perhaps the most
notorious criminal in Cleveland's history" for his innate ability to
rob banks, has died. He was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Watkins, who during a 43-year career in crime claimed to have
knocked over 55 banks coast to coast and netted more than
$1.5million, died Wednesday at a Cleveland hospital. The cause of
death was not announced, but Watkins was known to have suffered from
heart and lung disease.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Pittsburgh, Watkins left his mother's home at the age
of 13 and rode the rails to California to join his father, who was
making a living as a grifter.</LD>
<TE>   At 16, he robbed his first bank, taking $2,400 from a heist in
Cleveland. He was eventually caught and served time for that crime
and several smaller jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Getting caught and going to jail, then escaping or making parole,
would become the rhythm of his outlaw life.</TE>
<TE>   His wife once said of him: "Most men ogle girls, Eddie ogles
banks."</TE>
<TE>   He made the FBI's most-wanted list in 1965 after he robbed five
banks in the Cleveland area and another in Columbus.</TE>
<TE>   A year later he traveled west, taking $20,000 from a California
Savings and Loan branch in Los Angeles. He returned to the Southland
in 1980 to knock off a Citizens Savings and Loan. The amount of cash
from that illegal withdrawal was not disclosed in the local press.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' exploits were well reported in the Cleveland newspapers,
which described him as one of the most notorious criminals in the
city's long history. He gave interviews in which he acknowledged that
he found bank robbery a rewarding exercise. He also confided that he
believed in banks and was an eager depositor.</TE>
<TE>   "I trust banks with my money--they're insured," he once said.
"It's the best place in the world to put your money."</TE>
<TE>   While he may have put his money in banks, his desire for a lavish
lifestyle ensured that it didn't stay there long.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to be a big shot," Watkins once told a reporter for the
Cleveland Plain Dealer. "I wanted to buy fancy cars. I wanted to
impress the women. I wanted to have a pocket full of money when I
walked into that casino in Las Vegas."</TE>
<TE>   He earned his nickname from his ability to get in and out of banks
quickly without physically harming anyone in the various
institutions. The one time he didn't live up to his "Fast Eddie"
moniker was in Cleveland in 1975, when he ended up taking nine
hostages and holding off police for 21 hours. After letting the
hostages go unharmed, he surrendered and was sent to federal prison
in Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later he escaped and was back to bank robbing. He was
captured months later and ended up spending the next 15 years in
federal prison.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins took up painting while in prison. His canvases were mostly
nostalgic landscapes revolving around the quest for freedom and a
simpler life. He said he favored using acrylic paints because they
would dry faster in his cell.</TE>
<TE>   But he could never seem to forget his first love--banks.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably an ego thing," he told a reporter, "but I never
really thought about doing anything else.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody has got to have something to be proud of."</TE>

<HD>Drivers Complain of a Glaring Problem</HD>
<DH>New headlights and those on high-riding SUVs are lighting a
fire under motorists to complain. Solutions may not be easy to find.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Given the level of apathy in this country, it is noteworthy when a
handful of regular Joes (or Janes) take the time to put pen to paper
to complain to someone in a position of authority.</LD>
<LD>   But when several hundred people do it, it suggests that a glaring
problem is at hand.</LD>
<LD>   That brings us to the flurry of letters and e-mails that have
inundated government officials and others over the problem of
nighttime glare from car headlights.</LD>
<TE>   After receiving a handful of informal complaints, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration made a formal request last year
for public comment. Word of the agency's request was spread by
newspapers, radio and television.</TE>
<TE>   The response: More than 1,700 letters and e-mails in five
months--one of the largest public responses to an NHTSA request in
years. The headlight glare problem attracted more complaints than
such topics as air bags and window tinting.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing in recent memory has attracted as many comments," said
Elly Martin, a spokeswoman for the agency. "This has been an
outpouring of individuals.''</TE>
<TE>   The letters and e-mails have primarily come in two categories:
complaints about ubiquitous sport utility vehicles, many of which
have headlights mounted so high that they shine directly into the
bleary eyes of the drivers of sedans, and complaints about new
high-intensity, blue-tinged headlights installed on many luxury cars.</TE>
<TE>   The problem with SUV lights may be the easiest to address.</TE>
<TE>   Most SUVs ride high for extra clearance, even if the closest most
urban drivers get to an off-road experience is when they drive onto
their lawns to wash the car.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether an SUV or truck is approaching or driving behind my car,
it is difficult to see and quite disabling," Deborah J. Callis of San
Francisco said in her letter.</TE>
<TE>   Automobile manufacturers and vehicle safety experts have already
suggested that lawmakers lower the mounting height of headlights from
the current maximum of 54 inches off the ground. That height limit
has been in place since 1968.</TE>
<TE>   The Alliance of Automotive Manufacturers has recommended lowering
it to 47 inches. The Society of Automotive Engineers has suggested
bring it down even farther, to about 39 inches.</TE>
<TE>   That may solve the problem with new SUVs, but it would do nothing
to address the millions of older behemoths roaming the streets. In
2000, SUVs, light trucks and vans represented 50% of all new vehicle
sales. That's 8 million big-wheeled, high-riding machines using their
intrusive beams on the nation's roads.</TE>
<TE>   The second category of complaints--glare from the extra bright,
bluish headlamps--may be more difficult to solve.</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturers of such lights--called high-intensity discharge
lamps--claim the headlights are up to three times brighter than
typical halogen headlamps, use less energy and will last nearly the
entire life of the car.</TE>
<TE>   Auto makers say such lights are the headlamps of the future. They
are already installed on newer Lexus, Cadillac, GMC truck and
Volkswagen Beetle models, among others. Several companies also sell
retrofit kits to install the lights on older cars.</TE>
<TE>   Those headlights operate in much the same way as mercury vapor and
sodium vapor lights used as street lamps and outdoor lighting for
stadiums, except that xenon gas is often used to eliminate a slow
start-up.</TE>
<TE>   The NHTSA has yet to find data suggesting that the bluish-white
lights are so distracting that they cause serious accidents. But many
motorists have complained that the lights are annoying, distracting
and even blinding.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Eggers, a retired engineer from San Jose, complained to the
NHTSA, saying the high-intensity lights "make it very difficult to
see traffic ahead."</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, he said: "You have to look the other way and try
to avoid them."</TE>
<TE>   Eggers, who drives an old Jeep Cherokee, believes most motorists
get the new headlamps for the prestige of having the latest fancy
accessory. "I think it's all just a matter of selling jazziness," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Steven Koeppel of Palm Springs agrees. He wrote to the NHTSA
saying: "They're just another status symbol, and they are definitely
road hazards."</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Howell of Richwood, N.J., claimed in a letter that the
glare of the high-intensity discharge lights has forced her to swerve
off the road. "I am literally blinded by the glare of these new lamps
during the day and at night," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Car makers blame such complaints on cheap knockoffs installed by
amateur mechanics.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Strassburger, vice president of vehicle safety for the
Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, said the factory-installed
headlights meet federal standards and have yet to be linked to any
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   Strassburger, whose own car is equipped with high-intensity
lights, said the new headlamps improve visibility for drivers.
Several university studies support Strassburger's claim. But even
Strassburger concedes that the new headlights can be annoying to
oncoming drivers.</TE>
<TE>   He suggests that some complaints have come from drivers who stare
at the headlights because of the bluish color.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that they are different is making people take notice,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Strassburger's theory has precedent. When halogen headlights were
introduced in 1979, hundreds of motorists complained to the media and
the government about their intensity.</TE>
<TE>   One possible solution to the glare problem is to adopt a European
approach: allowing the headlamps only on vehicles with automatic
aiming devices and headlight wipers. The aiming systems keep the beam
of light focused on the road--not on the faces of oncoming drivers.
The wipers help eliminate dirty lenses, which disperse the intense
light.</TE>
<TE>   The NHTSA is reviewing the letters and e-mails and analyzing all
relevant studies on the problem before deciding whether to adopt new
standards.</TE>
<TE>   But there are signs that the agency has seen the light.</TE>
<TE>   Administrator Jeffrey Runge said of the outpouring of complaints:
"We expect that our request for comments will elicit useful
information that will lead to better lights with less glare."</TE>

<HD>Ridge Goes Over the Rainbow</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington is a syndicated columnist. E-mail:
arianna @ariannaonline.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let me get this straight: While Tom Ridge and his Office of Homeland
Security were spending months looking at swatches before unveiling
their colorful terror alerts, their partners in safety over at the
Immigration and Naturalization Service were routinely approving
student visas for Mohamed Atta and Marwan Al-Shehhi?</LD>
<LD>   And through it all, Ridge has continued to rebuff congressional
entreaties to testify.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got to find a way to break the impasse," said Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle on Sunday, while raising the option that
he may subpoena Ridge. "He's got to work with us. There is just too
much at stake."</LD>
<TE>   Like getting our priorities straight.</TE>
<TE>   I've got to believe Congress would agree that deciding if today
feels like a "yellow" or a "blue" day isn't quite as important as
figuring out a system that prevents the rubber-stamping of visas for
mass murderers.</TE>
<TE>   And how exactly are we supposed to react to Ridge's readiness
rainbow anyway? At least when a smog alert goes into effect, we know
to stay indoors.</TE>
<TE>   Since his much-ballyhooed appointment in the wake of Sept. 11,
Ridge has kept a lower profile than Mullah Omar--a strategy that has
raised doubts about his effectiveness.</TE>
<TE>   And now comes the Color Wheel of Terror, the result, according to
Ridge, of "countless conversations with first responders, local and
state officials, business leaders and concerned citizens"--and, one
would imagine, the people in charge of R&amp;D at Crayola.</TE>
<TE>   I thought we were fighting a war, not running a policy
kaffeeklatsch. After all, Winston Churchill's famous rubber stamp
said, "Action this day," not, "Countless conversations this day."</TE>
<TE>   So why would Ridge pick such a laughably lame initiative--the
war-on-terror equivalent of school uniforms--as his coming-out party?</TE>
<TE>   Is it because his color scheme was the only idea on which he could
get a consensus from the disparate agencies he is supposed to
coordinate?</TE>
<TE>   Upon assuming his post, Ridge stressed the need for avoiding
Washington's bureaucratic turf wars. But he has found himself
hamstrung by precisely these kinds of petty power plays.</TE>
<TE>   When he tried to take on problems at the nation's airports, he
butted heads with the Transportation Department.</TE>
<TE>   When he tried to bring order to the administration's chaotic
response to the anthrax attacks, he found himself jockeying for
control with Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   And when he proposed changing our nation's border security
strategy, both Customs and the Justice Department cried foul.</TE>
<TE>   Even a no-brainer like the need to consolidate the responsibility
for protecting the nation's food supply is being resisted by
officials in the two relevant agencies--the Food and Drug
Administration and the Agriculture Department. As a result, a
mind-boggling system persists where, for example, the FDA oversees
the safety of cheese pizza and the Agriculture Department the safety
of pepperoni pizza.</TE>
<TE>   And all Ridge can say is, "We have to see whether the system that
has developed over the past two decades is the one we need in the
future."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a hint, Mr. Ridge: It's not.</TE>
<TE>   Ridge should have seen this coming from the beginning, when the
president decided against making him a Cabinet officer with command
authority over the many different departments that deal with homeland
security. Here's a question: Isn't Homeland Security at least as
important as Veterans Affairs or Agriculture?</TE>
<TE>   So instead of leading a comprehensive national strategy to
safeguard our country, Ridge is in danger of becoming the Willard
Scott of terror, standing in front of a multihued map, filling us in
on the latest forecast: "Today will bring a severe risk of death and
destruction to parts of the South, with partly scattered mayhem in
the Great Lakes region over the weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Ridge cannot effectively operate solely on his perceived
chumminess with the president. He needs real authority and a real
department.</TE>
<TE>   Without them, he's destined to spend another six months cutting up
paper dolls and consulting with Martha Stewart about the hot new
shades for 2003 instead of doing everything in his power to make
America safer.</TE>
<TE>   Color me homeland insecure. It's enough to make us all see red.</TE>

<HD>Should Teacher Legislation Go to the Head of the Class?</HD>
<DH>Yes, Educators Need More Power in Shaping the Curriculum</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WAYNE JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>Wayne Johnson is president of the California Teachers
Assn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine the following scenario: You take your child to the doctor
with an ailment. She diagnoses the condition and recommends a
treatment.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of providing that care, the doctor is forced to
proceed with a completely different treatment imposed by a bureaucrat
who has never seen your child, a bureaucrat who has little or no
knowledge of the case and has never practiced medicine. The
bureaucrat then warns the doctor that she will be held fully
accountable for your child's recovery.</LD>
<LD>   No, this isn't an HMO horror story. It's the situation California
students face on a daily basis in classrooms throughout the state.</LD>
<TE>   Teachers, the trained professionals who work with students every
day, are often powerless when it comes to the selection of the
materials and methods they are required to use to help their students
learn.</TE>
<TE>   For too long, key education policies have been made without any
meaningful participation by teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Using a cookie-cutter approach, politicians, bureaucrats and
school administrators have made curriculum and other important
classroom decisions without consulting classroom teachers and have
then expected those teachers and, more important, their students to
live with those decisions.</TE>
<TE>   This is bad policy.</TE>
<TE>   It's bad for teachers, and it's especially bad for kids.</TE>
<TE>   For this reason, the California Teachers Assn. has sponsored
Assembly Bill 2160, legislation that would expand the current
collective bargaining law to give teachers the right to negotiate the
procedures by which local decisions are made about curriculum,
textbooks, teacher training and other classroom matters.</TE>
<TE>   We believe that teachers and parents, not administrative
bureaucrats, know what is best for our kids.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers are tired of being among the last consulted and the first
criticized when it comes to student progress. It's no wonder so many
young teachers leave the profession, citing a lack of control and
decision-making ability as a major frustration.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, veteran teachers sigh in dismay as the latest
educational fad is adopted and imposed without their valuable input.</TE>
<TE>   California teachers, parents and voters agree that it's time for a
change. The CTA recently conducted a poll that shows more than 75% of
parents believe teachers should be able to negotiate with districts
on issues such as providing additional teacher training, selecting
textbooks and instructional materials, deciding how to improve
low-performing schools and creating programs for parental
involvement.</TE>
<TE>   By a 3-1 margin, parents recognize that teachers are the state's
most valuable resource for enhancing student learning.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn. is proud to be behind many of the
reforms that are producing lasting results for the schools in our
state.</TE>
<TE>   Six years ago, the CTA sponsored legislation lowering class size
in kindergarten through third grade, which has provided one of the
most dramatic improvements to student learning in our state's
history.</TE>
<TE>   The CTA also led efforts in 2000 to lower the threshold for
passing local school bonds, which has made it easier for communities
to build much-needed new schools.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the CTA sponsored legislation that provided additional
support for our schools of greatest need. This was a first step in
leveling the playing field between our lowest- and highest-performing
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly Bill 2160 is another important component in our efforts
to improve California schools.</TE>
<TE>   It will not relinquish any control currently held by local school
boards.</TE>
<TE>   It will not overturn any state or federal law.</TE>
<TE>   It will simply give teachers and parents a participating voice
into how local education decisions are made.</TE>

<HD>Should Teacher Legislation Go to the Head of the Class?</HD>
<DH>No, It's Just a Power Grab by the Union to Seize Control of
the Schools</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL HAUCK and ROY ROMER</AU>
<BD>Bill Hauck is president of the California Business
Roundtable and chairman of California Business for Education
Excellence. Roy Romer is superintendent of the Los Angeles Unified
School District.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While much remains to be done, significant strides have been made in
a decade of commitment to improving California's public education.
Test scores are up, class sizes are downand per pupil spending is
inching closer to the national average.</LD>
<LD>   Public opinion polls consistently rank education as California's
top priority, and taxpayers have shown they are willing to invest in
our public schools. Over the past 15 months, voters in 109 school
districts approved more than $11.3 billion in bonding authority for
school construction.</LD>
<LD>   If public school reform is going to succeed, those who are
responsible for producing results must be held accountable, and
parents, students and policymakers must have meaningful data to
evaluate academic performance.</LD>
<TE>   That is why California has adopted new standards and testing
programs to measure student progress, reward success and identify
problems that must be addressed.</TE>
<TE>   However, a new proposal backed by the California Teachers Assn.,
or CTA, would essentially eradicate every step we have made in
reforming our public schools.</TE>
<TE>   The measure, AB 2160, would transfer control of our children's
education from parents and elected school boards to union
negotiators. Decisions about what our schools teach, the books they
use, the standards and objectives that are established, new academic
programs that should be implemented, the degree to which parents are
involved and even the maintenance of school facilities would be
subject to negotiation during the collective bargaining process.</TE>
<TE>   School boards are elected to set local school policy. They hold
public hearings to give parents and members of the community an
opportunity to air divergent views. School boards are responsible for
ensuring that the community's expectations and our children's
educational needs are met.</TE>
<TE>   The CTA plan would render school boards, and the parents they
represent, powerless. And unlike school board meetings, decisions
about how our schools are run would be made behind closed doors, with
no public input or scrutiny by the news media.</TE>
<TE>   Giving union negotiators the power to leverage our children's
education against union demands for better wages, benefits and
working conditions is simply wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The greater the number of issues to be resolved at the collective
bargaining table, the greater the drain of resources from
instructional programs. With virtually every school issue subject to
negotiation--from the number of parent-teacher conferences to the
details of the mathematics curriculum--collective bargaining would be
a yearlong process, diverting the attention of administrators and
occupying the time of teachers who should be in the classroom.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers should play an influential role in determining what is
taught in the classroom--and they do. Seven of the 17 members of the
Curriculum Development Commission are teachers, as were 13 of the 21
commissioners on the Academic Standards Commission. Their expertise
and insights are highly respected, and teachers should always be
consulted when education policy is determined.</TE>
<TE>   This measure is not about giving teachers more input. It's about a
powerful special interest group trying to seize control of the public
school system at the expense of schoolchildren.</TE>

<HD>Kids Get Left in the Lurch When the 'Values' Cops Arrive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD>Robert Scheer writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Homosexuals, no matter how exemplary in training and emotional
stability, continue to be the object of suspicion when it comes to
parenthood, particularly in the state of Florida where there is an
outright ban on adoption of children by gays.</LD>
<LD>   Thanks to the courage of talk show host and gay adoptive parent
Rosie O'Donnell--and a Web site she publicized, www.lethim
stay.com--many Americans now know that a boy named Bert may be ripped
out of the only home he has ever known. The administration of Gov.
Jeb Bush insists on putting Bert up for adoption knowing that his
foster parents would not be eligible under Florida law. How perverse
of the so-called family values movement of the Christian right that
continues to push for anti-gay adoption bans throughout the nation to
mock the love that Christ bestowed on all, and to deny children in
cases like this one the only good, loving family available to them.</LD>
<LD>   Bert entered the lives of Steve Lofton and Roger Croteau,
pediatric nurses, as a 9-week-old infant, born HIV-positive and with
drugs in his blood. Bert was part of an epidemic of sick, abandoned
children. He is now a 10-year-old who does well in school and excels
in soccer and swimming.</LD>
<TE>   Lofton and Croteau were on the front lines of the medical crisis
by dint of their training and personal dedication. "Almost no
couples--gay, married or otherwise--wanted the HIV-positive babies
who had been orphaned or abandoned at Jackson Memorial Hospital in
Miami in the late 1980s and 1990s," reported the Portland Oregonian.
"There were so many 'boarder babies' that Croteau frequently cared
for sick infants whose bassinets were in the [hospital's] hallway."</TE>
<TE>   The state urged the couple, who now live in Oregon, to become
foster parents to some of these unwanted, sick babies, and in the
years since, Bert and five other children have found a nurturing home
with the two men. Such a commitment is not to be accepted lightly;
one of the AIDS-afflicted children, a 6-year-old girl named Ginger,
died of the disease, a heart-wrenching event for Lofton, Croteau and
Ginger's foster siblings.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the family moved from Florida to Oregon to be closer
to Croteau's elderly parents, but Bert was still under the authority
of the state of Florida. And there's the rub: The boy no longer tests
positive for HIV, so Florida's bureaucracy now deems him a suitable
candidate for adoption--as long as the parents aren't gay. Lofton and
Croteau want to adopt Bert, but the Christian right's campaign of
hate more than two decades ago embedded a toxic sentence in Florida's
legal code that prevents it: "No person eligible to adopt under this
statute may adopt if that person is a homosexual."</TE>
<TE>   That sentence stands as the purest manifestation of prejudice, for
it means that a homosexual's behavior, no matter how exemplary, is by
definition of law irrelevant to judging the individual's competency
to care for others. Citing sexual orientation to the exclusion of all
other evidence of parenting skills is as irrelevant as judging a
caregiver by the color of his or her eyes, and yet this stupid law
has become a model that other states have threatened to follow.</TE>
<TE>   The American Psychological Assn. and the American Academy of
Pediatrics have published reports that show no adverse correlation
between sexual orientation and the quality of parenting, a finding
endorsed by myriad studies.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe there's a real debate to be had over whether gay
people can be good parents," Rosie O'Donnell said. "The only debate
is whether to put bias before children's future."</TE>
<TE>   Last week in Texas, a woman was sentenced to life in prison for
killing her five young children. She happened to be heterosexual.
Meanwhile, five kids orphaned, abandoned or neglected by their
biological parents are being cared for and nurtured by two men who
happen to be gay. In both cases, sexual orientation is irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't about Steve and myself and gay rights," Croteau told
the Oregonian. "This is about children's rights. There are all these
children who need a safe home, who need parents who care, who need a
childhood. The gay rights issue gets in the way of that."</TE>
<TE>   Florida's discriminatory adoption law reflects the blinding
intolerance of those who would deny the humanity and decency of the
Croteaus, Loftons and O'Donnells of this world, at the expense of
innocents.</TE>

<LD>Re "Yates Draws Life Sentence," March 17: I am incensed at the cold,
tearless, finger-pointing of the husband of convicted capital
murderer, Andrea Yates. Russell Yates blamed the mental health
system, judge, prosecutors, Texas law, the press and his wife for the
drowning deaths of their children while conducting "an impromptu
sidewalk news conference" after the sentencing last week.</LD>
<LD>   Knowingly impregnating his wife for the fifth time against medical
advice, housing his family at times in a converted bus and asserting
his strong will on a passive, obedient wife, Rusty Yates has
distanced himself from blame and now bemoans his lack of
companionship and impudently states the two will not have more
children together. At the very least, Rusty Yates should be indicted
as a co-conspirator in the deaths of the five children.</LD>

<TE>   Russell Yates wants to have more children? He belongs in prison
with Andrea. He blames the doctors for Andrea's condition. However,
Russell was the one who said that she wasn't well, but did he do
anything about it, did he try and help her? No, he went off on his
merry way to work like everything was fine. Guilty.</TE>

<TE>   Recently I wrote political cartoonist Michael Ramirez to say that
I greatly admired his visual artistry, despite his partisanship if
not outright falsehoods. But his Andrea Yates cartoon of March 16
passes the limit of my tolerance. He shows a woman with a National
Organization for Women T-shirt holding a "We support Yates" sign and
saying, "Just think of it as late, late . . . late term abortions."</TE>
<TE>   It is pure stupidity, if not slander, to equate concerns about
severe mental illness with the abortion issue in this sad murder
case. Has he no shame?</TE>

<TE>   I see that Ramirez has graduated from the Rush Limbaugh School of
Fearful Misogyny. I'm sure The Times is very proud of his degree in
Misinterpretation, with a minor in Hysterical Misdirection. His
thesis cartoon, which tars a pioneering organization like NOW and its
just defense of a woman's right to choose with the ink of a multiple
murderer, must have made his professors on the radical right very
proud indeed.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I cannot believe the poor judgment exercised in allowing
publication of such a hate-filled, outrageously offensive "cartoon."
The implication that any member of NOW would condone the acts of an
obviously unstable person and connect it to abortion rights is so
disgusting I felt that I had fallen into a cesspit when I read it.</TE>
<TE>   My immediate reaction was to throw the paper on the floor. I then
called The Times and canceled my subscription and took a shower in an
effort to wash away the filth that I felt had been dumped on me and
all supporters of women's rights.</TE>
<TE>   Please don't quote me the 1st Amendment as an excuse. I can't
imagine your printing Hitler's diatribes against the Jews, but
Ramirez's hatred for women is just as obvious a form of fascism.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In a 72-hour period, your editorial staff approved Ramirez
cartoons depicting members of the Democratic Party as the Ku Klux
Klan (March 14) and members of NOW as child murderers. By hiring
Ramirez and giving his paranoid, right-wing vitriol free rein, The
Times has allied itself not with free speech but with hate speech.
What a shameful commentary on a formerly respectable newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Sloane</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ramirez's cartoon was disgusting, malicious, mean-spirited, just
plain wrong and certainly not helpful. To take advantage of one of
the saddest news events within recent memory for his own political
purposes was despicable.</TE>

<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am quite disappointed in The Times for allowing the ignorance of
Ramirez to make light of such a horrible tragedy. In addition to his
lack of understanding of the importance of a woman's right to choose
(which is a completely separate issue), he also fails to see the
seriousness of mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Even the most loving of mothers can suffer postpartum depression
and psychosis. Andrea Yates is no more responsible for the symptoms
of her disease than a cancer sufferer is for his. The idea that
mental illness is somehow within the control of its victims is a myth
that continues to pervade our society.</TE>

<LD>Sad to say, but the experience of the teachers at Pacific Palisades
Charter High School in failing to obtain support for an attendance
policy (March 12-13) is the rule in the LAUSD, rather than the
exception. At my school, we found it impossible to maintain an even
more lenient standard (students could miss up to 15 days per
semester) in the face of constant bureaucratic assault and
administrative appeasement.</LD>
<LD>   While the vast majority of parents and teachers supported the
policy, implementation of it was constantly challenged (and
ultimately thwarted) by district bureaucrats who, it was made clear,
were tired of hearing complaints from the parents of the kids who
were forced to retake classes.</LD>
<LD>   The ultimate demise of our minimal standard was the perfect ending
to an LAUSD saga: We were told that the reorganization of the
district into mini-districts included shutting down the office
downtown that was responsible for handling waivers from local school
sites--and, in the process of moving, all such waivers were lost.
Therefore, we were told that continuing our policy would be illegal
and a violation of student rights.</LD>

You praise the Accelerated School in South-Central L.A. for not

excessive absences or tardies.</TE>
<TE>   Where will these students wind up? At traditional schools, whose
teachers you will call incompetent in your next editorial, when these
same chronically absent students contribute to the lowering of these
schools' standardized test scores.</TE>

<LD>I would like to commend Rhea Perlman and Ally Walker for sharing
their concerns for the children of L.A. County. However, I would like
to correct the inaccurate perceptions outlined in their March 12
commentary, "Remind the Foster Care System of Its Duties." As of the
end of January, the Department of Children and Family Services had
33,263 children in out-of-home placement. Nearly half, or 15,026
children, were placed with relatives and 1,592 were in adoptive homes
awaiting the finalization papers to be approved.</LD>
<LD>   A visitation waiver is used only when the child is already in a
permanent or adoptive placement. In order words, the child has
already been removed from the abusive situation and is well on his or
her way to starting a new life. As of March 8, the department had 74
visitation waivers in effect.</LD>
<TE>   To obtain the visitation waiver, the social worker must conduct a
face-to-face visit with the child and caregiver in question, compile
a quality-of-life assessment, evaluate the child's physical
environment, obtain personal statements from the child and secure the
caregiver's and child's agreement to the waiver. This visitation
waiver packet is then reviewed by the supervising children's social
worker and, if approved, goes to a review panel. This very specific
and arduous process is unique to L.A. County. The state does allow
for visitation waivers, which other counties routinely use.</TE>
<TE>   It is my hope, with the facts more clearly defined, that we can
join together to help the most vulnerable children in our community.</TE>

<LD>So do the senators who opposed the stiffer fuel standards (March 14)
feel it is better to drill for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge than to suggest that maybe we could drive something smaller
than a Ford Excursion or Chevy Tahoe? Doesn't it bother them that our
country far exceeds the rest of the globe in energy consumption? I do
not consider trying to save gasoline and our environment "an assault
on an American freedom." Every time I try to pull out of a parking
space next to one of these huge gas guzzlers, I have to hope no car
is coming, as it is nearly impossible to see around them. I would not
miss fewer of them on the road.</LD>

foreign oil is a worthy goal.</LD>

<LD>Re "Voice for Israel's Enemy," March 15: Marjorie Miller's story of
Israeli journalist Amira Hass taking the PLO side was interesting
indeed. Juxtaposed with "Violence Unabated Amid U.S. Envoy's Mideast
Visit" on the same page, it points up U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni's
difficulties. An Israeli who becomes a mouthpiece for the Arabs is
published, discussed, condemned or acclaimed, but free. An Arab who
is even suspected of collaborating with Israel is lynched, his body
dragged through the streets and strung up on the nearest lamppost. As
for a dissenting opinion in the Arab press, forget it. Good luck,
Gen. Zinni.</LD>

<TE>   It is hardly news that Israel's press reports the Arab point of
view. This has been going on for years. The real news would be an
Arab reporter who has the sheer guts to report the Israeli
perspective. Who in the Arab press represents Israel's situation in a
fair and realistic manner for its readership? Where in the Arab press
are the reports of the toil and hardship created on Israeli civilians
by the countless acts of terrorism perpetrated against them on a
daily basis? Where is the depiction of a tiny country of 6 million
under siege for over 50 years by much larger, hostile Arab neighbors?
Who speaks for the Israeli point of view in the Arab world?
Unfortunately, a tremendous silence resounds in this regard, and that
makes all the difference.</TE>

<TE>   The only crystal-clear fact emerging from the continuing violence

want peace quite as much as they want to win. It has been so for
thousands of years, and the U.S. government is as arrogant as it is
naive in believing that any sort of intervention on our part will
change that dynamic.</TE>
<TE>   We are involved in a horrendous war in Afghanistan because of our
ongoing support--including many billions of dollars annually--for
Israel. I will dare to ask the question: What has Israel done for us

our actions in Afghanistan and even--soon--Iraq, America should be
very supportive of Israel and its fight against Palestinian
terrorists. The Israelis are fighting the same fight we are. As the
Easter holiday approaches, I encourage all Christians to pray for all
soldiers fighting terrorists, including the Israelis. President Bush,
you said that in America's fight against terrorists, you're either
with us or against us. The Israelis are definitely with us and
deserve America's full support.</TE>

<DH>Asia: Activists who aided N. Korean defectors aim to replicate
events leading to fall of Berlin Wall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>The 25 North Korean defectors who stormed into the Spanish Embassy
in Beijing last week in a bid for freedom arrived safely in South Korea
on Monday, and political activists, emboldened by the success, promised
more dramatic operations in China and elsewhere in behalf of defectors.</LD>
<LD>   The activists who staged the Beijing operation said they are trying to
replicate the historic events of 1989 that led to the collapse of the
Berlin Wall.</LD>
<LD>   "We will create a flood of refugees to embassies, and it will lead to
the collapse of North Korea," said Norbert Vollertsen, a 44-year-old
German physician, who spent 18 months as an aid worker in Pyongyang, the
North Korean capital, and who now agitates against the Communist regime.
"This is the way it happened in 1989, in Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
First there were a few dozen defectors, then hundreds and then
thousands."</LD>
<TE>   The storming of the Spanish Embassy on Thursday was a deliberate
restaging of an incident in September 1989 in the Czech capital, Prague,
when more than 1,100 East German defectors scaled the fence of the West
German Embassy, attaining asylum and demanding safe passage to the West.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 100,000 to 400,000 North Koreans are living clandestinely
in China, having escaped their famine-ridden homeland. But China,
honoring a repatriation treaty with North Korea, routinely hunts them
down and sends them back to North Korea, where they face imprisonment and
sometimes torture or execution. In addition, the South Korean Embassy in
Beijing is restricted by China from directly helping defectors.</TE>
<TE>   After a journey from China that took them through Manila to the South
Korean capital, the North Korean defectors stepped off a plane Monday at
Seoul's Inchon airport for a brief but emotional welcoming ceremony. They
waved, accepted flowers and expressed thanks to their South Korean hosts.
They had no luggage but clutched duty-free airport shopping bags with
gifts from their airline.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to live as a free man in a free country," declared Lee Song,
43, a factory worker, as his pigtailed 7-year-old daughter hid from the
cameras behind her mother's legs.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Hyang, a 16-year-old orphan, said she will study in South Korea so
she can help needy North Korean children when she is an adult.</TE>
<TE>   The defectors, 14 adults and 11 children, were whisked off for medical
treatment and questioning by South Korean intelligence officials before
being sent to Hanawon, an acclimation center for North Korean refugees 30
miles south of Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, the South Korean government announced a $5-million
expansion of Hanawon. And South Korean Unification Minister Jeong Se
Hyun, the government's point man on North Korean relations, issued a
strong statement of support for defectors, saying, "It is the basic
policy of the government to accept and accommodate all North Korean
defectors from a humanitarian viewpoint."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea views the increasing number of defectors with some
trepidation. Last year, 583 North Koreans came to the South, nearly
double the number in 2000. With the latest arrivals Monday, the figure so
far this year has reached 141--53 in the last week alone. Defectors now
get about $28,000 each to resettle, but those funds will be badly
stretched if there turns out to be an exodus. The defections also could
jeopardize efforts by South Korean President Kim Dae Jung to salvage his
"sunshine policy" of engagement with the North.</TE>
<TE>Efforts to Topple Regime</TE>
<TE>   Refugee advocates, Christian missionaries and conservative political
activists have been working quietly with the defectors in China for
years, but they have decided that the time is now ripe to burst upon the
international stage with more daring acts. Their goal is not merely to
help defectors but to trigger a series of events that they believe could
topple the North Korean government, the last bastion of undiluted
communism.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope more escapes will be possible as we saw when East Germans
flocked into West Germany as the wall fell," said Kenkichi Nakahira, head
of the Tokyo-based Life Funds for North Korean Refugees, one of the
groups involved in the planning.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the activists had originally intended to use the German
Embassy in a deliberate effort to evoke memories of Prague and of similar
embassy sit-ins in the Hungarian capital, Budapest. But they switched to
the Spanish Embassy at the last minute because of its less stringent
security.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's incident was more a carefully planned covert operation
than a spontaneous occurrence. The group of about 30 activists--Japanese,
Koreans, Americans and Europeans, most of whom did not want to be
identified--spent months preparing for it. They cased embassies and
surreptitiously photographed the diplomatic missions' security
precautions. They carefully selected and rehearsed the defectors.</TE>
<TE>   The six families and three individuals were picked for their
intelligence and their resolve. Most had already been arrested once
before by Chinese police and sent back to North Korea, so they were
willing this time to risk their lives. They carried poison with them and
threatened to use it if they were captured.</TE>
<TE>   "They were the bravest, the ones who suffered some very bad
experiences in North Korea," said Vollertsen, the German doctor. "Most of
them had been living now in China one or two years, so they were well-fed
and knew their way around. We couldn't do this if we picked up fresh
refugees from the North Korean border."</TE>
<TE>   At 9:30 a.m. Thursday, the defectors arrived in front of the Spanish
Embassy in a rented bus, wearing red baseball caps reading "Beijing" to
make it look as if they were on a package tour. Conveniently, the metal
gates to the embassy compound were wide open, as was the front door.</TE>
<TE>   As a CNN crew that had been tipped off rolled its cameras, the
defectors rushed past the single Chinese policeman outside and dashed
into the embassy.</TE>
<TE>   "It was surprisingly easy. The doors were open, and they were the
doors to freedom," said Moon Kook Hwan, a South Korean businessman who
was watching from behind a tree. Moon and several others had also been
involved in an incident last summer in which a family of seven North
Koreans barged into the Beijing branch of the Office of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees, demanding safe passage to South Korea. The
family is now living near Seoul.</TE>
<TE>'Right to Their Freedom'</TE>
<TE>   Moon said he was encouraged that in this operation, the South Korean
and Chinese governments, with the help of the U.N. refugee agency and the
Philippines, were able to patch together a face-saving deal so quickly to
evacuate the refugees and bring them to Seoul.</TE>
<TE>   "This makes me very optimistic. I think the time has come that China,
South Korea and North Korea are realizing that these defectors have the
right to their freedom and the right to seek food," Moon said.</TE>
<TE>   A high-ranking Chinese official was quoted Monday by South Korea's
Yonhap news agency as saying that last week's incident should not be
viewed as "a precedent for the future." There were also reports that
Chinese police in provinces near the North Korean border had launched a
search for North Koreans at churches, restaurants, construction sites and
rooming houses where they might be living or working illegally.</TE>
<TE>   China is in a difficult position, juggling its obligations to its
increasingly isolated North Korean ally and its desire to burnish its
record on human rights. The activists are betting that the latter
prevails.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Monday, there had been no comment from Pyongyang regarding
the latest defection drama.</TE>
<TE>   Vollertsen's greatest hope is that news of the successful operation
will filter back to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, or at least to
some of the elite there who have access to foreign television.</TE>
<TE>Activists Seek U.S. Aid</TE>
<TE>   The activists are also seeking support among U.S. conservatives for
refugee camps in Mongolia and elsewhere in Asia to help North Korean
defectors. They hope that President Bush's characterization of North
Korea as part of an "axis of evil" can be parlayed into U.S. support for
their plans.</TE>
<TE>   Among North Korea watchers here, there are conflicting opinions about
whether the recent increase in defectors could be the harbinger of
something bigger to come.</TE>
<TE>   "The conventional wisdom is that the North Korean regime is not going
to collapse for quite a while. I'm not sure," said Kim Kyung Won, a
former South Korean ambassador to the United States. "North Korea is a
failed state. Changes in China are going to have a corrosive impact on
North Korea."</TE>
<TE>   Moon Chung In, a professor at Yonsei University in Seoul, believes
that China will prevent any increase in defections from North Korea from
developing along the lines of what happened in Eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a very strong bond between Beijing and Pyongyang. I don't
think China wants the internal collapse of North Korea. . . . They want
to keep the status quo," Moon said. "South Koreans, for the most part,
also don't want the collapse of North Korea. They learned from the
experience of German unification the enormous costs that could be
incurred. Except for some ultraconservatives, the majority of Koreans
want incremental changes, not what we call the 'Big Bang.' "</TE>

<HD>The Davis Enigma: Success Comes Without Popularity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three years in office and an easy primary win, Gov. Gray
Davis faces a strange problem: More California voters than ever actively
dislike him.</LD>
<LD>   When asked why, in a Times poll last month, voters most often blamed
his handling of the power crisis. Beyond performance-related gripes, many
said in follow-up interviews that he seems soulless and ambitious, a
tactician who sees all issues through the lens of political advance.</LD>
<LD>   "He's as cold as ice," said John Cohen, a Los Angeles Democrat who
voted for Davis in 1998, but is undecided about whether to do so again in
November.</LD>
<TE>   The pragmatic Davis has never pretended to offer much in the way of
warm fuzzies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, heading into the long middle section of his reelection bid, he
faces a decision. Should he try to woo the disaffected? Or should he use
his resources to target his Republican opponent, Bill Simon Jr.,
accepting voters' reluctant embrace? Put another way, must Davis be liked
to win?</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have to make Gray Davis into the sweetheart of the rodeo,"
said Garry South, Davis' campaign manager. "Gray Davis is not going to be
judged against himself. He will be judged against his opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Other California governors--notably Davis' Republican predecessor,
Pete Wilson--have surmounted low job-approval ratings and low charisma
quotients to win second terms. Like Wilson, Davis has taken the brunt of
voter frustration related to a national economic recession.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, however, has less time to engineer a turnaround. Longtime state
political strategists doubt he can entirely escape the shadow of his
administration's defining events.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, it can't be just 'the other guy is this, the other guy
is that,' " said Gale Kaufman, a Democratic campaign consultant. "He
doesn't want the election to be about him and, as governor, that's pretty
hard to do."</TE>
<TE>   In Simon, Davis faces a political novice whose campaign-trail oratory
remains awkward. But Simon's advisors say his very lack of polish,
combined with his smiling, self-effacing demeanor, could help position
him as a nice-guy alternative.</TE>
<TE>   "Even people who don't agree with Simon see him as someone who
listens. He's not a know-it-all," said Sal Russo, Simon's campaign
manager. "If voters liked Davis, they'd be more forgiving of mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Davis enters the general-election race with some unquestionable
advantages: In addition to the name familiarity that comes with
incumbency, he's a relentless fund-raiser and already has millions of
dollars in the bank. And as a moderate Democrat in a Democratic state, he
is in sync with the public's views on a wide range of issues.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, though, the energy crisis served as the dividing line in
Davis' relationship with California voters.</TE>
<TE>Before Energy Crisis, Kudos</TE>
<TE>   Though he never inspired fervent loyalty, little more than a year ago
Davis' work won kudos from 56% of registered voters and complaints from
just 32%, according to Times polls.</TE>
<TE>   The downside shifted dramatically as the energy crisis intensified.
The portion of voters with unfavorable impressions of Davis jumped from
27% in January 2001 to 41% five months later.</TE>
<TE>   It stood at 45% early last month, when almost a third of Democratic
respondents to a Times poll said they looked upon Davis unfavorably, as
did almost two in five independents. Of those who said they disliked
Davis, 42% cited the power crunch as the No. 1 reason, criticizing his
approach and his results.</TE>
<TE>   "He ignored everything for a year, then he did everything in secret,"
said Dvorah Colker, a Los Angeles Democrat who voted for Davis in 1998
but said she will not do so again. "He's a loner, a close-to-the-vest
guy. Maybe if there had been a more open process the state would have
gotten a better deal."</TE>
<TE>   At this point, roughly the same number of voters disapprove of Davis'
job performance as approve--47% in each case, anemic numbers for an
incumbent.</TE>
<TE>   Though his troubles started with energy, a bevy of other issues--from
education to the burgeoning budget deficit and the program cuts it may
trigger--have emerged to contribute to the low-grade hum of voter
discontent, Times polls show.</TE>
<TE>   For example, though Davis made public schools a top priority,
expanding their budget far faster than his predecessors, education is the
second-most common source of complaint among voters who view him
negatively.</TE>
<TE>   South blamed an impatient electorate and an inattentive media for not
recognizing Davis' accomplishments, promising the campaign would
repackage his record through a barrage of compare-and-contrast issue ads.</TE>
<TE>   "If people don't like the governor's record, wait until they hear Bill
Simon's solutions," he said. "It's a slam dunk."</TE>
<TE>   Several consultants slammed this approach, calling it a thinly veiled
retread of Davis' 1998 gubernatorial run against Dan Lungren. The
governor needs to do a better job of communicating his successes, they
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last month's state Democratic convention featured a video touting
Davis' work on health care, domestic-partner benefits and schools, "and
even I didn't remember half that stuff," said one consultant. "It's as if
he has a pretty decent record, but they've decided that's a harder sell
tactically than banging on Simon."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, even disgruntled voters acknowledged that Davis'
negative approach is likely to prove effective. Georgiana Coray, a San
Diego Democrat who vented her displeasure over the energy crisis and
budget deficit by not voting for Davis in the primary, said she sees
little alternative to him in the general election.</TE>
<TE>   "Simon disagrees with everything I believe in," she said. "He's way,
way too conservative."</TE>
<TE>   The biggest stumbling block to selling Davis on his positive points
may be Davis himself.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never going to make voters like him as a human being," said Dan
Schnur, a Republican consultant who was Wilson's communications director.
"You're not going to see ads with him running on the beach with his dog.
If Davis has a dog, it's because a focus group told him to."</TE>
<TE>   Often, voters can't quite pinpoint the source of their antipathy for
Davis.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing I can come up with to describe him is wishy-washy,"
Coray said.</TE>
<TE>Every Day a Bad Hair Day</TE>
<TE>   Others mention his plume of hair, his practiced political polish, his
charmless campaign slogan ("Effectiveness you can count on"). "It sounds
like a Metamucil ad," a Democratic consultant said.</TE>
<TE>   The same traits Democrats say they admired in Bill Clinton--tireless
fund-raising, for example--irritate them in Davis. "Why am I offended by
Gray raising money when I wasn't by Clinton? I wish I could tell you,"
said Colker, the Los Angeles voter who is not planning to support Davis
again.</TE>
<TE>   South insists that such concerns will crumble away come November and,
indeed, even Colker said that if she were satisfied with Davis'
performance, "he wouldn't have to charm me."</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman agreed that Davis' lukewarm appeal to voters need not spell
defeat for him, but warned that it could have a devastating effect on
other Democrats if it translates into low turnout.</TE>
<TE>   "It will kill everyone underneath him," she said.</TE>

<HD>Israel Pulls Its Troops Back</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Forces leave Palestinian areas as Cheney meets with
Sharon. Six people die in overnight clashes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>Israel pulled its troops out of the West Bank city of Bethlehem and
other Palestinian-controlled areas early today after Vice President Dick
Cheney and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon met in an effort to
achieve a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. officials did not expect a cease-fire to be declared before
Cheney's departure from Israel today. But the quickened pace of meetings
between U.S. envoy Anthony C. Zinni and Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators, coupled with Cheney's visit and the possibility that the
vice president would meet today with Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat, created a sense of momentum here. But White House
officials said this morning that the meeting with Arafat would not take
place.</LD>
<LD>   Palestinians said Israeli tanks began withdrawing from the heart of
Bethlehem shortly before midnight, and Palestinian security forces began
taking up positions there. The pullout was complete before dawn, an
Israeli army spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike previous pullouts, Palestinians did not flood streets to
celebrate the withdrawal, nor did gunmen fire on departing troops. In an
announcement issued this morning, the Israeli army said it had pulled out
of all Palestinian-controlled areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip it
reoccupied two weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   Five Palestinians and one Israeli officer were killed in overnight
clashes in Gaza and the Jordan Valley. In Gaza, two Palestinians who the
army said were trying to plant an explosive near a Jewish settlement were
shot dead and a third Palestinian was killed by a tank shell in his home,
Palestinians said.</TE>
<TE>   And in an early morning gun battle near a military training base in
the northern Jordan Valley, an Israeli lieutenant was killed and two
Palestinian gunmen also died.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli officials said they agreed during a U.S.-mediated security
meeting with the Palestinians on Monday to pull out of Bethlehem and
other Palestinian-controlled areas. The withdrawal would pave the way for
cease-fire negotiations that both sides said could be concluded by week's
end. Palestinian officials had insisted they would not participate in
cease-fire talks until an Israeli pullout was complete.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni described the talks--the highest-level meeting between Israeli
and Palestinian security officials in weeks--as "professional, serious
and constructive." He said he expected to preside over another meeting of
security chiefs Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops moved into Bethlehem on Thursday in an effort to
prevent gunmen from firing on nearby Gilo, a Jewish neighborhood built on
disputed territory. Tanks rolled close to Manger Square on Sunday, and
troops killed one gunman in a firefight.</TE>
<TE>   But neither that incursion--nor a suicide bombing and a shooting
attack Sunday--derailed Zinni's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The envoy's mission got a boost Monday as Cheney arrived in Tel Aviv
at midday from Kuwait. Zinni, a retired Marine Corps general, was at the
foot of the airplane steps to greet the vice president. The two rode
together in Cheney's limousine during the nearly one-hour trip to
Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The vice president is nearing the end of an 11-day, 12-country journey
designed to focus on the war on terrorism. But at every stop, the
violence in the Middle East has forced its way onto the agenda, and
nowhere more so than here.</TE>
<TE>   With Sharon at his side at an arrival ceremony outside the prime
minister's office, Cheney called on Arafat to honor his commitment "to
renounce once and for all the use of violence as a political weapon and
to exert a 100% effort to stamp out terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   He said he would speak with Sharon "in that same spirit . . . about
the steps that Israel can take to alleviate the devastating economic
hardship being experienced by innocent Palestinian men, women and
children."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon made a concerted effort to link the United States and Israel as
two victims of terrorism, expressing sympathy for the U.S. losses in the
Sept. 11 attacks while telling Cheney, "In recent months, we have been in
the midst of a brutal wave of terrorist attacks aimed at innocent people,
civilians at coffee shops and discotheques, youth, babies, entire
families that fall prey and are targeted by the Palestinian terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Defending his ironfisted response to Palestinian attacks, the prime
minister said he would make "painful compromise" to achieve peace. But,
he said, "we cannot make any compromise when it comes to the security of
our citizens and their right to live without the threat of terrorism and
violence."</TE>
<TE>   Zinni left the region Jan. 3 when the bloodshed showed no sign of
abating. Afterward, the violence intensified, with Palestinians launching
a string of attacks on Israelis and Israel stepping up its military
response until finally, two weeks ago, it launched its largest operation
in the West Bank and Gaza since it captured the areas in 1967.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed at the upsurge in violence, President Bush dispatched Zinni to
Jerusalem. He arrived Thursday in a new effort to turn around a nearly
18-month conflict that has created fundamental mistrust between Israeli
and Palestinian leaders and a willingness among each side's public to
believe the worst about the other.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni's goal is to restore enough security to allow resumption of
long-term peace talks and bring the Israelis and Palestinians into a
process of economic and security cooperation that leads to a break in the
violence.</TE>
<TE>   At their most optimistic, U.S. officials believe there are enough
elements being considered by both sides--and a shared horror at the level
of violence--that they could achieve a first-step security plan within
several days.</TE>
<TE>   Monday night, Palestinians fired two Kassam-2 rockets into southern
Israel, where they fell into an empty field. In addition, the Israeli
army said it foiled an attack on a northern Israeli town when two
Palestinians carrying a bag of explosives were arrested by police.</TE>
<TE>   Another Palestinian, who the army said was armed, was shot dead in the
Gaza Strip on a road leading to a Jewish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni's immediate focus was the withdrawal of Israeli forces from
three sections in the Bethlehem area of the West Bank and two in the Gaza
Strip. The Palestinians want Israel to withdraw from any areas it has
occupied since the uprising began in late September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I really hope that there will be a real cease-fire based upon a
political scheme that guarantees implementation of all agreements,"
Mohammed Madani, governor of Bethlehem, said as he awaited Israel's
pullout Monday night. Israel, Madani said, "can make the cease-fire hold
by lifting the closure [that keeps Palestinians from their jobs in
Israel] and ending the assassination policy [against Palestinian
militants]." Such moves, he said, "will enable both sides to restore part
of the confidence, which will enable both sides to engage in serious
talks."</TE>

<HD>FBI Agents Blamed for Delayed Files on McVeigh</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Incompetence, not computer problems cited by the agency,
is called the reason for execution delay.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Justice Department's inspector general has concluded that FBI
incompetence--and not computer problems, as the bureau maintains--caused
the mishandling of documents that led to the delay in Timothy J.
McVeigh's execution, officials close to the case said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The inspector general's report, which is to be released today,
recommends that two high-level FBI supervisors be disciplined and that
the bureau--which in the last several years has been hit hard by internal
problems--improve its management control over the various field offices
around the country.</LD>
<LD>   The lengthy investigation found that field agents and FBI headquarters
were slow in forwarding the thousands of pages of new material to
prosecutors and McVeigh's defense team last year, the sources said.</LD>
<TE>   Even officials at FBI headquarters took two days before alerting
prosecutors and defense lawyers that, even as the execution date
approached, new documents had been discovered. The investigation found no
deliberate attempt to conceal the documents from the defense.</TE>
<TE>   The report is yet another blow to the FBI and will likely lead to
changes in how the bureau handles high-profile criminal cases such as the
Oklahoma City bombing. The furor over the McVeigh documents prompted the
agency to seek more than $140 million for computer upgrades, an increase
of more than 40% over the previous year. Some members of Congress,
however, said stronger measures were necessary to fix an agency they
characterized as "out of control."</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the culture of the whole FBI, you sometimes see an
expression of arrogance," said one official who has reviewed the report
and said he was surprised to learn that the FBI is still claiming
computer problems caused the mix-up.</TE>
<TE>   "Indeed," he said, "the facts here are pretty arrogant."</TE>
<TE>   McVeigh was arrested, tried and convicted in the April 1995 bombing of
the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. In 1997, he was sentenced to
death.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2001, he suddenly dropped all legal appeals and convinced a
federal judge that he was ready to die. At that time, the federal Bureau
of Prisons set his execution by lethal injection for May 16.</TE>
<TE>   But just six days before he was to die, the FBI revealed that it had
found bureau files that had not been disclosed to the defense.
Ultimately, more than 4,000 pages of files were found that had never been
turned over. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft postponed the execution until June
11.</TE>
<TE>   The courts later ruled that the material was not relevant to McVeigh's
guilt or innocence, although U.S. District Judge Richard P. Matsch in
Denver was angry over the FBI debacle.</TE>
<TE>   "I would expect there would be consequences upon finding . . . an
undisciplined organization or organization that is not adequately
controlled, or that can't keep track of its information," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The aim of the inspector general's probe was to answer three central
questions: Was the delay due to computer problems? Did the FBI act
quickly when it realized the problem? And did the FBI hide evidence that
would have helped McVeigh win a new trial?</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, the inspector general determined that computers
were not at fault. "It was an agent problem and not a computer problem,"
one source said. "Agents made mistakes about what documents they had and
what documents they had to cough up. Not everybody in the field even knew
what to do."</TE>
<TE>   The investigation also found that the bureau did not act swiftly in
turning over the material, even though FBI officials realized that
McVeigh's death was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "Two supervisors learned in January of 2001 but sat on the news for
five months," said one official. "They failed to manage the review of the
documents and failed to notify FBI headquarters or the Justice Department
or defense attorneys what was going on.</TE>
<TE>   "They never took responsibility or were held accountable. But two of
them got promotions anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said the report adds that FBI headquarters also took two
extra days before alerting McVeigh's defense lawyers--"because of a
communications problems with the prosecution."</TE>
<TE>   On the third question, the sources said, the inspector general did not
find that the FBI hid documents from lawyers in the case out of concern
that the material might help McVeigh--who at that time was considered the
worst terrorist in U.S. history.</TE>
<TE>   But the sources added that the report faults FBI headquarters for
allowing field offices to become individual fiefdoms over the last
half-dozen years and not exerting more control over those field offices.</TE>

<HD>Nature of Threat in Georgia Gorge a Matter of Dispute</HD>
<DH>Caucasus: As U.S. prepares to train republic's forces in
anti-terror tactics, some analysts question motives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DUISI, Georgia
</DL>
<LD>A band of Arab fighters in the mountains near this country's
Pankisi Gorge have caused sufficient alarm that the United States is
preparing to spend $64 million in part to help the Georgian military get
rid of them.</LD>
<LD>   Philip Remler, a senior U.S. diplomat in Georgia, said in February
that dozens of fighters from Afghanistan, including Al Qaeda members, had
fled to the Caucasus in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   But authorities in this former Soviet republic, both local and
national, dispute that contention. They say that although the Pankisi
region has more than its share of criminal activity, there are probably
only a dozen or so renegade Arabs here.</LD>
<TE>   A handful of American military advisors are already in Georgia in
advance of the U.S. program, which will train and equip four
anti-terrorist battalions with 300 to 400 men each to bring the Pankisi
Gorge under control. About 200 Americans will be involved, with a new
contingent arriving this week. Exercises in the six-month training
program are planned for summer.</TE>
<TE>   According to Georgian security officials, however, the immediate
threat the young men in the mountains pose is not to the U.S. or Georgia,
but to Russia. They say the Arabs are waiting for the snow to melt so
they can cross the Caucasus Mountains to the north and join separatists
in the Russian republic of Chechnya in their fight against Kremlin
control.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgian security officials, upon whom the U.S. relies for most of
its intelligence about the gorge, do not know the men's nationalities,
what route they took to get to Georgia, whether they ever fought in
Afghanistan or whether they have ties to Osama bin Laden's terrorist
network.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts in Georgia play down any serious or immediate terrorist
threat emanating from the Pankisi Gorge. They see the U.S. program as
designed to avert possible future threats, to prop up the weak and
corrupt Georgian state in a region of U.S. oil interests and to
strengthen America's foothold in the Caucasus.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, U.S. officials in Washington acknowledged that while they
are concerned about the presence of anti-American Islamic fighters in
Georgia, the principal goal of the new aid program is to stabilize the
region by helping Georgia exert more control over its territory.</TE>
<TE>   They said the Georgian government has been unable to properly police
its borders, and argued that regional stability is threatened if the
Russian government needs to chase terrorists into Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   One State Department official said that the number of Arab fighters in
Georgia was unclear and that estimates ranged from a dozen to as many as
200.</TE>
<TE>   To local security officials such as Imzar Machalikashvili, 27, of this
village in the Pankisi Gorge, reports of Al Qaeda terrorists hiding out
in the area always seemed inflated.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no evidence that there are dozens of Al Qaeda fighters here.
At most, there are 10 to 15 Arabs, and there's no information that they
are connected with Al Qaeda," Machalikashvili said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know whose interests are being served, but the threat has
clearly been exaggerated, and the entire situation has been blown out of
all proportion," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Machalikashvili's estimate of the number of fighters was echoed this
month by the minister of state security, the defense minister, the
interior minister and a security officer with the Chechen separatists who
is familiar with the Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>Struggling to Be Rid of Russian Interference</TE>
<TE>   Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Georgia, a frail former Soviet
republic, has struggled to get out from under often belligerent Russian
interference. But despite close U.S. links and about $900 million in
American aid over the last five years, the country has stumbled because
of colossal bribe taking and other malfeasance in the government, the
police and the military.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts and Western advisors now suspect that most of the aid was
stolen, and some critics even suggest that, if not for the U.S.
anti-terror campaign, the West might have given up on Georgia in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   But Georgia's strategic position in the Transcaucasus--the transit
corridor the United States would like to use to ship oil from the Caspian
Sea--means that was never very likely.</TE>
<TE>   The Pankisi Gorge, a tiny shard of territory in northeastern Georgia,
about 8 miles long and 4 miles wide, has been associated with crime and
smuggling for centuries. But after the Soviet collapse and a subsequent
decline in the power of regional authorities, the situation--involving
mainly locals in the business of kidnapping, drug running and arms
smuggling--worsened.</TE>
<TE>   There are more than 100 local criminals hiding in the gorge, according
to security officials, who say there are also several hundred separatist
fighters or former fighters who crossed the rugged mountains from
Chechnya to escape Russia's brutal military campaign there.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Georgia's crime-fighting and security agencies stationed
five Interior Ministry checkpoints in the gorge and arrested some local
crime figures in a bid to reassert their authority. But it still takes
only a $100 bribe to pass through any of the checkpoints, according to
Georgian journalists who have done so.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgian explanation of the Pankisi problem is a quaint one, based
on an ancient Caucasus tradition of extravagant and selfless hospitality.
A looming statue above the capital, Tbilisi, embodies the same idea: that
it is your duty to play host to and defend even an enemy who seeks
shelter in your home.</TE>
<TE>   When thousands of refugees poured into Georgia from Chechnya in 1999,
fighters came with them, some fed up with the conflict, others seeking a
respite. Meanwhile, Arabs and other combatants who wanted to join the
Chechen separatists traveled through Georgia, while others supplied
weapons to the Chechens via the gorge. The local villagers, mainly
Kists--ethnic Chechens in Georgia with close ties to Chechnya--asked no
questions.</TE>
<TE>   "They [the Chechens] came here and lead proper lives. No one asks if
they fight or not," said Akhmed Margoshvili, 65, of Duisi. He had seen a
few Arabs in the village a week earlier, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few of them. I just saw the faces of a very few. I
don't know where they came from or why. You don't see them often," he
said. "The Arabs don't violate anything. If they have problems with
somebody else, it's not our business. We don't want to know about it."</TE>
<TE>   David Lordkipanidze, head of the Akhmeta regional security service,
which covers the gorge, said his men have been in contact with Chechen
fighters who supported the Arabs, bringing them food.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the Arabs arrived in September, before any U.S. military
action against Afghanistan, and that there is no evidence the men had
been fighting there.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, some of the Arabs come into Duisi, he said, but they
don't communicate much with the local people.</TE>
<TE>   "Our sources tell us what they are planning and what they're going to
do next. They want to get out of here as soon as the pass [through the
mountains into Chechnya] opens," Lordkipanidze said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're afraid because they hear all these reports about Georgia and
America launching an anti-terrorist operation."</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere in the gorge is quiet but tense. Young men wearing
camouflage clothing and military caps lounge around a recently built
mosque. Others in military camouflage cruise by in cars. But try to
approach any of these men on foot and they dart down side alleys, turn
and walk briskly away, disappear into buildings or halt their cars a
distance away.</TE>
<TE>   Lordkipanidze claims that the Duisi mosque was funded by Saudi Arabian
money and that the men near the mosque are Chechen Wahhabis--members of a
fundamentalist Islamic movement brought here from Chechnya.
Traditionally, people in Chechnya and the Pankisi Gorge have adhered to
the softer Sufi tradition of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Lordkipanidze, who lives in Duisi, estimates that 80% of the Wahhabis
in the region are involved in crime.</TE>
<TE>   But the terms under which a foreign journalist could visit the gorge
this month included traveling with Lordkipanidze's subordinate,
Machalikashvili, who prevented any movement toward the mosque or the
young men near it, claiming that here Christians cannot walk by or
approach a mosque. That assertion was contradicted by other locals.</TE>
<TE>   Malika Sadykova, 50, a refugee in Duisi from the Chechen capital,
Grozny, said the Wahhabis have tried to lure young men to fight a holy
war.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe they're trying to use the word 'Wahhabism' as a smoke
screen for criminal activity. The Wahhabis distort Islam. They carry
around videotapes that they use to spread the word [of Wahhabism] among
the local population," she said. "They're teaching our young boys that
they should die in this holy war. Wahhabism just destroys our youth."</TE>
<TE>Concern About Group's Emergence</TE>
<TE>   While officials downplay any terrorist threat, Irakly Alasania, first
deputy minister of state security in Georgia, said Georgian authorities
have been deeply concerned about the emergence of the Wahhabi movement in
the gorge.</TE>
<TE>   He said there has been no evidence that the Arabs in the gorge, whose
number he put at "no more than a dozen," have Al Qaeda links. But he said
it is possible that some have connections with a separatist commander in
Chechnya named Khattab, a Wahhabi who might have Al Qaeda ties. It is
known that Khattab sent some fighters to Afghanistan to fight with the
Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Alasania said Georgian officials prevented a Jordanian and a Saudi
from entering the country early last year after receiving information
that the two men were planning terrorist acts against Russia. Officials
also detained five Afghans several weeks ago, though those men insisted
that they were simple refugees, not moujahedeen. The men, who carried no
identification, were sent to neighboring Azerbaijan, from which they had
entered Georgia. There have been no other such cases, Alasania said.</TE>
<TE>   A Chechen security official in Tbilisi representing the separatist
Chechen leader, Aslan Maskhadov, said he had met two Arab fighters, aged
22 and 23, in the city two weeks earlier. They had intended to go to
Chechnya to fight but were afraid because of reports that the U.S. was
planning to assist Georgia in clearing the Pankisi Gorge.</TE>
<TE>   "They had visas. Later, they went back to the United Arab Emirates.
They said, 'We are not terrorists, and all this pressure has just taken
away our will to fight,' " said the official, who did not wish to be
identified.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just young guys. The people who are helping us have no links
to Bin Laden or Al Qaeda," he insisted.</TE>
<TE>   He said that several years ago, there were about 250 Arab fighters in
Chechnya but that most were killed in the war there.</TE>
<TE>   Tbilisi-based military analyst Kakha Katsitadze said there is neither
a major terrorist threat nor a significant Islamic fundamentalist
presence in the gorge. But if no action is taken to control the area, he
said, threats could emerge in the future.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is not that there are some fighters sitting in the
Pankisi Gorge," he said. "The problem is that there are not effective
state structures to deal with these problems."</TE>

<HD>Workers Born to Wander</HD>
<DH>Craftsmen in Germany follow a centuries-old tradition by going on
the road to find jobs. With unemployment high, their numbers are rising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEU FAHRLAND, Germany
</DL>
<LD>With a fresh paycheck in his pocket and his few worldly goods
bundled up with his tools, roofer Rene Schroeder is hitting the road
again, halfway through his journey along a path blazed during the Middle
Ages.</LD>
<LD>   Unable to find permanent employment, Schroeder has joined a society of
wandering craftsmen bound by strict codes and traditions that oblige him
to remain itinerant for at least three years and one day.</LD>
<LD>   The ranks of the wandergesellen--skilled carpenters, cabinetmakers and
bricklayers--have grown in these times of high joblessness and a
nationwide construction slowdown after the frantic first decade of
reunification, when much of eastern Germany had to be rebuilt.</LD>
<TE>   Now, with more than 4 million Germans out of work, artisans such as
Schroeder are selling their skills on the street as did legions of their
forebears.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I wanted a regular job after trade school, but there aren't
any to be had now in the eastern states," says Schroeder, 20, who left
his parents, brothers and girlfriend behind in Magdeburg, capital of the
impoverished Saxony-Anhalt state. "But it's been rewarding being on the
road. Wanderers bring fresh air to a construction project, and we don't
feel the stress of everyday life that builds up when you have a home and
a family."</TE>
<TE>   The wandergesellen, who now number about 500, usually travel alone,
meeting up with fellow wanderers from more than 30 guilds covering crafts
such as bricklaying and roofing. Settled veterans of the walz, as the
period of itinerancy is known, administer the private society of
journeymen and set the rules.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for their willingness to travel, the wanderers get access
to short-term jobs and gain experience working for a respected
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in uniforms designed for 19th century shipwrights, wanderers in
this suburb of Potsdam seem to have arrived via time travel. There are no
cell phones chirping in their pockets or laptop computers in their
crudely bound satchels; only the tools, such as hammers and chisels, that
have changed little through the ages. They are craftsmen who do not use
power tools.</TE>
<TE>   A few bows toward modernity have been made in recent years as the
number of lone artisans has grown along with Germany's new economic
troubles. Qualified women are admitted to the guilds, and odd jobs for
the journeymen can be called in to a computerized administrative center
in Cologne. But women are still excluded from the network of hostels
maintained by former wanderers for those still on the road, frustrating
female guild members' efforts to participate in the walz by making them
pay for their accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   Many graduates of the walz run their own construction companies or
workshops, providing a word-of-mouth network about short-term jobs that
might interest the young peregrinators.</TE>
<TE>Road Passed Through Russia, Japan, Canada</TE>
<TE>   "It's easier to get work as a wanderer because general contractors
want access to our skills but not necessarily to keep us on their
permanent payroll," says Guido Brauer. The 33-year-old carpenter recently
completed four years on the road that took him around the world, through
Russia, Japan and Canada. He's now working for a construction firm in
Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   The first year of the walz must be spent in German-speaking territory,
which includes Austria, Switzerland and the Alsace-Lorraine region of
eastern France. But after the indoctrination year, the wanderers are
allowed, even encouraged, to range as wide in the world as their earnings
can take them.</TE>
<TE>   Herbert Wiegman and Olav Schmidt worked as traveling journeymen in the
1980s and now own a construction firm based in Berlin. They hire young
wanderers for jobs requiring special skills, such as the restoration of
buildings under historical protection. Four itinerants were busy recently
replacing the solid wood beams of a 100-year-old apartment house in
eastern Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "When you want quality, you go to these guys," says Wiegman. "They are
clearly diligent in their work, or they wouldn't be putting up with this
lifestyle. It's not for everyone. A lot of guys prefer to stay home with
their moms until a regular job surfaces, or they have girlfriends who
want to get married. But those who stick with it can be counted on to do
top-class work."</TE>
<TE>France Also Has Wandering Workers</TE>
<TE>   Wandergesellen must be single, free of debt and, in the case of men,
already through their compulsory military service, unless they have
arranged a deferment, says Guenter Grimm, the "old master" for the
Berlin-Potsdam veterans group, one of dozens around the country that
administer the program.</TE>
<TE>   Justus Matthias, a Berlin architect, spent four years in the 1980s
with Les Compagnons du Devoir, the French equivalent of the German
wanderers. The far more structured and less tradition-bound society
employs about 2,500 craftsmen from Europe in union-supervised
internships. Matthias' stint with the French cabinetmakers guild took him
to Ireland and Greece before he returned to his native country to study
architecture and start a family.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a lot less to do with tourism than with furthering your
education and experience and social skills," says Matthias. "What you
come away with after being on the road and learning all these different
ways of approaching construction is a sense of confidence. I learned to
do a lot of things--put up a fence, build stairs, make cabinets and
furniture--so I know I will always be able to take care of myself and my
family."</TE>
<TE>   The wandergesellen are more skilled and often command better wages
than homebound unionized workers, Matthias says. But he insists that
there is neither resentment nor rivalry between the two groups vying for
work in these hard times.</TE>
<TE>   "We play at entirely different levels," Matthias says. "Trade unions
as representatives of employees focus on the material benefits accorded
their members, whereas these are not important at all for craftsmen who
have chosen the road over creature comforts."</TE>
<TE>   Those on the walz are forbidden by the centuries-old code of conduct
to come within 50 kilometers--31 miles--of their homes, except in cases
of death or serious illness in the immediate family. They also must wear
corduroy bell-bottoms and vests, along with heavy felt hats that vary to
identify them as members of a particular guild. White shirts, chains of
metal badges from previous places of work and a single earring complete
the signature garb, a uniform with minor variations for each skill but
collectively known as the kluft. The outfit costs a stiff $600.</TE>
<TE>   When traveling between work sites, wanderers carry two items: a
walking stick and a belted satchel, which wraps a bedroll, tools, clothes
and toiletries in a cloth bearing the guild's symbols.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to decide for yourself how much other stuff you want to
carry in the [satchel] besides your second kluft and your work things,"
says Jonathan Baum, a 21-year-old from near Frankfurt working on
Wiegman's restoration project. "It would be nice to have a few books for
the time you are traveling, but you have to balance that against how much
weight you want to carry."</TE>
<TE>Itinerants Keep Record of Their Work</TE>
<TE>   Another must in the wanderers' bundles are logbooks in which each
employer and hostel manager records the youths' travels, noting wages
paid and fees exacted for lodging. Although employers save on some costs,
the wanderers are obliged to pay the same taxes and pension contributions
as their more settled counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   Though older Germans recognize the wanderers and are often charmed by
the endurance of their antiquated lifestyle, the near-disappearance of
the itinerants during the latter half of the 20th century has made the
sight of them cause for surprise--and sometimes alarm--among younger
generations.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes people are put off by our appearance," says Baum, recalling
distrustful rural innkeepers who refused to rent him a room. But others,
he says, are motivated by curiosity or nostalgia to give a lift to
hitchhiking itinerants or stand them to a free lunch or a glass of beer.</TE>
<TE>   To be admitted into the ranks of the wanderers, craftsmen must have
completed an apprenticeship and meet or exceed skill levels required for
union membership in their trade. Because they are exposed to new
techniques and work styles from job to job--no position can exceed six
months--they tend to be regarded as the creme de la creme of each
construction craft, says Claudia Crepin, project manager at the Chamber
of Craftsmen, a liaison office between guilds and employer groups in
Cologne.</TE>
<TE>Practice Goes Back More Than 700 Years</TE>
<TE>   The wandering tradition began in the 13th century, when European
guilds were rigidly structured to ensure a good living for each town's
resident master craftsmen. Before admission to the guilds, journeymen
first had to leave their hometowns and place of apprenticeship to ply
their skills from farm to farm and gather experience.</TE>
<TE>   "The guild masters controlled everything then, except the wanderers,"
says Hans Mueller, a carpenter trained in East Prussia before World War
II and the wanderers' de facto historian and go-between with the Cologne
chamber.</TE>
<TE>   Trade union movements of the 19th century broke the guild masters'
grip on urban employment, causing the wanderers to nearly disappear as
workers found sufficient opportunities at home. Economic hard times after
both world wars gave a short-term boost to the practice, as Mueller
recalls itinerants willing to work just for food in the lean years
building up to Germany's economic boom of the 1950s. But by the time of
Germany's 1990 reunification, the number of wanderers had dipped below
200.</TE>
<TE>   The renewed popularity of the walz is attributed not only to the
slowdown in construction but to the highly regulated nature of the
building industry in western Germany, which poses its own barrier to
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't have a job if I stayed in Magdeburg," says Schroeder, the
roofer. "Hitting the road is one way of keeping your options open."</TE>

<HD>Possible Last Refuge of Incas Found</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Settlement may have been used by remnants of
civilization before final conquest.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A settlement that may have been one of the last refuges of the
Incas has been discovered on a remote and rugged Andean peak--a finding
that could shed new light on the origin and demise of the last great
Indian empire in the Americas.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement, on a peak known as Cerro Victoria, is in Peru's
Vilcabamba region, where the Incas fled after Spanish soldiers crushed an
Indian revolt in 1536. Artifacts found there indicate that it may have
served as a refuge in the years between the revolt and the final Spanish
conquest of the Incas in 1572.</LD>
<LD>   The nearly inaccessible settlement sprawls over at least 2.4 square
miles on steep slopes at an altitude ranging from 8,000 to 11,000 feet. A
platform built at the peak provides what explorers called a "spectacular
view" of several snow-capped peaks nearby.</LD>
<TE>   Such peaks were sacred to the Incas, and the platform probably was
used for religious ceremonies, as well as to maintain the Inca calendar,
said British author Peter Frost, who led the expedition along with Santa
Barbara explorer Scott Gorsuch and Peruvian archeologist Alfredo Valencia
Zegarra.</TE>
<TE>   The site was so important to the Incas that they built a 5-mile-long
aqueduct to bring water to the barren mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "Victoria is an enormous and complete complex of archeological sites,
with great historical and functional significance, situated within an
exceptional ecological system in stunningly beautiful country," said
Valencia, who is associated with the National University of San Antonio
Abad of Cusco.</TE>
<TE>   The team has so far explored only one side of the mountain, but has
found the ruins of more than 100 structures, including circular
dwellings, agricultural storehouses, cemeteries, funeral towers and
corrals, as well as agricultural terraces.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the site is still overgrown with dense cloud forest.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers hope further exploration of the site will uncover evidence
that sheds light on various mysteries, including the Incas' demise. For
now, "we've really only scratched the surface," Frost said.</TE>
<TE>   Pottery from the site indicates that Cerro Victoria was occupied when
the Incas began building their empire in the early 1400s.</TE>
<TE>   Finding an Inca site that is "virtually unknown" is "fairly rare,"
said archeologist Johan Reinhard of the Mountain Institute, who is an
expert on the Vilcabamba region.</TE>
<TE>   "What I noticed immediately was the size, which meant that it had to
be an important site, even though it isn't mentioned in historical
documents."</TE>
<TE>Settlement Is Close to Machu Picchu</TE>
<TE>   The settlement, which locals call Corihuayrachina, is only about 24
miles from Machu Picchu, the Inca city that is the most popular tourist
destination in Peru. It is even closer to another sacred site called
Choquiquirao.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike those two sites, which were the homes of elite populations
of rulers, priests and administrators, Corihuayrachina was most likely a
blue-collar settlement, home to peasants who worked a nearby silver mine
and farmers who supplied food to Choquiquirao.</TE>
<TE>   "It may have been a satellite" of the ceremonial center at
Choquiquirao, Reinhard said.</TE>
<TE>   Finding such a site is important to archeologists because "often, the
sites where people worked and lived tell us more about the culture than
the so-called imperial sites," said Vincent Lee, another expert on
Vilcabamba.</TE>
<TE>   Cerro Victoria sits in the middle of a region that is one of the least
understood and most significant places in the history of the Inca
civilization.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 1438, the Incas established an imperial state in the
Andes through an elaborate religious, social and military order. Despite
not having the wheel or a system of writing, they built more than 25,000
miles of roads, pioneered in agriculture and ended famines with a system
of food storehouses.</TE>
<TE>   Spanish exploration in the Americas doomed them. Initial contact with
the Spaniards in 1525 led to the introduction of smallpox and other
diseases that destroyed large segments of the population.</TE>
<TE>   Driven by a hunger for gold and silver, the Spanish, led by Francisco
Pizarro, fought four years of bloody wars against the Incas who survived
the epidemics. In the end, they captured the empire. The rebellion in
1536, led by Inca ruler Manco Inca, nearly overthrew the Spanish, but
ended in defeat for the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Protected by high mountains and impenetrable forests, the Incas who
retreated to Vilcabamba survived for nearly 40 years before the Spanish
finally prevailed, killing the remnant population or resettling them in
areas where they could be more easily controlled.</TE>
<TE>Evidence First Spotted During Hike in 1999</TE>
<TE>   Frost and Gorsuch first spotted evidence of the Cerro Victoria
settlement in 1999 while hiking to Choquiquirao. On a rest stop, they
noticed the peak through binoculars and observed a platform at the top,
suggesting a settlement.</TE>
<TE>   But it took two years before they could organize an expedition to the
site. With support from the National Geographic Society, they traveled to
Cerro Victoria last year--a trek that involved one day traveling by car
from Cusco and four days hiking across the Apurimac River and then up
6,000 feet through dense forest.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, there is a cable footbridge over the river now," Frost
said, or the trip would have been much more difficult.</TE>
<TE>   There is virtually no water in the region, so the team had to organize
a three-man, three-mule team that constantly shuttled water up the
mountain.</TE>
<TE>   The only residents of the area are two families who settled at the
site two years ago. They burned one side of the mountain to clear it for
farming and are now using some of the Inca agricultural terraces.</TE>
<TE>   The fires exposed many of the structures so the team could find them,
Gorsuch said, but it also destroyed valuable artifacts.</TE>
<TE>   The team is paying the families not to burn any more of the forest.</TE>
<TE>   "We gave them some money and, in effect, made them guardians of the
site," Gorsuch said.</TE>
<TE>   "We also asked them to keep their animals out of the structures."</TE>
<TE>   The team will return to the site later this year to continue its
excavations.</TE>
<TE>   The National Geographic Channel will premiere a special television
show about Cerro Victoria in May.</TE>

<HD>Coastal Drug Kingpin Eyes Tijuana Turf</HD>
<DH>Mexico: With Arellano Felix cartel crippled, officials say Ismael
Zambada may be poised to fill the void.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>If there is one man likely to fill the power vacuum that the
crippling of the Arellano Felix cartel has created in the
multibillion-dollar drug-trafficking trade, it is Ismael Zambada.</LD>
<LD>   A growing force in drug smuggling in northwestern Mexico, Zambada is
the man Ramon Arellano Felix was thought to be gunning for when he
himself was shot by police Feb. 10 in Mazatlan. The two were said to be
sworn enemies, with Arellano Felix claiming Zambada had dodged a
$20-million debt.</LD>
<LD>   Zambada, from Sinaloa state, has been trying to break the Arellano
Felix gang's iron grip on the Baja California "plaza," or turf, for
years. Mexican authorities believe he was responsible for the February
2000 killing of Tijuana's police chief, Alfredo de la Torre.</LD>
<TE>   "If you just look at geography, Zambada is in a position to benefit
most from a weakened Arellano Felix organization," said Don Robinson, an
FBI agent in San Diego. Zambada's operation is based in Culiacan and
Mazatlan in Sinaloa state, across the Gulf of California from Baja.</TE>
<TE>   The 53-year-old drug kingpin, nicknamed "El Mayo," was long considered
a second-tier enforcer in the so-called Juarez cartel run by Amado
Carrillo Fuentes. But since Carrillo Fuentes' death while undergoing
plastic surgery in 1997, that cartel has splintered and Zambada's power
has grown, U.S. law enforcement sources say.</TE>
<TE>   The March 9 arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix and the death of his
brother Ramon leaves their Tijuana cartel--once considered
"untouchable"--vulnerable to a challenge. Law enforcement officials on
both sides of the border expect a bloody struggle for power to erupt in
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Zambada is not the only pretender to the Arellano Felix domain. Osiel
Cardenas, head of the Gulf cartel based in Tamaulipas state, is thought
by U.S. drug investigators to be poised for a run at the Tijuana cartel's
turf, through which a quarter of all the cocaine consumed in the United
States is shipped. The Baja California-San Diego County smuggling
franchise is highly coveted by drug runners because of its dense
population of potential consumers on both sides of the border and the
high volume of cross-border traffic into which smugglers can blend.</TE>
<TE>   A key part of the franchise is the Arellano Felix wholesaling
operation in Los Angeles, where drugs are stockpiled at safe houses for
distribution around the United States, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   Other drug gangs have wanted a piece of the Tijuana cartel's turf for
years. But the Arellano Felix brothers insisted on high transshipment
fees for the right to use their turf, and they wiped out anyone who tried
to encroach on it without paying.</TE>
<TE>   Zambada's relationship with the Arellano Felixes was once cordial,
U.S. sources say. In fact, Zambada is known for his ability to forge
alliances among competing cartels. But the Arellano Felixes had no
interest in cooperating or sharing.</TE>
<TE>   "Zambada knows how to win friends and influence people. Keep in mind
he has 30 years in the business, and a lot of that has to do with his
ability to communicate and broker deals that are beneficial to both
sides," said one law enforcement official, who asked that his name not be
used.</TE>
<TE>   Zambada is thought to be on friendly terms with both Vicente Carrillo
Fuentes, Amado's brother, and Juan Jose Esparragoza, two figures vying
for control of the Juarez gang. But Zambada can be ruthless.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators probing the shooting of the Tijuana police chief said
suspects in the case have told them that Zambada ordered the killing and
had put out other hits designed to wreak havoc in the Arellano Felix
organization.</TE>
<TE>   Zambada has been wanted by Mexico's attorney general's office since
1998, when it put bounties totaling $2.8 million on him and five other
leaders in the Juarez cartel.</TE>
<TE>   Evidence against Zambada came from disgraced army general Jose de
Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, who was charged in 1997 with taking bribes from
the Juarez cartel in exchange for protection. The general was then
Mexico's anti-drug czar.</TE>
<TE>   "Zambada learned early on how to hitch his wagon to other bigger
organizations, and this has given him entree," said the U.S. law
enforcement official, who added that Zambada has cooperated with another
Sinaloa drug cartel operated by Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman and Hector Luis
"El Guero" Palma.</TE>
<TE>   But the Arellano Felix gang always insisted on monopoly control of its
turf, which stretches from Tijuana to the Baja California border with
Sonora state.</TE>
<TE>   Walter W. Collette, special agent in charge of U.S. customs in San
Diego, thinks that the Arellano Felix cartel is entrenched and that talk
of its demise is premature.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a minor hiccup in their operations, a little blip, and
then it's back to normal," said Collette, noting that 3,900 couriers were
arrested in 2001 attempting to smuggle drugs into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But the FBI's Robinson said law enforcement officials on both sides of
the border are waiting for the turf wars to begin. "Who will challenge
for this territory? Zambada is certainly on everyone's short list of
contenders," he said.</TE>

<HD>Church Attack May Have Targeted Americans</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Officials probe whether the Islamabad assault may be
linked to slayings of worshipers in Punjab. Militant group is focus of
investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONE TEMPEST</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan
</DL>
<LD>Pakistani authorities Monday were investigating possible links
between an attack on a Christian church here the day before and a deadly
assault in October on another Christian congregation in nearby Punjab
province.</LD>
<LD>   In both cases, the suspected targets of the attacks were Americans.
The group under investigation is a banned Sunni Muslim militant
organization with strong links to the former Taliban regime in
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   Also under investigation is the possibility that the Islamabad
attack--which killed five people, including two Americans--was a suicide
mission. That could mark a worrisome expansion of the deadliest, and most
difficult to stop, form or terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Four of those killed in Sunday's attack at the Protestant
International Church in this capital's diplomatic quarter have been
identified, including a U.S. Embassy employee and her 17-year-old
daughter. But the fifth was injured beyond recognition.</TE>
<TE>   As no family members have come forward to identify those remains,
police have speculated that the final victim may have been the same man
who hurled at least three grenades into the congregation during Sunday
services. A Western official connected with the investigation identified
the fifth victim as "one of the perpetrators," suggesting that more than
one attacker might have been involved.</TE>
<TE>   "He was blown to pieces," the official said. The force of the
explosions inside the church blew out windows and spattered blood on the
30-foot ceiling.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pakistani Communications Minister Javed Ashraf Qazi, a
former military intelligence chief, at the top of the list of terrorist
organizations suspected in the Sunday attack is the Sunni militant
organization Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.</TE>
<TE>   Banned in August by President Pervez Musharraf because of a series of
violent attacks on the country's minority Shiite Muslim community, the
heavily armed Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has been linked by witnesses to the Oct.
28 attack at a Christian service in Bahawalpur, in Punjab province.</TE>
<TE>   In that incident, attackers sprayed the congregation with fire from
Kalashnikov assault rifles, killing 15 worshipers and a policeman before
escaping on motorcycles. Although all of the victims in the Bahawalpur
attack were Pakistani Christians, authorities believe the primary targets
were two American missionaries who had been expected to attend the
service.</TE>
<TE>   Four members of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi were killed in police shootouts
earlier this month, including Shakeel Anwar, whom witnesses in Bahawalpur
identified as the chief suspect in the October church shootings. Police
said they recovered three Kalashnikov rifles, two grenades and three
pistols from the dead militants.</TE>
<TE>   Visiting some of the wounded victims of the Sunday attack in
Islamabad, Pakistani Interior Minister Moinuddin Haider suggested that
the attack might have been related to the earlier police actions, with
the remaining members of the group acting in retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is closely connected to another group,
Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan, that has been identified by the U.S. government
as a terrorist organization. Both groups are known to have members
trained in terrorist camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of the Sunday attack, which took place in a heavily
guarded diplomatic enclave only a quarter of a mile from the U.S.
Embassy, many Western embassies were reviewing their policies regarding
dependents of diplomats. After Sept. 11 and the U.S. bombing missions in
Afghanistan, many embassies, including the United States', ordered their
dependents and nonessential personnel home.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent months, most of the dependents had returned to
Islamabad, and tensions seemed to be lessening. For example, police
inspection of handbags and other items at the Protestant International
Church had been curtailed after parishioners complained.</TE>
<TE>   The International School, attended by 17-year-old American high school
senior Kristen Wormsley, planned a memorial service today. Wormsley and
her mother, U.S. Embassy personnel officer Barbara Green, were killed in
Sunday's attack.</TE>
<TE>   Islamabad police increased security Monday across the city. Musharraf,
who earlier this year announced a crackdown on militant groups, met all
day Monday with officials involved in investigating the incident, viewed
here as a major embarrassment to the military government.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday afternoon, Foreign Ministry spokesman Aziz Ahmed Khan
announced that a special task force had been created to investigate the
attack on the congregation of 70. Aziz described the attack as an act
"against the spirit of Islam and against any norm of civilized behavior."</TE>
<TE>   Also of concern is the possibility that Sunday's bloodshed was caused
by a suicide attacker. Although Pakistan has experienced many acts of
terrorism, primarily sectarian violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims
in Punjab and ethnic clashes in the port city of Karachi, there have been
no recent examples of the type of suicide missions that have plagued the
Middle East during the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and Sri Lanka in the
civil war between Tamils and the majority Sinhalese.</TE>
<TE>   According to Rohan Gunaratna, senior research associate at the Center
for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at the University of
St. Andrews in Scotland, a trend for suicide attacks has accelerated
since Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Before then, most such attacks had been restricted to the Middle East
or Asia, primarily Sri Lanka. Gunaratna, a specialist on suicide
bombings, said there have been "about 250 suicide attacks in the past 20
years by Asian and Middle Eastern groups."</TE>
<TE>   "But increasingly," he said in a recent interview, "more and more
groups are becoming interested in the suicide tactic because it is very
effective."</TE>

<HD>Family of Sept. 11 Suspect Refuses to Aid in U.S. Probe</HD>
<DH>Probe: Mother and brother of Zacarias Moussaoui say the possibility
of the death penalty is keeping them from cooperating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>The brother and mother of accused Sept. 11 conspirator Zacarias
Moussaoui said Monday that they were refusing to answer questions from a
U.S. prosecutor because the investigation and impending trial of their
relative could result in the death penalty.</LD>
<LD>   Abd Samad Moussaoui, the brother of the 33-year-old Frenchman
suspected of being the "20th hijacker" in the attacks, met Monday with a
U.S. prosecutor and an FBI agent in Montpellier in southern France. But
the 35-year-old teacher said he would not help U.S. officials because he
believed that they are bent on executing his brother.</LD>
<LD>   "I am not against the search for the truth or the punishment of the
guilty, but I cannot be associated with the risk that my brother could be
condemned to death," he said in a telephone interview. "I know that the
pain is still very, very strong for the Americans and that perhaps that
people here do not realize that. But that is not a reason to be unjust."</LD>
<TE>   The suspect's mother said in an interview that she and her daughter
would refuse to attend a meeting with the prosecutor scheduled for today.
And a French lawyer assisting attorneys in Virginia defending Zacarias
Moussaoui criticized the French government for permitting U.S.
investigators to collect evidence in a potential death penalty case in a
country that has abolished capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>A Fundamental Philosophical Clash</TE>
<TE>   The defense team's effort to turn the case into an attack on the death
penalty reflects a fundamental philosophical clash that could impede
U.S.-European cooperation in terrorism-related cases. European political
leaders, justice officials and the public are steadfastly opposed to the
death penalty and highly critical of its use in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   The Paris bar association, which represents more than 14,000
attorneys, issued a statement Monday calling on the French government to
demand that U.S. authorities refrain from seeking the death penalty
against Moussaoui, who will be tried in federal court in Virginia. U.S.
prosecutors are expected to announce March 29 whether they will pursue
capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   While expressing solidarity with the American victims of the attacks,
Europeans also criticize potential military tribunals and the
imprisonment of suspected terrorists at a U.S. naval base at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The debate largely skirts questions of guilt or innocence. After the
arrests of suspected members of an Al Qaeda cell in Madrid in November,
Spanish media focused less on the evidence than on speculation that the
prospect of the death penalty could scuttle a possible U.S. extradition
bid.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's French lawyer, Francois Roux, urged the Justice Ministry
to suspend cooperation with the United States until it gets a promise
that the death penalty will not be sought.</TE>
<TE>   French anti-terrorism Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere granted a request by
U.S. investigators to conduct the interviews with Moussaoui's relatives
in France as permitted by a treaty. Bruguiere has opened an inquiry into
the Moussaoui case to assist the U.S. prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. prosecutor will meet with French counter-terrorism officials
in Paris and, according to sources, travel to Lyon to question other
witnesses. Although officials would not divulge details, it is believed
that investigators want to question people who know associates of
Moussaoui.</TE>
<TE>Brother Undecided About Helping Defense</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's brother is a practicing Muslim, but he says he became
disgusted with his sibling's embrace of fundamentalism in the early
1990s. The elder brother said he had not seen Moussaoui since 1995. He
said he had not decided whether to testify for the defense.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui's mother, Aicha, a Moroccan immigrant, said the evidence
against her son did not merit the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   A terrorist would have had his immigration papers in order, she
asserted; Moussaoui was arrested in August on immigration charges while
attending flight school in Minnesota. She also cited Osama bin Laden's
statements in a video seized in Afghanistan that many of the 19 hijackers
did not know the details of their mission.</TE>
<TE>   "My son was not going to be among those people, because even those who
died did not know they were going to die," the mother said. "They thought
they were going to take hostages. . . . They were victims, not
kamikazes."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. authorities say they have a strong case. In addition to
allegations of Moussaoui's extensive activity in the Al Qaeda network
documented by French counter-terrorism investigators, they allege that
Moussaoui received money to finance his pilot studies from a key
associate of the hijackers in Hamburg, Germany.</TE>

<LD>A U.S.-contracted pilot was killed in Colombia when his
crop-dusting plane crashed on a drug-eradication mission, the U.S.
Embassy in Bogota said.</LD>
<LD>   Rebels who oppose spraying of drug crops and operate near the southern
Colombia accident site were not believed to have fired on the plane. The
embassy said it was investigating the incident. It did not identify the
pilot, who was described only as a non-U.S. citizen hired by Pentagon
contractor DynCorp.</LD>
<LD>   Colombia's drug-eradication program has received more than $1 billion
in U.S. aid. Rebels often fire on crop dusters spraying coca, the plant

<HD>Ex-Workers Face Off With China Oil Firm</HD>
<DH>Asia: Shift toward a market economy has left thousands in the
northeast unemployed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY KUHN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BEIJING
</DL>
<LD>Thousands of laid-off workers remain in a long-running standoff
with officials at one of China's largest oil fields, highlighting the
social and economic costs of transforming lumbering Maoist-era industries
into corporations fit to compete in the global economy.</LD>
<LD>   Dissatisfied with the terms of their severance, the workers have
surrounded the offices of the Daqing Oil Management Bureau in China's
northernmost province, Heilongjiang, since March 1, milling around by day
and dispersing peacefully at night.</LD>
<LD>   A public relations official in Beijing for PetroChina, the oil field's
parent company, acknowledged that there are 1,000 to 2,000 protesters but
insisted that the demonstrations "have basically subsided" and have not
affected oil production.</LD>
<TE>   The official, who declined to give his name, rejected earlier reports
of tens of thousands of protesters as exaggerated. He also denied reports
that authorities had mobilized soldiers from a nearby tank division to
contain the protests, or that officials had quashed attempts by the
laid-off workers to unionize.</TE>
<TE>   "Local officials have gone to the scene to explain policies and dispel
misunderstandings with the workers," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Protests by laid-off workers are increasingly common throughout
China's northeastern industrial belt. The Hong Kong-based Information
Center for Human Rights and Democracy said Monday that police had
detained the organizers of 5,000 workers demonstrating against unpaid
wages and alleged corruption at the bankrupt Ferroalloy Factory in the
northeastern city of Liaoyang.</TE>
<TE>   Workers began drilling Daqing's oil wells in 1958, battling
Manchuria's harsh winters and using primitive equipment on permafrost.
China hailed completion of Daqing's main facilities in 1963 as a sign
that the country no longer needed to import oil or the technology needed
to produce it.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning the following year, the Communist Party directed all
government departments to learn from the "Daqing spirit" of
self-reliance, as personified by "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi, the model worker
who reportedly said, "I'm going to build this oil field even if it takes
20 years off my life."</TE>
<TE>   At its peak, Daqing produced about two-fifths of China's crude oil.</TE>
<TE>   In its transition to a market economy, however, China has increased
its reliance on petroleum imports even as domestic producers have been
hit by falling oil prices worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, in anticipation of foreign competition after its entry into
the World Trade Organization, China organized its oil companies into
northern- and southern-based conglomerates. The northern one, PetroChina,
absorbed Daqing.</TE>
<TE>   Then, as part of a restructuring ahead of its stock market listings in
New York and Hong Kong in 2000, PetroChina took its best-performing
assets and a staff of 425,000 for the listed vehicle, while Daqing and
other unprofitable subsidiaries were left with outdated plants and a
bloated staff of more than 1 million.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone left in the remaining subsidiaries would scream injustice,"
Zeng Yukang, head of the Daqing Oil Management Bureau, told the official
People's Daily last month.</TE>
<TE>   From 1999 to 2001, the subsidiaries laid off about 300,000 workers,
roughly 28% of their staffs, cutting annual losses from $1.5 billion to
about $500 million, according to the People's Daily.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the State Labor Bureau reported that the Daqing Oil
Management Bureau was the fourth-worst corporate performer nationwide in
giving the government money for retirement benefits.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, as many as 80,000 bureau employees have signed
severance contracts providing them with up to $500 for each year they
worked at the company. Although the payment was a substantial sum for
many workers, many still felt it would not cover rapid cost-of-living
increases and hence wanted their jobs back, according to the Hong
Kong-based China Labor Bulletin. Other workers alleged that while they
were losing their jobs, bureau managers had given themselves generous
bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   "Some workers may have felt that the severance contract was
unreasonable and therefore didn't admit its validity," said the
PetroChina spokesman. "But they looked at the contract before signing it.
You can't just walk off the job one day and then come back tomorrow."</TE>

<LD>Indonesia's government said it would stand by its decision to ban
an Australian journalist who has reported on human rights abuses.</LD>
<LD>   Lindsay Murdoch, 48, who writes for the Sydney Morning Herald and the
Age newspapers, has not been allowed to renew his journalist visa, which
expired March 10.</LD>
<LD>   The Foreign Ministry refused to say why the renewal was rejected. But
authorities may have been angered by two of Murdoch's reports. One quoted
witnesses as saying Indonesian troops poured boiling water on a baby in
the province of Aceh. The second focused on refugees from East Timor who
allegedly were kidnapped by a Jakarta-based nationalist group.</LD>

<LD>A white farmer was shot dead, Zimbabwe's major labor federation
called a strike and two African presidents counseled compromise as
President Robert Mugabe began his fifth term of office after a bitter
vote condemned as massively flawed.</LD>
<LD>   The Commercial Farmers' Union said Terry Ford was attacked by blacks
stationed on his farm under a government program to seize white-owned
farms for redistribution to landless blacks. Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions, once led by defeated presidential candidate
Morgan Tsvangirai, announced a three-day strike. White farmers and union
workers are key centers of opposition to Mugabe.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Monday, Presidents Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and Olusegun
Obasanjo of Nigeria met Mugabe and Tsvangirai to urge them to seek an

<LD>A lawmaker who is close to Japan's prime minister said he is
leaving the ruling Liberal Democratic Party over influence-peddling
allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Koichi Kato, once a strong candidate to become premier, is the second
legislator to depart in disgrace within a week.</LD>
<LD>   "We mustn't allow trust in the LDP to be hurt even one more day," Kato
said. He denied personal wrongdoing but said he was taking responsibility
for failing to supervise an aide who was arrested this month on
tax-evasion charges.</LD>

<DL>BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan
</DL>
<LD>Supporters of a jailed opposition lawmaker battled police in
southern Kyrgyzstan, leaving four dead and dozens injured. The president
urged calm Monday after the rare clash and blamed his political foes for
the violence.</LD>
<LD>   The bloodshed Sunday marked the first time that an opposition protest
turned violent in the 10-year history of this Central Asian nation, where
U.S. and other foreign forces are deployed for the campaign in nearby
Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,000 people had gathered in the village of Karadzigach in
mountainous, impoverished southern Kyrgyzstan. In ensuing rioting, four
protesters were killed and 15 hospitalized with wounds, while 47 police
were injured, the prosecutor general said Monday.</LD>
<TE>   President Askar Akayev addressed the shocked nation on state
television Monday evening "with pain and sorrow in my heart."</TE>
<TE>   The protesters were hoping to be present Monday in the neighboring
village of Toktogul for the sentencing of Azimbek Beknazarov, a lawmaker
who was arrested in January on charges of abuse of power.</TE>

<HD>Candid U.N. Rights Chief Won't Seek a 2nd Term</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>GENEVA
</DL>
<LD>U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, long a thorn
in the side of the major powers for her outspoken views, said Monday that
she would not seek another term when her appointment ends in September.</LD>
<LD>   The former Irish president announced her departure in an address to
the annual session of the Human Rights Commission.</LD>
<LD>   She declined to comment on suggestions by some rights groups that she
had been pushed into the decision by Washington.</LD>
<TE>   In recent months, there had been speculation that Robinson, who has
criticized Russia's military campaign against Muslim separatists in
Chechnya and aspects of the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, was interested
in staying at her post.</TE>
<TE>   Washington was thought to oppose any extension of her mandate after
she expressed concern over the number of civilian casualties in U.S.
airstrikes in Afghanistan and criticized the treatment of Taliban and Al
Qaeda prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson acknowledged that her views were unwelcome to some countries
but said she had been guided by advice from U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan upon her appointment in 1997. "Stay an outsider within the United
Nations," she quoted him as telling her.</TE>
<TE>   Reed Brody, advocacy director of the U.S.-based Human Rights Watch,
said Robinson was paying the price for willingness to stand up to
Washington, Moscow and Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   The single most dramatic events since she last reported to the
commission in March 2001 had been the Sept. 11 terrorism, Robinson said.</TE>
<TE>   She described the attacks as a "crime against humanity" but said the
reaction to them also threatened to undermine international standards of
human rights.</TE>

<HD>Britain to Send More Troops to Afghanistan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Britain announced Monday that it will deploy an infantry battle
group of 1,700 in Afghanistan, its largest military deployment for combat
operations since the 1991 Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   Defense Minister Geoff Hoon said that the United States had asked
Britain to join future operations against Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters
in Afghanistan and that the British force--built around a Royal Marines
commando unit--would be fully integrated with U.S. troops.</LD>
<LD>   "This group will join a U.S.-led brigade, forming a potent force ready
to undertake such operations," Hoon told the House of Commons.</LD>
<TE>   He said that the force would initially go to Bagram air base north of
Kabul, the Afghan capital, and that the first members of 45 Commando
Group would be on the ground within days. The force would be ready to
begin offensive operations by mid-April "in support of the wider
coalition war against terrorism," Hoon said.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Britain will hand over command of the Kabul multinational
brigade, the subordinate headquarters of the International Security
Assistance Force, to a German unit, Hoon said.</TE>
<TE>   The United States commands the war effort in Afghanistan, including
the peacekeeping operation in Kabul, although Britain has had day-to-day
command of the multinational force and has had 1,800 troops taking part.</TE>
<TE>   British forces joined the U.S.-led coalition shortly after Sept. 11
and have already participated in reconnaissance and air-to-air refueling
flights. On the ground they have engaged in operations against Al Qaeda
and Taliban fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "But for all the progress that we have made in Afghanistan, the threat
of attack from Al Qaeda and Taliban-related groupings and individuals
across the country remains high," Hoon said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to 18 helicopters and four amphibious landing craft
already in the area, three Chinook helicopters will be sent with the
commandos.</TE>
<TE>   "These troops are being deployed to Afghanistan to take part in
war-fighting operations. We will be asking them to risk their lives.
Their missions will be conducted in unforgiving and hostile terrain
against a dangerous enemy," Hoon said.</TE>
<TE>   "No government ever makes such decisions without reaching the absolute
conviction that it is something that must be done," he said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Forces Kill 16 in Afghanistan</HD>
<DH>War: Troops capture 31 in a second strike. No Americans are hurt,
but operations apparently yield no terrorist leaders. Anaconda is
declared over.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. forces, moving to defang the still potent threat from
surviving Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, killed 16 people in an attack on
a convoy in southeastern Afghanistan and detained 31 while searching a
compound near the southern city of Kandahar, senior military officials
said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   There was no indication that any of those killed or captured in the
strikes, both of which occurred Sunday, were senior leaders of either the
Al Qaeda terrorist network or the Taliban, the ousted hard-line regime of
Afghanistan. No Americans were wounded in either confrontation, Pentagon
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The strikes came as U.S. military commanders announced the end of
Operation Anaconda, which began March 2 and has been described as the
biggest battle of the 5 1/2-month-old Afghan war.</LD>
<TE>   Small teams of U.S. Special Forces soldiers and Afghan allies--about
500 in all--remain in the battle zone in the wintry mountains of eastern
Afghanistan, searching caves for information on terrorist activities,
Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "While this particular operation's over, we're still actively pursuing
Al Qaeda and Taliban personnel throughout Afghanistan, and we're
preparing for any subsequent missions that may be needed," said Air Force
Brig. Gen. John W. Rosa Jr., deputy director of operations for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, on a political trip to the Midwest, praised the
success of Operation Anaconda but told reporters in O'Fallon, Mo., near
St. Louis: "I feel like we've got a lot more fighting to do in
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have so far searched about 30 caves in the
60-to-70-square-mile area near the city of Gardez where Operation
Anaconda was fought, Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that on Sunday morning, Army commando teams in MH-47 Chinook
helicopters swooped down on a convoy of three vehicles about 45 miles
southwest of Gardez, killing 16 men believed to be Al Qaeda fighters and
wounding one. Another person, who was not injured, was held for
questioning, Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces initially fired warning shots from the helicopters, Rosa
said. When their shots were answered with fire from the vehicles, the
troops rushed out of the aircraft and engaged in a firefight on the
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said a search of the vehicles turned up ammunition,
rocket-propelled grenades and other weapons. He and other officials said
they were awaiting more details.</TE>
<TE>   A fourth vehicle, traveling some distance behind the convoy, also was
stopped by the Americans, Rosa said. The family in the vehicle was
allowed to proceed, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa said he was not sure where the convoy had originated, but other
officials said it appeared that the people in the vehicles were trying to
escape the area attacked heavily during Operation Anaconda.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident about the same time as the firefight, U.S.
forces captured 31 suspected Al Qaeda or Taliban fighters in a compound
west of Kandahar, officials said. Rosa said the troops seized weapons and
a large amount of ammunition. He had no other details.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the war on terrorism, American troops in the Philippines
removed three Philippine soldiers from Basilan island after they were
wounded in a firefight with the Abu Sayyaf, a Muslim extremist group
believed to be linked to Al Qaeda, Rosa said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. troops were sent to the nation last month to help train and
assist Philippine forces battling the Abu Sayyaf. More than 600 U.S.
troops are in the Philippines to help crush the group, which has held two
American missionaries hostage since May.</TE>

<HD>Study Urges Trawling Ban in Fragile Marine Habitats</HD>
<DH>Fisheries: A practice likened to 'clear-cutting' the oceans needs
to use less damaging gear, federal researchers say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dragging nets along the ocean floor, a widely used method of
commercial fishing, causes such devastation to sea life that the practice
should be banned from areas with fragile marine habitat, federal
researchers concluded Monday.</LD>
<LD>   A report released by the National Academy of Sciences points out
numerous areas of concern along the Pacific Coast, the North Atlantic,
the Gulf coasts and waters around Alaska.</LD>
<LD>   It also recommends that the federal government reduce bottom trawling,
as the practice is called, and require trawlers to modify their gear to
minimize damage.</LD>
<TE>   The study, requested by the National Marine Fisheries Service, was
applauded by some fishing and environmental groups that liken bottom
trawling to chain sawing forests as a way to hunt for deer.</TE>
<TE>   "This is clear-cutting the oceans, but because it happens out of sight
and out of mind, nobody pays any attention to it," said Elliott Norse,
president of the Marine Conservation Biology Institute in Redmond, Wash.
"So this [report] is huge. The National Academy of Sciences has outed the
issue and now it will finally be dealt with."</TE>
<TE>   The marine fisheries service, which manages commercial fishing, said
the scientific recommendations come at a key time: when its fisheries
management councils are preparing studies on the best protection for
critical ocean habitat in five different regions.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca Lent, the fisheries service deputy director, said the report
underscored a critical point: "We need to reduce fishing efforts because
we have too many boats chasing too few fish."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, she said, the report pointed out the need for better mapping
of essential habitat so federal officials know which areas of sea floor
to protect.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a bipartisan group of Congress members, frustrated by the
slow pace of reform, is set to introduce legislation today to restrict
bottom trawling.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed Ocean Habitat Protection Act would ban fishing trawlers
from using large rollers and "rock-hopping" wheels that allow their nets
to bounce through rocky terrain without getting snagged.</TE>
<TE>   It is this multilayered sea floor that is most susceptible to
long-term damage, as weighted nets pulverize coral, sponges, sea grass
and rocks used as feeding grounds and hiding places for juvenile fish.</TE>
<TE>   "As an avid fisherman," said Rep. Joel Hefley (R-Colo.), "I have
strong concerns about the future of fishing and the devastating effects
of mobile fishing gear."</TE>
<TE>   The legislation has brought together support from environmental groups
such as the American Oceans Campaign as well as the recreational fishing
lobby. Recreational anglers blame commercial trawling for ruining fishing
for everyone else.</TE>
<TE>   "This gear is destructive," said Michael Doebley of the Recreational
Fishing Alliance, which represents 70,000 anglers.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the commercial fishing lobby opposes the idea, as well as any
other restrictions that would cut into the supply of seafood for American
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   "Rather than wasting time on frivolous legislation or litigation,"
said Rod Moore of the National Fisheries Institute, he suggested everyone
follow just one of the recommendations made in the report--to have
"scientists and the seafood industry work together more effectively."</TE>
<TE>   The report, written by the academy's National Research Council,
examined the ecological impacts of trawl nets used to snare cod in
Alaskan waters, and shrimp in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Pacific
Coast. The report also scrutinized the effects of steel-teeth dredges
that scoop up scallops and oysters in New England and off the
mid-Atlantic states.</TE>
<TE>   Bottom trawling has been around for decades, sweeping across soft,
sandy ocean bottom for flounder, haddock, shellfish and shrimp. Only
since the 1980s, however, have trawl boats equipped their nets with
rollers allowing them to scour deep, uneven terrain that functions as
fish nurseries.</TE>
<TE>   The disturbance to the ocean bottom varies widely, as does its
recovery time, according to the report. The report says that besides
scraping away cold-water coral, sponges and various plants, a single pass
of a trawl wipes out 68% of sea anemones and 21% of starfish. Repeated
passes, the report maintains, results in a 93% reduction in these
bottom-dwelling creatures.</TE>
<TE>   California has set some restrictions on bottom trawling in waters
within three miles of shore. Georges Bank off the coast of Maine has
closed some areas to help them recover, and the Dry Tortugas marine
reserve off the tip of Florida has also banned bottom trawling.</TE>
<TE>   Generally, though, the ocean is wide open to trawls, researchers
noted, concluding that "closed areas are necessary to protect a range of
vulnerable, representative habitats."</TE>

<HD>Pentagon Will Reduce Air Patrols Over Cities</HD>
<DH>Defense: High costs lead officials to scale back the effort, but
combat planes will remain at the ready across the nation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon will scale back the combat air patrols flying over
Washington, New York and other major U.S. cities since Sept. 11, but will
maintain planes and crews ready to fly across the nation, officials said
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Citing the high cost of the flights, the drain on Air Force resources
and the unlikelihood that the patrols could deter another air attack on
the U.S. homeland, officials said it is possible that patrols over New
York will stop altogether.</LD>
<LD>   "Combat air patrols in the air, even on Sept. 11, may not have made a
difference," a senior military official said. "What pilot is going to
want to shoot down a civilian airliner? The Sept. 11 attacks, if they
were going to be stopped, would have had to be stopped at the airports,
not once the planes were in the air."</LD>
<TE>   The round-the-clock patrols have cost the military more than $500
million. They have tied up more than 260 aircraft--including fighters,
AWACS radar control planes and C-130 transport planes--350 air crews and
10,000 Air Force personnel at 30 bases around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The patrols were the first of their kind over the United States since
the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, civilian awareness and safety conditions have
sharply improved at commercial airports and aboard airliners, making the
combat patrols a significantly less critical element of defense against
terrorist attack, Pentagon officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are talking about a different mix," Defense Department spokeswoman
Victoria Clarke told reporters. "And it will probably be . . . somewhat
less than what you have had in the past."</TE>
<TE>   "We are looking at a plan that will employ some kind of mix of combat
air patrols over certain locations, intermittent combat air patrols on an
ad hoc basis, and different levels of strip alerts," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Strip alerts" involve fighter planes ready to be scrambled for combat
duty on 15 minutes' notice.</TE>
<TE>   Senior military officials said after the patrols were first announced
that fighter pilots could be authorized to shoot down an airliner if
there were an extreme threat, but they cautioned that utmost care would
be taken before any such move.</TE>
<TE>   New York's Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, questioned the decision to reduce the flights.</TE>
<TE>   "There may be some logic to cutting the 24-hour air patrol over New
York City while maintaining it over Washington, D.C.," Clinton said. "But
without any information, we don't know what that logic is."</TE>
<TE>   In January, the Air Force's top civilian official said the
patrols--made up of F-15s and F-16s--were putting too much strain on the
Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   "That was never intended to be a permanent thing," said Air Force
Secretary James G. Roche.</TE>
<TE>   In testimony last week before the House Armed Services Committee, Gen.
Ralph E. Eberhart said more than 19,000 flights have been conducted in
U.S. and Canadian air space in support of Operation Noble Eagle, the
military's name for the effort. Eberhart is the Air Force general in
charge of the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which is
responsible for the overflights.</TE>
<TE>   Besides covering New York and Washington, other flights have taken
place from time to time over other major metropolitan airports and
critical security sites.</TE>
<TE>   Clarke told reporters that President Bush had been briefed on the
move, but she declined to say when it might go into effect. A senior
military official said the move was imminent.</TE>
<TE>   "This was from the beginning an ad hoc system put together after
9/11," the official said. "Now we're putting together a longer-term plan
about how to conduct combat air patrols, and how to respond to threats in
the sky. It's no secret that our forces are stressed. It's no secret that
we need to look at options."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Deceit at Issue Before Supreme Court</HD>
<DH>Law: The plaintiff says officials are liable for alleged lies about
her husband's plight before he died in Guatemala.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A lawyer for President Bush on Monday defended alleged lying by the
Clinton administration in a Supreme Court case that centers on whether
government officials can be sued if they lie to cover up crucial facts.</LD>
<LD>   The case has nothing to do with Paula Corbin Jones or Monica S.
Lewinsky but instead concerns the Clinton administration's support for
the Guatemalan military. It also marked one of the rare instances in
which the victim of alleged government wrongdoing argued her own case in
the high court.</LD>
<LD>   "The government cannot engage in intentional deceit in order to
prevent [you] from going to a court of law," Jennifer Harbury, a lawyer
and widow of a Guatemalan guerrilla fighter, told the justices.</LD>
<TE>   For more than a decade, Harbury has carried on a one-woman crusade
against U.S. policy in Central America. In 1991, she met and married
Guatemalan rebel Efrain Bamaca Velasquez.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, he was captured by the Guatemalan army, whose commanders
reported that he had died. In fact, he was reportedly the prisoner of a
Guatemalan officer who was on the CIA's payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Harbury says she was deceived by Clinton administration officials in
1993 who said they did not know her husband's whereabouts. She later
learned Bamaca was killed in the fall of 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Harbury has been seeking to hold key officials liable for
lying, including former Secretary of State Warren G. Christopher and
National Security Advisor Anthony Lake.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told there was nothing in the files," Harbury said, though her
husband "was alive and undergoing torture. He could have been saved," she
said, had officials told her the truth about his plight.</TE>
<TE>   Responding to her suit, Christopher and other officials said Harbury's
allegations are false. They said they did not know of Bamaca's situation
in early 1993 when he was a captive.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, however, they argue that her lawsuit should be thrown out
because citizens do not have a "right of access to government
information," as they put it in their legal brief.</TE>
<TE>   Harbury won an important victory in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington two years ago. Assuming that the facts of her complaint are
true, the court ruled, she can hold the officials liable for their
actions.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it should be obvious to public officials that they may not
affirmatively mislead citizens for the purpose of protecting themselves
from suit," wrote Judge David Tatel for the appeals court.</TE>
<TE>   But the Supreme Court agreed to review the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The case of Christopher vs. Harbury, 01-394, raises the question of
whether the Constitution gives citizens a right to truthful answers from
government officials, particularly when they need the information for a
lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson, representing the Bush
administration, joined Christopher's lawyers in arguing that the answer
is no.</TE>
<TE>   The Constitution does not "impose any affirmative duty of candor on
the government," Olson said in his brief.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of times daily, citizens ask for information from officials.
Sometimes, they are not provided complete answers, he said. "On
occasions, there are polite evasions. Or an equivocal, 'I will get back
to you,' " Olson said.</TE>
<TE>   If citizens can haul officials into court by claiming they were
deceived, it would a put a costly personal burden on officials, he said.
Moreover, such a rule might lead to the "drying up of information"
because officials would routinely say "No comment" to protect themselves,
Olson argued.</TE>
<TE>   "There are other ways to deal with this" than creating a
constitutional right to honest answers from the government, Olson said.
For example, citizens can seek details under the Freedom of Information
Act.</TE>
<TE>   For their part, the justices appeared to agree.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me you are trying to make up a constitutional right of
access to information," Justice Anthony M. Kennedy told Harbury. He said
he was leery of opening the door to lawsuits against officials for
providing, or not providing, information.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the court was reluctant to meddle in
foreign affairs. U.S. officials did not kill Harbury's husband, and
Breyer questioned whether judges should allow suits against officials
over actions that took place in other countries.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously yours is a sad, difficult case. One is immediately
sympathetic," Breyer commented. "But the problems of conducting foreign
affairs usually requires the courts to stay out."</TE>

<HD>Democrats Get Record Gift of 'Soft Money' They Oppose</HD>
<DH>Politics: The donation will help build a new headquarters as party
lawmakers push to limit such contributions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>While Democrats launched a final push Monday for legislation to
limit the influence of big-money donors, party officials said one
contributor has given several million dollars this year to help build a
national Democratic headquarters.</LD>
<LD>   The gift, when confirmed in federal disclosure reports due to become
public next month, will apparently be the largest of the past decade to
either of the major national parties.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview Monday, Democratic National Committee chairman Terry
McAuliffe declined to name the donor or specify the amount, saying that a
report will make the information public soon. No other details about the
gift could be independently confirmed.</LD>
<TE>   But party officials made clear that the size of the donation, which is
part of a $32-million fund-raising drive for the headquarters, will set a
record.</TE>
<TE>   Details about Democratic fund-raising for a new headquarters are
emerging as Congress nears approval of legislation that would prohibit
this type of drive.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign finance bill now before Congress targets the unlimited
donations to political parties known as "soft money." These donations are
often made in six- or even seven-figure sums.</TE>
<TE>   This fall's campaign would be the last in which national party leaders
and federal officeholders or candidates will be able to call on major
donors--including wealthy individuals, corporations and labor unions--for
such contributions.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, the parties will be forced to raise money in much
smaller chunks from a broader base of contributors. The campaign finance
bill would take these and other steps to overhaul federal election law
for the first time in nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Senate began debate on the legislation, which passed
the House on a 240-189 vote last month and is expected to come to a final
vote this week.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved an earlier version last April on a 59-41 vote but
must vote again because of House amendments to that bill. In both
chambers, most Democrats joined with a splinter group of dissident
Republicans in support of reform. GOP congressional leaders strongly
oppose the legislation, calling it an unconstitutional infringement on
free speech and an unnecessary barrier to building strong political
parties.</TE>
<TE>   Barring a major surprise, the Senate is expected to vote to send the
bill to President Bush for his signature or veto, and White House aides
have signaled that Bush will probably sign it.</TE>
<TE>   In a further sign that obstacles to campaign finance reform are
falling away, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for years the legislation's
leading opponent, said the Senate could move swiftly toward final passage
beginning as early as today.</TE>
<TE>'We Find It Hypocritical,' GOP Says</TE>
<TE>   Proponents launched the Senate debate Monday with a stinging blast at
soft money--a form of political fund-raising that they claim has
undermined public confidence in good government.</TE>
<TE>   "When we weigh the pros and cons of legislation, many people think we
also weigh the size of the contributions we got from interests on both
sides of the issue," said Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), a chief
sponsor of the bill. "And when those contributions can be a million
dollars, or even more, it seems obvious to most people that we would
reward, or at least listen especially carefully to, our biggest donors."</TE>
<TE>   Republican critics say the Democrats' collection of soft money for a
new headquarters undercuts their credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We find it hypocritical," said Kevin Sheridan, spokesman for the
Republican National Committee. "They're out there as the vanquishers of
soft money and its 'corrupting influence' on politics. So what are they
doing right now? They're out there shaking down every large donor they
can find, every corporation . . . to permanently build a monument to
their hypocrisy."</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe, dismissing GOP criticism, said the new headquarters and
upgrades in technology would help Democrats erase tactical advantages
that Republicans have.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to think of where we are as a party 25 years from today," he
said in an interview in his office on South Capitol Street. "This will be
the last chance we ever will be able to afford a new national
headquarters or new technology."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, both parties have been raising soft money at a furious pace
as the likelihood has grown that Congress would move to ban it. In 2001,
Federal Election Commission data show, Republicans raised $100 million in
soft money, up 67% from what they collected in 1999 and 149% from their
1997 total.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, raised $68 million in soft money last year--up
26% from 1999 and double the amount they received in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The largest single donation to a national party since 1992 was Amway
Corp.'s $1.7 million for a Republican committee in October 1994,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent
organization in Washington that tracks federal election data.</TE>
<TE>   Late last year, two other donors gave $1 million each for the new
Democratic headquarters: media executive Fred Eychaner of Chicago and the
United Assn. of Journeymen, a plumbers' trade union.</TE>
<TE>   A major focus for McAuliffe, who became DNC chairman just over a year
ago, has been to move the party into a newer, larger
headquarters--outfitted with television and radio equipment and other
high-tech gear to help the party reach out to donors and activists.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe says he is trying to catch up to Republicans, who for years
have invested in office space, computers and other equipment to help the
party manage its operations in Washington and reach core supporters
across the country.</TE>
<TE>In Time for Next Presidential Campaign</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic plans call for a 95,000-square-foot, six-story building
on E Street in southwest Washington, not far from the Capitol--nearly
double the 55,000 square feet the party currently occupies.</TE>
<TE>   Party officials say they have collected most of the $23-million cost
of the building and are raising an additional $9 million to furnish and
equip it. Groundbreaking is expected by summer, and the party hopes to
occupy the building by late 2003--just before the next presidential
campaign swings into high gear.</TE>
<TE>   The new headquarters would help the party comply with the campaign
finance legislation if it becomes law, McAuliffe said, by giving
Democrats more space and resources to raise the smaller donations from a
wider group of supporters. Those donations would be subject to limits of
$2,000 per individual per election under the bill. Raising these smaller
amounts is labor-intensive, political pros say.</TE>
<TE>   In pushing the headquarters project, McAuliffe has the full backing of
such top Democrats as Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and
House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.). Former President
Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), have also
given their support.</TE>
<TE>   Party officials say a small group of a dozen or so big donors is
spearheading the headquarters campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Haim Saban,, an entertainment industry executive from Los Angeles, is
its chairman. Democratic officials insist that money raised for the
headquarters will not siphon resources from this year's Democratic
campaigns to retake the House and maintain a slim Senate majority.</TE>

<HD>Bush Poses Tax Deduction for Small Businesses</HD>
<DH>Economy: The plan is part of an assistance package to help
stimulate recovery and create jobs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>O'FALLON, Mo.
</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Monday proposed a greater tax deduction for small
businesses as a fresh incentive for them to buy new equipment, a move
that he said would lead to more jobs.</LD>
<LD>   "In my judgment, we're not out of the woods yet," Bush said, referring
to the economic recovery that many economists believe is underway.</LD>
<LD>   Beginning a two-day focus on the economy and small business, the
president also asked Congress to adopt legislation that would enable
small businesses to increase their purchasing power by banding together
to buy less expensive group health insurance for their employees.</LD>
<TE>   Today, Bush will unveil a package that includes a mixture of "tax
simplification, tax relief, assistance to provide health care to
employees [and] reductions of regulations and barriers to growth," said
White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials said the Treasury Department will soon
announce final rules to allow service-oriented businesses with less than
$10 million in gross receipts to use cash accounting rather than accrual
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   This change will significantly reduce the paperwork burden for
hundreds of thousands of small businesses, officials said, and allow
these businesses to immediately deduct the cost of supplies and to defer
paying taxes until income is received.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also is to propose allowing small businesses to earn interest on
their checking accounts, which is banned under laws enacted during the
Depression, officials said Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   For many small businesses, the interest income on their checking
account balances would defray other significant costs.</TE>
<TE>   The president also renewed his vow to eliminate the inheritance tax,
which earned him a thunderous ovation from several hundred small-business
workers and their families here.</TE>
<TE>   Lauding America's small-business owners, Bush noted: "More new jobs
are created by small business people than anybody else." Small business,
he added, "represents one of the true strengths of our country."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's appearance here demonstrated anew his keen awareness that a
president's popularity as a war commander may not sufficiently shield him
from voters' wrath at the ballot box if the economy is ailing--as his
father, the 41st president, learned in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke before a backdrop featuring two large signs, both
containing the phrase "Working for America."</TE>
<TE>   The setting was the warehouse of Albers Manufacturing Co., an
award-winning small business 30 miles west of St. Louis. The company,
which makes electrical and mechanical parts for communication equipment,
has been hit hard by the economic downturn and has had to lay off
employees.</TE>
<TE>   In his remarks, Bush also provided an update on the war and renewed
his plea to Americans to perform volunteer work and help those in need.</TE>
<TE>   "Materialism itself is a dead end," said the president, who only a few
months ago had urged Americans to spend as a way to keep the economy from
sliding into a recession.</TE>
<TE>   One proposal that Bush specifically mentioned would increase the
maximum tax deduction that a small business may take when it buys new
plants or equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The law currently allows an immediate deduction of the full cost of
the first $24,000 if a business invests less than $200,000 a year. Bush
wants to increase that cap to $325,000 and allow a first-year deduction
of $40,000.</TE>
<TE>   The White House said this depreciation proposal would cost $7 billion
over 10 years, and repeal of the estate tax would cost $104 billion over
10 years.</TE>
<TE>   The concept of pooling purchasing groups to buy health insurance is
not new. It was a central feature of the massive plan to revamp the
nation's health-care system put forth in 1993 by President Clinton and
his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   After his appearance here, Bush attended a state Republican Party
fund-raiser in St. Louis expected to bring in $1.3 million--$850,000 for
the party and $450,000 for Senate candidate Jim Talent.</TE>
<TE>   Talent, a former congressman who ran unsuccessfully for governor two
years ago, is the front-runner in the Republican primary to challenge
Sen. Jean Carnahan, a Democrat appointed to the Senate. Her husband, Mel,
then the governor, defeated incumbent Sen. John Ashcroft, now Bush's
attorney general, in 2000 despite his death in a plane crash just weeks
before the election. Jean Carnahan was then named to fill his seat. This
election will determine who serves the remaining four years of the
six-year Senate term.</TE>

<HD>Yates Gets Life as Husband Is Criticized</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON
</DL>
<LD>As Andrea Yates was formally sentenced to life in prison Monday for
drowning her children, some of her relatives accused her husband of not
doing enough to help her.</LD>
<LD>   State District Judge Belinda Hill told Yates she was going to prison
for two concurrent life terms for drowning three of her children.</LD>
<LD>   "Good luck to you, Mrs. Yates," Hill said as she dismissed the
37-year-old former nurse, who will be eligible for parole in 2041.</LD>
<TE>   Jurors last week rejected an insanity defense and convicted Yates of
capital murder in the drownings of Noah, 7; John, 5; and Mary, 6 months.
Evidence also was presented about the drownings of Paul, 3; and Luke, 2.</TE>
<TE>   The same jury rejected lethal injection as a punishment Friday,
meaning Monday's life sentence was automatic.</TE>
<TE>   "She wants to know what all this means and it's very difficult to
explain," defense attorney Wendell Odom said. ". . . I think Andrea right
now thrives on solitude and being quiet and being away from it all."</TE>
<TE>   Her family, however, was far from quiet.</TE>
<TE>   Brian Kennedy, her brother, in an interview broadcast on ABC's "Good
Morning America," called Russell Yates an "unemotional" husband who was
inattentive to his wife's needs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that any man and woman whose spouse was that severely down,
confused, that sick, that I would do whatever it would take to make sure
my other half would get the help that was necessary," Kennedy said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrea Yates' mother, Jutta Karin Kennedy, also appeared on "Good
Morning America." She said her son-in-law told her after the birth of
their fourth child that he had never changed a diaper.</TE>
<TE>   Russell "Rusty" Yates, meanwhile, told NBC's "Today" show that some
people "don't understand the biochemical nature of Andrea's illness . . .
so they'll say there must have been something else going on in that
household, or there must have been this or that, and it's all false."</TE>

<HD>89 Charged in Online Child Porn Network</HD>
<DH>Crime: The FBI, in its most aggressive crackdown yet, says 20-state
ring swapped images through Yahoo.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<AU>KAREN KAPLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Marking the most aggressive and widespread government crackdown
over online obscenity, federal investigators on Monday charged more than
89 people--including Little League coaches, eight clergy members, a
school bus driver and at least one police officer--with belonging to a
20-state child pornography ring that met and swapped explicit images
through Yahoo Inc.</LD>
<LD>   The FBI said it had arrested 19 people in recent days, bringing the
total to 40 in the last 14 months as part of its "Operation Candyman." At
least 50 more arrests are expected this week.</LD>
<LD>   The arrests come amid a stepped-up attack on child exploitation by the
Department of Justice and state officials eager to crack down on Internet
pornography.</LD>
<TE>   Beginning next month, a Pennsylvania law will hold Internet service
providers criminally liable if the companies do not block any site that
the state attorney general's office deems to offer child pornography.</TE>
<TE>'A New Marketplace . . . Has Emerged'</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say their goal is to close off a growing maze of Internet
back alleys they say have made children more susceptible than ever to
sexual exploitation.</TE>
<TE>   "It is clear that a new marketplace for child pornography has emerged
in the dark corners of cyberspace," Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft said at a
news conference at FBI headquarters. "Hidden in the vastness of the
Internet, innocent boys and girls have been targeted by offenders who
view them as sexual objects. These offenders have tried to use technology
and anonymity of the Internet to trade child pornography, and these
individuals must be stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians and the high-tech industry worry that such a
crackdown could be taken too far, and note that even the federal
definition of "child pornography" is under review by the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law makes it a crime to sell or possess "any visual depiction"
that seems to show a sex act--simulated or real--involving an actor who
appears to be a minor. Congress later expanded the definition to include
even "computer-generated images," such as cartoons and video games, that
portray minors in apparent sexual positions.</TE>
<TE>   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor expressed skepticism during
a hearing last year. She questioned whether the Oscar-winning film
"Traffic" could fall under the law's broad definition of illegal
pornography. One scene portrays the underage daughter of an official in
the war on drugs apparently having sex with a drug dealer.</TE>
<TE>   "The language is extremely open to interpretation," said attorney H.
Louis Sirkin, who represents the Free Speech Coalition, a collection of
adult-film makers that is challenging the federal statute in the Supreme
Court. "Is it child pornography when there's no real child involved?"</TE>
<TE>   The computer files targeted in "Operation Candyman" involved images
that are "very explicit . . . hard-core sexual exploitation of our
children," said Michael Heimbach of the FBI's Crimes Against Children
unit. FBI officials declined to say if the material swapped and sought in
three Yahoo discussion groups contained photos, videos, animation or any
files with audio.</TE>
<TE>   Like music fans with Napster, tens of millions of Internet users have
transformed the club and community sections of Yahoo's "EGroup" networks
into havens for swapping hard-core images.</TE>
<TE>   "We applaud the efforts of the Department of Justice and the FBI in
apprehending individuals who engage in the creation and online
distribution of illegal content," said Yahoo spokeswoman Mary Osako.</TE>
<TE>Group Claimed About 4,600 U.S. Members</TE>
<TE>   Yahoo officials have acknowledged that their members have created
virtual red-light districts, just as others have built virtual
communities focused on snowboarding and needlepoint.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Yahoo groups depicted itself this way: "This group is for
People who love kids. You can post any type of messages you like too or
any type of pics and vids you like too." One of the groups was dubbed
"Candyman," and the other two have not been identified because
investigators still are tracing suspects through their e-mail addresses.</TE>
<TE>   The "Candyman" group claimed more than 7,000 members, including about
4,600 in the United States, the FBI said. It's not clear if each of those
members is a unique individual, or if there are cases of one person
having multiple accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI did not disclose a full list of the people charged in this
case or if any of the suspects come from Southern California, which is
considered the capital of the commercial adult-film industry.</TE>
<TE>   Identifying, charging and arresting the thousands of people affected
by Monday's action could take several months. The FBI hasn't decided
whether to pursue the roughly 2,400 group members in other countries, the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Those charged so far include a foster parent, two Catholic priests,
and medical, educational, military and law enforcement professionals,
according to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   One of the suspects is Father Thomas A. Rydzewski, an associate pastor
at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen in Baltimore. Arrested on Dec. 13, he
was charged with possession of child pornography. Rydzewski told the FBI
that he "has long had a curiosity" about child pornography and that he
sometimes connected to Internet newsgroups that promote it.</TE>
<TE>   In Las Vegas, the FBI arrested Beckham Baker, a 23-year-old teacher's
aide at a day-care facility, Special Agent Gayle Jacobs said. Baker was
arrested Feb. 7 on one count of possessing child pornography and one
count of receiving it. He was arrested six weeks ago because he works
with children and is considered more of a threat, though he is free on
bail, Jacobs said.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI said Monday that 27 of the people arrested in conjunction with
"Operation Candyman" have admitted to molesting more than 36 children.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1995, a Boston-based FBI task force dubbed "Innocent Images" has
been focused on proliferation of child pornography and other harmful and
exploitative material on the Internet. FBI investigators in Houston
joined the task force and initiated the investigation into the Candyman
Internet group early last year. The investigation quickly expanded to
include two other Yahoo EGroups. It's not clear whether all 89 people
charged Monday were members of the Candyman group.</TE>
<TE>States Follow Federal Government's Lead</TE>
<TE>   Monday's news follows last year's "Operation Avalanche," in which
about 100 people were arrested by the FBI in a two-year undercover sting.
U.S. officials later forwarded the names of 9,000 Web subscribers to
local authorities because of the users' "predilection" for child
pornography.</TE>
<TE>   "We will diligently shut down any and all Web sites, EGroups, bulletin
boards and any other mediums that will foster the continued exploitation
of our children," said FBI Director Robert Mueller.</TE>
<TE>   Some states are following the federal cue. Pennsylvania's law requires
hundreds of Internet service providers such as America Online and
EarthLink to remove or disable access to child pornography within five
days of being notified by the state attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Surprisingly, the ACLU's Pennsylvania chapter praised the bill, noting
that an Internet user whose access is cut off could seek redress in
court.</TE>
<TE>   But technology executives countered that tracking such sites can be a
herculean task on the anonymous, global network.</TE>
<TE>   "This is technically impossible for us to do," said Sue Ashdown,
director of the American Internet Service Provider Assn., an organization
of small ISPs.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with AOL said they have scheduled meetings with the
Pennsylvania attorney general's office to discuss the law, said company
spokesman Nicholas Graham.</TE>

<DL>CLEAR LAKE, Iowa
</DL>
<LD>After the summer of green ice cubes, folks here were fed up.</LD>
<LD>   The lovely lake at the center of this resort town in the cornfields
had been growing murkier for years. In the summer of 1977, it turned
green--neon green--and smelled putrid. "If you lived on the lake, you
were a block too close," one resident recalled. Another scowled at the
memory of ice made from tap water drawn from the lake. "It adversely
affected the scotch," he grumbled.</LD>
<LD>   Locals began demanding answers. It took 25 years to get them--as the
water turned ever more cloudy--but they know now why Clear Lake does not
live up to its name.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is agricultural pollution. And it's not Clear Lake's
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Across the nation, excess fertilizer and animal manure are washing off
fields and pastures, poisoning fish, upending the ecology in lakes and
rivers and forcing cities that draw drinking water from suspect sources
to spend heavily on treatment.</TE>
<TE>   There are occasional attention-grabbing disasters, such as a pipeline
rupture that spewed liquid ammonia fertilizer into the northern Iowa
countryside in December, poisoning 49 miles of prairie streams and
killing nearly 1.3 million fish.</TE>
<TE>   The more insidious culprit, however, is the quiet, chronic erosion
that sweeps soil, manure and fertilizer into watersheds to be carried
downstream.</TE>
<TE>   Farms aren't the only, or even the primary, source of water pollution.
Just last week, the U.S. Geological Survey announced that traces of birth
control hormones, cough suppressant, insect repellent and other chemicals
used or excreted by humans were found in rivers across the nation.
Industrial waste is a huge problem as well.</TE>
<TE>   But there is growing recognition that the fields that roll, lush and
bountiful, across the heartland can cause as much ecological harm as a
factory belching fumes.</TE>
<TE>   That recognition is embodied in the federal farm bill being debated in
Congress. Runoff can be reduced by restoring wetlands, creating buffers
between farms and rivers and keeping crop residue on the fields after
harvests to anchor the soil and prevent erosion. The farm bill would step
up incentives for farmers to take those measures.</TE>
<TE>   A more controversial proposal would cap farm subsidies to try to
prevent the consolidation that has created ever-larger agricultural
operations; some environmentalists believe the biggest problems come from
the biggest farms.</TE>
<TE>   In Iowa--where 92% of the land is in agriculture--lawmakers also are
going after pollution more aggressively than environmentalists have ever
seen. The state Legislature has appointed a 12-member task force to draft
bills that will better "balance the needs of agriculture and the
livestock industry with the needs of the rest of the people," Republican
state Sen. Stewart Iverson said.</TE>
<TE>   Iverson calls that balance "decent" now. There are many, however, who
would disagree.</TE>
<TE>   Traces of the antibiotics fed to livestock and excreted in their
manure have been found in streams. Iowa's lakes contain more fertilizer
pollutants than most any in the world, according to John Downing, a
professor of aquatic ecology at Iowa State University. The rivers that
provide tap water to Des Moines are so loaded with farm runoff that the
city installed the world's biggest nitrate filter a decade ago. They use
it only when the nitrate load gets so high that it could endanger public
health. Some years, that averages twice a week.</TE>
<TE>   The effects extend far beyond Iowa's borders. Agricultural runoff
flushed down the Mississippi River from this state and Illinois is the
biggest source of the enormous "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico--an
expanse of water the size of Massachusetts that's too polluted to support
aquatic life.</TE>
<TE>   "Because Iowa is so green, it's hard to understand that [its
landscape] is really the most changed of all 50 states," said Barbara
MacGregor, director of the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, a land
preservation group. "Nearly all the wetland, the prairie, the natural
parts of the state have been turned into cropland." The cropland is then
scraped and churned, sprayed with herbicides and liquid hog manure.</TE>
<TE>   That turns it into some of the most productive acreage in the nation.
It also loosens the topsoil until it's easily blown away--and with it,
all the excess nutrients and chemicals that the crops have not absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   Mitigating that impact will be delicate. Farm lobbying groups warn
that too much regulation will send agricultural production--and jobs and
taxes--to other states, or to South America. And if Big Agriculture goes,
"what's the alternative" for Iowa? asks Kevin Vinchattle, executive
director of the Iowa Poultry Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Many Iowans insist they don't want an alternative. They are proud to
be among the nation's top producers of eggs, hogs, corn and soybeans.
They just don't want dirty water because of it. "The excuse has always
been that this is what you put up with in a farm state," the Des Moines
Register wrote in an editorial last fall. "That excuse isn't good enough
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Public outrage has coalesced around the huge livestock feedlots that
have come to dominate animal agriculture in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials say market forces make such consolidation vital.
And they maintain that good management can control the flies, dust and
odor that come when thousands of pigs or millions of chickens are
confined in one lot. Neighbors, though, complain of stenches so
unbearable they have to plug the keyholes in their doors. They also are
concerned about the effect on water quality.</TE>
<TE>   Most feedlots store their manure in huge open lagoons, easily two or
three times the size of a football field. From time to time, they drain
some of the manure and sell it to farmers, who spray it on their fields
as fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa requires every feedlot to develop a "manure management plan,"
detailing how the waste will be handled. That gives the state a chance to
make sure farmers are not spreading too much manure on any one field.</TE>
<TE>   And that, in turn, should limit runoff of excess manure, which can be
deadly to aquatic life.</TE>
<TE>   But the state officials who review the manure-disposal plans are so
far behind that there's a backlog of at least 900 plans--and no timetable
for catching up. The state is also hard-pressed to carry out mandatory
annual inspections of the manure pits. There are just eight inspectors to
check 850 lagoons. In the last three years, there have been at least 40
manure spills from Iowa feedlots, according to the Izaak Walton League, a
national conservation group.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly alarmed, citizens are fighting back.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest battles took place here in northern Iowa last
month, when an egg company proposed putting 2.4 million hens near a
wetland a few miles south of Clear Lake. Furious locals protested--and
won. The company withdrew.</TE>
<TE>   Even before that dispute, Clear Lake had become a potent symbol of the
environment under siege.</TE>
<TE>   The lake draws tourists from all over Iowa; over the years, the
degradation has been obvious. Older fishermen remember the lake as so
clear they could watch bass take their bait 10 feet below the surface.
Swimmers today are lucky if they can make out their toes while they're
standing ankle-deep.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Iowa State University researchers finally pinpointed the
culprit: phosphorus pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Phosphorus is a key plant nutrient. But when too much is applied to
crops or lawns--in the form of manure or fertilizer--the excess drains
into the watershed. Around here, it ends up in Clear Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Phosphorus is not a human health hazard. (And in any case, the town no
longer gets its drinking water from the lake.) But the nutrient sets off
a chain reaction that has devastated the aquatic ecology here.</TE>
<TE>   Algae feed on the phosphorus, growing like mad. That turns the lake
green and murky. It also chokes off the oxygen that aquatic plants need
to survive. When the vegetation dies, so do the fish that rely on it for
habitat. (Hence, the foul odor of decay that was especially bad in the
summer of 1977 and has returned, on and off, ever since.)</TE>
<TE>   A few numbers from state biologist James Wahl tell the story. Half a
century ago, there were more than 50 species of plants in Clear Lake. By
the 1980s, there were 20. A survey last year found just 12.</TE>
<TE>   In the new ecosystem, bottom-feeding species such as carp and bullhead
have thrived. But the fish most valued by anglers--bass, walleye and
bluegill--have been hit hard by the shrinking habitat. To maintain Clear
Lake as a top fishing spot, the state has stocked it with 17 million
walleye a year, as well as thousands of other sport fish.</TE>
<TE>   There is a plan to fix all this. But it will cost $16 million--and
require local farmers to change the way they work.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fighting a lot of social attitudes, a lot of, 'This is the way
my dad did it and my granddad did it,' " said Kevin Baskins, a state
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is to set up an incentive program that will pay farmers to
use less phosphorus and to stop tilling their fields after each crop, a
practice that leaves the soil vulnerable to erosion. The state hopes to
send out experts who can determine exactly how much fertilizer each acre
needs, so less excess runs into the watersheds.</TE>
<TE>   Farmer Dave Hansen is all for it. He already refrains from tilling,
and says his harvests are as good as ever. He has joined a federal
conservation program that pays him to return some of his most
erosion-prone land to wild prairie. But he says "it's like pulling hen's
teeth" to get his neighbors to try such practices.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to pollute, but you have to make a living," fellow
farmer Matt Knutson explained. He said the plan will work only if the
incentives are generous: "If you can show people how they can make money
doing it a new way, they will."</TE>
<TE>   Inspired in part by the Clear Lake saga, state lawmakers are
considering setting limits on how much phosphorus farmers can apply on
their fields. They also are weighing restrictions on big feedlots. And
across the state, citizens are demanding that their local lakes and
rivers be analyzed with an eye toward restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an agricultural state and it's always going to be an
agricultural state," said Charles MacNider, a local businessman. "But we
are going to have to figure out how to have agriculture here without
profound negative impacts on the environment. It's going to be a
struggle. But at least the debate has been joined."</TE>

<DL>HARLAN, Ky.
</DL>
<LD>A second day of heavy rain in the hills of Kentucky and Tennessee
triggered floods and mudslides Monday that destroyed dozens of homes and
forced people to flee by boat as water lapped at the rooftops.</LD>
<LD>   Tennessee authorities blamed at least six deaths on the storm, which
dumped as much as 6 inches of rain on the region Sunday. Showers are
expected over the next couple of days.</LD>
<LD>   Flash flooding early Monday in the riverfront town of Cumberland, Ky.,
sent a trailer plunging over a 50-foot embankment with a family inside. A
tearful Jacqueline Bellofatto recounted how she survived the fall and
then searched frantically for her 7-year-old daughter in the mud and
rain.</LD>
<TE>   "I just started yelling for her and she wasn't there," said
Bellofatto, who began digging in the mud beneath the trailer. "I just dug
her out with my hands. She was buried alive."</TE>
<TE>   Once the daughter was found safe, Bellofatto, her husband, Scott,
their daughter and 4-year-old son struck out for a neighbor's home to
seek help. "We were finding out with each step that we took we would sink
down to our chest in the mud," Bellofatto said.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout Kentucky, at least 250 homes were damaged or destroyed.
Authorities ordered the evacuations of a string of communities in the
Cumberland River basin, where rooftops could be seen protruding from the
murky water.</TE>
<TE>   "The water came up so fast that we didn't have time to save anything,"
said Kimberly Evans, who was forced from her home in Dayhoit. "All we can
do now is wait until we can get back in and see what we can salvage."</TE>
<TE>   Officials called the flooding in eastern Kentucky the worst in the
region in 25 years. National Guard troops were sent in with three boats,
three trucks and a Humvee to assist with evacuations.</TE>
<TE>   Most school systems in the region were closed. Water lapped at the
steps of a vocational school outside Pineville, covered two school buses
and inundated a $12-million golf course.</TE>
<TE>   In Tennessee, where the brunt of the storm had passed, two people
drowned crossing swollen creeks and a family of three died in a traffic
accident on rain-slickened Interstate 24. A traffic death in Nashville
also was blamed on the flooding.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly three dozen roads were still under water in Sevier County and
dozens more in Blount, Knox and surrounding counties.</TE>
<TE>   In southwestern Virginia, at least 15 people were driven from their
homes in the town of Saltville after more than 4 inches of rain caused
flooding along the Clinch and Holston rivers. Flood waters from the Guest
River also forced evacuations in Coeburn, Va.</TE>
