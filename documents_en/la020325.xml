<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when many older Americans rushed to join HMOs,
attracted by generous prescription drug plans that promised to save
them money. Now many seniors are suffering from sticker shock, as
Medicare HMOs are asking members to pay more for drugs and, in some
cases, requiring them to use less-costly generics instead of
brand-name medications.</LD>
<LD>   HMOs complain that they had no choice. Drug prices keep rising and
doctors are writing more prescriptions at the same time that the
federal government gets more frugal in its Medicare payments to
health plans. One HMO spokesman said that while U.S. drug costs have
been rising more than 10% a year, government reimbursements for drugs
under the Medicare program have risen only about 2% a year for the
past three years.</LD>
<LD>   There are plenty of examples of the Medicare benefit cutbacks.
Last year, for example, Pacificare's Secure Horizons HMO provided up
to $2,000 a year in brand-name drugs to members in Los Angeles County
and an unlimited supply of less-costly generic drugs. This year, the
total benefit is capped at $2,000, for both brand names and generics.
For any prescription, a 90-day supply now requires a $50 co-payment,
up from $30 last year.</LD>
<TE>   The situation is different for Secure Horizons members in Orange
County. The HMO is providing unlimited access to generic drugs but is
providing no coverage for brand-name drugs--meaning members must pay
the full cost out of their own pockets. A 90-day supply of a generic
medication has an $18 co-payment, up from $14. In some California
counties, Secure Horizons now requires members to pay a $50 monthly
membership premium; there are no such premiums in Los Angeles or
Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   The changes strike the sickest patients especially hard, including
those with Alzheimer's disease. Consider the cost of four commonly
prescribed Alzheimer's drugs: Aricept, $151 a month; Cognex, $176;
Exelon, $151 and Reminyl, $146. There are no generic equivalents for
these four medications, so many families now must pay the full tab
for medications that their HMOs once paid for. It can be a heavy
burden, because many Alzheimer's patients also have other chronic
ailments, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure, that require
medications. "Our families are being hurt," said Peter Braun,
executive director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Alzheimer's
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the Alzheimer's Assn. and other advocacy groups met
in Sacramento recently to discuss these problems. But money is tight
in both the state and federal capitols, so help from the government
is unlikely. The groups decided to mount a campaign to promote public
awareness of the prescription drug problem for seniors. California is
hit hard by this issue because about 35% to 40% of the state's
Medicare recipients belong to HMOs, compared to a nationwide figure
of about 14%. Traditionally, California seniors enjoyed rich HMO
benefits, with no premiums and virtually unlimited drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   HMOs traditionally enjoyed a warm welcome in California. Many
residents grew up with Kaiser Permanente, the pioneering HMO that
dates back to World War II. They were used to receiving care within a
tightly controlled network of doctors and hospitals. In addition,
federal payments provided to Medicare HMOs in California were
generous compared to other U.S. regions. The government provides a
fixed monthly payment for each person who joins a Medicare HMO, based
on local medical costs. California has comparatively high medical
costs, so HMOs received higher payments.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, California became a magnet for aggressive health
insurers that sought out Medicare HMO members because, for a time, it
was a very lucrative business. As the Medicare business has become
less attractive to profit-conscious insurers, the once-rich benefits
enjoyed by California seniors are eroding.</TE>
<TE>   Many Medicare beneficiaries are in "a bad situation," said Clare
Smith, executive director of California Health Advocates, a
counseling and advocacy group. "The people who are the sickest are
the ones who take the most medications."</TE>
<TE>   Some help is available for consumers. California law says that
anyone enrolled in Medicare is entitled to the same discount the
state of California pays when it buys drugs under the Medi-Cal
program for the poor. Beneficiaries should show the druggist the
Medicare card to receive the discount. It is important to increase
public awareness. A recent study indicated many people who are
eligible don't know about the program and don't get the discount.</TE>
<TE>   Under a bill approved last year, SB 696, California is negotiating
now with pharmaceutical firms to provide additional discounts on
medications for Medicare beneficiaries. State Sen. Jackie Speier,
author of the law, also is talking with drug companies about creation
of a "Golden Bear" discount card that would include the separate
discount programs offered by individual drug makers.</TE>
<TE>   Information on the state's discount program for Medicare
beneficiaries is available at www.aging.ca.gov. On the Web site, look
for the line reading, "Californians on Medicare can now get
prescriptions at Medi-Cal prices." Click on this, which takes you to
the page with a price calculator to look up the discount for 200
popular drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Savings may be as sizable as 20% off the usual retail price.
Health insurance counseling and advocacy organizations provide help
with Medicare and insurance questions. The statewide number is (800)
434-0222 and the Web site is www.healthadvocates.org. Individual
pharmaceutical companies have discount cards. However, they are
limited to people who do not have current drug coverage, meaning HMO
members would be ineligible.</TE>
<TE>   Novartis, for example, offers discounts of 25% to 40% on its
drugs. Medicare beneficiaries are eligible if they do not have drug
coverage. Income limits are $26,000 for an individual and $35,000 for
a couple. For information, call (866) 974-2273 or go to the company's
Web site at www.novartis.com/carecard.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Lilly ([877] 795-4559, www.lilly.com), Pfizer ([800] 717-6005
or www.pfizerforliving.com) and GlaxoSmithKline ([888] 672-6436) also
have various discount programs.</TE>
<TE>   Another drug maker, Merck Medco, offers a mail-order discount
program. Call (877) 733-6765 or go to the company's Web site at
www.yourrxplan.com. The AARP offers mail-order discounts to members.

<HD>Trauma Therapy's New Focus</HD>
<DH>EMDR uses eye movements to ease patients' emotional
distress. Skeptics suggest a placebo effect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LINDA MARSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watching a therapist's hands move back and forth in front of your
face while recalling painful memories may seem an unlikely way to
alleviate trauma. But hundreds of thousands of people have reportedly
tried the technique, and some psychologists--and their patients--say
it works.</LD>
<LD>   The therapy, called eye-movement desensitization reprocessing,
involves a combination of hand movements (or sometimes finger taps or
sounds), accompanied by verbal commands. The patient follows the
therapists' movements with his or her eyes while discussing the event
or problem that led the patient to seek help.</LD>
<LD>   "EMDR sounds like utter nonsense, but this weird thing has a
profound effect on people," says Dr. Bessel A. van der Kolk, a
professor of psychiatry at Boston University who has studied EMDR.</LD>
<TE>   Once employed mostly to treat severely traumatized patients, EMDR
is now used for such common problems as depression, loneliness, fear
of flying, claustrophobia and stage fright. Since it was first
devised by California psychologist Francine Shapiro in 1987, more
than 40,000 therapists in the United States and abroad have attended
EMDR workshops, and an estimated 2 million patients have been treated
with this technique, according to the EMDR Institute in Pacific
Grove, Calif., which conducts training workshops in the technique.</TE>
<TE>   Even though no one is quite sure how EMDR works, it has received
some notable endorsements. The American Psychological Assn., the
nation's primary professional organization for psychologists, has
determined that it's an effective treatment for civilian
post-traumatic stress disorder, and Kaiser Permanente, one of the
nation's biggest HMOs, uses the technique to treat patients at mental
health clinics in Northern California.</TE>
<TE>   EMDR's increasing acceptance is part of a larger trend in
psychotherapy. Conventional talk therapy, which can be a lengthy
process, has been augmented or supplanted by techniques that
emphasize problem-solving, such as cognitive behavioral therapy,
which tries to change abnormal reactions to ordinary stresses. Such
experiential techniques, which seem to help patients more quickly,
have been inspired by new insights into brain chemistry and how the
mind deals with trauma.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that if people can talk about something, they will
feel better--but we've discovered just talking doesn't necessarily
change your life," van der Kolk says. Today, psychotherapy has been
significantly influenced by research into the brain and how it
processes information. Many doctors and therapists, however, doubt
that EMDR is any more effective than other treatments. They point out
that the placebo effect, which is the belief that a treatment will
work, is quite potent in psychotherapy, especially with new
treatments. Patients expect a therapy to be effective, and because
they trust their therapists, it can become a self-fulfilling
prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   Skeptics also argue there's nothing unique about EMDR, and they
fault proponents for touting it as a major breakthrough. They contend
it's just a clever repackaging of existing therapies in which
patients are repeatedly exposed to sensations or objects they fear to
gradually diminish their anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   "Patch this together with the placebo effect, and it's not
surprising that it's helpful," says Richard J. McNally, a psychology
professor at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. "There are a
bunch of syndromes where EMDR does seem to work well--with PTSD,
phobias and panic disorder. But people are now using EMDR for
everything--even for improving golf games."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pinpointing, Treating Specific Traumas</TE>
<TE>   EMDR was first used on patients suffering from PTSD: Vietnam
veterans; victims of rape, incest or child abuse; and survivors of
natural disasters or traumatic events, like car accidents,
earthquakes, the shootings at Columbine High School and the Oklahoma
City bombing. And when terrorists attacked the Pentagon and the World
Trade Center, EMDR therapists traveled to Washington and New York to
counsel survivors, victims' families, and rescue and recovery
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Therapists who use the technique say it helps people come to terms
with their experience without being re-traumatized. "EMDR is much
more accurate than conventional therapy," says Steven V. Marcus, a
psychologist at Kaiser Hospital in Santa Clara.</TE>
<TE>   In an often-cited study funded by Kaiser and published in the
journal Psychotherapy in 1997, Marcus randomly assigned 67 PTSD
sufferers to either EMDR or standard treatment. At the end of three
sessions, 50% of the EMDR participants no longer met the criteria for
PTSD, compared to 20% receiving standard therapy. After treatment,
77% of the EMDR group no longer met the PTSD criteria, compared to
50% of those receiving standard therapy.</TE>
<TE>   "With EMDR," says Marcus, "you can pinpoint a specific trauma and
target that like a laser beam."</TE>
<TE>   This fast transformation is a large part of EMDR's appeal. When
Susan Rogers, a psychiatric social worker in Woodland Hills, attended
an EMDR workshop two years ago, she was asked to think about an event
in her life that was still painful. She remembered an incident 15
years earlier, when she was a graduate student at UCLA. A professor
had interrupted her during a practice interview with a client, taken
over the session himself and afterward told her that she'd never be a
good therapist.</TE>
<TE>   During the EMDR session, she was instructed to think about the
episode while watching the therapist's hand as he waved it back and
forth like a metronome. The therapist then told her to think about
how she'd like her mental picture to change.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, his [the professor's] head behind the desk got
as big as a balloon and then it just popped into little pieces, and
he wasn't there anymore," Rogers recalls. Within five minutes, she
says, her feelings of shame and resentment evaporated, and the
incident no longer bothers her.</TE>
<TE>   EMDR may work so quickly by focusing on specific disturbing
incidents, as opposed to traditional talk therapy that tends to be
more wide-ranging.</TE>
<TE>   "EMDR can help resolve all kinds of trauma--anything that has
stuck with someone that is controlling his or her emotional life at a
subconscious level," says Ronald M. Doctor, a professor of psychology
at Cal State Northridge. "Emotions that have been cut off or
repressed can be brought to the surface. Reliving them in a safe
place--the therapist's office--somehow relieves the blockage and
creates alternative networks in the brain."</TE>
<TE>   When people are threatened, the body secretes stress hormones,
like adrenaline. Brain scans of rats reveal that prolonged
bombardment by stress hormones shrivels the hippocampus, the part of
the brain where memories are stored. Similar tests of combat veterans
suffering from PTSD showed a marked decrease in the size of their
hippocampi, too, which were restored to normal levels when the stress
was relieved.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists such as van der Kolk speculate that an oversupply of
stress hormones interfere with the normal processing of traumatic
events. They say these memories become stored in the wrong place in
the brain's memory banks, which accounts for the flashbacks,
nightmares, anxiety and constant feeling that they are reliving their
trauma again and again--all symptoms of PTSD.</TE>
<TE>   Life's everyday stresses can have similar, though not quite as
pronounced, effects, say experts like Cal State's Doctor. A critical
parent, social ostracism during high school or an abusive boss can
eventually add up to trauma that is imprinted in the brain. Then,
when people are confronted by comparable situations, they become
gripped by seemingly senseless fears, paralyzing claustrophobia or
performance anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   One Hollywood writer and director was on the verge of landing a
huge assignment. But based on unsatisfying past experiences, he
worried that he wouldn't be given the freedom to do the job the way
he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew this wasn't productive, but I was anxious and lost sleep
chewing this over in my mind," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   His therapist suggested EMDR as a way of resolving these feelings.
During a 90-minute session, the therapist asked him to think about
why this job possibility was so upsetting. Then she told him to focus
on a better outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped obsessing and torturing myself, and did in a day what
would have taken a year in regular therapy," says the 59-year-old Los
Angeles man, who asked that his name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Connection Between Eye Movements and Brain</TE>
<TE>   A typical EMDR session begins with the therapist asking the
patient to envision a safe place he or she can call to mind should
the person feel threatened. The patient is then told to think of the
disturbing experience while focusing on the therapist's hand
movements (or sounds or taps). The therapist then asks the patient to
talk about the image and the feelings about it. Next, the client
returns to the distressing image and is told to imagine a better
solution. The patient is then asked his or her feelings to the
solution.</TE>
<TE>   After repeating these steps several times, many patients say
they're able to distance themselves from the traumatic experience.</TE>
<TE>   Even scientists who say EMDR works can't explain how it alleviates
the effects of trauma. But, after three or four sessions, brain scans
of 12 people with post-traumatic stress disorder showed changes in
the brain regions that govern emotion, memory and impulse control,
says van der Kolk, who conducted the research.</TE>
<TE>   "The eye movements seem to cause a shift in the cognitive
processes," says Shapiro, a senior research fellow at the Mental
Research Institute, a nonprofit training and research center in Palo
Alto. Shapiro stumbled upon the technique while out for a walk about
15 years ago. She noticed that rapidly moving her eyes back and forth
eased her disturbing thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   This eye flicking seems to mimic the rapid eye movements of REM
sleep, that deep sleep stage when we dream and process the events of
the day. But eye movements aren't the only way to diminish a trauma's
emotional sting. Different types of stimulation were introduced in
1990 when other therapists found they could get the same results
using gentle finger taps or tones. Activating both sides of the
brain--whether it's done with eye movements, taps or sounds--seems to
be the key element in turning on information processing systems in
the brain, according to Shapiro.</TE>
<TE>   Still, EMDR has primarily been studied in people who have been
severely traumatized. Donna Bowers, for one, spent nearly 10 years in
traditional talk therapy to find some relief from flashbacks, panic
attacks, nightmares, insomnia and anxiety--all of which were the
emotional fallout from years of physical, emotional and sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Therapy helped me to understand why I felt this way," says the
46-year-old Placentia woman. "But it did nothing to relieve my
physiological symptoms. I woke up afraid. I went to sleep afraid. and
I was so crippled emotionally that it took all my strength and
courage to get through every day."</TE>
<TE>   She decided to try EMDR at her therapist's suggestion.</TE>
<TE>   After six weeks, Bowers no longer suffered from the panic attacks
and anxiety that plagued her all her life, and she says a year of
EMDR sessions helped clear away much of the debris left by a damaging
childhood.</TE>
<TE>   "EMDR gave me my life back," says Bowers, now a therapist herself.
"I no longer live in the shadow of my past."</TE>

<LD>Swiping your credit card at the pump burns only five fewer calories
than walking into the gas station to pay. Opening a bag of pre-sliced
veggies expends just 12 fewer calories than washing, slicing and
chopping fresh ones. Riding the elevator uses 15 fewer calories than
climbing three flights of stairs.</LD>
<LD>   But add up the energy it takes to do these and 17 other common
tasks in a sedentary manner--and compare the result with the calories
burned performing the same tasks actively--and the difference is the
energy equivalent of 2 1/2 pounds of body fat over a month and 30
pounds over a year, says a Dallas epidemiologist who is a pioneer in
the growing movement to "jump-start" our increasingly obese,
sedentary society.</LD>
<LD>   "When you expend a little less energy doing numerous tasks over
time, the end result can be a substantial weight change," says Steven
N. Blair, director of research at the Cooper Institute, which was
founded in 1970 to study the effects of exercise on health. Blair
also served as senior scientific editor for the landmark U.S. Surgeon
General's 1996 Report on Physical Activity and Health, which
concluded that a modest amount of moderate exercise could reduce the
risk of numerous chronic diseases including heart disease, type 2
diabetes, hypertension and some cancers.</LD>
<TE>   Though much of the debate surrounding America's obesity epidemic
focuses on our "super size" junk food diet, Blair says the major--and
often unrecognized--culprit is the "gradual ratcheting down of daily
life activity." In a recent editorial in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings,
he blames our widening waistlines on the dramatic decline in daily
energy expenditure that has resulted from increased mechanization on
the job, labor-saving devices at home and changing cultural practices
such as online shopping, drive-up windows and "cocooning" with videos
and mega-channel TV.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people don't realize how very sedentary our lives have
become," Blair says. "But if we burn even 100 fewer calories each
day, that's the energy equivalent of 10 pounds of fat in a year."</TE>
<TE>   Blair contends that America's diet and leisure-time exercise
habits have changed little during the past few decades. Dietary
surveys and other data collected by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture "[suggest] that energy intake in the United States has
not increased during the past 40 years," he writes. Studies of
physical activity habits only assess participation in leisure-time
sports and fitness activities, says Blair, who adds that these
numbers have remained constant over the last 25 years.</TE>
<TE>   America's alarming girth growth, say Blair and numerous other
health experts, is directly related to "physical activity being
engineered out of daily life." In our computerized, remote-control
culture--in which moving walkways whisk travelers through airports
and doors fly open as if by magic--Blair says the average adult
expends about 300 to 700 fewer calories per day than our parents did.
Although numerous studies have demonstrated that lifestyle
activities, such as climbing stairs and parking in the farthest
space, can provide health benefits similar to those gained in a gym
workout, Blair says our society has created a "toxic environment"
that discourages movement. Streets are often too dangerous for
pedestrians to cross, stairwells are frequently hidden, and parks in
some areas are unsafe.</TE>
<TE>   "Obesity is an environmental issue," says John Foreyt, director of
the behavioral medicine research center at Baylor College of Medicine
in Houston. "Westernized nations have unlimited access to
good-tasting, calorically dense foods and very little energy
expenditure during a typical day. This 'obesogenic' environment is
completely opposite to the one that shaped human evolution." Our
ancestors evolved effective mechanisms to store fat in case of
famine, he says, which may now make us less able to shed fat in times
of plenty.</TE>
<TE>   Although Foreyt agrees that Americans expend about 300 fewer
calories per day than previous generations, he disagrees with Blair's
assertion that food consumption has remained steady. "Studies show
we're eating up to 200 calories more per day than we did just 10
years ago," Foreyt says. If current trends continue, he estimates
that everyone in America will be obese by 2230.</TE>
<TE>   Foreyt and Blair are among a growing number of health experts
calling for public health initiatives to help Americans meet the U.S.
surgeon general's recommendation to accumulate 30 minutes of moderate
activity on most days. "Restoring physical activity into our daily
routine represents a critical goal," says pediatrician William Dietz,
director of the division of nutrition and physical activity at the
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. "This
may involve changes as mundane as improving the location and
appearance of stairwells or as complex as the redesign of
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Creating public health strategies to encourage better eating is
extremely difficult "because there's a lot of controversy over which
diets are best," says James O. Hill, director of the center for human
nutrition at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in
Denver. "But on the activity side it's simpler because everyone
agrees that Americans need to move more."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado will launch a major initiative to activate its citizens
this fall, says Hill, who co-wrote an editorial in the current issue
of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition urging public health
efforts to increase activities of daily living. The "Colorado on the
Move" campaign will encourage use of step counters by all citizens
older than 9 and urge everyone to take at least 2,000 more steps than
they've been getting--working their way up to 10,000 steps each day.
The pocket-sized electronic devices cost less than $10 and will be
provided free to people who can't afford them, says Hill, who adds
that the project already has funding from numerous corporate
sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wears a watch, so why not have everyone wear a step
counter?" he says. "They're nifty little devices that provide a
terrific incentive to walk more because they give you immediate
feedback on how much--or how little--you're moving."</TE>
<TE>   Two thousand steps represents about 15 minutes of walking--or
about one mile--and can be spread over the course of the day. "We
don't expect people to give up their garage door openers or other
conveniences," he says. "And we certainly haven't been very
successful in getting people to go to the gym. But this is a
relatively easy way to encourage people to move a little bit more."</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is to make this big deal statewide," Hill says.
"Businesses may give people a discount if they're wearing a step
counter. Schools may create programs using them." When people get
more active, he says, "they start feeling better, and it kick-starts
them to doing other healthy things." He believes the program could
save the state millions in health-care costs for disorders such as
type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado's campaign is part of a new, nationwide effort to
heighten awareness of the physical and economic costs of sedentary
living.</TE>
<TE>   "Physical inactivity costs America more than $150 billion a year,"
says Frank Booth, a physiologist at the University of Missouri,
Columbia, and executive director of Researchers Against
Inactivity-Related Disorders (www.ridinactivity.org), a 2-year-old
group of more than 300 health scientists and educators from around
the country who have "declared war on sedentary lifestyles."</TE>
<TE>   Booth has coined the term "sedentary death syndrome," or SeDS, to
help people recognize that a major cause of death in the U.S. is
sedentary living. He plans to travel to Capitol Hill this spring to
lobby for legislation and funding to help activate sedentary
Americans.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many potential strategies that could benefit everyone
involved," says Carlos Poston, an assistant professor of psychology
at the University of Missouri, Kansas City. "Insurance companies
could offer fit people discounts on life and health insurance the
same way they give breaks to nonsmokers." Work sites could offer
"stretch breaks," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   But most important, Poston says, is the effort by public health
groups to boost public awareness that small steps throughout the day
can significantly enhance health. "A lot of people feel helpless
about their weight," he says. "They need to know that even if they
don't lose a substantial number of pounds, adding movement into their
life can stop that steady creep of weight gain and dramatically
improve their health."</TE>
<TE>   This is a key message of the national Coalition for Promoting
Physical Activity (www.ncppa.org), a network of more than 150
organizations--including the American Heart Assn. and the American
College of Sports Medicine--that is seeking to increase physical
activity in America. Dallas epidemiologist Blair, a past president of
the 4-year-old organization, says people need help in removing social
barriers to becoming active. "In addition to counseling and advice
from health professionals, public health interventions and the
individual actions by more people," he says, "we need to consider
legislative and policy initiatives that will make it easier for more
people to lead healthy lifestyles."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While working in the emergency room of a large, urban hospital one
afternoon, I was pulled aside by a paramedic who told me that he and
his partner had just brought in an unresponsive patient from a nearby
high school. Picking up the patient's chart and my stethoscope, I
went to investigate.</LD>
<LD>   In medicine, the word "unresponsive" has bad connotations. It's a
general term that can stand for a wide variety of things, both
serious and not so serious. A patient can be unresponsive because he
or she is dead (here "unresponsive" is synonymous with "asystolic,"
meaning "without a heartbeat") or nearly dead, say from a large
stroke or a massive heart attack. "Unresponsive" is also used in a
patient with a systemic insult, such as low blood sugar or a drug
overdose, or in an asthmatic who is not sufficiently delivering
oxygen to the brain. Often the term is used loosely to describe
patients with end-state senility, psychotic disorders, blindness or
deafness--and those who are drunk or asleep.</LD>
<TE>   In this case, the patient was a teenage girl, and the main problem
was that she had been possessed by the devil just prior to an exam.
The prince of darkness had caused her to collapse onto the floor in
the middle of her classroom and to remain in a state of flaccid
unconsciousness despite efforts by her teacher, classmates and
paramedics to revive her. They had tried pinching, smelling salts,
sticking her with a safety pin and inserting objects into her nose.</TE>
<TE>   As Thomas Aquinas says: Satan is a most pernicious adversary, both
persistent and cunning, and loath to relinquish his hold once
obtained.</TE>
<TE>   Possession was a new experience for me.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Aquinas might know his way around the devil fairly well,
but when I entered the room wearing the mantle of modern medicine, I
didn't know what it was I was supposed to do. The paramedics had
checked her blood sugar and the oxygen content of her blood; both
were normal. The nurses had assured me that her vital signs were also
normal.</TE>
<TE>   My examination of the patient proved to me that she was breathing,
had reactive pupils, but wasn't responding to painful stimuli in any
extremity.</TE>
<TE>   The ER was busy and I had to make some quick decisions. Should I
order lab tests? Should I call a psychiatrist?</TE>
<TE>   I decided instead to rack my brain for more painful stimuli, and
my mind went back to stories I had read about the Spanish Inquisition
in high school. Fortunately, before I could get started, her father
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   He told me not to worry, that she had done this before. Dad, as it
turned out, was an evangelical minister at a local church.</TE>
<TE>   Thank goodness, I said to myself, glad that someone there could
take charge of the situation. I told him I was Jewish, but that I'd
love to help. (As a physician, I'm always on the lookout for learning
opportunities.) He assured me, however, that exorcism was a one-man
operation, so I resigned myself to watching. But as I was pulling up
a seat, other duties called and I had to leave the room.</TE>
<TE>   When I returned 15 minutes later, the devil had been banished, and
standing before me was a pretty, smiling teenager as responsive as
the day is long. Her father had sweated through his shirt and he
looked tuckered out, but stood defiantly with one arm around his
daughter's shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   One of my mandatory responsibilities in the emergency department
is to write discharge instructions for all my patients, usually a
rather mundane task. In this case, however, I sat hunched over the
discharge sheet, pen in hand, wondering what to write. Something
pithy, such as "Avoid Satan" sounded too tongue-in-cheek, and the
more ominous "Return to emergency department if your condition
worsens" seemed like an invitation for trouble. Finally I jotted down
"See your own physician for further problems."</TE>
<TE>   I was content to let it go at that.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors often encounter conditions they're not trained to treat.
In such cases, it's important to keep an open mind--and to remember
that not all problems are strictly medical in nature. Sometimes, a
little patience and understanding go a long way, even in the
emergency room.</TE>

<HD>The Colorful History of Pills Can Fill Many a Tablet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROSIE MESTEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We recently learned that the inventor of Life Savers candies was
inspired, in the early 20th century, to make his candy after
witnessing a pharmacist make pills with an old-fashioned pill
machine.</LD>
<LD>   All very fine and creative. But who, we'd like to know, invented
pills?</LD>
<LD>   Someone way, way back when, says George Griffenhagen, a retired
pharmacist with a penchant for history who resides in Vienna, Va.
(Griffenhagen has made quite a study of the pill question. He's even
written about pill history.) Pills, he says, date back to roughly
1500 BC--and they were presumably invented so that measured amounts
of a medicinal substance could be delivered to a patient. Earlier
than that--say, 4,000 years ago--recipes were generally for liquid
preparations. For instance, a tasty-sounding medicinal recipe
inscribed on an Assyrian clay tablet instructs the user to pulverize
various seeds, plant resins and leaves together--then dissolve them
in beer.</LD>
<TE>   The first pill references crop up in ancient Egyptian times,
Griffenhagen says. One famous set of papyruses is filled with medical
remedies, including pills made from bread dough, honey or grease.</TE>
<TE>   Plant powders, or other active ingredients, would be mixed with
these substances--then little balls, or pills, would be formed with
the fingers. (Early ingredients of pills included saffron, myrrh,
cinnamon, tree resins and a slew of other botanicals.)</TE>
<TE>   Not that the word "pill" was used then. In ancient Greece, the
round balls or other shapes were called katapotia (meaning "something
to be swallowed"). It was the Roman scholar Pliny--who lived from
23-79 AD--who first coined the word "pilula."</TE>
<TE>   Pills came in various sizes as well as flat and round, and other
assorted shapes (and, if they were anything like their modern
counterparts, some of them were doubtless large and nigh-impossible
to swallow). As far back as 500 BC, some were trademarked with
special indentations in the pills.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in medieval times, people would coat their pills with
slimy plant substances and other materials so they'd go down more
easily or taste less bitter.</TE>
<TE>   "They rolled them in spices, and later decided to put gold and
silver on them," says Griffenhagen. The latter, unfortunately,
rendered the pills pretty inert, since they'd pass right through the
digestive tract without releasing any of their medicinal compounds.
(Gilding of pills, amazingly, continued well into the 19th century.)</TE>
<TE>   Some early pills still exist in museums, such as a famous one
dating from 500 BC. that was known as Terra Sigillata--consisting of
clay from a particular island that was mixed with goat's blood then
shaped into pills. (Terra Sigillata was supposedly good for
practically everything that ails you, Griffenhagen says, including
dysentery, ulcers and gonorrhea.)</TE>
<TE>   Also residing in museums are pieces of ancient Roman pill-making
equipment, such as a stone in the British Museum. The stone has long
flat grooves into which the pill maker would press clay or other
substances to make long, snaky strings. Then the pill maker would
prize the strings out and cut them into discs to form pills--much the
way one cuts dough for cookies.</TE>
<TE>   Medicines in pill form were all the rage in 17th century England
and thereafter. Pill manufacturers were even granted special patent
rights from the king for their top-secret formulas.</TE>
<TE>   One famous patented product from the 18th century: "Hooper's
Female Pills," which were guaranteed to contain "the best purging and
anti-hysterik ingredients."</TE>
<TE>   And pills, of course, made their way over to the still-new United
States--which had its own set of patent-protected preparations,
courtesy of the U.S. Patent office--including Chase's Kidney-Liver
Pills, Cheeseman's Female Regulating Pills and (Griffenhagen's
personal favorite) Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.</TE>
<TE>   The old-fashioned, roll-and-cut kinds of pills had a drawback:
Their preparation required moisture.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, doctors were learning, this moisture could inactivate
the drugs contained therein.</TE>
<TE>   The 1800s saw a whole slew of innovations: sugar-coating and
gelatin-coating of pills--as well as the invention of gelatin
capsules. It also rang the death knell for the old, original pill
with the invention of the compressed tablet.</TE>
<TE>   In 1843, a Brit named William Brockedon invented a totally
different kind of pill. You'd put powder in a tube and then compress
it to solidity with a mallet.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, his invention caught on. "Pills as such are no longer
made," says Griffenhagen--with just a hint, we sense, of regret.</TE>

<HD>A Committed Battle to Save Teeth From Disease</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANNE PARTIE LANGE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gum disease is a major cause of tooth loss in adults, and many people
don't realize they have it until their dentist tells them they need
gum surgery, or worse, that a tooth must be pulled. Bacteria-laden
plaque is the cause, and when the infection is advanced, the tissues
and bone that hold the tooth in place are damaged. Once periodontal
disease reaches this stage, it was thought to be irreversible.</LD>
<LD>   Over the past several years, however, studies have found that
mechanically removing plaque from around the roots of the affected
tooth followed by antimicrobial treatment may save it.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers at the University of Michigan School of Dentistry have
been testing this nonsurgical approach for 20 years. What they didn't
know for certain was whether the technique provided temporary or
lasting benefits. Their most recent study, published in the Journal
of the American Dental Assn., found that the conservative treatment
worked for many of those who were still available for evaluation five
years later.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers followed a group of patients who had initially
been treated with debridement--removal of plaque and tartar from the
roots of affected teeth--three times or less within three months.
Twice, following the root-cleaning treatment, which is sometimes
called "scaling and root planing," they received a short course of
oral antimicrobial therapy with metronidazole (Flagyl), doxycycline
or a placebo. There was a 93% reduction in the need for periodontal
surgery, and 66% of teeth that would have been extracted were saved.
There was no difference between the two drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Over the next several years, the patients were supposed to have
scaling and root planing every three or four months. After the first
and second year, they also were given a week's supply of
metronidazole or a placebo. One group received no drug. But the
patients' compliance was erratic. Some returned for treatment only 11
times. At best, patients were seen 29 times.</TE>
<TE>   After five years, the researchers found the nonsurgical treatment
benefits were sustained. Among the 44 people who were still available
for evaluation, there was, on average, less than one tooth per person
needing surgery or extraction. That compared to the initial
recommendation of 8.7 teeth per person needing treatment. Those who
had taken the follow-up treatments of metronidazole were
significantly less likely to need surgery during the years of the
study.</TE>
<TE>   Sticking with a regular program of scaling and root planing might
be the hardest part. After five years, about half of the original 90
people were available for evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "In any long-term study, it's not surprising to lose about 10% of
the study subjects each year," says Walter J. Loesche of the
University of Michigan School of Dentistry in Ann Arbor. It may be
that those who stayed with the program had more incentive, he says.
They had an average of nearly 10 teeth in danger.</TE>
<TE>   Regular maintenance is a necessity if scaling and root planing
alone are to succeed, says Michael Lynch, director of scientific
information at the American Dental Assn. Another gem in the study,
says Lynch, is the discovery that the benefits of the nonsurgical
treatment were always tempered by smoking.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Acupuncture's Effect on Morning Sickness</TE>
<TE>   At least half of pregnant women have morning sickness, and for
many it can last all day. Nibbling on dry crackers and drinking herb
tea may help, but waiting weeks or months for it to pass can be
frustrating. For severe morning sickness, antinausea medications may
be needed.</TE>
<TE>   Now, an Australian study concludes that acupuncture, "especially
the traditional Chinese type," brings relief quickly. Researchers
have tried to evaluate benefits of acupuncture before, but this is
the largest study done in a scientific manner. It compared two
acupuncture techniques to sham acupuncture--that is, needles placed
in unrelated points--and no acupuncture.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 600 women less than 14 weeks along in a healthy pregnancy,
except for the nausea, were divided into groups for the four-week
study. Twice the first week and then weekly, one group received
traditional acupuncture, according to their individual Chinese
medicine diagnosis, with six needles or fewer. Another group received
acupuncture to only one point on the forearm believed to relieve
nausea. Those in the fake or sham group got needles in areas close to
the traditional acupuncture points. The fourth group got no
acupuncture but lots of advice on diet, using vitamin B6 and
lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the first week, those in the traditional acupuncture
group had less frequent bouts of nausea and dry retching, report the
researchers in the U.S. journal Birth. By the second week, those in
the single needle group were starting to feel better. By the third
week, some mothers-to-be in the sham group had less nausea than those
who got no acupuncture, indicating that there may be a placebo
benefit for some women. The researchers report that improvement
continued over time, especially for those who received traditional
acupuncture. Vomiting, however, was a persistent symptom in all the
women who had it.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers speculate that more frequent treatment might be
needed in women whose nausea is accompanied by vomiting. Edna Bates,
a spokeswoman for Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide, said
the research "provides women with an additional option to manage
their morning sickness without resorting to pharmacological agents."</TE>

<TE>   Sound-Wave Therapy Shows Promise Against Heel Pain</TE>
<TE>   The pain of plantar faciitis is unmistakable. It stabs at the
bottom of the heel the minute your foot hits the floor in the
morning. The tenderness usually improves as the tissue that supports
the underside of the foot stretches, but any activity that creates an
impact, like running to cross the street, may still be extremely
painful.</TE>
<TE>   Plantar faciitis is an inflammation of the thick connective tissue
that extends beneath the foot, fanning out from the heel to the toes.
Until recently, surgery was the last resort when stretching, heel
cushions, foot taping and pain pills failed. Now, your foot doctor
might suggest sound wave therapy.</TE>
<TE>   One device, the Ossa Tron, was approved more than a year ago, and
in January the Food and Drug Administration approved the Epos Ultra.
The FDA says both of the approved devices are only for people who
have had plantar faciitis that has persisted despite standard
treatment for at least six months.</TE>
<TE>   According to John A. Ogden, president of the International Society
for Musculoskeletal Shock Wave Therapy, there are about six devices
available in the Los Angeles area. A single treatment costs about
$3,000 to $3,500, which is not yet covered by most insurance
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The therapy works by bombarding the tough, dry, connective tissue
under the foot with rapid-fire sound waves. The energy from the sound
waves breaks up the tissue, creating little tunnels through which new
blood vessels can grow, explains Ogden, who is also director of
Orthopedics at the Atlanta Medical Center. After healing is complete,
the tissue has a much improved blood supply and becomes more elastic.
The therapy is easier on patients than surgery, which only works
about half the time.</TE>
<TE>   "You walk in, have the treatment, and walk out," Ogden says. No
crutches, no long healing period, no staying off the foot, except for
avoiding vigorous pounding activity for about a month. Treatment is
effective in about 60% of cases; about a third of those need two
treatments, he says.</TE>

<HD>Interesting Food Facts to Gnaw On</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We hadn't cleaned off our desk in a while and, when we finally did,
we found many items interesting enough to warrant discussion, but too
short to fill an entire column. Some of these nutrition facts may
come as a surprise.</LD>
<LD>   Among them:</LD>
<LD>   * Saltwater fish are no higher in sodium than freshwater fish
because they have an internal regulatory system that keeps the flesh
from taking up sodium from the water.</LD>
<TE>   * Three-fourths of the food on your plate should consist of
grains, vegetables, legumes and fruit, leaving just one-quarter for
meat, poultry or fish.</TE>
<TE>   * Americans get more vitamin C from oranges and orange juice than
any other food. But the following foods contain as much C as an
average orange: 1 cup of strawberries; one green bell pepper (red and
yellow peppers have even more); one kiwi; or 1 cup of cooked
broccoli, cauliflower or Brussels sprouts.</TE>
<TE>   * A 2-ounce croissant contains about 14 grams of fat and 260
calories. Compared to an English muffin, that's about 12 times as
much fat and twice as many calories.</TE>
<TE>   * Six strips of bacon contain 220 calories, 18 grams of fat (75%
of the calories are fat) and 600 milligrams of sodium.</TE>
<TE>   * Canned baked beans are usually low in fat, but be sure to check
the label. Some contain 3-4 grams of fat from pork or hydrogenated
vegetable oil in each 1/2-cup serving. Baked beans are loaded with
fiber but are also usually very high in sodium.</TE>
<TE>   * You should always drink the milk left over in your cereal bowl;
many vitamins that are used to fortify cereals wind up in the milk.</TE>
<TE>   * Spinach pasta has almost no spinach in it (less than a
tablespoon in a cup of cooked pasta), so it isn't any more nutritious
than regular pasta. However, it is pretty and does have a slightly
more interesting flavor than its more traditional cousin.</TE>
<TE>   * Read the labels on those newfangled pretzels trying to cash in
on the nonfat healthy-snack image of plain pretzels; some have
high-fat gimmicks added, like peanut butter, chocolate and nuts.</TE>
<TE>   * If you buy tofu, stay away from unwrapped tofu that is floating
in open, un-refrigerated trays of water. These are bacteria farms
that can make you sick if you don't cook the tofu well before eating
it. Look for commercially sealed packages.</TE>
<TE>   * If you want to feel full on as few calories as possible, look at
the following: Potatoes are the most filling food. Whole-grain bread
is 50% more filling than white bread. Oranges and apples outscore
bananas. Fish is more filling per calorie than lean beef or chicken.
Popcorn is twice as filling as a candy bar or peanuts.</TE>
<TE>   * If you have a particularly tough cut of meat, try rubbing half a
kiwi over it about 30 minutes before cooking.</TE>
<TE>   * Despite what your parents may have told you, nothing bad will
happen if you swallow your gum. It's made of a fiber that can't be
digested, so all you get out of it is the sugar or sugar substitute.</TE>
<TE>   * The average American consumes about 50% more than the
recommended daily allowance of protein.</TE>
<TE>   * Yogurt has more than twice as much calcium as cottage cheese
(300-450 milligrams per cup). That's also more than milk, and yogurt
can supply between 25% and 50% of most people's daily needs.</TE>
<TE>   * A slice of a traditional quiche provides about 48 grams of fat,
28 of which are saturated (more than half a day's supply of total
fat, and more than a whole day's worth of saturated fat); about 285
milligrams of cholesterol (about a day's worth).</TE>
<TE>   * One cup of steamed, chopped broccoli (stalks and florets)
provides 90% of the recommended daily allowance for vitamin A (as
beta carotene); 200% of the RDA for vitamin C; and 25% of your daily
fiber needs.</TE>
<TE>   * On average, Americans eat 50% more onions today than they did 15
years ago. Part of this is due to the increased popularity of various
ethnic cuisines. Even at that, the Japanese and the Europeans eat
lots more than we do.</TE>
<TE>   * Parsley is more than just a pretty garnish. Fresh parsley
contains quite a bit of beta carotene and vitamin C. In order to get
10% of the RDA, you need to eat about seven sprigs of it so try using
it as a salad green.</TE>

<HD>Shrinking Medicare Pinches Seniors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seniors will be hard pressed to find any good news or easy choices in
a just-released report on the quality of Medicare HMOs in California.</LD>
<LD>   The 2002 Guide to California Medicare HMOs provides a
report-card-like rating of every health plan on various measures,
including the quality of prescription drug benefits, out-of-pocket
costs and what members think about the plans.</LD>
<LD>   The study found a significant drop in the number of Medicare HMOs
operating in the state, as well as an overall decline in the ratings
of many of the remaining plans.</LD>
<TE>   "For a lot of seniors, Medicare HMOs remain the place to be, but
it's harder to make the right choice," said Ann Monroe, director of
medical quality programs for the California HealthCare Foundation, an
Oakland-based health care philanthropy and research group that
co-authored the study.</TE>
<TE>   During the past year, the number of Medicare HMOs in California
dropped nearly half, from 196 to 100.</TE>
<TE>   "We were surprised by the dramatic reduction. Some plans, like
Maxicare, are gone. Others have dropped certain counties," Monroe
said.</TE>
<TE>   Most plans have reduced their drug benefits, sometimes by
increasing what members must pay for prescriptions or requiring wider
use of generic drugs, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The landscape has changed dramatically, Monroe added, noting that
the HMOs in Los Angeles County that received the highest ratings last
year included Maxicare, UHP and SCAN Health plan, all of which have
encountered financial difficulties.</TE>
<TE>   Maxicare Health Plans, a long-troubled HMO, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Generally, what we are finding is that the plans that offered the
best coverage have not been able to sustain that over time," Monroe
said.</TE>
<TE>   The situation in Southern California is better than some other
parts of the state, where HMOs have quit the Medicare business,
limiting consumers' choice of plans, or slashed benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Medicare recipients in Los Angeles and Orange counties have nine
HMOs to choose among, and all but one Orange County plan offers a
prescription drug benefit.</TE>
<TE>   The comparative information about Medicare HMOs comes at a time
when a new federal "lock-in" policy will make it more difficult for
seniors to switch between traditional Medicare and the HMO option.
The new rules permit Medicare beneficiaries to change plans only once
between January and June 2002 and not at all between July 1 and Dec.
31.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, seniors could change plans each month.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of that flexibility makes for a dicier decision for
seniors. "Now that seniors will be locked in, do they bet that their
HMO plan, even though it is losing money, will turn around?" Monroe
said.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, a senior on multiple prescription drugs might opt
to join a financially weaker plan because it offers more generous
drug coverage, while a financially healthier plan might have fewer
drug benefits. "It's a terrible place for seniors to be," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Monroe suggests that seniors bear several factors in mind when
reviewing the quality report: Be certain the HMO's network includes
the doctors and hospitals you want; check the drug benefits to see if
brand-name or generic drugs are preferred; compare the plans' ratings
on managing chronic conditions, preventive care and financial health.</TE>
<TE>   The guide can be accessed on the Internet at www.calmedicare.org.
A free copy, in English or Spanish, is available by calling (888)
430-2423.</TE>
<TE>   More than 4 million California seniors are covered by Medicare,
about 1.5 million of whom currently belong to HMOs. The study was
released last week by Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports
magazine, and the California Healthcare Foundation.</TE>

<HD>Estrogen Lotion May Smooth Out Hot Flashes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARI ROAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Menopausal women may soon be able to alleviate their hot flashes with
a body lotion.</LD>
<LD>   Research presented Friday in L.A. showed that an estrogen lotion,
Estrasorb, reduced hot flashes in 85% of the women who used it. The
product's manufacturer, Novavax Inc., has asked the Food and Drug
Administration to approve the product for marketing, and it could
become available this year.</LD>
<LD>   Although the medication in Estrasorb, estradiol, can be found in
other types of hormone replacement products, such as pills and skin
patches, many women may prefer the lotion, said Dr. James Simon, a
clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington
University School of Medicine. Simon presented the data on the lotion
at the Society for Gynecologic Investigation meeting.</LD>
<TE>   "Women find this very appealing," he said. "It seems more natural
than taking a pill. I think women over age 50 also like it because
they have dry skin and are often already using a moisturizer."</TE>
<TE>   In the study, most women reported fewer hot flashes after four
weeks of use, and almost all of the women experienced an effect by 10
weeks. The side effects reported with Estrasorb are similar to those
seen in a small number of women taking any form of estradiol, such as
breast tenderness and breakthrough bleeding. Estrogen use is also
associated with an increased risk of gallstones, blood clots and
uterine cancer when the estrogen is not combined with progesterone.
Because the lotion does not contain progesterone, it might appeal to
women who have had a hysterectomy or who do not want to take
progesterone.</TE>
<TE>   The lotion may be easier to use than traditional estrogen
products, Simon says. Oral estrogen can cause stomach upset in some
women, while the patch can cause skin irritation. Estrasorb is based
on Nanosomes technology, in which tiny particles containing drug
compounds are delivered steadily from skin reservoirs into the
bloodstream.</TE>
<TE>   "With Estrasorb you don't get the rapid increases and decreases in
estrogen that you do when it is delivered orally," says Simon, who
expects the FDA to issue explicit instructions on where the cream
should be applied. The women in the study applied the lotion to their
thighs. The product will likely come in measured packets to avoid
overdose, says John Spears, chief executive of Novavax. He expects
the product to be priced similarly to estrogen patches and to be
covered by insurance. Earlier safety studies showed that the lotion,
once it has dried on the skin, cannot rub off on another person.</TE>

<LD>POWER TO THE PATIENT: The Treatments to Insist On When You're Sick</LD>
<LD>   By Dr. Isadore Rosenfeld</LD>
<LD>   Warner Books, 448 pages, $25.95</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Overview: Rosenfeld, a cardiologist and author of several
bestsellers including "Live Now, Age Later," has again written an
excellent guide to getting the most from the health-care system. He
recognizes a need to help the average patient at a time when doctors
tend to be rushed and health insurers focused on the bottom line.
"Knowledge is power, and when it concerns your health, it can save
your life," he writes.</TE>
<TE>   What Works: Rosenfeld has targeted 39 conditions, including acne,
depression and stroke. In each chapter, he defines the problem, lists
risk factors and symptoms, outlines treatment and often spells out
"what to insist on" during medical encounters. The book, which
displays the author's trademark humor, is written in the
conversational style that has made him a popular fixture in books,
magazines and on television.</TE>

<HD>Rehearsing for Their MRIs Makes Kids the Image of Poise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>THE HARTFORD COURANT</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lie perfectly still. Don't move a muscle. Your body is sliding into a
dark tunnel. Your head is trapped in a cage-like helmet. The tube is
so narrow that if you twist, your body might touch the sides.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes the noise, the brain-rattling clatter of a freight train
heading straight into your tunnel. You can almost see the headlight.</LD>
<LD>   Remember, do not move.</LD>
<TE>   This is how it feels to have an MRI, the magnetic resonance
imaging that allows doctors to take clear pictures of your insides
without pain or exposure to dangerous radiation. It can be pretty
scary.</TE>
<TE>   Now, imagine you're 5 years old.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, half of the children who needed an MRI at
Yale-New Haven Hospital in Connecticut were given a sedative or
general anesthesia to make it through the test. Now, with the help of
a mock scanner and a training program, nine of 10 lie still and
tolerate an MRI without medication.</TE>
<TE>   "With the mock scanner, they're oriented, they know what to
expect," said Charlene Sastre, an MRI technologist at Yale-New Haven.
The training consists of three practice sessions in which children
get to lie in a realistic scanner, hear the noise and practice
holding perfectly still without the pressure of the real thing. They
get to meet the nurse who will accompany them to the real test while
their parents learn to work with the nurse.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are usually pretty bored by the time they get downstairs
[to the real MRI scanner]," said Bruna Banyas, one of the nurses who
does the training. "They jump up on the table and they stay for 40
minutes. Sometimes they fall asleep because they're so comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   That's what Greg and Rachel Green were hoping for when they
brought 5-year-old Brandon to Yale-New Haven for training recently.
Brandon had had coordination problems and his neurologist thought a
curve in his spine might be throwing his body off balance.</TE>
<TE>   Banyas showed him a poster board lined with black, shadowy
photographs of a brain. She reminded him that the pictures with
bright splashes of color were ruined because the patient moved.
Brandon agreed that he wanted his brain picture to be perfect.</TE>
<TE>   The door of the mock scanner room is painted to look like the
ticket office at an old railway station. The entrance to the scanner
is surrounded by a painted brick backdrop, making the scanner tube
look like a railroad tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon hopped up on the table and adjusted headphones through
which he would listen to a book on tape. It was Brandon's third
training session. His parents said the investment of time had been
worthwhile. Brandon did not move when his body was slid into the
scanner tunnel. Greg Green said Brandon had an operation when he was
younger and became nauseated from the anesthesia. Everyone wanted to
avoid that this time.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers at Yale-New Haven initiated the training about three
years ago at the request of a child psychologist who had heard about
similar programs elsewhere and thought it might be helpful for his
studies of children's brains.</TE>
<TE>   The program was extended to children with medical problems such as
headaches, brain tumors and epilepsy. Because it is part of a study,
there is no charge for the training and any child is eligible. So
far, 100 children with medical problems have been prepared for MRIs.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 100 children who have needed MRIs for medical reasons, more
than 90 completed the test without sedation, said Barbara A. Teague,
the nurse who designed the program. When Brandon had his real MRI, it
lasted more than an hour and he did not move at all.</TE>

<LD>Question: Is it possible to increase muscle mass by doing more
repetitions with lighter weights, or do you need to be lifting
heavier weights?</LD>
<LD>   Martin Crump</LD>
<LD>   West Indies</LD>
<TE>   Answer: It depends on your intensity level.</TE>
<TE>   You can increase your strength with heavier weights, but let's say
you're capable of squatting 225 pounds for 10 repetitions and that,
physically, you can do no more.</TE>
<TE>   If you reduce the weight to 125 pounds but increase the reps to
20--and then complete another rep on top of that--you'll have
stimulated your body to respond with increases in strength and muscle
mass.</TE>
<TE>   Providing you have proper rest and nutrition, your muscles will be
stronger and bigger next time you train.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are genetic limits to this, but the general rule
applies to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   So the answer is less about the number of reps but how much effort
you put into your set.</TE>
<TE>   Basic rules to follow are:</TE>
<TE>   * Maintain proper form.</TE>
<TE>   * Gradually increase the weight or reps.</TE>
<TE>   * Do most sets to--or almost to--muscular failure; in other words,
until you simply can do no more.</TE>
<TE>   Also, keep in mind that the upper body generally responds well to
10 to 12 reps; the lower body responds to 10 to 20 reps.</TE>

<HD>Many Therapies Hit the Spot for Relief of Acne</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To a teenager, few things are more embarrassing than acne. Whether
it's an isolated pimple or a severe outbreak, most adolescents--and
some adults--would do just about anything to clear it up.</LD>
<LD>   Americans spend more than $100 million a year on over-the-counter
acne treatments, and hundreds of millions more on visits to doctors
and prescription medications for this skin disorder. The cost of
treating acne is high, in part, because the problem is so common.</LD>
<LD>   About 85% of people between the ages of 15 and 24 are affected by
it, and by their mid-teens, more than 40% of adolescents have acne
severe enough to require some treatment by a physician. The problem
is not confined to adolescence; many people suffer from acne well
into their fourth and even fifth decade of life.</LD>
<TE>   Even so, it's a lot of money spent trying to unclog hair follicles
that have become blocked by a greasy, waxy substance called sebum.
Sebum is produced by a small gland (the pilosebaceous gland) at the
base of the hair follicles. Normally the sebum empties onto the
skin's surface. Acne develops when the follicle becomes plugged
(usually by a mixture of sebum and skin cells that line the follicle)
and the sebum becomes trapped inside.</TE>
<TE>   As sebum builds up, the follicle enlarges, and "whiteheads" and
"blackheads" develop. (Whiteheads are simply plugged follicles that
remain closed beneath the skin's surface; blackheads are plugged
follicles that have opened up to the skin's surface.) The problem is
aggravated when bacteria that normally live on the skin get into the
sebum-plugged follicle and begin to multiply there, causing
inflammation, swelling and redness (a condition known as inflammatory
acne). In some cases the buildup of sebum and bacterial overgrowth
actually cause the follicle to rupture, resulting in the development
of larger acne lesions like cysts and nodules (referred to as nodular
or cystic acne).</TE>
<TE>   While these acne lesions pose no serious threat to general health,
they can have devastating emotional consequences. Acne--especially
severe inflammatory or cystic acne--can undermine self-esteem,
destroy self-confidence and distort self-image. It can also be the
source of tremendous frustration and even lead to depression.</TE>
<TE>   For some people, acne leaves physical scars as well as emotional
ones. When inflammation is severe or persists for long periods of
time, it can lead to permanent damage ranging from small, rounded
"pockmarks" to long, linear scars. In people with darker complexions,
acne can also cause the skin to become darker, or "hyperpigmented."
Although the initial acne lesions may last only days to weeks, the
skin can remain discolored for months or even years.</TE>
<TE>   Both the emotional and physical scarring of acne are usually
preventable because almost all acne lesions can be successfully
controlled with prompt and appropriate treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Keeping the skin clean is an important first step. The American
Academy of Dermatology recommends gently washing the skin twice a day
with water and a mild cleanser to help eliminate excess oils on the
skin's surface. Scrubbing the skin and using strong detergent
cleansers are not advised. (In fact, they are actually thought to
aggravate the problem.)</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular belief, however, washing alone is not enough.
Medications are usually necessary to combat acne successfully. Some
acne medications work by keeping hair follicles from plugging up;
some reduce the amount of sebum that is produced; others control the
overgrowth of bacteria.</TE>
<TE>   Over-the-counter medications are often the best place to start,
particularly for treating whiteheads, blackheads and mild
inflammatory acne. Many gels, creams and lotions are available to
choose from. To work, they must be applied frequently, sometimes as
often as three times a day. Products containing benzoyl peroxide,
salicylic acid, sulfur and resorcinol work by preventing follicles
from plugging and are among the most popular on the market. (Benzoyl
peroxide-containing products offer the added advantage of inhibiting
bacterial overgrowth.)</TE>
<TE>   When used properly, over-the-counter products can be very
effective, though not for everyone. When these simpler measures fail,
the use of prescription medications may be helpful. Antibiotics can
help stop or slow the growth of bacteria, and drugs called retinoids
can unplug blocked follicles or reduce the amount of sebum produced.
In some cases the medications are applied directly to the skin; in
others, they are taken as pills.</TE>
<TE>   Isotretinoin (brand name Accutane) is an oral retinoid medication
that is generally reserved for the most severe cases of nodular or
cystic acne. Accutane produces dramatic results: 9 out of 10 people
treated with it experience complete or near complete resolution of
their acne after 15 to 20 weeks of treatment. Unfortunately, its side
effects can be equally dramatic. When taken by women who are
pregnant, isotretinoin can cause severe birth defects in the
developing fetus.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent retinoid-related birth defects, the Food and Drug
Administration recently issued new prescribing rules: Women who are,
or who might become, sexually active with a male partner are required
to use two forms of birth control for at least a month prior to
starting Accutane. Before receiving a prescription for Accutane, all
women must have two negative pregnancy tests. After starting on the
drug, they must return to their doctor for a repeat test during every
month they continue to take it.</TE>
<TE>   Most skin specialists support the use of simple nonprescription
therapies first. If those don't work, a physician with experience in
treating acne should be consulted promptly. Especially with the
cystic form of acne, the earlier an appropriate therapy is started,
the less the likelihood of scarring afterward.</TE>
<TE>   If your child has acne, it's important to talk frankly together
about the problem; sympathetic concern alone can be very comforting.
Be sure the child is aware that effective treatments are available,
and let the child know that you'll help find competent care. Although
some children may be embarrassed to talk about this subject--even
with their parents--the embarrassment pales in comparison with their
fear of humiliation in front of their peers because of acne.</TE>

<LD>Whether it's your first attempt to quit smoking or your 10th, experts
offer these tactics to help you give up cigarettes for good.</LD>
<LD>   * Set a date to quit. The sooner, the better. Experts recommend
aiming for sometime in the next two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   * Talk with your doctor about medication to help while you quit.</LD>
<TE>   The latest federal treatment guidelines recommend nicotine
replacement or bupropion (Zyban) for nearly all smokers. Exception:
pregnant women--although on a case-by-case basis, they also can take
drugs to help them stop smoking.</TE>
<TE>   * Involve your friends--plus family and co-workers. Social support
combined with drug treatment can boost success rates to 30%.</TE>
<TE>   * Avoid alcohol. It can undermine willpower.</TE>
<TE>   Experts advise going on the wagon for the first two months while
quitting smoking. Barring that, limit yourself to two drinks or fewer
per day.</TE>
<TE>   * Don't even think of dieting while you quit smoking.</TE>
<TE>   Studies suggest that giving up nicotine and food at the same time
is a program for failure. Stock up on low-calorie munchies and expect
to gain a little weight, the range is about seven to 10 pounds. Most
people lose those extra pounds eventually.</TE>
<TE>   * Exercise. It will help limit weight gain, can ease cravings for
nicotine, improve sleep and elevate mood. About one in five smokers
may experience mild depression after quitting.</TE>
<TE>   * Drink plenty of fluids. They help flush nicotine from the body.</TE>
<TE>   * Find a phone buddy or an Internet friend. National quit lines
include those run by the American Cancer Society ([800] ACS-2345),
the American Lung Assn. ([800] LUNG-USA) and the Cancer Information
Service of the National Cancer Institute ([800] 4-CANCER).</TE>

<HD>New Drugs Prevent Goals From Going Up in Smoke</HD>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>About 40% of America's 50 million smokers will try to kick the habit
at least once this year, according to the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. On each attempt, fewer than one in 10 will
succeed. As discouraging as those numbers may seem, nicotine
addiction researchers offer the offsetting news that those very
failures pave the road for breaking dependence on tobacco--something
that about half of smokers ultimately achieve, according to federal
treatment guidelines.</LD>
<LD>   "Most people have to try to quit probably five to seven times
before they succeed," said John Hughes, professor of psychiatry at
the University of Vermont. "It's just like swimming--it's important
to keep jumping in the water to learn."</LD>
<LD>   And as experts like to note, there has never been a better time to
quit--or so many different scientifically validated options to help
smokers reduce the pangs of nicotine withdrawal and the craving for
cigarettes, both of which make quitting smoking harder than making
most other behavioral changes.</LD>
<TE>   Ten years ago, "all we had to offer was going cold turkey or
nicotine gum," says Michael C. Fiore, chairman of a federal panel
that issued treatment guidelines two years ago calling for nearly
every smoker who wanted to quit to use medications to support their
efforts. Today, there are seven drug-treatment choices, as well as
many organized smoking-cessation programs and individual counseling
services that also boost chances that smokers will manage to quit.</TE>
<TE>   Four safe and proven nicotine replacement methods--gum, a patch
that delivers nicotine through the skin, an inhaler that mimics the
effect of smoking and a spray that provides a quick burst of nicotine
to nasal passages--can deliver gradually declining doses to take the
edge off cravings and withdrawal. They have only minimal side
effects, a very low risk of addiction and are free of the nearly
4,000 harmful substances that cigarette smoke delivers.</TE>
<TE>   The treatments don't end there. An antidepressant
medication--bupropion, marketed for depression under the brand name
Wellbutrin and for smoking cessation as Zyban-- can also help break
cigarette addiction, though the scientific process by which this
occurs is still not understood. There have been many reports of
serious adverse effects, including some deaths, from Zyban in Europe.
For now, "it's unclear if the events are related to the medication,"
says Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   Two other options for especially difficult cases of smoking
addiction are the blood pressure medication clonidine and the
antidepressant nortriptyline. While the evidence of their value is
not as extensive as that for nicotine replacement drugs, a government
panel advised recently that these medications be tried if other drugs
have failed. (Neither, however, is approved for this use by the Food
and Drug Administration.)</TE>
<TE>   "The good news for smokers," Fiore says, "is that people now have
a choice. There's never been a better time to quit."</TE>
<TE>   Trouble is, a lot of smokers do it the wrong way and increase
their odds of failure. Since smoking is often viewed as a weakness or
character flaw, many smokers tend to tough it out and go cold turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Or they mistakenly use minimal amounts of the nicotine replacement
drugs and other medications that are proven scientifically to help
assuage the strong physiological symptoms of withdrawal.</TE>
<TE>   "That is why there is such a high relapse rate," explains David
Sachs, clinical associate professor of pulmonary and critical-care
medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. "It's like
killing all four engines on a Boeing 747 where you're 2,000 feet
above the runway. You crash and burn and then people start beating up
on themselves. They say, 'I am a failure,' when they are really
dealing with something that has a striking rationale as far as
pharmacology and physiology are concerned."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I am back again. They say that the third time's a charm.
Hope they are right. This is the third time this year that I am
quitting. The last time I went back to smoking, I got so depressed
that I didn't want to talk to anyone for a long time. Can't say I
will make it, can't say I won't. I'm just going to take this one
minute, hour and day at a time."</TE>

<TE>   No one suggests that quitting is easy, even with nicotine
replacement medications. Adult smokers go through an average of a
pack of cigarettes each day. At 20 cigarettes per pack and 10 puffs
per cigarette, that's 200 nicotine hits a day right to the brain,
making smoking "one of the world's most intense habits," says Hughes.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes just a few heartbeats to get nicotine from the tip of
your finger to the brain," says Richard Hurt, director of the
Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
Once there, nicotine produces significant changes in brain cells.
Chemically similar to naturally occurring neurotransmitters or
chemical messengers, nicotine displaces some brain chemicals. Just 10
days of smoking triples the number of entry points--receptors--that
allow nicotine to get inside brain cells, says Sachs.</TE>
<TE>   There, nicotine acts on the pleasure-reward pathway by raising
levels of four key neurochemicals that affect alertness, energy and
mood--dopamine, norepinephrine, beta endorphins and serotonin. "The
bottom line is that nicotine has a lot of very beneficial effects on
how we feel and think," Sachs says.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the development of effective nicotine replacement drugs
has finally given an edge to smokers who want to quit. Using one or
more of these medications boosts success rates to about 25%, the
federal treatment guidelines issued in 2000 by the Agency for
Healthcare Research and Quality found. Evidence suggests they could
go higher if more intensive treatment and greater support were
applied.</TE>
<TE>   Close monitoring of withdrawal symptoms and tailoring nicotine
replacement therapy to the individual has produced success rates of
up to 50% at some of the best smoking-cessation programs.</TE>
<TE>   At Mayo's Nicotine Dependence Center, for instance, smokers pay
$3,300 each to check into an intensive, weeklong residential
smoking-cessation program. They undergo blood testing for cotinine, a
marker of nicotine byproducts; the tests are used to help adjust
treatment individually for withdrawal symptoms and cravings. The
program includes daily group and individual therapy, stress
reduction, nutrition and diet information, supervised exercise and a
12-step program similar to Alcoholics Anonymous.</TE>
<TE>   About 700 smokers have gone through the decade-old program. Eighty
percent of the participants are already experiencing tobacco-related
illnesses such as emphysema or heart disease. Yet, one year after
treatment--the longest follow-up data available--about 45% of
participants remain smoke-free, according to Hurt.</TE>
<TE>   In the community at large, however, research suggests that smokers
and some physicians are confused about what approach to use. "While
we are blessed with a variety of treatment strategies, the challenge
is finding the right combination for each individual," says Neil
Grunberg, professor of psychology and neuroscience at the Uniformed
Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. Science
still can't say with certainty which smoker will benefit most from
which treatment, but there are tantalizing hints.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 treatment guidelines, which were written after an
extensive review of the scientific literature, note that gum and
bupropion appear to help prevent weight gain. Those who have
experienced severe withdrawal symptoms in previous attempts to quit
may do better on the patch; studies suggest that smokers who suffer
severe cravings seem to be helped by the high-speed nicotine delivery
of the gum, the inhaler or the nasal spray.</TE>
<TE>   Yet all too often, tobacco-addiction experts find that smokers go
cold turkey and don't take advantage of these aids--an almost-certain
program for failure. Or they don't follow directions and use too
little of the medications to help them succeed, perhaps because the
treatment can cost $4 to $18 a day--compared to $3.50 for a
pack-a-day habit.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people are way underdosed," Hurt says. "If they're getting
more than 300 milligrams a day from cigarettes--that's about two
packs a day--then we will use two [nicotine replacement] patches."</TE>
<TE>   Not using enough nicotine replacement medication can sabotage the
most dedicated attempts to give up smoking. At Stanford, Sachs and
his colleagues monitored the blood levels of nicotine as smokers quit
and compared them with the eventual rates of success. When nicotine
levels dropped too precipitously to 50% or less of what they had been
while participants were smoking, success rates were no better than
the 5% to 8% seen with a placebo, about equivalent to going cold
turkey.</TE>
<TE>   Smokers need to take a cue from other over-the-counter
medications. "They say: If your symptoms persist for a few days, go
see your doctor," Sachs notes. "What nicotine replacement products
should say is: If craving for cigarettes continues or you experience
increased irritability or difficulty concentrating, contact your
doctor. As a physician, that would tell me that you're probably not
getting an effective dose."</TE>
<TE>   Another mistake smokers make is thinking of nicotine replacement
as a magic bullet that will help them sail through the difficult days
of withdrawal and ease their cravings without any additional effort.
Those who ignore the importance of behavior change or social support
undermine their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Looking back over my one month [of abstinence], I find that the
one constant lesson I've learned from everything I've seen is that I
can't have one puff!"</TE>
<TE>   --Feb. 1 posting on Quitnet.com from a 60-year-old who has smoked

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For those trying to quit, there's no safe way to light up a single
cigarette--which is why the current treatment guidelines advise
abstinence. Some nicotine replacement medications, such as the patch,
could contribute to toxic levels of nicotine if they are combined
with smoking and lead to nausea, blood pressure problems and other
health effects. But worse, even one cigarette can send a smoker down
a slippery slope toward re-addiction.</TE>
<TE>   "There's never a point where there is an absolute guarantee that
someone has quit smoking," says Harry Lando, professor of
epidemiology at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health
and a member of the federal committee that drafted the treatment
guidelines. It is true, however, that the longer abstinence is
achieved, the better the chance that it will be permanent.</TE>
<TE>   Large population studies show that smokers who quit for a year
have an 85% chance of maintaining their abstinence, Lando says. Those
who make it five years have a 97% chance of continued success.</TE>
<TE>   "But it's important that someone not feel too safe and let down
their guard," Lando says.</TE>
<TE>   However difficult it may be to quit, smoking researchers are
convinced that nearly everyone can achieve independence from
smoking--given the right help. A new generation of drugs now in the
research pipeline--such as a tobacco vaccine currently under
development at Nabi in Rockville, Md.--is expected to attack tobacco
dependence in bold new ways. The $206-billion settlement by state
attorneys general with the tobacco companies established the American
Legacy Foundation in 1999. The foundation is pumping money into
prevention programs and into practical strategies, including $7.5
million for the establishment of a toll-free telephone hot line for
pregnant smokers trying to kick the habit ([866] 66-START).</TE>
<TE>   "We know that quit lines can be an effective way to help people
quit smoking," says Scott Leischow, chief of the National Cancer
Institute's tobacco-control branch.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a growing recognition that smoking is not a character
flaw or a weakness, but an addiction and a serious chronic disease
that warrants treatment. "We wouldn't tell someone with a blood sugar
of 500 to [just] work on their willpower," Fiore says. "We don't tell
someone who has a systolic blood pressure of 250 that if they really
had character they could control it on their own. Why hold back
treatments from smokers that we know could help?"</TE>
<TE>   And yet that is what happens every year. Medicare doesn't pay for
smoking-cessation medications, and only about half of private
insurers cover such treatment, although HMOs often do. "It's
important that smokers, doctors, insurers and the U.S. Congress hear
what a paradox it is that our health system spends tens of billions
of dollars to provide care for heart attacks or strokes or lung
cancer or emphysema, but it does not pay for medicine that could help
people quit smoking," Fiore says.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line that tobacco experts are delivering is this:
Smokers should keep trying to quit no matter what the cost. Giving up
cigarettes at age 50 cuts the risk of dying in half from
smoking-related illnesses during the next 15 years, Fiore says. Even
long-term smokers who have been diagnosed with smoking-related health
effects--chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or lung cancer--can
buy time and improve breathing capacity by as much as 5% by quitting.</TE>
<TE>   "The message is: Keep trying," says Hughes. "A lot of people give
up too soon. The No. 1 message is that there is a lot of help out
there now."</TE>

<HD>Donors' Pregnancies May Be Key to Transfusion Deaths</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHLEEN KERR</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blood donated by women who have been pregnant several times--more
than 1 million such donors give each year--may contain dangerous
antibodies that can kill transfusion recipients.</LD>
<LD>   After the deaths of 55 transfusion recipients over nine years, the
Food and Drug Administration recently warned physicians that blood
donors who have had multiple pregnancies may carry antibodies that
can trigger a rare but fatal lung condition--transfusion-related
acute lung injury, or TRALI.</LD>
<LD>   In one case, the blood from just one woman caused two deaths.</LD>
<TE>   The deaths, between 1992 and 2001, pose a serious problem for the
blood banking community.</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of the nation's 3.6 million female blood donors,
or 1.2 million women, have had multiple pregnancies. And there is no
quick, reliable way to screen blood for the TRALI antibodies. The
loss of so many donors could devastate the blood supply.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to press the panic button, but it is clearly one of
the most important transfusion problems in the developed world," said
Dr. Mark Popovsky, associate professor of pathology at Harvard
Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Women exposed to fetal white blood cells during pregnancy or
childbirth form antibodies against the foreign cells. But those
antibodies can trigger TRALI in some transfusion recipients, mostly
through transfused plasma.</TE>
<TE>   Though women with three or more pregnancies are the most likely to
develop the antibodies, those with just two pregnancies can produce
them too.</TE>
<TE>   Transfusion experts suspect that many more deaths have occurred.
They estimate one in every 5,000 plasma transfusions ends up as a
case of TRALI and that 5% to 10% of TRALI cases end in death. With
more than 3.3 million plasma transfusions nationwide annually, that
would mean as many as 660 TRALI cases and as many as 66 deaths every
year.</TE>
<TE>   In October, Kathryn Zoon, director of the Food and Drug
Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, issued
the government's warning, which said: "Because of misdiagnosis and/or
underreporting, the full scope of TRALI is not known."</TE>
<TE>   The country's two main blood collection organizations, the
American Red Cross and America's Blood Centers, say laboratory
workups to detect the antibodies wouldn't make sense. They would take
weeks and cost about $300 each, or $360 million for the 1.2 million
female blood donors with multiple pregnancies.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Leslie Holness, a medical officer in the Food and Drug
Administration's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said
the agency does not prohibit women who have had multiple pregnancies
from donating.</TE>
<TE>   For TRALI to occur, a number of things must happen.</TE>
<TE>   A fetus receives genes from both father and mother. If the mother,
either when she gives birth or because of small placental leaks
during pregnancy, is exposed to fetal white blood cells from the
father, her immune system forms antibodies to protect her against the
so-called foreign invaders.</TE>
<TE>   The problem arises if the mother later donates blood to someone
with the same antigens, or proteins, as her baby. The mother's
antibodies bind with the white blood cells of some transfusion
recipients, setting off a reaction that causes extreme breathing
difficulty, lung failure and, sometimes, death.</TE>
<TE>   When a TRALI case is reported, the blood used is traced to donors,
who are prohibited from giving again. Any remaining blood is no
longer used.</TE>
<TE>   But Popovsky, the Harvard professor, says that preventing all
women who might carry the antibodies from donating would be foolhardy
at this point.</TE>

<LD>A long time ago, on a battlefield in Korea, I escaped death because
an artillery shell that hit a tree next to me was a dud. Not far
away, in the same barrage, a friend died because the shell that
landed near him wasn't. I've wondered about that ever since.</LD>
<LD>   I had been with him earlier, but for some reason hadn't liked the
position and moved up the mountainside to wait out the barrage. I
didn't say why I was moving because I didn't know why. But should I
have urged him to go with me? If I had stressed my vague uneasiness
with that position, would he be alive today?</LD>
<LD>   Emotions have long memories, especially for those of us who lived
for a while on their dark side. They engender episodes of pain and
guilt as we think back to the what-ifs of decisions made, or not
made, in the shifting environment of war. It's that way with me, and
it's that way with Sam Maas.</LD>
<TE>   I mention my own experience only as a prelude to the condition I
find Maas in today. At 87, living quietly in the San Fernando Valley
with his wife of 53 years, he's troubled by words he didn't say
during World War II and wonders: Had he said them, would 10 men who
died in the crash of a B-24 be alive today?</TE>
<TE>   One of them was Lt. Gen. Millard Harmon, U.S. Army Air Corps
commander in the Pacific, a gentle, soft-spoken man that everyone
knew as Miff.</TE>
<TE>   Maas was a flight engineer on the plane used by Harmon to move
about the South Pacific. On Feb. 26, 1945, as the war was winding
down, the general scheduled an island-hopping flight out of Hawaii's
Hickam Field.</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, it was a flight into eternity, and Maas had just
missed being on it. That caprice of fate and timing has rested
heavily on his conscience ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Days before the fateful flight, Maas had been granted a 30-day
furlough and was awaiting transportation home. As he passed the
converted B-24 that would fly Gen. Harmon and a nine-man crew on an
inspection trip through the South Pacific, he noticed a mechanic
repairing a heater due to be installed in the plane.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him that he ought to get a new heater rather than repair
the old one," Maas said the other day in the living room of his West
Hills home. He's frail in some ways and can't hear too well, but his
mind is sharp and his memory clear.</TE>
<TE>   "He said he could fix it OK. In retrospect, I wish I'd told the
pilot. I wish I'd told someone. I was the only one who knew. If those
heaters weren't put together properly, they could explode. They were
fueled by 100-octane gasoline, and the fumes could ignite. I'm 90%
sure that's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   The B-24 took off toward the islands of Kwajalein, Guam and
Tinian. Maas left for his home in Milwaukee. It was there, two weeks
later, that he learned that Gen. Harmon's plane had disappeared in
the Pacific. An 18-day search failed to reveal its fate.</TE>
<TE>   "I was with some buddies at a hamburger place after a movie. One
of them said he'd heard on the radio that Harmon's plane had gone
down. I couldn't believe it. I called the newspaper and they said it
was true. I felt terrible. There were tears in my eyes...."</TE>
<TE>   Maas paused for a moment to regain his composure. Piles of
newspaper clippings, photographs and research papers lay on a table
next to him, all relating to that B-24 and its crew. Then: "I lived
with those guys. Four of them were my friends. I knew them
personally." He recited their names in a tone of litany: "Anderson,
Savage, Geist, Harmon." Another pause. "If my theory is correct and
I'd have told someone...." The sentence faded into silence.</TE>
<TE>   We honor in different ways those whose deaths trouble our
conscience. I write about my experiences. Maas devotes time and
energy to seeing that Gen. Harmon, whom he considers a forgotten
hero, receives credit for having initiated low-level bombing
techniques both in the islands and in attacks on the Japanese
mainland.</TE>
<TE>   It was Harmon, he said, who helped bring the enemy to its knees,
and hardly anyone knows that. After the war, Maas ran the family
bakery in Milwaukee, then moved to L.A. in 1972 where he eventually
retired. A life's work since then has been to publicize as much as
possible Harmon's contribution to America's victory in the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   "Harmon came up with the idea of getting down to 200 to 400 feet
to do the bombing, instead of 15,000 to 20,000 feet. But who got the
credit for it? Douglas MacArthur. That's not right."</TE>
<TE>   Maas liked Harmon. He remembers him as an intelligent and
reasonable man who wouldn't seek publicity on his own. "That's why no
one has ever heard of him," the old tech sergeant said, upset by
history's shortcoming. "He just wouldn't claim credit."</TE>
<TE>   So Maas tells the story whenever he can, lights a candle every
anniversary of the plane's disappearance and up until recently
gathered veterans of Harmon's command together as a way of honoring
him. But time has thinned their ranks and left most of the others
unable to make the trips required for a reunion.</TE>
<TE>   I looked through the photos that Maas loaned me, especially those
of the flight crew that included him. They were young back then and
strong and resolute, bonded in the kind of relationship war forges
with fire and steel. That's why loss assumes such a horrific form and
conscience burns so brightly over the long years.</TE>
<TE>   I hope this column helps Maas. I hope that giving credit to a
general for a wartime innovation damps the fire a little. It's the
least I can do, for both of us.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A simple act--like standing in a checkout line to buy milk-- can make
one dizzy with thoughts of sex. From the covers of women's magazines,
headlines scream: "Orgasm secrets revealed"; "100 ways to thrill a
man in bed"; "How to be the sexually confident woman men love." The
sexual promised land is within reach, oh yes.</LD>
<LD>   But what if the promises are empty? According to a story published
this month in the Columbia Journalism Review, some women's magazines
change quotes, fabricate quotes, invent people and make wild
extrapolations in stories about sex and relationships.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, Liza Featherstone, a New York City-based writer who
wrote "Faking It: Sex, Lies and Women's Magazines" for the CJR, was
covering a panel discussion on the state of women's magazines.
Senior-level editors at women's magazines and writers were in
attendance when the discussion turned to the question of what ails
women's magazines. One editor proclaimed that the most egregious
problem plaguing women's magazines was not the reed-thin models nor
flagging advertising revenues, but how much they "lie about sex." The
revelation drew nods and general agreement, Featherstone reported,
but no denials.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not happening at all women's magazines, as I try to make
clear in the article, but it is really a specific kind of lifestyle
magazine that does a specific kind of anecdote-driven story within
that genre," said Featherstone, who cited Cosmopolitan, Glamour,
Marie Claire, the now-defunct Mademoiselle, and other magazines that
feature mostly sex and relationship advice stories. "These are
usually how-to, instructive stories such as how to have much better
sex or how to get your man to say you're the best, but with the
pretense that this is a reported story and the writer really went out
there and investigated what women are really doing."</TE>
<TE>   Elle senior editor Laurie Abraham, the conference attendee who
raised the issue of lying about sex, said in an interview that
"massaging quotes," as it is called in magazine parlance, is not the
biggest lie. The deeper offense is how women's magazines deliver sex
and relationship stories in impossibly simplistic terms, such as
"Jenny says that she makes her boyfriend happy by doing ..."</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest problem is that these stories never get at the truth
of what it feels like to have sex and at the ambivalence women have
about sex," said Abraham, who noted that Elle does not publish
anecdote-driven relationship and sex stories, but plumbs the topics
through personal essays. "This is not the crime of the century. But I
don't think you get to the truth in a roundup piece of interviewing
20 people and then stringing the anecdotes together."</TE>
<TE>   Editors come up with language on a magazine cover that reader
research has shown sells magazines. The editors then assign a story
to fill the "coverline," said Abraham. "It is always the same thing,
you know, 100 ways to skin a cat," she added. "Everything is being
forced into this chatty, magazine-y talk." As a writer, Abraham
herself had quotes changed. Years ago, she was assigned a story about
"how to revive your sex life." She quoted a friend who had been
married for many years who had sex five times a week with her
husband. "None of the editors could believe that anyone who is
married has sex five times a week," said Abraham, "so they changed it
to three times a week."</TE>
<TE>   But Glamour Editor in Chief Cynthia Leive, who took the helm from
Bonnie Fuller in May, strongly denied in the CJR article that quote
embellishment occurred on her watch. "I can't speak to the standards
at all magazines, but most editors would be horrified to think that
went on," Leive told the CJR. Hearst Magazines, publisher of
Cosmopolitan and Marie Claire, also disputed Featherstone's charges.
"We take offense with Columbia Journalism Review's reporting,"
e-mailed Paul Luthringer, vice president of communications for Hearst
Magazines, when asked for a comment on the CJR piece last week.
"Relationship stories are held to the same standards as all other
stories. Every article is scrupulously fact-checked and all anecdotes
in the magazine are to be accurate; composites are not allowed." But
Featherstone and others assert that quotes are changed to exaggerate
or diminish sexually charged information in some women's magazines,
depending on a magazine's image and readership.</TE>
<TE>   Another writer, who has written for national women's magazines for
more than 15 years, said that besides changing facts in interviews,
there is a general expectation that quotes will be rephrased in
chatty tones consistent with a magazine's voice. "Real people often
are boring and real people are inarticulate," said the writer, who
added that if she interviewed someone very articulate she would
sometimes divide that person into two or three people. "The magazine
said that these quotes are flat, and I said, 'Well, you wanted real
people.' So they told me to go back to interviewing my friends. If
the quotes weren't what they wanted, I changed them myself. One
magazine once took opinions that I had expressed in a piece and
attributed it to a psychologist."</TE>
<TE>   Another editor who has worked at women's magazines for nearly 20
years said the quotes of experts who didn't quite support the thesis
of a story were routinely manipulated to say what editors needed them
to say. "The editor had a concept for a story and if an expert's
quote didn't work out, it was massaged by many editors to say what
they wanted," said the editor.</TE>
<TE>   Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociologist who is
often quoted in women's magazines, said she thinks many women's
magazines are guilty as charged. "Some social scientists won't talk
to the press because there will be just enough changes made to what
they actually said that it will be wrong and it would be a
professional embarrassment," said Schwartz, who used to write a sex
column for Glamour, where she said she was fact-checked better than
academic journals under Ruth Whitney, then editor in chief. "When I
was writing an article for one woman's magazine and they changed
something, I called the editor to say, 'You can't do this. I am a
sociologist and this would be a trespass of principle and practice."
Schwartz said many women's magazines refuse to include information
about women's sexuality that veers from what they deem normal or
moral. "There was a magazine that would interview me ... and I was
talking about what if a woman is seeing more than one man at a time.
They said, 'We can't do that unless she is getting a sexually
transmitted disease.'"</TE>
<TE>   Writer Refused to Lie;</TE>
<TE>   Story Was Killed</TE>
<TE>   Even the personal essay is not immune. "I wrote an essay about a
friend of mine I had been vaguely dating in college who had a
sex-change operation," said San Francisco-based writer Laura Fraser.
"The senior editor who assigned it loved it and the top editor said,
'You didn't explore the feelings of betrayal and disgust deeply
enough.' I said, 'I didn't feel disgust or betrayal.' I had a lot of
other feelings that were complicated but not disgust and betrayal."
Fraser refused to lie about her emotional response to her friend's
operation and the piece was killed. Magazine editors and writers told
Featherstone that lying about sex had to do with deadline pressure,
the need to fill magazine pages and, curiously, to make sex stories
seem more "realistic." Sex stories were held to a different standard
than other stories, editors, writers and fact-checkers told
Featherstone. "I think that the wild extrapolations and inventions of
people, inventions of quotes and the extent of fabrications doesn't
go quite to the extreme that it does with topics of sex," said
Featherstone. "Fact-checkers were often told by editors not even to
bother to check a sex story, or they were told by an editor: 'Don't
even bother calling that person because they don't even exist.'" Are
some of the journalistic prevarications of this sort a violation of
readers' trust?</TE>
<TE>   "Lies, inventing quotes and making things up are disturbing things
to readers....How can they trust these magazines to help them build a
better sex life?" asked Bryce Nelson, a journalism professor at the
USC Annenberg School for Communication. "The idea that sex has
consequences in terms of emotional impact, pregnancy or sexually
transmitted diseases is little dealt with in the women's magazines."
But perhaps readers understand that stories such as "Ten Steps to
Driving Your Man Wild in Bed" are not to be taken too seriously.
Samir Husni, a professor of journalism and head of the magazine
writing program at University of Mississippi, said readers deserve
more credit for discriminating between fiction and reality.</TE>
<TE>   "If you take the magazine as a whole, there are some well-reported
stories," said Husni, whose daughter works for Cosmo Girl. "Part of
what [these] magazines do is give readers fantasy," said Husni. "When
a reader reads a quote, they read it with more salt than pepper. They
read it for the fun, giggle and being in on the joke. Women want to
read something that makes them feel good. These magazines are not
there to make women feel guilty or bad."</TE>

<LD>HEARTBREAK</LD>
<LD>   The Political Memoir of a</LD>
<LD>   Feminist Militant</LD>
<TE>   by Andrea Dworkin</TE>
<TE>   Basic Books</TE>
<TE>   214 pages; $24</TE>
<TE>   Even among militant feminists, Andrea Dworkin seems an extremist.
Wasn't she the one who equated sexual intercourse with rape? (Not
quite. She simply pointed out how sex in masculinist cultures is too
often associated with conquest and domination.) Hasn't she launched a
relentless assault on the 1st Amendment by claiming that pornography
has nothing to do with free expression and everything to do with
violence against women and children? (Pretty much.) Certainly Dworkin
does not mince words. She writes out of raw emotion. Nor does she
tend to temper her gut responses with qualifications and second
thoughts. Indeed, as she stresses in "Heartbreak," Dworkin regards
extremism in defense of women and children to be no vice, nor
moderation in the pursuit of a fairer, less violent society to be a
virtue.</TE>
<TE>   Dworkin's strongly held views are very much rooted in her personal
experience with misogynist violence, as a victim and as ear-witness
to other victimized women. This memoir highlights some of the links
between Dworkin's personal history and her emerging feminist
ideology. Alas, it is a rather patchy, piecemeal production, more
like a set of notes than a finished book. But it does convey some
sense of where she is coming from. Interestingly, it also reveals the
complex and curious ways in which her militant feminism grew out of
her experiences with radicals in the 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Dworkin's girlhood idols were the intellectuals, rebels and free
spirits who seemed to point the way out of suburban conformity,
philistine insensitivity and racial-religious prejudices. Soon, as
she tells us, she was meeting writers like Allen Ginsberg, hanging
out with jazz musicians, hippies, antiwar activists, even tithing a
portion of her meager earnings to the Black Panthers. When it came to
their treatment of women and children, however, Dworkin's idols
turned out to have feet of clay. The man she marries beats her so
badly that her doctor is shocked. Antiwar activists she knows devour
pornography and talk of women with contempt. ("Weren't we the love
children, not the hate children?" she asks.) The intense fervor of
Dworkin and other feminists who came out of the 1960s radical
movement is reminiscent of those anticommunists who were once
communists and saw their god fail.</TE>
<TE>   Yet long after turning against it, Dworkin is still influenced by
this mid-century radical milieu in perhaps more ways than she
recognizes. Her style and stance are radical: She has a penchant for
coarse language and fierce vituperation, an instant affinity for
taking the most extreme position and expressing it in the most
attention-grabbing manner possible. Indeed, in some ways, her
take-no-prisoners brand of feminism resembles nothing so much as the
infantile masculinist posturings of a Norman Mailer. Ironically, what
turned her off to the 1960s radicals was their tendencies toward
brutality, violence and insensitivity.</TE>
<TE>   The chief strength of "Heartbreak" is that it baldly points a
finger at something all too prevalent: men abusing women and
children. The book's chief weakness is that Dworkin sounds almost as
angry at her ninth-grade English teacher for giving her a B on an
essay as she is at men who brutalize women or sexually molest their
children. Still, one cannot accuse Dworkin of lacking a sense of
responsibility. At the end of one of her fulminations against a
teacher who tried to force her to sing "Silent Night," Dworkin offers
this advice: "Adults need to be stood up to by children, period....
Pushing kids around is ugly.... On the other hand, students should
not, must not shoot teachers. The nobility of rebellion
student-to-teacher requires civil disobedience, not guns, not war."</TE>
<TE>   Dworkin is also capable of making some subtler points, many of
them quite eye opening. Responding to the familiar argument that any
form of censorship is wrong because it is impossible to draw the line
between art and hard-core porn, she notes: "These are some of life's
easier distinctions. I used to ask groups of folks how the retailers
of pornography could tell the difference between Joyce and hard-core
visual pornography. I noted that although, generally speaking, they
weren't the best and the brightest, they managed never to stock
'Ulysses.' If they could do it, I thought, so could the rest of us."</TE>

<LD>Have you ever raced a fringe-toed lizard to the peak of a sand dune?
Or played in a volcanic landscape with rocks as large as 60 feet
across? Have you ever been to the driest desert in North America?</LD>
<LD>   If not, you might like visiting the Mojave National Preserve, one
of the 385 sites within the National Park System. Located near
Barstow, in the heart of the Mojave Desert, the preserve has the
largest protected grove of Joshua trees, the two westernmost stands
of white fir in Southern California and the only permanent stream in
the eastern Mojave Desert. It is the only place you can find a native
fish called the Mojave tui chub and a plant called the Mojave
spike-moss. It is the meeting place for three major desert
ecosystems--the Sonoran, Mojave and Great Basin. The preserve also
has campgrounds, hiking trails and ranger-led learning programs.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the Mojave National Preserve needs help protecting
its plants, animals and cultural artifacts. That's why the National
Parks Conservation Assn. has listed it as one of this year's 10 most
endangered national parks. You can learn about how to help the
preserve and other national park sites at www.eparks.org.</LD>
<TE>   Did You Know?</TE>
<TE>   * The Mojave Desert is not only the driest but also the smallest
desert in North America.</TE>
<TE>   * The Kelso Dunes, the third-highest sand dunes in the United
States, are found within the preserve's boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   * The rocky area called Hole-in-the-Wall looks like a giant piece
of Swiss cheese. It was created by air pockets that were trapped
inside a huge lava flow.</TE>

<LD>   This is a story about a girl named Ramona whose third-grade year
is filled with lots of changes--a visit from Howie's rich uncle, the
surprise wedding of her Aunt Bea, the death of the family cat, her
dad's new job, and a new baby! I enjoyed reading this book and will
read more Ramona books by this author.</LD>

<TE>   Did you know that every American owns mountains, lakes, icy
glaciers, boiling volcanoes, spouting geysers, underground caverns
and living trees that are thousands of years old? All citizens of the
United States share equally in these natural wonders, for they are
all part of the country's system of national parks.</TE>
<TE>   A national park is an area set aside by the federal government
because of its magnificent scenery or its historic or scientific
importance, to be preserved for the enjoyment of all people now and

<LD>The farmhouse kitchen was warm and comfortable. It had white ruffled
curtains on the windows and a red-and-white checked cloth on the
table. In one corner of the room, there was a cozy brick fireplace
for burning wood on cold days.</LD>
<LD>   It was morning, and Sarah's mother was in the kitchen putting a
round loaf of bread into the oven. After the bread was baked, she
would do something special that she did only once a year on Easter.
With the tip of a spoon, she would drizzle thin white frosting over
the top of the bread and decorate it with tiny fresh flowers from her
garden.</LD>
<LD>   Sarah's father had been up early to feed and water the cows and
horses on the farm and had built a nice warm fire in the fireplace.
Now he was sitting in front of the fire reading the Sunday newspaper
and waiting to have some of the specially frosted bread for
breakfast.</LD>
<TE>   Sarah, who was sitting at the kitchen table, was also waiting for
the pretty bread. In the meantime, she was busy admiring what was
inside a large yellow basket--12 brightly colored eggs.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all the bright colors must be in Sarah's Easter basket
this morning," said Sarah's mother, as she looked out of the kitchen
window. "I see no color in the sky, only gray." Then she said,
"Sarah, why don't you put your Easter basket in the center of the
table for decoration? It looks so cheerful with its big yellow bow!"</TE>
<TE>   Now the Easter bread was ready to eat. Sarah's mother put it on
the table, along with a bowl of fresh strawberries sprinkled with
powdered sugar, and called Sarah's father.</TE>
<TE>   While they were eating, Sarah told her parents about what she saw
on her egg hunt before breakfast.</TE>

<HD>Not OK. Not Yet. Maybe Not Ever.</HD>
<DH>Six months later, memories still haunt four who were
touched by the Sept. 11 attacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCOTT GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At the Foul Tip Restaurant and Lounge outside Stoystown, Pa., where
they sell hot wings at the bar and glow-in-the-dark condoms in the
bathroom, Terry Butler is hunched over a beer, trying not to let the
boys see him cry.</LD>
<LD>   At most, Butler is explaining, he was on the periphery Sept. 11.
Born 42 years ago in a hard-luck stretch of Pennsylvania strip mines,
he never left. He's never been to New York or Washington. He's never
been on a plane. But he did jerk his head out from under a car hood
that morning, about six months ago, just in time to watch a United
Airlines jet plunge into a nearby field.</LD>
<LD>   For Butler, like many others, even those far removed from the
centers of power targeted that morning, the lasting impact of the
attacks has become as surprising and maddening as the attacks
themselves.</LD>
<TE>   These are the portraits of four people, in four cities, touched in
very different ways by Sept. 11. Immediately after the attacks, they
brushed themselves off, wiped the soot from their eyes, sometimes
literally, and announced that they were going to be OK.</TE>
<TE>   Only now do they know that Sept. 11 was not a singular event but a
boulder in a pond. The ripples are still there, washing over a world
that doesn't look that different but can be topsy-turvy--a world
where a man who wants to forget remembers everything and a boy who
wants to remember fears he's forgotten too much.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to try to get over it," Butler said. "But I can't handle
it. It takes something like this to bring a man down."</TE>
<TE>   And so, they are not OK. Not yet.</TE>
<TE>   Not Butler, a hulking man who doesn't look like he's afraid of
much, but is quaking with fear, wishing he'd just closed his eyes and
turned away.</TE>
<TE>   Not Lingling Sun, a World Trade Center survivor, who ducks into a
Manhattan building after a pigeon flies by her head, mistaking it for
another terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Not Randy Hamud, an attorney who has been helping coordinate the
defense of three men imprisoned in the government's dragnet, and was
shunned by the San Diego legal community.</TE>
<TE>   And not Chris Beaven, a freshman at Loyola Marymount University in
Los Angeles, who is still searching for his father, who died aboard
United Airlines Flight 93, about a quarter of a mile from where
Butler was standing.</TE>
<TE>   Randall Hamud, in his trademark burgundy cowboy boots, is
click-clunking across the marble floor of downtown San Diego's
Westgate Hotel, talking so rapidly one wonders if he's going to pass
out.</TE>
<TE>   "Charles Manson was entitled to a defense. Ted Bundy. Joe Dahmer."</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Dahmer.</TE>
<TE>   "Right. I'm just a podunk lawyer no one ever heard of, and here I
am in the middle of a constitutional crisis. All I can do is use the
media, the Fifth Estate."</TE>
<TE>   Fourth Estate.</TE>
<TE>   "Right. And if you are unwilling to take on an unpopular cause you
shouldn't be a lawyer."</TE>
<TE>   Hamud, 54, doesn't have much time to catch his breath these days.
An Arab-American of Lebanese descent and an attorney who has long
operated in obscurity, Hamud is organizing the defense of three men
the government jailed in connection with Sept. 11--Mohdar Abdallah,
Yazeed Al-Salmi and Osama Awadallah, students at San Diego State
University and Grossmont College. The three were arrested on
suspicion of being material witnesses, three of more than 1,100
people detained in the government's dragnet.</TE>
<TE>   Hamud said he took on the cases because he believed it was his
patriotic duty. The integrity of the legal system depends largely on
the notion that everyone accused of a crime deserves a sound defense,
he said, and never has that been more of a vital notion than now.
"I'm sitting here arguing for human rights," Hamud said. "I mean,
where am I? The twilight zone? We're back in the dark ages."</TE>
<TE>   He agrees with some legal scholars who believe the government has
gone too far--whether claiming the right to secretly listen to
conversations between lawyers and their clients or authorizing secret
military tribunals.</TE>
<TE>   Those are lonely convictions these days.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego lawyers run an Internet chat group where they seek legal
assistance from each other. Hamud, who specializes in civil
litigation, not criminal defense, wrote seeking help with his cases.
He was met with silence. Two lawyers responded, he said, not with
advice, but complaints that he shouldn't abuse the chat room to
represent terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   One attorney said he wanted to help but that his wife, afraid for
their safety, wouldn't let him. The death threats began a short time
later. He returned to his office one recent afternoon to find this on
his voicemail: "I have people that are going to bring a bomb by for
you." He didn't help matters when he called the attorney general
"Adolf Ashcroft" during one interview. He's been labeled a publicity
hound, a traitor and worse.</TE>
<TE>   "This wasn't exactly the 15 minutes of fame I had in mind," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Hamud found a couple of lawyers willing to help. The
cases are lumbering through the justice system. Al-Salmi was released
without being charged with a crime. Awadallah has been released on
bond and is back in class at Grossmont. Abdullah remains imprisoned.
Hamud says he can't raise any bail money among Arab-Americans, who
fear they'll be persecuted if they join his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "The waters are still roiling," Hamud said last week.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the attorney who once advertised his specialties as
dog-bite cases and medical malpractice is debating civil liberties
lawyer Alan Dershowitz on Court TV and becoming a hero in the
Arab-American community. He recently won an award named after Alex
Odeh, the regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee who was killed in 1985--assassinated, some would say--by a
pipe bomb that exploded outside his Santa Ana office.</TE>
<TE>   Hamud has taken to calling the local Arab Americans "my people,"
though his Spanish is considerably better than his Arabic.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he's attempting to keep his solo practice going.
Business, he says, is slow, which he attributes in part to a backlash
from the community.</TE>
<TE>   Relaxing recently in the comfortable home north of San Diego that
he shares with his girlfriend, Hamud gazed at one of his prized
possessions, a framed photograph of his hero, Gen. George S. Patton,
urinating in the Rhine River. Another native Californian. Another man
whose conviction often left him isolated. Another contrarian.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to trivialize soldiers, but I'm fighting just
as hard as they are right now, for the Constitution," he said. "This is
my war. I believe that I am fighting for my country."</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Center towers were almost identical. One was a bit
taller because of its needle nose, so you could tell them apart, the
same way you can tell the difference between twin brothers when one
has a cowlick.</TE>
<TE>   When they were still standing, Lingling Sun, 46, went to work each
morning at 1 World Trade Center, overseeing distribution of a Chinese
English-language newspaper. Back then, before there ever came a day
so preposterous that she would compliment a gentleman's tie after he
had given it to her to use as a dust mask, she bounded home each
night with a sprightly confidence, her shoulders straight and true
and parallel with the tops of those buildings behind her.</TE>
<TE>   The Beijing-born Sun had arrived early that morning when she felt
the first attack. Her husband, who lives in Jamaica, called. He was
watching on CNN. "A plane hit the building," he said. "Be calm. Go
down."</TE>
<TE>   She stumbled down, past people whose hair had been burned off. She
made it outside, where she saw the bodies of those who had jumped,
and she emerged into lower Manhattan as the south tower collapsed,
enveloping her in ash.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like melted chocolate, so soft," she said. "I looked back.
A man said, 'What are you looking at? There's nothing left.'"</TE>
<TE>   Today, six months after she escaped the terrorist attacks, when
she walks next to a skyscraper, her shoulder closest to the building
rises sharply and instinctively to shield her from new attacks, from
the debris she escaped that day, from the bodies that were falling
around her. For months, Sun didn't sleep well, and when she did, she
dreamed of germs that infiltrated everything, even her socks.</TE>
<TE>   Troubled by the anthrax threat, she sent gloves and a letter
opener to her 16-year-old daughter, Jenny, a student at the Taft
School in Connecticut. Jenny opened the package, laughed and asked if
it was part of a Halloween costume.</TE>
<TE>   She's been hunting for a new office, but that hasn't been easy.
She no longer wanted to work downtown and didn't want to be high off
the ground--no small request in New York City. In early October, she
met a realtor near Columbus Circle, on the Upper West Side, and
stepped into an office suite. Sun had just one question: "Where are
the stairs?" There were two sets, she was told, both nearby. Still,
she hesitated--she'd learned that several prominent businesses were
planning to move into a swanky new complex across the street.</TE>
<TE>   "They could be a target," Sun said.</TE>
<TE>   Neurotic? Maybe. She'd be the first to admit it. But it's the new
reality, one that now touches every corner of her life, from the
houseplants she lets wither to the mail she won't open because of
anthrax.</TE>
<TE>   Struggling to recapture her "old life," she's finally signed a
lease on a building--not too close to Wall Street, not too high off
the ground. She's beginning to sleep more soundly, as the nightmares
fade. But recovery hasn't come fast enough, and she said last week
that she has decided to leave her Manhattan apartment for the safer
shores across the river, in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I'm moving out," she said. "I'm one of the chickens. I
guess I just want to try to forget it. And I can't do that here."</TE>
<TE>   As Chris Beaven took his seat in a front pew, the mourners reached
the peak of Nob Hill in San Francisco and spilled into Grace
Cathedral--academics with elbow patches on their jackets, lawyers in
suits, aging hippies in tie-dye.</TE>
<TE>   It was Oct. 13, more than a month after his father, 48-year-old
Alan Beaven, an environmental attorney from Oakland, died on United
Airlines Flight 93. Mourners walked past a statue of Saint
Francis--his outstretched arms a symbol of God's love, even for the
wicked. Ushers passed out programs that didn't bill the service as a
funeral, but a "Thanksgiving for the Life of Alan Anthony Beaven,
October 15, 1952--September 11, 2001."</TE>
<TE>   Associate Pastor Janet Dobrovolny addressed the mourners. She
chose the words of the Persian poet Hafiz: "Don't surrender your
loneliness so quickly. Let it cut more deep. Let it ferment."</TE>
<TE>   As if I have a choice, Chris thought.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Alan Beaven had hopscotched the globe--from Scotland
Yard, where he was a prosecutor, to New York, where he was a trial
lawyer and where Chris lived as a boy. Alan Beaven helped launch a
Bay Area law firm in 1992. He quickly became a stalwart of the
environmental movement, taking on oil drillers and sugar companies.</TE>
<TE>   He had also become deeply involved in Eastern philosophy, joining
an ashram, meditating and practicing yoga. With his second wife and
5-year-old daughter, he was preparing to take a year's sabbatical to
volunteer for a humanitarian organization affiliated with his ashram.
He was on the East Coast, preparing for the trip, but needed to
finish one last case, a dispute over water pollution in a
Sacramento-area river. He was headed back to the Bay Area for the
case on Sept. 11, and boarded United Airlines Flight 93 that morning.</TE>
<TE>   Aboard the plane, many passengers had time to make phone
calls, and investigators believe that some learned of the attacks in New
York and Washington and elected to revolt against the hijackers.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Beaven, though, never even used a computer--he did all of his
legal work with a pen and a yellow pad. He despised cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that no one really knows the details of what happened
aboard that flight, and the Beaven family doesn't really know whether
Alan Beaven was involved in the passengers' revolt against the
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   But Chris, 18, a freshman at Loyola Marymount University in Los
Angeles, who had started classes just three weeks before the attacks,
believes. He has to believe, he says, that his father did not die in
vain.</TE>
<TE>   Weeks after the attack, the cherub-cheeked, 6-foot-6 Chris opened
one of the many letters he received, some from friends, some from
folks who "just came out of the woodwork."</TE>
<TE>   It read: "Sorry your father died in such a pointless way."</TE>
<TE>   Chris bristled.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't pointless at all. He died a hero. I think it's fair to
assume that," Chris said. "The people on that plane realized they
were going to die. Of course it took courage, but at the same time,
it must have been perfectly clear. What choice did they have?"</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Chris, who is applying to transfer to Stanford this
spring to study international relations and be closer to his family,
has had to cope with the fact that he didn't really know his father.
How many 18-year-olds do?</TE>
<TE>   He knew Alan Beaven as a wonderful father of three--two sons and a
5-year-old daughter from his second marriage. He was a dad who hit
balls high in the air with a tennis racket for his boys to catch, who
took Chris scuba diving off Catalina Island, where they darted
through kelp forests and met seals that looked them straight in the
eye.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't know much about Alan Beaven the man. So he's been
quizzing friends and relatives, learning about how much his father
gave up professionally so he could move to California to be closer to
his sons, about his father's passionate work at the ashram, about the
rivers that are cleaner today because of his father's work.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still kind of piecing it together," he said. "But now I know
so much more about him. It has raised an awareness in me. I've seen
what he did with his life. There's something to be learned here. I
might as well pay attention."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Butler met his wife-to-be when he almost ran her over. True
story: He was driving through an alley 24 years ago when he almost
ran her and her three friends down. She asked if he would give them a
lift.</TE>
<TE>   "Patty sat up front," he said. "That was it."</TE>
<TE>   It was, it seemed, the last moment of serendipity in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Straight out of high school, he started working for a boot
factory, shaping the leather on an assembly line. But the work began
to dry up, so Butler got on at Stoystown Auto Wrecker, a magnificent
compound stuffed with thousands of smashed cars, ringed with "No
Dumping" signs that seem incongruous and known as "The Yard" to
locals.</TE>
<TE>   Butler went to work on Sept. 11 like he does six days a week. A
customer had asked for a radiator, and he'd been asked to fetch it
from one of the wrecks. It was an easy job--four bolts, two hoses. He
was working under the hood just before 10 a.m. when heard the jet. He
jerked his head up and saw it soar low just a few hundred feet over
his head, past the red silo and the clothesline behind a farm, then
wobble and veer sharply into a nearby field.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like I could have just reached up and touched it," Butler
said. "All of a sudden it made a right turn, like if somebody grabbed
the wheel of your car while you were driving. Five seconds later, it
was down."</TE>
<TE>   The first days after the crash of United Airlines Flight 93 were a
blur. The town in southwest Pennsylvania, population 389, was in a
frenzy, setting up a memorial on bales of hay, collecting so much
food and blankets the Red Cross made them stop. Strangers hugged each
other on street corners.</TE>
<TE>   But the good times--it seems odd to think of them like
that--wouldn't last. Folks started locking their doors. You couldn't
buy a gun, because they were all snatched up.</TE>
<TE>   Butler was too scared to go to the spot at work where he was
when he saw the plane go down. He was scared to go home too. He was a
mess.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, he was a local celebrity. One of a handful of eyewitnesses,
the media descended upon him. A television crew making a documentary
about Flight 93 even asked him to re-create the moment. He hated
it--and then his part didn't even make it into the piece.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Yard, one of the largest businesses in a stretch of
Pennsylvania built on strip mines and cow fields, it's a tough crowd.
Co-workers accused him of getting rich off the interviews. No one had
offered him money, he said. But they were jealous of the attention.</TE>
<TE>   They pick on him even now, tell him he's crazy. He's starting to
think they're right.</TE>
<TE>   "They say I'm not all there. And I ain't," Butler said. "I
just wish someone else had seen it. I just wish I had turned my damn
head."</TE>

<HD>If It's a Great 'Do, It's Likely She Did It</HD>
<DH>Wig and hair designer Carol Doran curls and teases for
stage and film.</DH>

<LD>Discretion is a prized commodity in show biz, where things such as
actors' ages and movie producers' box-office bombs are seldom
discussed in public. So it's a tribute to Carol Doran's artistry that
many of her Hollywood clients are both willing and eager to answer
those eternal entertainment-world mysteries: Does she or doesn't she?
Is that her natural hair she's combing or someone else's?</LD>
<LD>   If the 'do in question was created by Doran, it's not always easy
to tell. Small wonder, then, that the Los Angeles-based wig and hair
designer has a list of credits in theater, opera, film and TV that's
growing as long as Rapunzel's golden tresses.</LD>
<LD>   A partial roster of Doran's star customers would include Candice
Bergen, Lauren Bacall and Robert Duvall. She fashioned Johnny Depp's
facially hirsute look for "Don Juan de Marco," gave Ian McKellen a
startling bleach job for "Gods and Monsters" and has been working
with Lynn Redgrave for 10 years.</LD>
<TE>   "Those are my favorite clients, the ones that keep coming back,
because you know what they like and don't like and what looks good on
them and the shape of their head," Doran says.</TE>
<TE>   If you saw the current feature film "Monster's Ball," you may have
spotted Doran's handiwork perched atop Billy Bob Thornton's scalp. "I
asked him ahead of time, and he said that I could mention his name,"
Doran says. "I have some clients that are very guarded. Especially
the men. The women don't care so much."</TE>
<TE>   This month, L.A. audiences have been getting an especially good
look at Doran's skill in "The Moliere Comedies," the double bill of
one-acts by the 17th century French master dramatist playing through
April 7 at the Mark Taper Forum. Staged by and starring actor Brian
Bedford, the production parades an assortment of beribboned dandies
in head-turning perukes and bowed damsels in glossy curls.</TE>
<TE>   In Moliere's time, the showy and splendiferous age of King Louis
XIV, wigs and frills were just coming into vogue, Doran says. A big
head of sculpted fake hair was "a very high fashion statement at that
point," as well as a mark of class distinction for Versailles
courtesans. The plot of "The School for Husbands," the first of the
Taper's one-acts, partly turns on issues of misleading appearances
fostered by 17th century shifts in fashion and culture.</TE>
<TE>   For Doran, an additional demand of the production was that several
ensemble members appeared in both plays, in different roles, so their
hair had to look notably distinct in each. It was a challenging job,
though by no means Doran's biggest: Last year's Mark Taper production
of the Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein musical "Flower Drum Song" called for 60
different wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Center Theatre Group, which consists of the Mark Taper Forum and
Ahmanson theaters, maintains a large wig and hair inventory, some
1,500 pieces in all. Many wigs can be taken apart and "recycled,"
Doran says. In some ways, she adds, the art has changed little since
Moliere's day.</TE>
<TE>   Doran says that wig-making "was not something I had any desire to
do" initially. But she'd always liked working with her hands ever
since her mother taught her to sew. After landing a job with San
Francisco Opera doing hair and makeup, she found that her skills in
embroidering and cross-stitching were exactly suited to the
painstaking task of weaving wigs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a really hard skill to learn, and I ended up really, really
liking it and also realizing it's a very lucrative skill to have,"
she says. Besides working in Los Angeles and for regional theaters
across the country, Doran lived in London for several years, building
wigs for the English National Opera and several West End productions.</TE>
<TE>   Her favorite historical period, tonsorially speaking? The 1930s,
"just because I love finger waves and I'm really attracted to Art
Deco furnishings," she says. The finger wave is a type of hairstyle
popularized by such actresses as Myrna Loy. So does Doran like to
experiment herself with an interesting dye job or eye-catching perm?
"Very infrequently," she says. "I have never been one for doing
trendy hair fashions on myself. I do it on the wigs."</TE>

<HD>Japanese Grasp for Answers in U.S. Management Books</HD>
<DH>Asia: Tables are turned as economic troubles boost sales of
titles such as 'Who Moved My Cheese?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK MAGNIER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>The Japanese are clutching at straws, penguins and cheese in their
struggle to force back the gloom overhanging their lives these days.</LD>
<LD>   A decade-long economic slump, scandals, social upheaval and
general angst are prompting Japanese to snap up American management
books--from "A Peacock in the Land of Penguins" to "Who Moved My
Cheese?"--in their quest for fresh ideas.</LD>
<LD>   Though long-suffering corporate salarymen in their 30s and 40s
tend to be the main buyers, several books are finding surprisingly
large audiences among homemakers, students and the elderly looking
for greater meaning in their lives.</LD>
<TE>   "Penguins," about encouraging creativity in the workplace, went on
sale last month in Japan with an 80,000-copy first run in a market
where sales of several thousand for such works are considered decent.
"Cheese" has sold a whopping 3.5million copies, a record in Japan for
any management book, and titles such as "The Goal," "The Millionaire
Mind" and the self-help book "People of the Lie" have posted strong
numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstering the sales, publishers say, is a feeling among many
Japanese that the world is moving too fast, too many companies are
foundering and society is unraveling. With traditional remedies
largely ineffective, more people are searching for answers farther
afield.</TE>
<TE>   "A book like 'The Goal' has done well by offering hope for dying
men clutching at straws," said Eiji Mitachi, international rights
editor for Diamond Inc., referring to the inspirational story by
Eliyahu Goldratt and Jeff Cox of a factory turnaround. "Many Japanese
these days are looking for answers and trying to find hope."</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't all that long ago that North America had the lock on
despair. In the late 1980s, as Japanese bankers threatened to carry
Rockefeller Center home in their luggage and corner the global art
market, Americans spent long nights studying why Japanese quality
circles, just-in-time delivery and short-term outlooks were
consigning U.S. companies to history's competitive backwater.</TE>
<TE>   From 1985 to 1990, Japan's Foreign Rights Center oversaw the
translation of 20 Japanese management books into English. Among the
big sellers handled by the publications group and its counterparts
were "The Mind of the Strategist: The Art of Japanese Business," by
Kenichi Ohmae, "Workplace Management," by Taiichi Ohno, and "The
Japan That Can Say No," by Shintaro Ishihara.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, however, the center hasn't done a single translation.
"We used to collect huge royalties from Japanese management books," a
spokeswoman said. "Now it's a few hundred dollars a year."</TE>
<TE>   Booksellers, meanwhile, are reporting a strong response here for
softer American management books in translation such as "People of
the Lie," by M. Scott Peck, and "A Peacock in the Land of Penguins,"
by B.J. Gallagher Hateley and Warren H. Schmidt. Though this
management and personal communication genre has long been popular in
the United States, it represents a new crossover market for Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "If something I wrote can help the people in Japan muddle through,
like a phoenix rising from the ashes, that's great," said Gallagher
Hateley.</TE>
<TE>   Fusosha Publishing Co., which had never handled a management book,
expected little when it bought the translation rights to "Who Moved
My Cheese?" by Spencer Johnson in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Sales have exceeded all our expectations," editor Kentaro Tomita
said. "The original target was businessmen, but we've heard back from
everyone from 9-year-old boys to 80-year-old grandparents."</TE>
<TE>   Naoko Hara, a 44-year-old Tokyo homemaker, said that though
"Cheese" isn't revolutionary, its message--adapting to change--is too
often forgotten in the constraints of Japanese life.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people seem to have scales on their eyes these days," she
said. "The 'Cheese' book really reconfirms some important human
ideas."</TE>
<TE>   According to Japan's Research Institute for Publications, 122
management books were translated into Japanese in 1999, the most
recent data available, up 160% over the 1994 level.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that everything in translation is flying off
shelves. Publishers say horn-tooting books by brash American
executives can be a tough sell.</TE>
<TE>   Though Americans love the well-told tale of a manager slaying
corporate dragons to emerge rich and envied, Japanese place a higher
premium on modesty, group decision-making and shared credit. Only
books by heavyweights such as General Electric Co.'s Jack Welch and
Microsoft Corp.'s Bill Gates sell well.</TE>
<TE>   "In the United States, they seem to publish memoirs even if the
person isn't memorable," said Diamond's Mitachi. "In Japan, 100 out
of 100 people must know someone before you'll see a memoir."</TE>
<TE>   Publishers also tend to take a pass on American books covering
taxes, personal finance issues and how to fire people, issues that
don't translate as well between the two economies.</TE>
<TE>   Books that offer lots of detail and paint-by-number guides to
corporate revival, on the other hand, are generally well received.
These not only circumvent cultural barriers but also resonate in a
nation taught to play it safe and prepare exhaustively for
contingencies.</TE>
<TE>   One big headache for editors is finding the right title. Fusosha
felt that a literal translation of "Who Moved My Cheese?" lacked the
sense of urgency needed to sell the book in Japan. The company
settled on "My Cheese Disappeared. Where Did It Go?" with the
implication that it might never be found.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring such subtleties can be expensive. Gary Hamel's "Leading
the Revolution" has done well in the U.S. but has sold less than half
its 20,000-copy production run in Japan. Yutaka Hashida, publications
salesman with Nikkei Business Publishing, attributes this in part to
insistence by the American side that the Japanese title and cover
design mirror the U.S. edition.</TE>
<TE>   "Something like 'Seven Ways to Revolutionize Your Company'
would've worked much better here," Hashida said. "It would've given
it a how-to feel. In addition, the numbers 1, 3, 7 and 100 are
considered lucky and tend to spur sales."</TE>
<TE>   Most management authors dream of having some new buzzword jump
from their pages into general use. In the 1980s, American executives
mouthed such Japanese terms as zero defects, continuous improvement,
lean production and speed to market, even if many had no idea what
the terms meant.</TE>
<TE>   These days, the American cliche makers are in control, prompting
more Japanese to talk about brand asset management, relationship
management, guerrilla marketing and supply-chain management.</TE>
<TE>   "We stopped hearing of new Japanese breakthrough ideas," said
Philip Kotler, whose "Marketing Management" is selling well here.
"The fact is that the U.S. is generating a great number of new
management ideas through an avalanche of books and articles."</TE>
<TE>   It's one thing to understand the sentiment behind many management
books from another land, including the need for bold thinking and
better communication. It's quite another to apply these ideas in a
traditional society in which those in authority strongly resist
change.</TE>
<TE>   Toyota Urago, a 29-year-old office worker at an auto parts
company, said he's a big fan of such authors as Kotler and management
guru Peter Drucker but says the old guard in Japan isn't reading
these books.</TE>
<TE>   "My bosses are dour, sedentary and completely lacking in any sense
of crisis," he said. "They're obsessed with avoiding pain rather than
changing things for the better."</TE>
<TE>   Change is painfully slow, said George Fields, an author and
president of consulting firm Fields Associates. But it is happening
as young managers increasingly are willing to criticize
traditionalists.</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S. model on the ascent, some Japanese bridle at the
brashness of American managers, the swagger of the most successful
U.S. companies and the implicit view that North America has a lock on
global business practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the U.S. has the only answer," said Kenji Iwamoto,
a 32-year-old who works in the finance industry. "We need to find a
third way that combines Japanese and U.S. ideas."</TE>
<TE>   As Japan struggles to find its way, it often seems as if nothing
is going right. Still, this country has been written off before, only
to prove the skeptics wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a cycle," said Yasuhiro Horiye, economics professor at
Kyushu University.</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows? If Americans have a recession, they might start
reading Japanese management books again."</TE>

<HD>Bank of China to Acquire Hutchison CSFBdirect</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG</DL>
<LD>Bank of China said Sunday that it would buy a Web-based brokerage
from Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. and Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd.,
betting it can sell online stock services to its customers in the
city.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of China is buying Hutchison CSFBdirect, a venture Hutchison
formed with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette unit DLJdirect in February
2000. Financial details of the deal, expected to close in May, were
not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   Credit Suisse acquired CSFBdirect when it bought Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette in November 2000.</LD>
<TE>   With the sale, CSFBdirect would become the third-biggest Hong Kong
Web-based brokerage to close or change hands in four months. Fixed
minimum commissions and slumping stock prices have made the city a
difficult market for Web-based brokers.</TE>
<TE>   "An established financial institution that can offer a
comprehensive range of services has a major advantage in providing
online retail brokerage services in this market," said Dominic Lai,
an executive director at Hutchison.</TE>
<TE>   Hong Kong scrapped plans in January to end the minimum stock-trade
commission of 0.25% on concern that price competition would cost jobs
in a city with record 6.8% unemployment. Stock market trading volume
fell by a third last year.</TE>

<HD>PepsiCo Adding Some Latin Flavor to Boost Gatorade</HD>
<DH>Marketing: It hopes the new Xtremo line will increase sales
among Spanish-speaking consumers in the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELENA GAONA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gatorade is thirsting after the U.S. Latino market.</LD>
<LD>   To quench its thirst, the sports drink division of PepsiCo Inc. is
introducing a new line of Gatorade brand drinks into the highly
competitive beverage market, which is being sliced into ever smaller
segments.</LD>
<LD>   With its new Xtremo line, PepsiCo is looking to broaden Gatorade
sales among the nation's 35million Latinos, who make up about 12% of
Gatorade's market. Gatorade dominates the U.S. sports-drink market,
controlling 80% of it, and ended 2001 with $2billion in sales.</LD>
<TE>   "The beverage market has gotten increasingly competitive, and
growth has slowed because it is so competitive," said industry
consultant Gary Hemphill, senior vice president of Beverage Marketing
Corp. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many products that companies are looking for any
advantage they can get, particularly within different demographic
groups, and Hispanics are definitely among those groups," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What Gatorade is doing is not unique--or expensive.</TE>
<TE>   To increase sales, many beverage makers are simply taking existing
brands and marketing them to different ethnic groups by repackaging
products to include Spanish and English labeling, or by boosting
advertising in ethnic markets.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Xtremo, PepsiCo is adding three Latin-inspired
flavors--mango, tropical and citrico--and bilingual labels. The
product's ad campaign will include spots on Spanish-language
television.</TE>
<TE>   "In general [ethnic markets] are a high-growth area, and they're
always looking to find where lightning will strike," said Greg
Prince, executive editor of Beverage World magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Prince pointed to Coca-Cola Co.'s recent reintroduction in the
United States of Fanta, a citrus-flavored soft drink brand popular in
Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Coca-Cola initially introduced the Fanta line in six markets,
including Southern California, Texas and Arizona, in 2001 after a
20-year absence from U.S. store shelves. Today, Fanta is available in
almost every U.S. market; last year it boosted the division's sales
by $17million, Fanta spokeswoman Maria Perez said.</TE>
<TE>   Hemphill said PepsiCo has done a good job of segmenting its
Gatorade products, such as introducing a so-called Fierce line for
Generation X consumers and a Frost line that is popular among women
and by continuing to market its core Gatorade sports drink to active
males.</TE>
<TE>   Gatorade officials would not discuss projected sales for Xtremo,
but the Frost and Fierce lines had sales of more than $100 million
their first year on the market, according to the company. Xtremo
sales are forecast to be considerably less because it will be sold
only in 32-ounce bottles, and distribution will be limited.</TE>
<TE>   PepsiCo also is finding success marketing its core soft drink
brands to ethnic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Flavored sodas such as Sierra Mist, with ads in Spanish in certain
markets, and Mountain Dew's Code Red, with a strong presence in
African American markets, are helping to boost sales, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Colombian singer Shakira was seen shaking her hips to a
bilingual tune with a Pepsi in hand. In English, she sang of "The joy
of Pepsi," while in Spanish she told TV audiences "Goza el sabor de
Pepsi."</TE>

<HD>GM Striving to Make Inroads in the Global Luxury Market</HD>
<DH>Autos: Cadillac and Saab look to crossovers, other models
to compete in what's seen as a growth area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRIL YUE JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>Drive around any European or Asian capital, and you'll rarely see a
Cadillac. The only Cadillacs in Paris or Tokyo are likely to be
driven by the U.S. ambassador or flown in for U.S. presidential
visits.</LD>
<LD>   And therein lies a problem of stretch-limo proportions for General
Motors Corp.: It lacks a potent luxury brand it can sell around the
world, at a time when the luxury segment is emerging as one of the
auto industry's hottest growth areas.</LD>
<LD>   Neither of GM's luxury brands--Cadillac and Saab--is a global
contender against the likes of DaimlerChrysler brand Mercedes-Benz,
BMW or Volkswagen unit Audi. From the United Arab Emirates to New
Zealand, even Rolls-Royce and Bentley have more cachet than GM's
contenders.</LD>
<TE>   In the luxury arena, GM is getting hammered by domestic rivals
Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler, which have strong-selling
high-end brands.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac, for decades the brand leader in the U.S. luxury market,
has fallen from grace. The No. 1 luxury brand up to 1997, Cadillac
has sunk to No. 4 as Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus, Mercedes and BMW
have raced ahead with a wider range of sedans, sports cars and
trucks. Cadillac's sales have fallen from a high of 350,000 in 1978
to less than half that--172,000--last year.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of Saab, which has had only two models for what seems
forever, have grown under GM ownership but are trailing off.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, sales of Ford Motor's Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo
brands are growing steadily around the world, and Mercedes' image is
the stuff of legend.</TE>
<TE>   "GM does not have a global luxury brand," said Jim Hall, vice
president of consulting firm AutoPacific in Detroit. "Unless they can
get that going, they're going to lose out in the luxury market, which
is going to be the hottest sector in the coming two decades."</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac has focused on trucks the last couple of years, first
catching up to Ford Motor's Lincoln Navigator sport utility vehicle,
then designing an all-new Escalade SUV that has caught on well.</TE>
<TE>   "We were late to the game with the full-size utility," said Mark
LaNeve, Cadillac's general manager. "We don't want to be late to the
next exploding segment, if it's the $20,000-to-$25,000 luxury
segment. If you can call that luxury."</TE>
<TE>   Thus, Cadillac is in the middle of an assault on the wallets of
the wealthy and moderately wealthy with some new high-tech vehicles
it hopes will attract a younger following at home and abroad.</TE>
<TE>   And Saab is finally moving toward something it has long needed to
resuscitate the brand: an SUV-like crossover.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac recently turned the corner on design, sending to
showrooms the just-released CTS sedan and Escalade, with their
chiseled, angular looks marking a watershed for Cadillac styling.</TE>
<TE>   And Cadillac plans to keep pumping it out. A pickup version of the
Escalade recently went on sale, and an even bigger version based on
the hulking Chevy Suburban is planned.</TE>
<TE>   "Our competitive advantage derives from our North American
vehicles that Mercedes, Lexus and Volvo don't make and can't sell in
their home markets," LaNeve said. "First and foremost, we have to be
competitive in our home market."</TE>
<TE>   He slices the luxury passenger car market into segments that have
been overrun by imports, and said emphatically that Cadillac already
is or will be in every one of them--entry luxury with the CTS;
prestige luxury with the Seville; ultra luxury with the XLR roadster
due out next year; and mid-luxury utility crossover with the
wagon-like SRX in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "This is where all the growth has been in the last 20 years,"
LaNeve said. "It's the reason we slipped, but it's the reason we
think we can come back," he said, adding: "We'll be global with our
new vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   As for Saab, the Swedish marque offers what is called good "brand
equity": a strong, upscale image of safety and environmental
consciousness. In the past it was noted for being different with the
somewhat quirky designs of the former 900 and 9000 models.</TE>
<TE>   But the company hasn't made money for years, and Saab's design has
become nondescript with the current 9-3 and 9-5 models.</TE>
<TE>   Saab, of which GM bought 50% in 1990 and the rest in 2000, also
has suffered by being on the sidelines of the truck boom. It has two
cars that perform well--the turbocharged, 230-horsepower 9-5 Aero can
hit 156 mph--but tend to be pricey.</TE>
<TE>   Why pay $40,000 for a 9-5 Aero wagon when you can get a
212-horsepower Subaru Outback wagon with all-wheel drive for $10,000
less?</TE>
<TE>   Saab's U.S. sales peaked in 1999 at 39,500, falling to 37,500 last
year. Peter Augustsson, chief executive of Saab Automobile, said he's
confident he'll boost Saab's global sales from 126,000 last year to
200,000 in four or five years, including 70,000 in U.S. sales.</TE>
<TE>   But to get there he'll need a wider product lineup, including a
bigger vehicle that can carry more people and cargo, a direction that
Swedish rival Volvo has taken with its new XC90 SUV.</TE>
<TE>   And that's just what Saab's going to get. "You will see a
crossover from Saab," Augustsson said.</TE>
<TE>   Saab has been showing two concept cars, the 9X and 9-3X, that give
an idea of the shape of things to come. They are of the "two box"
type of design--wagon-like, as if a smaller box (the front end) were
placed in front of a larger box.</TE>
<TE>   "The two-box shape is very, very important, not least when
stretching forward in design language," Augustsson said. But "a
truck-based SUV you will never see from Saab," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The crossover will be based on a passenger car to retain nimble
steering and better gas mileage.</TE>
<TE>   Saab's crossover "is probably the way to go," said Michael Ward,
an auto industry analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. BMW, Mercedes and
Honda Motor Co.'s Acura all have smaller SUVs, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Saab's limited availability remains an obstacle, Ward said.</TE>
<TE>   "They do have a global reach, but the point is they distribute
basically on the East and West coasts and not ... a lot in between,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Saab could sell through or alongside Cadillac dealers, a plan that
was announced for Europe last fall but was scrapped for several
reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Cadillac first needs to refine its dealer network.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the dealers have gotten sluggish and not competitive.
They look antiquated," Ward said. "People my age don't walk into
Cadillac dealerships if there's a brand-new, shiny Lexus dealer
nearby, where they treat customers in a very different way," the
42-year-old said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the cars aren't good, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Take the Seville versus the [BMW] 5-Series. Pound for pound, the
Seville's a better car," he said. "But you don't see many people
buying them."</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>HCA Inc. said Sunday that a federal appellate court overturned
health-care fraud convictions against two executives of the biggest
U.S. hospital chain, just as the government considers whether to
prosecute others in the case.</LD>
<LD>   The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta reversed the
convictions of Jay A. Jarrell and Robert W. Whiteside on Friday, HCA
said. They were found guilty on six counts each in July 1999 as part
of a fraud investigation against the company.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel said the U.S. government failed to prove
Jarrell and Whiteside had knowingly and willfully made false
statements in reports to Medicare. The two men were the only HCA
executives to be convicted in the case. HCA has paid $840 million in
penalties to settle related criminal allegations and most civil
allegations against the company.</LD>
<TE>   "The appeals case confirmed that in the cost reporting process the
applicable rules and regulations are frequently unclear, ambiguous
and subject to conflicting interpretations," Pat Loughlin, an HCA
attorney, said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys for Jarrell and Whiteside could not be reached for
comment. The Justice Department did not return phone calls.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrell had been sentenced to 33 months in prison and ordered to
pay $1.7 million in fines and restitution.</TE>
<TE>   Whiteside had been sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to
pay more than $500,000 in restitution.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling comes as the Justice Department and Nashville-based HCA
battle over remaining civil fraud claims that allege the company
overbilled Medicare by about $650 million by inflating cost reports
and paying kickbacks to doctors in exchange for patient referrals.</TE>

<HD>German Banks Step Up Efforts to Rescue Kirch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MUNICH, Germany</DL>
<LD>The country's biggest banks, facing as much as $1.3 billion in bad
loans after construction firm Philipp Holzmann collapsed last week,
stepped up their efforts to rescue media company Kirch Holding and
minimize their losses.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of German banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche
Bank and investors including Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. and Italian
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi met in Munich during the weekend to
try to reach an agreement on how to inject more funds into
KirchMedia, Kirch's film library business.</LD>
<LD>   Banks cannot afford a second high-profile failure, investors said.
Kirch, which has $5.7 billion in debt, owns the country's largest
television broadcaster, Europe's biggest film library and the rights
to sporting events such as World Cup soccer.</LD>
<TE>   Commerzbank said Friday that it was among a group of banks that
might agree to buy a stake in KirchMedia, throwing a lifeline to a
company that needs $1 billion next month to repay loans and buy out
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The rescue proposal discussed by creditors and shareholders would
cut founder Leo Kirch's personal 72% stake in KirchMedia to a
minority, the Financial Times said Saturday, without citing sources.
Banks also would ask Berlusconi's Mediaset and Fininvest and
Murdoch's News Corp. to back a $700-million capital increase to keep
KirchMedia in business, the newspaper said.</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Holzmann's filing for bankruptcy protection on
Thursday, Deutsche Bank, the biggest creditor and the largest
shareholder, probably will have to pick up the lion's share of the
bill. Dresdner Bank, by contrast, has an exposure of less than $8.6
million, according to newspaper reports.</TE>
<TE>   A Kirch failure would endanger loans of $86 million or more for at
least eight banks, according to Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale,
the No. 1 creditor, including Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., which also
is a Kirch shareholder and the Munich-based media company's main
banking advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "Keeping Kirch in business is necessary for the banks to avoid big
write-downs, especially for HVB," said Olaf Conrad, who helps manage
$13 billion at Trinkaus Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   German banks are under pressure as bad-loan charges mount and
slumping markets crimp profit.</TE>
<TE>   Injecting fresh cash in return for a stake in KirchMedia, which
owns more than 15,000 hours of programming, might be a step toward a
Kirch rescue and would give the banks collateral against their loans.</TE>

<HD>Liability Rates Rise for Firms, Consumers</HD>
<DH>Insurance: Sept. 11, big bankruptcies and years of price
cutting have led to increases, experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cost of insuring against lawsuits already has climbed for company
directors in the wake of Enron Corp.'s meltdown. Now, liability
insurance is becoming more expensive for others--including
homeowners--as insurers get pickier about the risks they are willing
to take.</LD>
<LD>   Premiums for certain kinds of professional liability coverage are
rising as much as 70%, and insurers are trimming coverage and
dropping unprofitable customers, insurance brokers said.</LD>
<LD>   Companies that paid $12,000 for $1 million of liability coverage
for its directors and officers last year now pay $20,000 to $30,000,
said Susanne Murray, national director for such coverage at insurance
broker Willis Group Holdings Ltd.</LD>
<TE>   The average insurance tab for company directors and officers is
expected to rise an additional 35% this year, and some big public
companies will face increases of 50% or more, said Murray, who
co-authored a study of current liability-insurance market conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Even liability insurance for nonbusiness risks, such as lawsuit
protection for drivers and homeowners, is beginning to rise.</TE>
<TE>   Rates for so-called umbrella or personal-liability policies, which
offer lawsuit protection on top of a homeowner or auto policy, are
rising nationwide from an average of $150 for $1 million of coverage
last year to about $200 this year, said Michelle Kenney, director of
underwriting for Fireman's Fund in Novato, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   A number of factors have collided to produce what insurers call a
"hard market" for liability insurance, in which even steep price
increases are sticking and insurance purchasers have little choice
but to pay or go without coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, poor stock market returns, more
class-action lawsuits, high-profile corporate bankruptcies such as
those filed by Enron and Global Crossing Ltd. and years of price cuts
have contributed to the current rate hikes, insurance experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Premiums for all kinds of insurance had been gradually increasing
before Sept. 11, as insurers realized that price wars had trimmed
rates too far for the companies to remain profitable. More than a
year of poor investment returns also were taking their toll.</TE>
<TE>   "Insurance companies historically have operated at a slight loss,
but they have been able to make up for it with investment income,"
Kenney said. "Now they don't have the same [leeway] to cover up that
loss, and the [insurance] lines have to stand on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Those problems were exacerbated by the terrorist attacks. The
giant reinsurance companies that are paying most of the $40-billion
to $70-billion insurance tab for the tragedy have sharply raised the
prices they charge insurers and reduced the available coverage, said
Don Griffin, head of business and personal lines for the National
Assn. of Independent Insurers.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer advocates have warned that insurers may be taking
advantage of the terrorist attacks to push through big premium
increases. But other insurance experts say the price increases
probably are overdue for liability insurance.</TE>
<TE>   "The pricing was pretty much out of whack for a number of years,"
said Murray of insurance broker Willis. "Prices were dropping by 15%
a year and features were being added for free [to attract
customers]."</TE>
<TE>   Insurers also are spooked by a rising number of lawsuits and
bigger settlements, said Fred Sklow, an insurance analyst for
Standard &amp; Poor's.</TE>
<TE>   The number of federal securities fraud class-action lawsuits filed
last year hit a record--487--compared with the previous peak of 236
in 1998, according to the Stanford Securities Class Action
Clearinghouse.</TE>
<TE>   The bursting of the dot-com bubble and a record number of failed
initial public offerings in 2000 helped increase the number of
lawsuits. More lawsuits mean more claims on liability insurance as
companies defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Enron debacle has made insurers and their clients
more aware of how much potential liability can be faced by a
company's directors and officers. Enron's directors have been named
in dozens of lawsuits filed by angry shareholders and employees.</TE>
<TE>   Some accountants are feeling the heat as well after Andersen's
role as Enron's auditor drew lawsuits and a federal indictment for
alleged obstruction of justice.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Big Five accounting firms generally are self-insured,
liability rates for second-tier firms that audit public companies
generally are on the rise, said John Kenny, senior underwriting
officer for Aon Corp., which provides insurance for more than 25% of
the accounting market.</TE>
<TE>   Higher rates have yet to trickle down to smaller accounting firms,
said Mark Cheffers, owner of AccountingMalpractice.com, which tracks
insurance trends.</TE>
<TE>   In California, where most local accounting firms are covered by
mutual insurer Camico, accountants still pay $3,000 to $7,000 for $1
million of errors-and-omissions insurance to cover any professional
mistakes, said Ron Klein, general counsel for the company.</TE>

<DH>Media: The broadcasters say Nielsen fails to include enough
Spanish speakers in TV surveys.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>How many Latinos are watching Spanish-language television?</LD>
<LD>   About 30% more in Los Angeles than Nielsen's ratings show,
according to Spanish-language broadcasters, who say the TV ratings
firm is chronically underestimating Latino viewers.</LD>
<LD>   To try to keep up with changing demographics, Nielsen Media
Research in the last decade has spent millions of dollars to create
separate Latino audience panels to measure their TV tastes across the
country and sent legions of bilingual recruiters to find more
Spanish-speaking families to participate in the surveys.</LD>
<TE>   But Nielsen still is under attack for underestimating Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been telling Nielsen forever, 'You need to fix it,' " said
Michael Wortsman, president of Univision Communications Inc.'s
television group.</TE>
<TE>   Univision, the nation's largest Spanish-language broadcaster, has
refused to sign a multiyear Nielsen contract for its flagship
station, KMEX-TV Channel 34 in Los Angeles, because of what Univision
says are inaccurate ratings. Nielsen's audience surveys for local
stations are flawed, Univision says, because they contain too many
English speakers. The broadcaster wants more Spanish speakers added.</TE>
<TE>   "I can understand the frustration of some of our clients, but
we're trying to move as quickly as possible," said Paul Donato,
Nielsen senior vice president for research. "Everyone wants to do the
right thing, but there's no consensus on how to get there."</TE>
<TE>   At stake is about $100 million a year in extra advertising for Los
Angeles-based Univision, its chief rival, Telemundo, and other niche
networks, including Viacom Inc.'s Black Entertainment Television.
Univision said the shortage of Spanish-speaking Nielsen families,
particularly in Los Angeles, Phoenix and Sacramento, costs it at
least $65 million a year in lost advertising revenue because of lower
ratings.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating this debate is that the major English-language TV
networks and their affiliate stations have long resisted changes in
audience surveys that might boost Univision's or Telemundo's
ratings--at the expense of English-language broadcasters. The tension
illustrates the tug of war over Nielsen's ratings, which help steer
an estimated $58 billion a year in national and local TV advertising.</TE>
<TE>   "The English-language networks have more to lose than anyone
else," said Paul Casanova, president of Irvine-based advertising firm
Casanova Pendrill, which specializes in Spanish-language media.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, Spanish-language programs garner just 5% of the
overall TV audience, according to Nielsen, and that translates into
about $1.8 billion a year in advertising, or 3% of the market.</TE>
<TE>   Separate Survey Set Up for Latino Preferences</TE>
<TE>   Developing an accurate picture of Latino TV viewing has been a
sensitive issue since the late 1980s, when Univision and Telemundo
first approached Nielsen because it didn't measure any Spanish-
language TV viewers. At the time, Latinos made up less than 10% of
the U.S. population, compared with about 14% today.</TE>
<TE>   So a decade ago, Nielsen created a separate audience survey of
Latino homes to rate national and local Spanish-language programming.
This is in addition to Nielsen's national and local-market surveys
that primarily track English-language programming, although some
Latinos are included in these audience panels.</TE>
<TE>   But determining TV viewership by language is no easy task, given
that two-thirds of Latinos in the U.S. understand English and
Spanish, according to market researcher Strategy Research Corp. in
Miami.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, not all Latinos are glued to Univision or Telemundo.
Latinos who speak or understand English still are more likely to
watch English-language shows. In November, "Friends" and "ER" on
General Electric Co.'s NBC were the top-rated shows for adults in Los
Angeles, while the highest-rated Spanish-language show was
Univision's teenage soap opera "Amigas y Rivales" (Friends and
Rivals), which ranked ninth. In this survey, of the 50 top-rated
shows, only four were Spanish-language programs.</TE>
<TE>   "We're the only people who are working on independent [TV]
estimates based on language," said Nielsen's Donato. "There are no
government statistics that the television community can use."</TE>
<TE>   Increasing Spanish Speakers in Surveys</TE>
<TE>   Facing pressure from Univision and Telemundo, Nielsen in its TV
surveys has boosted the number of households where Spanish is the
dominant language, particularly in Southern California. Today, 15.1%
of Nielsen's local survey group is Spanish-language dominant, up from
10.7% five years ago. But Nielsen acknowledges that the numbers still
fall short of its target of 17.5%.</TE>
<TE>   Change comes slowly.</TE>
<TE>   For more than two years, Nielsen has been debating whether its
fieldworkers trying to recruit families in Latino neighborhoods
should begin a conversation with "Hola" instead of "Hello." Some
English-language TV executives complain that using "Hola" could
unintentionally put off English speakers who then would be less
inclined to participate and thereby cut the ratings of
English-language shows.</TE>
<TE>   Next week, Nielsen plans to unveil the results of its study that
should resolve the debate over which language should be used in
greetings. The study also will decide whether to include children in
TV ratings samples, a decision that could boost ratings for some
English-language shows because studies have shown that Latino
children watch more TV in English.</TE>
<TE>   Univision still is pushing Nielsen to give more weight to Spanish
speakers in the local-market ratings surveys.</TE>
<TE>   But critics said weighting the TV viewership sample toward one
demographic group isn't the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "We have clients in the English-language media who have some
legitimate questions on how we are developing those language-
universe estimates," said Doug Darfield, Nielsen's director of
Hispanic services.</TE>
<TE>   One of Nielsen's problems, industry experts said, is that it tries
to measure the preferences of Spanish-language TV viewers with a
separate panel of about 800 households and relies on a decades-old
combination of handwritten diaries and TV set-top meters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really 1950s thinking--that this is a separate audience that
has to be treated separately," said Jack Myers, publisher of the Jack
Myers Report, a media newsletter in New York. "The Hispanic audience
is integrating into every aspect of American life, with the exception
of advertising buying."</TE>
<TE>   NBC research chief Alan Wurtzel said: "It's really a problem when
you wind up having lots of different sample panels. It would be
valuable in the long term to have [one] large-enough panel to measure
all TV viewed."</TE>

<HD>Overture May Mute Rivals</HD>
<DH>Experts say Internet firm has foothold on advertisers,
customers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having shown that online advertising can actually be profitable,
Overture Services Inc. is girding for a fight as Internet search
engines try to duplicate the Pasadena company's success.</LD>
<LD>   Overture sells "sponsored links" that pop up in search engines on
portals such as Yahoo Inc., Microsoft Corp.'s MSN and AOL Time Warner
Inc.'s America Online. Advertisers bid for placement and pay Overture
only when someone clicks on their links.</LD>
<LD>   That pay-for-performance approach has made Overture one of the few
profitable online ad services and a Wall Street favorite. In 2001, a
year in which dot-coms melted into oblivion, the company posted a
$20-million profit on revenue of $288 million.</LD>
<TE>   But others are trying to play Overture's finale.</TE>
<TE>   Search engine Google last month snatched away a contract with
EarthLink Inc. Overture's agreement to post listings with America
Online expires next month. Its contract with Yahoo expires in the
summer, and Yahoo has contemplated creating its own service.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives, though, don't expect the competition to set
them back.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all over it when new entrants come into the market," Chief
Executive Ted Meisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Overture's approach is simple and offers clients a more definitive
way to measure the effectiveness of an offer than traditional banner
or pop-up advertising. Advertisers bid for placement, with the
highest bidder appearing at the top of a list of search results. When
a consumer clicks on a link, the advertiser pays Overture a set fee,
which is split with the hosting site.</TE>
<TE>   Advertisers request to be listed under specific key terms. A car
dealership, for example, might ask to be listed in search results for
"cars." So whenever someone types "cars" into the search field of,
say, Yahoo, the ad listing pops up. Its ranking depends on how much
the advertiser agreed to pay Overture.</TE>
<TE>   The search engine has about 8 million paid listings from 53,000
advertisers. The average fee paid by advertisers at the end of 2001
was 23 cents per click-through; the average advertiser paid $1,980
during the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Since launching the service in 1997, Overture has come to rule the
market. But with Google jumping in and Yahoo considering it, Overture
might find itself having to bid for placement in the same way its
advertisers do.</TE>
<TE>   "The company that's the best organized to make the most money can
pay the most to buy the distribution," said Lanny Baker, analyst with
Salomon Smith Barney.</TE>
<TE>   Should Google, or any other competitor, offer higher rates to
partner sites, Overture might have to increase the amount it pays as
well. But right now, Baker said, Overture is in the best position to
offer competitive rates.</TE>
<TE>   Although Google's search engine could draw advertisers and
customers away from Overture, analysts do not believe it is likely.
The company is modeled after the Yellow Pages, which has "almost a
natural monopoly," said Safa Rashtchy, analyst with U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray.</TE>
<TE>   The phone book contains all businesses in town and nearly every
household has one, virtually eliminating the need for a second Yellow
Pages, Rashtchy said. If Overture includes listings from a majority
of advertisers, they--and the customers--will have no reason to go
anywhere else.</TE>
<TE>   About 95% of Overture's traffic comes from its partner sites.</TE>
<TE>   Although the company is poised to dominate the pay-for-performance
industry, its stock has not been so stable. Shares fell 41% in early
February when EarthLink announced it had chosen Google to run its
search engine. The stock rebounded but fell again two weeks later
when Google announced it was offering cost-per-click searches. The
stock peaked at $108.25 in November 1999, when the company called
itself GoTo.com. It fell $1.85 Friday to $29.02 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts expect the company to extend its contracts with AOL and
Yahoo later this year, but shares could drop again if the company
fails to do so.</TE>
<TE>   "Psychologically, the stock will need [the contracts to be
renewed]," Rashtchy said.</TE>
<TE>   Having built partnerships with most of the major portals in the
United States, the company is now expanding into international
markets. Overture signed a multiyear contract with AOL in January to
provide search results in the United Kingdom, Germany and France. The
company also has an agreement with one of Europe's leading Internet
service providers, T-Online.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Overture is working on securing longer contracts with
its current partners--last month the company extended its contract
with Microsoft to provide search results for its MSN Web site through
2003--and increasing the number of results that are listed on each
partner site.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really an attractive business," Meisel said. "It's going
to invite competition."</TE>

<LD>Economic Data Expected to Point to Recovery</LD>
<LD>   Despite the holiday-shortened week, look for a bevy of economic
data, most of which are expected to underscore the strengthening
economy.</LD>
<LD>   Trading could be particularly thin and choppy since Wall Street is
set for a four-day week with exchanges closed in observance of Good
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Many investors will be on vacation for the Passover and Easter
holidays.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Wall Street will take a look at data on the housing
sector, a pocket of economic strength, with reports on February sales
of existing homes today and new homes Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Economists expect a decrease in last month's sales of existing
homes, though new-home sales are likely to have risen in February,
when compared with January results.</TE>
<TE>   One of the week's most closely watched set of numbers will be
reported Tuesday with the release of February orders for costly
durable goods, which includes such items as washing machines and
computers.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, data showed U.S. businesses were building up
inventories, anticipating an increase in demand from consumers and
businesses amid the economic upturn.</TE>
<TE>   Now, investors are looking for evidence that anticipated growth in
demand is showing up in orders.</TE>
<TE>   A final revision to fourth-quarter U.S. gross domestic product
data is expected Thursday. Economists expect GDP to show a gain of
1.4%--same as the previous revision.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer will move to center stage with two closely watched
reports set for release.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer spending, which makes up approximately two-thirds of the
economic activity in the nation, remained strong throughout the
downturn, and traders are watching for indications that it has
continued to stay resilient.</TE>
<TE>   The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence, due Tuesday,
is expected to show a gain to 98.8 in March from 94.1 in February.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, University of Michigan's final March consumer
sentiment report will be released. The forecast calls for a reading
of 95.1, up from 90.7 in February.</TE>
<TE>   The New York and Chicago regional manufacturing surveys, which are
due Thursday, will be scrutinized for clues on whether the U.S.
manufacturing sector is emerging from its slump.</TE>

<TE>   Andersen Partners May Vote on Work Clause</TE>
<TE>   Partners of accounting firm Andersen may vote within a week on
whether to rescind their noncompete agreements, which would allow
them to join rival firms and bring clients along, partners and legal
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   Though hundreds of Andersen's 1,600 U.S. partners have talked with
other Big Five accounting firms, the rivals haven't hired them
because of concern about legal liability from plaintiffs suing
Andersen over its role as Enron's auditor or from Andersen's
creditors if the company files for bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "The noncompete clause is under consideration by our leadership,
and we are supposed to hear back from them by ... Thursday," said
Jack Gelman, a New York-based partner in Andersen's consulting
business. "The firm is cognizant of the fact that people have a right
to make a living, and these are internal matters being discussed by
our leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Andersen oversight board Chairman Paul Volcker proposed
a takeover of the fourth-biggest accounting firm, provided the
Justice Department drops the criminal charges that threaten its
survival. The proposal, which Volcker promises will place new
management at the top of the firm headed by Chief Executive Joseph
Berardino, requires the approval of Andersen partners.</TE>
<TE>   Rivals Ernst &amp; Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte &amp;
Touche, as well as smaller firms, could gain hundreds of clients that
may follow departing Andersen partners.</TE>
<TE>   For the partners, even voting to rescind the noncompete agreement
so they can get new jobs could be legally perilous. If a partner then
leaves the firm, a plaintiff or creditor could argue that the
partners contributed to Andersen's demise by voting in their own
self-interest.</TE>
<TE>   For now, concern about Andersen's liabilities has scared away
potential purchasers of the firm. Ernst &amp; Young and Deloitte &amp; Touche
held talks with Andersen about buying its U.S. operations, then
pulled out because of the legal liabilities.</TE>
<TE>   For rival firms that want to hire Andersen partners, the
noncompete clause is the main concern. If that obligation is dropped,
it may spark an exodus of partners and accelerate client defections,
analysts said.</TE>

<TE>   States vs. Microsoft Case Enters 2nd Week</TE>
<TE>   The antitrust case against Microsoft Corp. continues this week in
Washington, after an opening week in which witnesses faced tough
questioning and were admonished by a skeptical federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the nine states suing Microsoft over antitrust violations
still think they can persuade the court to impose far-reaching
penalties on the software company.</TE>
<TE>   The states want Microsoft to create a stripped-down version of its
flagship Windows software that could incorporate competitors'
features. The states also want Microsoft to divulge the blueprints
for its Internet Explorer browser.</TE>
<TE>   The states hope U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly will
allow them to present evidence they say shows that Microsoft has
damaged competition in emerging markets such as hand-held computers,
television set-top boxes and smart cell phones.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses expected for the states this week are:</TE>

<TE>   Europeans Debate Airline Insurance</TE>
<TE>   The European Commission and the region's transport ministers,
meeting Tuesday in Brussels, will discuss the issue of allowing
governments to continue providing airlines with emergency war and
terrorism insurance to cover risks that have been uninsurable since
Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   After insurers slashed coverage and hiked premiums, governments
stepped in to provide their airlines with third-party liability
coverage for acts of war and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Under European Union rules, this constitutes state aid and must
therefore be approved by the commission, the EU's executive arm.</TE>
<TE>   Current approval runs out at the end of the month, and if EU
governments want to extend it they need the commission's nod. The
United States decided last week to extend similar coverage to its
airlines for 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   Many EU governments are reluctant to act as guarantor for risks
they want to see covered by commercial insurers, but with a lack of
adequate insurance available at a price the airlines are prepared to
pay, they have had little choice.</TE>
<TE>   The global airline industry is looking at the possibility of
creating its own mutual insurance fund.</TE>
<TE>   In the EU, the Assn. of European Airlines is planning a fund that
would cover risks for as much as $1.5 billion via a surcharge on
tickets of 50 cents to $1.</TE>

<KH>EXECUTIVE ROUNDTABLE</KH>
<HD>Before Accepting Stock, Know Why You Want It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer are a summary of discussions at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   Question: I'm a "hired-gun" chief executive of a small,
family-owned company. After five years of working for salary and
bonuses, I have been offered stock as part of my compensation package
for next year. Every year I have asked for stock in the company, but
now that the opportunity has arrived, I'm not sure I want to make
that kind of commitment. In order to get fully vested in the stock, I
have to stick around five to seven more years.</LD>
<LD>   Owning some equity is important to me, but the more I think about
it, the more those golden handcuffs are starting to look like iron
shackles. What should I do?</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Many professional CEOs see the attainment of equity as the
holy grail of their position. To own a piece of the company they work
for somehow symbolizes that they have "arrived."</TE>
<TE>   However, keep in mind that minority shares in a private company
have no value on the open market. So before locking yourself into a
specific course of action, make sure you understand all the issues.</TE>
<TE>   Carri Johnston, president of Pep Threads in Orange, says to first
become clear on what ownership means to you and how it will affect
you financially.</TE>
<TE>   "Ownership sounds great," she said, "but it does have its
drawbacks and limitations, especially when you hold a minority
position in a privately held company. What looks like a good deal on
paper may not look so good five years down the road when it comes
time to cash out. I would do some soul-searching to determine why
ownership is so important to you. I would also explore whether you
can accomplish your financial goals by some other means."</TE>
<TE>   Suzanne Frindt, a principal at consulting firm 2130 Partners in
Villa Park, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Your job is to build value for the owners," she said. "However,
there are many ways to get compensated for doing so, of which stock
options represent just one. Start looking into phantom stock and
other types of deferred compensation plans. Then sit down with the
owners and get creative about how you can best meet both of your
needs."</TE>
<TE>   Jo Hunt, president of DeLyon-Hunt &amp; Associates in Redondo Beach,
believes there is a deeper and more important issue involved--your
reluctance to commit to the job for five more years. Before making
any decisions regarding the stock offer, she recommends evaluating
your personal and professional goals and your future with the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "The first thing I would do would be to explore why accepting the
stock would cause you to feel trapped or locked in," she said. "Do
you have a tenuous relationship with the owners? Does the job still
challenge you personally and professionally? Does the direction the
company is going in excite you, or has the time come for a change of
scenery? If you can't commit yourself 100% to the job, don't take the
stock options. Instead, start looking around for something that will
rekindle your sense of passion and commitment."</TE>
<TE>   If you decide to stay put and accept the stock offer, Wes
Phillips, CEO of Hunter Barth Advertising in Costa Mesa, says, you
should make sure the deal is structured properly.</TE>
<TE>   "Pay close attention to how the stock will get valued, how it will
get converted to cash and all those technical aspects," he said. "In
addition, if the stock options depend on growth, revenue or
profitability targets, make sure they don't require too much of a
stretch for you or the company. Why bother with stock options if you
have no chance of achieving the goals?</TE>
<TE>   "Also, you might want to consider retaining professional counsel,
someone who knows all the issues and will look out for your best
interests in the deal. The last thing you want is to get stuck with
25% ownership that you can never get anything out of."</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Handspring Inc. has introduced a test version of a program that
provides access to corporate e-mail for users of its new Treo device,
which combines a cell phone and a hand-held computer.</LD>
<LD>   The program, called Treo Mail, will let users of the device send
and receive messages through corporate e-mail systems that run on
Microsoft Corp.'s Exchange software. Other hand-held devices that
include e-mail functions include Palm Inc.'s i705 and Research in
Motion Ltd.'s BlackBerry.</LD>
<LD>   Treo also lets users make phone calls, organize appointments and
send short text messages.</LD>
<TE>   Mountain View, Calif.-based Handspring is counting on sales of the
$399 Treo, introduced this year, to help the company turn its first
profit since its 1998 founding.</TE>
<TE>   A final version of Treo Mail, which is based on software from
closely held Visto Corp., will go on sale by midyear, said Joe
Sipher, vice president of product marketing for Handspring.</TE>
<TE>   The price has not been determined and may include monthly payments
to Handspring, Sipher said.</TE>

<HD>IBM to Develop Software to Link Computers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>IBM Corp. has struck a deal to link a U.S. government research
laboratory's far-flung computers in a powerful grid, massively
boosting their ability to study complex issues such as global climate
change.</LD>
<LD>   Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said last week it will work with the
Department of Energy's National Energy Research Scientific Computing
Center, based in Berkeley, on developing software to connect the
lab's supercomputers and data storage machines to other computers in
four locations.</LD>
<LD>   The center said its goal is to enable scientists to connect
supercomputers and storage machines to off-site scientific
instruments such as telescopes, making it easier to do research or
analyze data stored in diverse locations.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, scientists will be able to tap into computing power
at far-flung locations, said Horst Simon, a research director at the
National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center. The lab has a 5
teraflop supercomputer, or one that can run 5 trillion operations per
second, located in Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   IBM has said the new field of "grid computing" is one of its key
computing strategies under new Chief Executive Sam Palmisano.</TE>
<TE>   It said it saw numerous commercial uses for the technology, which
will one day allow corporations such as financial institutions to tap
into off-site computing power.</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rayovac Corp. said it has developed a new rechargeable battery that
will take only 15 minutes to recharge.</LD>
<LD>   The technology will cut recharging time from one hour for its most
powerful rechargeable batteries, designed for high-drain devices such
as digital cameras, the Madison, Wis.-based battery maker said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a real breakthrough that allows for much faster charging
without worrying about the buildup of temperature and pressure you
have with old fashioned systems," Rayovac spokesman John Daggett
said.</LD>
<TE>   Sales are expected to start in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Rayovac calls the technology I-C3 for "In-Cell Charge Control"
because the key to the system is the transfer of charging technology
from the charger to the battery.</TE>

<HD>Web Filter Will Block Sites to Protect Children</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nonprofit group aiming to protect children from unsavory material
on the Net has introduced a free Web browsing filter that blocks
access to sites promoting, among other things, sex, drugs and hate
speech.</LD>
<LD>   The initiative comes from the Internet Content Rating Assn., a
small organization with an ambitious goal.</LD>
<LD>   Since the mid-1990s, the ICRA, which has offices in the United
States and Britain, has been working to establish the Internet's
first voluntary rating system for all major Web sites.</LD>
<TE>   The ICRA rating is not carried on the site, but inside its source
code, thus making it easier for filtering software to detect and
block out, as in the case of adult sites.</TE>
<TE>   More than 50,000 Web sites have volunteered to have their sites
classified under the ICRA system, from the tame Yahooligans portal
for children to the racy Playboy.com.</TE>

<HD>The Web Isn't Wide in Cuba</HD>
<DH>Access to PCs, Internet Is Tightly Controlled by Havana</DH>

<AU>ANITA SNOW</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HAVANA</DL>
<LD>Jesus Garcia Leiva flashes a nervous smile at the small desktop
computer and 14-inch monitor, both arranged carefully on a lace
tablecloth barely hiding the crude wooden table beneath.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing the kind of dark suit worn here only for solemn events,
the cyber-dissident declares that the Pentium machine will launch a
new computing learning center for opponents of President Fidel
Castro.</LD>
<LD>   "An hour from now, this computer could be gone," Garcia, a systems
analyst and programmer, recently told a small gathering.</LD>
<TE>   Although the communist government has multiplied efforts in recent
years to promote cyber-literacy in the workplace and youth clubs, it
tightly controls access to computers and the Internet, restricting
private use to the politically trustworthy and to foreigners.</TE>
<TE>   That hasn't stopped hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Cubans hungry
for Internet access from finding unauthorized and sometimes illegal
ways to get online.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have seized unauthorized computers, mostly from
government opponents, preventing the Internet from posing a serious
political threat.</TE>
<TE>   The government blames the controls on economic limitations, not
politics.</TE>
<TE>   "Technologically it is impossible to connect all those who are
interested," said Sergio Perez, director of the government office
that maintains the country's official Web site, in a rare interview.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cuba has used foreign investment to expand and modernize
its antiquated telecommunications grid, it still had just 4.4 phones
per 100 people in 2000, half as many as Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban officials have shied away from discussing the country's
Internet program with foreign media, except for a few news
conferences organized after reporters sought interviews.</TE>
<TE>   But the government teaches millions of Cubans how to use
computers, send e-mail and conduct Web searches--albeit on
island-wide networks that use the same protocols as the global
Internet but are not connected to it.</TE>
<TE>   Cuba's restrictions are similar to those of such tightly
controlled countries as Myanmar and North Korea. They are far
stricter than those in China and Saudi Arabia, for example, which
merely use software to block sites authorities deem objectionable.</TE>
<TE>   At more than 300 government-run computer youth clubs, dozens of
young people can be found furiously typing away at computers.</TE>
<TE>   Castro himself champions these computer literacy efforts, often
showing up at club openings to chat with young cyber-philes.</TE>
<TE>   The government estimates that 60,000 of the island's 11 million
citizens have e-mail accounts.</TE>
<TE>   In a country where the average monthly government salary is about
$9, post offices sell $4.50 cards that provide three hours of access
to international e-mail and domestic Web sites, including those of
official media.</TE>
<TE>   But even wealthy Cubans cannot legally buy a personal computer.
Nor can they sign up for one of several full-access Internet services
available to foreigners for $60 a month.</TE>
<TE>   What is available to all Cuban surfers are several national
intranets, some with specialized content such as Infomed, which is
geared toward physicians and other health-care workers.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the first law passed to govern how the Internet would be
used stated that access would be selective and granted "in a
regulated manner ... giving priority to the entities most relevant to
the country's life and development."</TE>
<TE>   The government controls full Internet access--which depends on
satellite connections to Europe and Canada--through three service
providers including Infocom, which is operated by Cuban telephone
monopoly Etecsa, a mixed enterprise in which Havana has a majority
interest in partnership with Telecom Italia and a Panamanian
consortium.</TE>
<TE>   Informaticos, or Cuban Internet rebels, also can get full access
to international e-mail and the World Wide Web via pirated accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Scores tell of paying $40 a month to buy clandestine access to an
already existing Internet account--often held by an unsuspecting
foreign firm.</TE>
<TE>   "We cannot find out what is really going on in the world," Garcia
said. "That's what we want--not just the government's version."</TE>

<HD>Work Vs. Play</HD>
<DH>Sony's new robot is all about fun. Honda's aims for
functionality too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND KLAMANN and EDWINA GIBBS</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>It's a question anyone might ask about a potential live-in partner.</LD>
<LD>   Should your household robot be cool? Or practical?</LD>
<LD>   Consumer electronics giant Sony Corp., which last week unveiled
the sleek and diminutive SDR-4X, which can sing in vibrato and dance
with fluid or funky motions, says robots ought to be entertaining.</LD>
<TE>   But auto maker Honda Motor Co., which showed off the latest
version of its Asimo robot at a luncheon with foreign reporters
Tuesday, says such machines should one day perform useful tasks for
their human masters.</TE>
<TE>   "Sony is basically an entertainment company," Toshi Doi, president
of Sony's Digital Creatures Laboratory, said at a news conference.
"So it's natural we would develop a robot for entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Masato Hirose, Honda's chief engineer in charge of Asimo's
development, had a different view.</TE>
<TE>   "It is in the end a machine, a tool," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sony and Honda, both founded by charismatic postwar entrepreneurs
and considered among Japan's most innovative companies, are at the
leading edge of developing humanoid robots for home use.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's SDR-4X, bigger and better than the 3X unveiled a year and a
half ago, sought to steal the spotlight from Asimo, which Honda
already is leasing out to IBM Corp. and other companies as a
high-tech receptionist and hospitality robot.</TE>
<TE>   "Researchers are always aiming at making useful robots, but the
risk of harm increases when there's direct contact with humans," said
Masahiro Fujita, a senior manager and scientist in Sony's digital
creatures group.</TE>
<TE>   "There's very little danger with an entertainment robot."</TE>
<TE>   Doi said robots performing such tasks as caring for ill or
disabled persons would not necessarily need a human form or the
ability to walk.</TE>
<TE>   Like Sony's hot-selling Aibo robotic pet, which uses much of the
same software, the appeal of the SDR-4X is its personality, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It has emotions," he said. "It has instincts."</TE>
<TE>   Drawing from its vocabulary of 60,000 words, an SDR-4X said to a
guest in a high, squeaky voice: "Please hold still for a minute while
I memorize your face."</TE>
<TE>   It also showed off its ability to walk on uneven surfaces, get
back up when it's pushed over and come when it's called.</TE>
<TE>   Although Honda's Asimo also is still used primarily for
entertainment, its creator hopes it will someday be a useful
household companion.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the Asimo is 4 feet tall--more than twice as tall as
the SDR-4X--despite the technological challenges posed by taller
robots.</TE>
<TE>   Hirose said 4 feet was the minimum height a robot needed to move
effectively around a home, given the height of such objects as
tabletops, doorknobs and stairs.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to have something that can move with ease in a
human environment, then it is better to design the robot like a
human," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Its future roles might include nighttime security guard or helper
for the elderly.</TE>
<TE>   Honda now leases Asimo to businesses for $152,400 a year, but
Hirose said that by the time he retires in a decade or so, he hopes
it will be cheap enough for him to buy one for himself and nimble
enough to fetch him a beer when asked.</TE>
<TE>   Sony's Doi said he expected the SDR-4X will be priced about the
same as a luxury car.</TE>
<TE>   And while it was just working prototypes in the song-and-dance
quartet that performed last week, he was hopeful that the SDR-4X
would be ready for a market debut by the end of the year.</TE>

<HD>Getting Fired Up About FireWire</HD>
<DH>Any device that deals with lots of data is an ideal
candidate for the high-speed add-on connection interface.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIM HEID</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Got FireWire? If your PC doesn't contain FireWire ports, you're
missing out on the most widely used high-speed connection scheme
available.</LD>
<LD>   FireWire was invented in the mid-1990s by Apple Computer Inc.
Later, it was adopted as a standard by the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers--hence its less-fiery moniker, IEEE 1394.
Sony Corp. and other firms call it iLink, but each name refers to the
same thing: a fast interface for connecting add-ons to computers.</LD>
<LD>   How fast? FireWire can transfer data at up to 400 megabits per
second. By comparison, the Universal Serial Bus ports that are built
into most PCs max out at about 12 Mbps. (The new USB 2.0 tops out at
480 Mbps, but the standard is catching on slowly.)</LD>
<TE>   Most people think of FireWire as a way to connect video cameras to
personal computers. That's a common application, but FireWire is
about much more than video. Any device that deals with lots of data
is an ideal candidate for a FireWire connection. And these days,
plenty of devices deal with lots of data.</TE>
<TE>   Many high-end digital cameras now provide FireWire jacks, which
enable them to transfer images to a computer far faster than USB
cameras. You also can buy FireWire-based card readers that accept the
Compact Flash and SmartMedia cards used by most consumer-level
digital cameras. Connect a reader to your computer and then insert
the card in the reader, and you can transfer images in the fast lane.</TE>
<TE>   Three companies offering FireWire-based card readers are Unity
Digital, Lexar Media Inc. and Synchrotech. You'll pay $100 to $150
for a FireWire reader. USB-based readers cost much less but are far
slower. If you have a high-resolution digital camera, spring for a
FireWire reader.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of digital imaging, many scanners now provide FireWire
connections too. USB still dominates among inexpensive scanners,
although Umax Technologies Inc.'s Astra 6400, currently selling for
$99, is a notable exception.</TE>
<TE>   Hard drives and optical burners also are available with FireWire
jacks. A FireWire hard drive is a great way to expand your system's
storage and is ideal for moving large files from one computer to
another.</TE>
<TE>   Many companies sell standard-size FireWire hard drives, but
today's hot fashion accessories are the compact drives from companies
such as WiebeTech, La Cie and Smartdisk Corp. Portable FireWire
drives shoehorn up to 60 gigabytes into cases that fit into shirt
pockets. The most copious minidrives aren't cheap--La Cie's 60gb
Pocket Drive goes for $699--but drives in the 20gb and 30gb ballpark
are less than $350.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Apple's iPod music player, which contains a 5gb
hard drive and connects via FireWire. The iPod was designed for Macs,
obviously, but with MediaFour Corp.'s XPlay software, you can use it
with Windows computers.</TE>
<TE>   So how can you catch FireWire? It's built into all Macs and is
factory-installed on a growing number of Windows PCs, particularly
Sony's. And you can add it to just about any desktop or notebook PC
by installing a FireWire adapter card. All recent versions of Windows
support FireWire; Windows XP supports it particularly well.</TE>
<TE>   For desktop PCs, a FireWire card that installs in an internal
expansion slot typically costs well below $100 and provides two or
three FireWire jacks. For notebooks, FireWire adapters that install
in a CardBus slot cost about $100.</TE>
<TE>   When you're shopping for a FireWire card for a desktop PC, look
for one that provides "powered" FireWire jacks--many portable
FireWire hard drives (as well as Apple's iPod) can draw power from
these jacks and thus don't require a separate power supply. Belkin
Components sells a $79 FireWire card that provides three powered
jacks.</TE>
<TE>   And when your collection of FireWire gizmos outgrows the number of
jacks on your computer, it's time for a FireWire hub, which provides
additional connectors. Belkin Components' $99 hub provides six
FireWire jacks.</TE>

<HD>Libraries Challenge Net Filter Requirement</HD>
<DH>Law: The plaintiffs say a federal act aimed at curbing
pornography leads to the blocking of legitimate information.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Testing the boundaries between free speech and protecting children
from obscenity online, a group of public libraries is scheduled to go
to court today in Pennsylvania for the beginning of a trial
challenging a federal law that requires them to use Internet
filtering software.</LD>
<LD>   The case consolidates two lawsuits filed in the U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that claim that the
Children's Internet Protection Act violates the 1st Amendment by
requiring the use of software that also can block legitimate
information.</LD>
<LD>   The groups that filed the lawsuits include seven public libraries
from around the country, four teenage girls who rely on their local
libraries for online access and an Oregon man whose Web site, which
advocated the use of Internet filtering software, was unexpectedly
blocked.</LD>
<TE>   "Congress has tried twice to censor the Internet, and the courts
have struck down both of the previous attempts," said plaintiff
attorney Charles Sims. "The fact is the law grossly over-censors and
is under-effective as well."</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials declined to comment. Officials with
the U.S. attorney's office in Pennsylvania could not be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   The root of the case is a federal program that subsidizes public
Internet connections. Thousands of schools and libraries across the
country access the Internet thanks to the "education rate," or
e-rate, which was created with the 1996 Telecommunications Act.</TE>
<TE>   About 4,500 libraries and 800 other educational groups were given
about $250 million in 2001, the plaintiffs say.</TE>
<TE>   After the e-rate system was approved, some congressional leaders
expressed concern about minors' use of federally funded computers to
view pornography. The solution was the Children's Internet Protection
Act, which was sponsored by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.).</TE>
<TE>   The act--passed last year--requires institutions that receive
e-rate funds to install filtering software to block access to content
deemed inappropriate for minors. Schools and libraries that receive
e-rate funds have until 2003 to install such software.</TE>
<TE>   But critics have argued that although the act is well-intentioned,
it has serious practical and technical flaws. Many of the most
popular filtering products--including Net Nanny, Cyber Patrol and
Cyber Snoop--are designed to target sex-related Web sites but can
inadvertently block material that has nothing to do with pornography.</TE>
<TE>   One of the Pennsylvania plaintiffs, Jeffery Pollock, initially
supported the use of such filters in public schools and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   A Republican candidate in the 2000 congressional election in
Oregon, Pollock had a Web site to issue statements and detail his
campaign. Part of his campaign hinged on his support of libraries and
schools using filtering software.</TE>
<TE>   His site contained statements concerning the e-rate issue and the
difficulties of protecting children from online pornography. He
advocated the use of Cyber Patrol in public schools and libraries.</TE>
<TE>   To Pollock's surprise, his Web site was blocked by the Cyber
Patrol software.</TE>
<TE>   The case comes amid a stepped-up government push against online
pornography. Next month, a Pennsylvania law will hold Internet
service providers criminally liable if they do not block sites that
the state attorney general's office deems to offer child pornography.</TE>

<LD>Q: Why does a slice of bread with honey on it tend to curl up?</LD>
<LD>   A: Bread is about 40% water, while honey is a very concentrated
solution of sugar that strongly attracts water--scientists say it is
hygroscopic. When honey is spread on bread, it pulls out water,
causing the bread to shrink on that side, so the bread tries to curl
up.</LD>

<LD>A blood test may be able to identify Alzheimer's disease long before
there are symptoms of the brain-destroying disorder, allowing early
treatment, according to researchers from Washington University School
of Medicine in St. Louis. The researchers reported in the March 22
Science that injecting an antibody into mice causes a sudden flood in
the bloodstream of a protein that forms neuron-destroying plaques in
the brain.</LD>
<LD>   The level of the protein, amyloid-beta, after the injection was an
indication of the amount of plaque, said Dr. David M. Holtzman. He
emphasized that although the technique works in a strain of mice that
develop Alzheimer's, it is still not known if the test would work in
humans.</LD>

<LD>The standard drug used to restart a stopped heart when electrical
shocks have failed may not be the best medicine after all, according
to a study in the March 21 New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors
at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto, Canada, concluded the drug
amiodarone works nearly twice as well as the widely used lidocaine.</LD>
<LD>   "Amiodarone led to a statistically significant and relatively
large improvement" in the number of people who made it to the
hospital alive, according to the study. But, the doctors cautioned,
although more people made it to the hospital after receiving
amiodarone, the vast majority later died in the hospital--which was
also the case with lidocaine. In many cases, the heart damage is so
great that the patient cannot be saved.</LD>

<LD>   In the largest breast cancer treatment study to date, women taking
Arimidex were less than half as likely to develop a new cancer in the
other breast as those taking tamoxifen, researchers reported Thursday
at the European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain.</LD>
<LD>   International experts were enthusiastic about the findings, and
some said it provided a clue that Arimidex, a new drug, could be a
better option than tamoxifen for preventing breast cancer in healthy
women. However, others expressed concern that the women taking
Arimidex had more bone fractures than those taking tamoxifen, an
indication that the new drug accelerates bone loss.</LD>

<HD>Unlocking Secrets of Plasma</HD>
<DH>UCLA research team is creating a curious form of matter
that is the main ingredient of stars yet is a rarity on our
relatively cool, dense planet.</DH>

<AU>J. MATTHEW ALDAG</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inside Walter Gekelman's warehouse-sized laboratory in Westwood
Village, enough electricity to power a thousand homes pours into a
row of 68 magnet rings, each one weighing half a ton.</LD>
<LD>   A steady pulse of brilliant red light flashes from inside the
cylindrical machine--as tall as a bus and twice as long. With each
pulse, a thimble's worth of neon gas seeps into the near-vacuum
inside the machine and directly into the path of a 500,000-watt
electron beam. As temperatures shoot to a quarter-million degrees, a
curious form of matter known as a plasma is created. It lasts only a
few thousandths of a second. Any longer and the 80-ton Large Plasma
Device would melt.</LD>
<LD>   Plasma makes up well more than 99% of the "stuff" of the
observable universe. Thin wisps of plasma occupy the vast near-vacuum
of interstellar space. Plasma is the main ingredient of stars--dense
as iron and 5 million degrees at the sun's core. Lightning, licks of
fire and fluorescent light bulbs are earthly examples of tiny amounts
of plasma. Yet this universally common form of matter is a rarity on
our relatively cool, dense planet--perhaps why the study of plasma is
one of the youngest fields of physics.</LD>
<TE>   Atoms as we normally know them each consist of a central nucleus
orbited by charged electrons. This relationship is faithfully
maintained even as materials shift from solid to liquid to gas. A
plasma, by contrast, is ionized--its atoms "stripped" of electrons.</TE>
<TE>   "I always ask my students what happens if we keep making steam
hotter and hotter?" said Gekelman, a UCLA professor. As a material is
heated, its atoms vibrate more and more intensely. At extreme
temperatures, orbiting electrons are literally shaken loose from
their nuclei. "It's at this point that you have a plasma," he said.</TE>
<TE>   First described by 19th century physicist Sir William Crookes,
plasma wasn't named until American chemist Irving Langmuir coined the
term in 1929. During the 1950s, as physicists worked on testing
hydrogen bombs, they realized that the extremely hot plasmas formed
by the nuclear explosions could be used to generate energy. Born
classified, research on nuclear fusion and plasmas remained secret
until 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Today, researchers like Gekelman study the fundamental properties
of how waves of energy flow across and through plasma. Among the
behaviors the Large Plasma Device is designed to study is the ability
of a plasma to, in effect, store a memory of energetic disturbances
that pass through it.</TE>
<TE>   Ordinarily, if a material is disturbed repeatedly in exactly the
same manner, it will react the same way each time. Drop three
identical pebbles into a bucket of water, for example, and the
ripples will be the same each time. Not so with a plasma.</TE>
<TE>   Under certain circumstances, disturbances to the plasma change it.
The plasma reacts "in such a way that a second, identical pulse may
cause a completely different reaction," Gekelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Built by Gekelman and his colleagues, the Large Plasma Device
allows researchers to create and contain plasmas for detailed study
of those mysterious phenomena. Making plasma in the lab requires
million-degree heat and a vacuum environment. The device uses vast
amounts of electricity to ionize gas and generate a magnetic field
that keeps the hot plasma from the inner walls. Computer-controlled
probes reach into the sealed innards, monitoring the burst of plasma
that hangs around for mere thousandths of a second. The machine then
takes about a second to cool down enough to generate another plasma
burst. The trick is to ensure that each plasma is made exactly the
same every time--every second, 24 hours a day for months.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no better and more accessible facility for understanding
the underpinnings of plasma science," said Ron McKnight of the
Department of Energy's Office of Fusion Energy Sciences. The
department and the National Science Foundation recently awarded $4.8
million to support the UCLA machine. Next fiscal year, the department
will spend more than $9 million on basic plasma research.</TE>
<TE>   Among the topics for which researchers are using the machine is
the study of a large and ubiquitous energy-carrying ripple called an
Alfven wave. Named after the late Swedish physicist and Nobel
laureate Hannes Alfven, it is one type of disturbance to which
plasmas react.</TE>
<TE>   Common in outer space, Alfven waves carry solar wind--also a
variety of plasma--to Earth from the sun. The waves also are involved
with solar flare eruptions that explode with the power of a million
100-megaton nuclear bombs. These solar hiccups can cause a coronal
mass ejection in which a section of the sun's outer plasma, weighing
about 10 billion tons, tears off and hurtles into space.
Occasionally, such eruptions speed toward Earth on the legs of Alfven
waves at speeds in excess of 2 million mph.</TE>
<TE>   When coronal mass ejections collide with Earth's protective
magnetic field, they create the electrical and magnetic discharges
known as aurora borealis, or northern lights, and their south pole
counterpart, aurora australis. They also can down orbiting satellites
and overload ground-based power grids.</TE>
<TE>   A daylong interruption of cell phones, credit card purchases and
40 million pagers in 1998 was blamed on a solar event that disabled a
communications satellite. A similar disturbance in 1989 left 6
million people without power for nine hours in Quebec and affected
some Northeastern U.S. states.</TE>
<TE>   "Coronal mass ejections are very important in terms of the
magnetic storms that may occur at Earth," said Joe Kunches, chief of
space weather operations at the Space Environment Center in Boulder,
Colo. "If we could model how Alfven waves travel and interact with
our magnetic field, our ability to predict Earth disturbances would
be better."</TE>
<TE>   The sheer size of the Large Plasma Device makes it "the only
machine in the world" that enables researchers to make detailed
studies of Alfven waves, Gekelman's main research interest.</TE>
<TE>   He has company. The University of Iowa's Craig Kletzig, who
studies the generation of northern lights, is scheduled to visit the
device in April.</TE>
<TE>   But plasma scientists aren't the only ones flocking to the Large
Plasma Device. Gekelman routinely spends Saturday afternoons with
high school students experimenting on a smaller plasma machine that
he and the students built from spare parts especially for his
classroom. "Some come away with little more than an inkling of what's
going on, and some are so smart I figure they should just skip the
rest of high school and come right here," he said.</TE>

<LD>After all the hand-wringing about whether such an event should occur
while our country is waging a war, and whether the tight security
would rob the night of any joy and spontaneity, the 74th Academy
Awards was essentially what it is every year: a celebration of movies
and pop culture that could only be manufactured in Hollywood.</LD>
<LD>   The glitterati showed up and paraded on the red carpet, greeting
their industry friends (and rivals) and waving to the fans who filled
the bleachers and the streets along the perimeter of the Kodak
Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   True, things will never again be the same for our nation, but on
this night, in the heart of the dream factory, it was just like old
times.</LD>

<HD>In a Crisis, It Was a 'Beautiful' Job</HD>

<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ten years from now, it will be hard to know what will be more
memorable, "A Beautiful Mind" the movie or "A Beautiful Mind" the
Oscar campaign, a watershed moment in the ongoing battle between
historians and Hollywood over the custody of our shared heritage.</LD>
<LD>   "It says it was really close," joked producer Brian Grazer as he
accepted the envelope and the award for best picture, tacitly
acknowledging the battle the film has endured on its way to the
Oscar.</LD>
<LD>   "A Beautiful Mind's" route to victory represented a personal
vindication for some of Hollywood's biggest players, who launched a
massive campaign to win the Oscar. Yet it was a victory, barely
snatched from the jaws of defeat as Universal was forced to
concentrate most of its effort on defending the film from charges of
having whitewashed Nash's life.</LD>
<TE>   This is the first Oscar winner with its own crisis PR manager, the
inveterate Sitrick and Co. The firm, whose other clients have
included Orange County in the middle of its bankruptcy, Enron wannabe
Global Crossing and Paula Poundstone, wasn't brought on to squelch
tales of Russell Crowe's sex life or hide evidence of discontent on
the set, but to inoculate the film from a far graver adversary: the
truth.</TE>
<TE>   "I advise the studio on how to deal with journalistic issues,
issues about the accuracy of the movie, controversies, which we seem
to have more than our share," said Allan Mayer, the Sitrick partner
in charge of the "Beautiful Mind" account, who also personally
advises John Nash, the scientist on whose life the film is based, or
rather "inspired by" as the credits state.</TE>
<TE>   "In recent years particularly, journalists have become more
sensitive to accuracy issues in movies, which in another time would
have never been expected to be held to that standard," said Mayer,
who added that director Ron Howard and Grazer have been totally
upfront about their intention, which was to take "the outlines of
John Nash's life and [use] the high points, and [fill] in with
imaginative speculation what might have been. They weren't pretending
otherwise."</TE>
<TE>   "For people to say, we're shocked it departs from the book ["A
Beautiful Mind," by Sylvia Nasar] is kind of strange. Maria von Trapp
was not exactly the way she was portrayed by Julie Andrews [in the
Oscar-winning "The Sound of Music"] back in 1965."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, the fury over "A Beautiful Mind" was particularly intense,
with critics complaining of how Howard eliminated the complex and
nuanced elements of Nash's messy life (everything from a son from a
woman other than Alicia Nash, to a George Michael-type of arrest in a
bathroom, which lost him his security clearance). Ironically enough,
the basis of the charges came not from alternate histories of Nash's
life, or disgruntled ex-lovers, but from the very book on which the
film is named, based, and which can now be bought in the bookstores.
(Look for the Russell Crowe cover.)</TE>
<TE>   The pressure was unrelenting on the studio marketing machine. At
Universal there were weekly strategy meetings and furious claims of a
"smear campaign." One involved in the process described his job for
the last three months as "going to the war room," the famous epithet
that Clinton staffers had named the hub of their campaign
headquarters. Like political candidates, Hollywood movies now need to
be vetted for the skeletons in their past, and whether they actually
inhaled or not.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Oliver Stone's history-revising epic "JFK" in 1991, a
revitalized truth brigade has been on call to examine Hollywood films
under the microscope. Presenting an alternate vision of American
history, Stone's film attempted to debunk the lone gunman theory
behind the Kennedy assassination and the published version of the
screenplay came complete with annotations and footnotes, like a
doctoral dissertation. That film unleashed a torrent of invective
from journalists and authorities of all stripes, from columnist
Christopher Hitchens, to the former funeral parlor worker who put
Kennedy's slain body into the casket.</TE>
<TE>   In its wake, almost every film, which dealt with living historical
characters, has had to contend with the inevitable comparisons
between real life and fiction, from "The Insider," (about a
whistle-blower in the tobacco industry) which upset newsman Mike
Wallace, to "13 Days" (the story of the Cuban Missile crisis), which
provoked the criticism of former Kennedy staffers.</TE>
<TE>   In today's climate, a man like Mayer has a busy practice. He was
brought in just before the Oscars on "Hurricane," the film based on
the life of boxer Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, which Universal felt was
torpedoed by claims of inaccuracy. He advised the real-life Erin
Brockovich. Her film had the advantage of sticking close to the
brash, sexy, miniskirted truth of her life, but nonetheless,
Brockovich was plagued by experts who wanted to impugn the science
behind her big legal win. Recently, he also counseled the cast of
"Black Hawk Down" on how to deal with accuracy questions on that
film, which is based on Mark Bowden's nonfiction account of the
battle of Mogadishu.</TE>
<TE>   As the success of those films suggest, the truth is one of
Hollywood's biggest selling tools. It's hard to imagine that "A
Beautiful Mind" would have even gotten made if the story weren't
true, because its premise of a schizophrenic who wins the Nobel Prize
sounded too Hollywood for even Hollywood. In fact, "A Beautiful Mind"
was the second schizophrenic-makes-good project developed by Howard
and Grazer's company, Imagine. The first, "Laws of Madness," was
based on the true-life story of schizophrenic Michael Laudor, who
battled his way through Yale law school. Imagine bought the rights
for $1.5 million in 1995, but the project was derailed when Laudor
murdered his girlfriend, thereby squelching any possibility of a
happy ending to the Hollywood movie.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine has long been one of Hollywood's most powerful producers,
reliably churning out such hits as "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole
Christmas", and "Liar Liar," and provoking the usual naysayers that
trail in the wake of success. Going into the Oscar campaign, the
studio, according to several who work there, was worried that there
might be some kind of industry backlash against this Hollywood
standard-bearer.</TE>
<TE>   Universal and Imagine instead have faced a wholesale attack on the
Opie aesthetics, on Howard's facility for uplift, his penchant for
optimism, all heartily enjoyed in such films as "Parenthood," or even
the patriotic "Apollo 13," but troubling when applied to the province
of mental health. For those who question Howard's vision, the
rallying cry has been the truth--the director has glossed over the
messy truths of Nash's life.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, like Ronald Reagan or Bill Clinton, sunny politicians who
were able to connect to the country's eternal need for uplift, "A
Beautiful Mind" has enticed moviegoers from Los Angeles to
Providence, earning more than $150 million at the box office, more
than almost every other fact-based drama, from "JFK" to "Ali."</TE>
<TE>   And Ron Howard now has two Oscars, one for best picture and one
for best director.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a good enough actor any more to really stand up here and
make you believe that I haven't imagined this moment in my mind over
the years and played it out about a thousand times," said the former
child star on the podium. "It's pretty simple really. I'm grateful.
I'm very grateful for this."</TE>

<LD>   "It continued to evolve and grow as I got to know the strength of
this woman."</LD>
<TE>   Best supporting actress Jennifer Connelly echoed Grazer and
Howard's comments about Alicia Nash.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a true hero. She's a remarkable woman, she's strong,
fiercely intelligent. Devoted to her husband, even now. An incredible
amount of devotion that's rare and extraordinary," Connelly said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Best supporting actor Jim Broadbent, said of "Iris," an intense
film based on his character John Bayley's book about his wife Iris
Murdoch's struggle with Alzheimer's disease: "The film needs all help
it can get. Grown up, serious. A love story between older people, by
and large. It's nice to be able to promote it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woody Allen said backstage he said he hadn't written down his
remarks for the short film honoring New York City, but he had
practiced in the shower. When it was his turn to speak, he said, "I
got a panicky feeling that without hot water running down my back I
wouldn't be able to do it. I feel I was better in my shower,
actually."</TE>
<TE>   Allen, whose good-humored disdain for locations west of the Hudson
River and L.A. in particular is legendary, said he "just flew in
today. I'm here till Wednesday and will take advantage of any
cultural opportunity the city has to offer, like mudslides."</TE>
<TE>   No one told him that these days, a big fire is much more likely.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reporter Herby Moreau of Flash TV in Montreal asked Sidney Poitier
if he could touch his Oscar because it would bring him good luck.</TE>
<TE>   Then he stood in front of the camera and told his parents he was
holding Poitier's Oscar. Another reporter then asked, "Have things
changed enough?"</TE>
<TE>   "Things have changed, clearly," Poitier said. "If you came to this
venue tonight and saw the array of minority actors headed by some
extraordinary people, then you know that things have changed. I think
it's a question of degree."</TE>
<TE>   "To speak of Hollywood as if there has not been change is not
fair," Poitier said. "You can question the speed of it and question
whether it will last. Denzel Washington stands shoulder to shoulder
with some of the best actors of the world....</TE>
<TE>   "We have lots and lots and lots of African American actors. The
world has changed, and it is continuing to change."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The first six months, I thought it wasn't going to happen at
all," said Julian Fellowes, honoree for best screenplay written
directly for the screen for "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   "And then the money came, and people were in and out. Until
February, I didn't think it would be made. The big thing was whether
or not it would be made, not whether we'd win an Oscar."</TE>
<TE>   Fellowes, an actor who won for his very first script, added, "I
don't see one has to make that choice [between screenwriting or
acting]. My acting career doesn't match my writing career. A slight
schizophrenia going on.</TE>
<TE>   "When I write, I cast it in my head. Four of the people I imagined
in my wildest dreams actually played the parts. They didn't
improvise...."</TE>
<TE>   Randy Newman, winner of best original song, said he was surprised.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought [Paul] McCartney or Sting would win ... or Enya."</TE>
<TE>   "When they stood up, the audience threw me. If I had tear ducts, I
would have teared up.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't cool about it, as you could see."</TE>
<TE>   He joked that he had mixed feelings about the award, acknowledging
that if he had lost, he could have set a record for having had the
most nominations (16) without winning.</TE>
<TE>   More seriously, he said, "I never thought I was somehow deficient
in the past ... [and the award] doesn't make the song any better. The
grammar in it is really bad."</TE>
<TE>   When he saw the orchestra and the audience stand, he said, "I
thought I'd have to wait till I died."</TE>

<KH>HOW THE THEATER FARED</KH>
<HD>The Kodak Seizes the Moment When It Counts</HD>
<DH>Despite 37 challenging steps leading up to it, Oscar's new
Hollywood home receives raves from the night's guests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE HAITHMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The biggest challenge for guests attending this year's Academy Awards
ceremony at the Kodak Theatre--the awards show's brand-new long-term
home in Hollywood--came early in the evening.</LD>
<LD>   It was the 37 Steps.</LD>
<LD>   "The 39 Steps" is an Alfred Hitchcock horror movie. The 37 Steps
at the Kodak Theatre are a potential horror movie because you have to
climb them all to get into the main lobby after walking down the red
carpet. This was true no matter how high the heels, or how big the
star.</LD>
<TE>   But--at least according to an unscientific survey conducted in the
various lobbies of the multi-level Kodak--there were no step-related
mishaps on the way into the Academy Awards' new digs, although a few
could be observed teetering just a little, the angle of tilt
determined by the comparative tightness of the skirt.</TE>
<TE>   "If anybody fell, I was praying it wasn't going to be me," said
Kathy Murphy, a guest of Pixar who wore a sparkly pair of silver
sandals with 2-inch heels under her floor-length dress.</TE>
<TE>   "I just held onto the rail, girl!" exclaimed Rachel Zellars, who
works at Paramount, another 2-inch-heel wearer.</TE>
<TE>   Once inside, everything went smoothly in the new 3,500-seat
theater, which looked glamorous even on television.</TE>
<TE>   Onstage, host Whoopi Goldberg cracked only one joke about why the
awards ceremony moved: "Tonight marks the debut of Oscar's new house,
the Kodak Theatre. Beautiful, isn't it? The academy wanted to stay at
the old place, but the networks thought they should go with a younger
theater."</TE>
<TE>   Critics have complained that, acoustically, this theater will
never win any awards. But even though a few audience members
complained that they couldn't hear Tom Cruise's comments about Sept.
11 at the top of the show, they blamed the low volume on the actor's
attempt to sound earnest.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, even the winners for best sound editing (George Watters
II and Christopher Boyes for "Pearl Harbor") said the acoustics were
just fine. And "it might not be great for a classical music concert,
but this kind of event, it seems to work," said one academy employee
who asked not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   Both longtime award show attendees and those new to the experience
offered rave reviews of the new theater, praising everything from the
ease of traffic flow to the efficient post-Sept. 11 security checks
to the restrooms, which were plentiful.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the bathrooms," said Carol Mukhalian, attending the awards
with her husband, actor Vincent Schiavelli, as guests of producer
Saul Zaentz. "Lots of times, when I'm in a ladies' room, I'll say, 'A
man designed this building.' But this is great."</TE>
<TE>   Anne Wills, a visitor from Australia, has been coming to the
Academy Awards since 1981. "The whole layout here is much nicer, much
better organized, than at both the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and the
Shrine," she said, referring to the awards show's two most recent
homes. "This is a good location--even with coming up those stairs."</TE>
<TE>   Academy executive administrator Ric Robertson, in charge of
theater operations on Sunday, said midway through the show that all
was flowing smoothly. "Everything seems to be going extraordinarily
well. People took our advice and arrived early, so traffic was never
a problem," he said. He noted that attendees arrived 15 minutes to
half an hour earlier than usual.</TE>
<TE>   Before the ceremony, some people had complained they couldn't get
tickets because of the size of the theater. And Kodak Theatre
watchers worried that the theater's multiple levels and elevators
might cause some problems, but the production staff was grateful for
the elevators.</TE>
<TE>   "At the Shrine, our production offices were on the second floor.
It was hard to bring everything up the stairs," said Jomarr Ileto,
production assistant for Michael Seligman Productions. "This is
definitely a nicer facility."</TE>

<AU>HOWARD ROSENBERG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Academy Award-winning "A Beautiful Mind" is not the only artistic
endeavor whose integrity has been viciously under attack by rivals
this Oscar season.</LD>
<LD>   This review--inspired by Sunday night's Academy Awards telecast on
ABC--is already being accused by other TV critics of being fatally
flawed by omissions, distortions and untruths.</LD>
<LD>   These critics fail to understand that extreme literary license is
essential not only to sustain reader interest, but to achieve a truth
greater than mere literal truth, honesty and accuracy. How mundane
those are. What follows, instead, is a review not of the Oscarcast,
but of something much more significant that Oscar-winning "A
Beautiful Mind" director Ron Howard will surely appreciate.</LD>
<TE>   My personal vision of the Oscarcast.</TE>
<TE>   It begins with high praise for Billy Crystal as host. The timing,
the creativity. And funneeeeee? When he descended from the top of New
York's Madison Square Garden in that balloon....</TE>
<TE>   All right, instead of the reliably witty Crystal, it was a return
gig for Whoopi Goldberg, dropping down on a swing from the top of the
Oscar event's impressive new Hollywood home, Kodak Theatre, in trashy
feathers worthy of Bette Midler in her Divine Miss M days.</TE>
<TE>   "Security here tonight is tighter than some of the faces," said
Goldberg, who did nothing thereafter to match the fun spectacle of
her opening, but was funny from time to time and set a pleasant tone
for a crisp, sometimes moving show directed by Louis J. Horvitz and
produced by Laura Ziskin. Yet whoever created the cheap John Ashcroft
joke should have stowed it.</TE>
<TE>   The show's highlight, aside from the awards, was an appearance by
Hollywood's favorite New Yorker, Woody Allen, pitching his Sept.
11-scarred city for film production in conjunction with a montage of
movies set there.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it was a kick seeing Allen in Hollywood, a place he so
famously dislikes. Still, the highlights were elsewhere. One was a
performance by the animal-less Cirque du Soleil circus troupe, the
other a special Oscar for granted a deserving Sidney Poitier.</TE>
<TE>   The circus performers were spectacular in this setting in
conjunction with introducing the award for effects. It was an
extraordinarily visual moment, and the appearance of Poitier an
extraordinarily emotional one. Unlike some of his giddy fellow
actors, he was the picture of dignity while accepting an award
signifying his seminal role in breaking barriers holding back African
Americans in the film industry. It was all the more memorable, given
the evening's breakthrough Oscar wins by Halle Berry and Denzel
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Poitier is "not just an African American treasure, [he's] an
American treasure," noted Berry. That being the case, however, why
have only black performers take part in the tribute?</TE>
<TE>   Posting Donald Sutherland and Glenn Close backstage as sub-anchors
was a terrific idea.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, not. Talk about redundancies.</TE>
<TE>   Cleo Lipschultz electrified the audience when singing the five
original song nominees.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, there was no Cleo Lipschultz. She's a composite
character I created because the real names of the five singers would
confuse you. In any case, the song nominees were again the draggiest
part of the evening.</TE>
<TE>   The pre-telecast, celebrities-walk-the-red-carpet shows finally
rose to the occasion, attaining levels of intelligence and sincerity
worthy of the event they they're supposed to be celebrating.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, sure. On the E! Entertainment channel, that old pro Joan
Rivers was at it again, asking "Sexy Beast" nominee Ben Kingsley:
"How do they know to give you such a variety of parts?" His reply to
the unanswerable question: "There's a beast in all of us."</TE>
<TE>   On KTLA, a question to "Gosford Park" nominee Helen Mirren: "Is it
gratifying to be recognized for a role like that?" Duh! Mirren
reckoned that it was.</TE>
<TE>   On ABC's pre-show, co-host Chris Connelly had "Black Hawk Down"
star Josh Hartnett in his cross hairs, grilling him mercilessly about
his nominated director, Ridley Scott: "Are you hoping he wins
tonight?" Hartnett admitted he was. And then to nominees Nicole
Kidman and Renee Zellweger: "Are you worried about sweating in your
new gowns?"</TE>
<TE>   At least Rivers ended with a self-effacing sendup of her own show,
bidding viewers a maudlin farewell ("Goodbye, my friends ... ")
before adding, as if unaware she was still on camera: "Who wrote this
crap?"</TE>
<TE>   It must have been the beast in her.</TE>

<DH>Denzel Washington's and Halle Berry's wins are an
unprecedented Oscar moment for black actors.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She was so emotional she was nearly speechless, while he was cool and
elegant as usual. Halle Berry and Denzel Washington reacted in
different ways to their wins as best actress and actor. But the
historical significance of the moment was not lost on the stars or
the audience on a night made even more poignant by Sidney Poitier's
honor from the board of governors for a career spanning half a
century.</LD>
<LD>   "This moment is so much bigger than me," Berry said. "This moment
is for Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll.... This is for
every faceless woman who now has a chance because this door tonight
has been opened."</LD>
<LD>   "I was just very calm all day today," Washington said. "I just
felt relaxed. I had been to the dance a few times and knew it was out
of my hands. I'm already a part of history in many ways. I am just
glad to know [Sidney Poitier]. I just feel closer to him now."</LD>
<TE>   Since the nominations of Berry, Will Smith and Washington--three
African Americans competing for the top prizes this year--the race
became the center of media attention and discussions among activists
and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   Two days before the Oscars, an impromptu gala honoring "African
Achievement in Hollywood" was held at a Westwood restaurant. On
Saturday, activists held a round-table discussion on what the Oscar
nominations meant for minorities in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, who has been nominated five times, won his first Oscar
12 years ago for best supporting actor in "Glory." But he was
reclusive during the campaigning season this year, never addressing
the issue of race head on. The 48-year-old actor was stung by the
brouhaha over 1999's "The Hurricane," a film criticized by many for
its factual inaccuracies.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, being the leading African American box-office star
has placed a heavy burden on Washington, some say. "He should just be
considered a fine actor," said screenwriter Cheryl Edwards ("Save the
Last Dance"). "Instead, here we are ... looking at him as the great
black hope."</TE>
<TE>   Future hopes are also pinned on Berry. She first caught the
industry's eye for her role as a homeless crack addict in Spike Lee's
"Jungle Fever" (1991). She also played a recovering addict fighting
for custody of her son in "Losing Isaiah."</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps the turning point in her career came with her Golden
Globe win in 2000 for the HBO biopic "Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,"
in which she played the 1950s actress who fought for a career in
then-segregated Hollywood. Dandridge, who committed suicide, was the
first black woman to be nominated for best actress for 1954's "Carmen
Jones."</TE>
<TE>   But often the expectation that movie parts will come flooding in
after an Oscar win is shattered by reality, said "Monster's Ball"
producer Lee Daniels. "I sometimes wonder if the Oscar is the kiss of
death actually," he said. "With Halle we are looking at a different
situation because she's black and it's a first--we are treading new
water here."</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood is a difficult industry for nonwhites. From 1990 through
2000, only 21 nonwhites (including Asians, Native Americans, African
Americans and Latinos), or about 9% of the Oscar nominees, were
included in the top five categories: leading actor, leading actress,
supporting actor, supporting actress and director. Only two--Whoopi
Goldberg (supporting actress in "Ghost") and Cuba Gooding Jr.
(supporting actor in "Jerry Maguire")--won.</TE>
<TE>   Only time will tell if these awards result in concrete changes for
the industry as a whole, said Todd Boyd, professor of critical
studies at the USC School of Cinema-Television. "We are way premature
in potentially celebrating these victories as some watershed event in
Hollywood," he said.</TE>

<LD>I sat just a few rows away from Oscar himself. The golden statue
viewers saw at the beginning of the broadcast was perched on a
platform jutting out from the second mezzanine. Amid the splendor of
the theater and the challenge of getting into my seat without
enveloping the man in front of me in my skirt, I hadn't noticed at
first.</LD>
<LD>   But as various people admonished the audience to take their
seats--no really, right now, you have to sit down--a camera on a
mechanical arm descended from the heavens or possibly the third
mezzanine and went in for a close-up and I realized I was in the
presence of a superstar. It was about as close as I got all evening.</LD>
<LD>   Here's the thing they don't tell you about the Oscars: Most of the
people who attend are not famous, or at least not recognizably so.
The image I had in my mind when I found out I was going to the Oscars
was something along the lines of me and a few of my friends moving
through a rustling enchanted forest of movie stars. Instead, we
walked slowly down the red carpet surrounded by people who looked a
lot like us. OK, Robert Redford came in right behind us, as did
Sidney Poitier, and Sting was to our left, but mostly it was just a
bunch of ordinary-looking people scandalously overdressed for 4 in
the afternoon. Glamorous yes, superstars no.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the bleachers were filled with people who could see better
than we could, screaming names--Ian! Russell! Reese!--so apparently
there were movie stars about and when I finally got to my seat, why,
there they were: teeny tiny people in the orchestra section trying to
sit still while cameras swarmed around them like robotic moths.</TE>
<TE>   Memo to self: next time bring binoculars. And a bigger handbag.
And snacks.</TE>
<TE>   But then nothing turned out the way I thought it would. For one
thing, I had no idea we would actually have to watch the commercials.
I knew you had to sit through breaks in the program while the poor TV
audience was inundated with J.C. Penney ads but I thought possession
of a ticket raised you above the hoi polloi. Imagine my surprise to
see Cindy Crawford fill the screens on either side of the stage clad
in jeans and shilling for Diet Pepsi.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, my friends and I had expected to encounter
limousine lock-down and a security nightmare. In fact, we got there
so quickly that I asked the driver to go around the block again so I
could put on some lipstick. Security was a breeze, with about 200 of
the best-looking members of the LAPD frisking the limos, an array of
nice-looking security guards rifling through teeny tiny handbags. And
if there wasn't an endless grove of celebrities, there was still
plenty of wondrous things to look at.</TE>
<TE>   * For starters, the Oscars are probably the best place to observe
the L.A. reconnaissance stare, that sidelong "Is that..? Isn't she
... ? No, I suppose not" sweet search of a look practiced at the Ivy
and premieres all over town.</TE>
<TE>   * It's always amusing to watch women in very high heels and long
tight dresses try to walk up three flights of stairs, one of them
made out of slick stone. Academy sheriffs try to herd people up the
carpet, up the steps, into the theater and into their seats. "Treat
them like cattle," one was heard to say. "Although they're not," he
added, catching a guest's eye. "Absolutely not, and that's a lovely
dress you're wearing, ma'am."</TE>
<TE>   * Here are two ways to spot a celebrity from afar: Look for men in
headsets, parting the crowd like the Red Sea, and keep an eye out for
women who look too thin to actually be alive. Reese Witherspoon and
Ryan Phillippe must have cloned themselves--everywhere one looked,
there they were weighing no more than 100 pounds put together.</TE>
<TE>   * Many people attending the awards, it turns out, watch much of
them on television, from the various bar areas. It's like being at an
incredibly glamorous silent Super Bowl party.</TE>
<TE>   * There is an inner-circle Oscar snobbery. "All he wanted to
know," said one man to his companion after running into a friend, "is
where our seats were and if we were going to the ball. And he's
working this room."</TE>
<TE>   * There were more people here on cell phones than at rush hour on
the 405. Most of them, including myself, saying, "Hi, Mom, guess
where I am?"</TE>
<TE>   Memo to self: Halle Berry's skirt was sort of the same color as
yours, a very good sign.</TE>

<LD>It was a new nude Hollywood on the red carpet Sunday night. Not
peekaboo fashion, but a wonderful palette of understated blush and
beige tones that stood out in a sea of mostly black.</LD>
<LD>   Best supporting actress winner Jennifer Connelly was stunning in a
flesh-hued, strapless Balenciaga gown, a fitted top with a long skirt
with tiered ruffles. The only accessories were a matching long scarf
and simple diamond studs. "I love the elegance and simplicity of the
gown. I feel very relaxed in it," she said.</LD>
<LD>   Nicole Kidman favored a similar color in a delicate Chanel Couture
gown, as did Jennifer Lopez in a strapless Versace. Ditto for Kirsten
Dunst, in a sequin-splattered John Galliano for Christian Dior. All
three wore simple jewelry.</LD>
<TE>   Others went a tad bolder. "This was my early favorite," Halle
Berry said, spinning in a taffeta skirt and burgundy tulle top
embroidered with silk flowers by Beirut-based Elie Saab, who shows in
Paris. "I saw so many gowns, but this one just felt the part:
classic, couture, modern and sexy," she said as her proud mother,
Judy, decked out in Escada selected by Berry, looked on.</TE>
<TE>   Kate Winslet was a splash of color in a red Ben de Lisi gown
adorned with a silk flower across the shoulder. Anne Jeffreys' red
dress was the perfect backdrop for her heart-shaped purse. And Renee
Zellweger, with her hair pulled back in a simple bun, looked like
old-school Hollywood in a Carolina Herrera black gown accessorized
only with dangling diamond earrings.</TE>
<TE>   There was no Bjork swan outfit this year, but there was Sally
Kirkland in a Julia Gerard gown with pulleys on the skirt.</TE>
<TE>   Men got their share of double takes in their classic tuxedo looks.
Russell Crowe in a below-the-knee Armani tuxedo coat, Ron Howard in a
two-button Versace tux and Will Smith in a black-on-black pinstripe
tux by Ozwald Boateng (his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, wore a 1963
vintage Lanvin Castillo gold gown from a New York boutique).</TE>
<TE>   Marisa Tomei in a navy blue Jurgen Simonson tulle gown said it was
"nerve-racking" trying to decide what to wear but was happy with her
"glamorous" selection.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just come along in any old thing," summed up Judi
Dench, showing off her black Escada dress and matching floor-length
coat.</TE>

<HD>A Change Has Come</HD>
<DH>Analysis: After an Oscar campaign season marked by
bitterness, the Academy Awards receive a genuinely emotional
Hollywood ending as African American actors are honored.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Talk about a Hollywood ending.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the 74th Academy Awards telecast had hit the
three-hour mark, "A Beautiful Mind" had won only one Oscar out of the
five for which it had been nominated: Jennifer Connelly's victory for
best supporting actress, which had just about opened the program.
Archrival "Lord of the Rings," meanwhile, was already holding four.</LD>
<LD>   But "A Beautiful Mind," as befits a film that was the most
classically Hollywood of all the nominees, came roaring back like the
cavalry in a John Ford western. It took best adapted screenplay, best
director for Ron Howard and, finally, best picture as well.</LD>
<TE>   But, to be frank, not only wasn't "Beautiful Mind's" victory the
only Hollywood finish of the evening, it wasn't the most memorable
either.</TE>
<TE>   For after an awards campaign season universally acknowledged to be
the most petty and mean-spirited in memory, the entire Academy Awards
process also got a heartening, emotionally stirring Hollywood ending.
With Sidney Poitier's special Oscar, Halle Berry's best actress
triumph and Denzel Washington's best actor nod, the Oscar ceremony
touched chords of genuine feeling you would have sworn were beyond
the grasp of this often derided ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, this was also one of the longest Oscar shows of all time,
clocking in at well more than four hours, but that seemed a small
price to pay to witness significant dreams become real in ways they
rarely do, in the movie business or outside of it.</TE>
<TE>   For Oscar night is the night when Hollywood traditionally embraces
the fantasy, or, to be more accurate, several kinds of fantasies.
First is the fantasy of gowns and glamour, of the most recognizable
faces on the planet gathering in one place and giving the impression
we all want to believe, that Hollywood is like the old MGM back lot,
an alluring small town populated by beautiful people who hang out
together and dress grandly.</TE>
<TE>   The second fantasy is that Hollywood can be a place of
significance, that it doesn't just turn out women-in-jeopardy slasher
movies or painful farces for the teenage set. No, Hollywood likes to
insist, we do serious movies that go to bat for social change,
Oscar-winning movies like "Gandhi" and "Driving Miss Daisy"--films
that, any studio executive will tell you, have nothing to do with the
movie business' bread and butter.</TE>
<TE>   But sometimes, on rare occasions, what happens on Oscar night
actually goes beyond pretense, actually seems to say and do something
that is genuinely moving and perhaps--even if only in a small and not
necessarily lasting way--significant. Sunday night was one of those
nights, an evening when the best picture winner was fated to be
overshadowed by issues larger and more deeply felt than Oscar
business as usual.</TE>
<TE>   It started with Poitier's honorary Oscar, a tribute to a man who
was, to quote presenter Washington, "the first solo, above-the-title,
African American movie star."</TE>
<TE>   "We have all been led by Sidney," Washington added, a sentiment
amplified by a marvelous series of clips and interviews done by
director Kasi Lemmons in which any number of prominent African
American actors and directors paid tribute to Poitier's importance.</TE>
<TE>   The man himself, when he came out, made such an eloquent speech,
to such an extended standing ovation, that it seemed nothing could
top that moment. But something did.</TE>
<TE>   When Berry won the best actress award, the first African American
ever to take that prize, she almost literally melted away, her
emotions were so strong. Repeating "Oh my God, oh my God" through
tears, she talked about how "this moment is so much bigger than me,"
listing the women who had gone before and her peers today.</TE>
<TE>   When she refused to be rushed, saying "it's taken 74 years to get
here, I've got to take this time," when she talked eloquently about
"every nameless, faceless woman of color now has a chance," the depth
of her feelings was breathtaking.</TE>
<TE>   Then it was Washington's turn, besting Russell Crowe and taking
the only one of the five top awards "A Beautiful Mind" was up for
that it didn't get. Washington, already an Oscar winner for
supporting actor--for "Glory," in 1990--shook his head and said,
"Forty years I've been chasing Sidney, and they give it to me the
same night."</TE>
<TE>   Holding up his statuette in salute at Poitier in his box, with
Poitier returning the gesture, he finished with a graceful,
heartfelt, "I'll always be chasing you, and there's nothing I'd
rather do."</TE>
<TE>   Even in Hollywood, they don't write them like that anymore.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being long and emotional, Sunday's ceremony was
also the year Oscar, in any number of ways, got smart.</TE>
<TE>   Asking writers like the Coen brothers and David Mamet to explain
what below-the-line professionals do was a fine idea. The inevitable
best picture segments were improved by commentary by the filmmakers
involved. The also-inevitable Oscar montages, like Lemmons' for
Poitier and Nora Ephron's of New York City moments, benefited by
using talent that the academy has not often involved before.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary history montage was put together by director
Penelope Spheeris, whose remarkable "Decline of Western Civilization"
rock documentaries likely have never been even close to nominated.</TE>
<TE>   And the show's marvelous "what do the movies mean to you" opening
segment was done by director Errol Morris, whose groundbreaking work,
from "Thin Blue Line" through "Fast, Cheap and Out of Control," has
also been criminally neglected.</TE>
<TE>   It was bracing to see people from Laura Bush to Jerry Brown to
Mikhail Gorbachev interviewed, and mind-bending to hear film titles
such as Russ Meyer's "Faster Pussycat, Kill, Kill" and William
Castle's "The Tingler" mentioned on usually sacrosanct Oscar
airspace.</TE>
<TE>   As always, the best parts of the show were the human moments, when
the winners were just themselves. Moments like "Lord of the Rings"
makeup winner Peter Owen saying, "I don't know why anyone gave me the
job in the first place"; often-nominated, first-time winner Randy
Newman thanking the music branch for "giving me so many chances to be
humiliated over the years"; and live-action short director Ray
McKinnon talking about how great and dreamy it was "to be standing
here at the good-God-almighty Academy Awards."</TE>
<TE>   Especially on a night like last night.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Is State Academic Champ</HD>
<DH>Decathlon: The high school team beats defending titleholder
El Camino Real of Woodland Hills. Next will be the national
competition in Phoenix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a competition that eventually came down to two Southern California
powerhouses, Moorpark High School of Ventura County defeated
defending national champion El Camino Real High School of Woodland
Hills at the California Academic Decathlon on Sunday in Modesto.</LD>
<LD>   The winner emerged after two days of competition among 51 schools.</LD>
<LD>   Moorpark will now go to the U.S. Academic Decathlon, held in
Phoenix next month.</LD>
<TE>   "Even if we didn't win, this all would have been worth it," said
Moorpark's Andy Song. "This is the icing on the cake."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark coach Larry Jones has represented Ventura County at the
state competition seven years in a row, and has won twice.</TE>
<TE>   The last victory was in 1999, when his team won its only national
title.</TE>
<TE>   This year, his son, Nathaniel Jones, is on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "This [win] is much sweeter," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   While Moorpark students cheered, competitors from El Camino
displayed the strain of months of intense study.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting with heads bowed, some held hands, while others prayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I did the best I could," said Ketti Augusztiny, El Camino's
leading scorer. "It's the most the team could do. [Moorpark] is the
better team."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches Melinda Owen and Chris Cerone led El Camino to the
national title last year in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   They said the second-place finish Sunday took nothing away from
the school's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to go twice in a row," Owen said. "Moorpark is a
great team with a great coach."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark scored 48,603.3 points to El Camino's 47,730. Third place
went to Edison of Fresno County.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the top 10 high schools: North Hollywood,
Palisades Charter, Marina of Huntington Beach, Los Angeles, Bishop
Alemany, Casa Grande of Sonoma County, and Hemet of Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Grande will also go to the national competition because it
won the Division II title for smaller schools.</TE>
<TE>   The decathlon's ending ceremony came amid controversy over the
quality of testing material provided by the U.S. Academic Decathlon,
which holds the events and provides the questions.</TE>
<TE>   A petition signed by Moorpark's Jones and a number of coaches
called for higher standards and criticized the USAD for its
"incompetent ability to put together accurate and fair competition
tests."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other schools whose coaches signed the petition were El
Camino, North Hollywood, Edison, Garfield, Venice and Casa Grande.</TE>
<TE>   State Academic Decathlon Executive Director Marvin Cobb would not
comment. Unaware of the controversy, most of the students flooded a
hotel in downtown hotel where they basked in academic fervor and
celebrated a chance to get away from home to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all worth it," said Moorpark's Michelle Kim.</TE>

<HD>Teen's Hoop Dreams Come True</HD>
<DH>Sports: Buena High's Courtney LaVere will play on the first
McDonald's All American girls' team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are exciting times for Courtney LaVere, and not just because
the Buena High School senior has been named to the first-ever
McDonald's All American girls' basketball team.</LD>
<LD>   Morning radio show personalities are set to visit her Ventura high
school today for interviews. She's headed to a Lakers game Tuesday,
where she and other All Americans will be introduced at halftime.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's an upcoming trip to New York, to the inaugural girls'
game between the east and west high school all-stars April 4 at
Madison Square Garden. The game will follow a week's worth of events,
including scheduled appearances on the "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" and
the CBS "Early Show."</LD>
<TE>   "It's all so cool," said LaVere, 18, who led all Ventura County
scorers this season, averaging 28 points per game. That, plus a
stellar academic record, earned her a scholarship to Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "We are really making history right now," she said of the
McDonald's selection. "It's such an honor. I didn't know basketball
could take me to such great things."</TE>
<TE>   Success has been a long time in the making. She started playing
basketball in second grade and received her first college recruitment
letter, from the University of Nebraska, while in junior high.</TE>
<TE>   This season, at girls' basketball powerhouse Buena High, she
scored 30 or more points seven times, including a school record 45
against Newbury Park.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the 6-foot-3 center was selected to play in the
Phoenix/WBCA High School All-America Game on April 6 in Hartford,
Conn. That was followed weeks later by news of her selection to the
McDonald's team. She is one of 48 high school athletes--out of a
nationwide pool of 2,500--chosen for the boys' and girls' squads.</TE>
<TE>   "She's handling all of this with quite a bit of modesty," said her
father, Marty LaVere, who played college basketball for the
University of Redlands. "We're very proud of her."</TE>
<TE>   This year marks the 25th anniversary of the McDonald's boys' All
American game, a basketball tradition that benefits charity and gives
some of the best high school talent in the country their first taste
of prime-time exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the NBA's biggest stars have played in the game, including
Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson and Shaquille O'Neal. And this year's
girls' game could be a jumping off point for future stars of the
WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only is it the 25th anniversary of the game, but the
first-ever girls' game," said UCLA basketball coaching legend John
Wooden, who will speak to the players at a formal dinner at Tavern on
the Green. "For the 48 final team members, being selected is really a
dream come true."</TE>
<TE>   LaVere, who serves this year as senior class vice president, does
not know yet whether professional basketball will be her dream come
true. If the WNBA comes calling, she said she wouldn't pass up the
opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   But with the prom and graduation coming up and summer school at
Notre Dame on the horizon, she is trying not to get too far ahead of
the moments at hand.</TE>
<TE>   "I have so much going on, right now I'm trying not to take
anything too fast," she said. "I need to cherish these moments with
high school friends and high school memories."</TE>

<HD>Power of 120 Pounding Hoofs</HD>
<DH>Circus: 'Cheval' is the work of 30 horses, 30 performers
and a busy behind-scenes crew.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seated before a mirror illuminated by dozens of lights, the hands of
"Cheval" performer Caroline Mace are a blur as they grab lipstick
pencil, then blush, then eye makeup.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly 200 shows, Mace knows the routine. Cheeks, medium
peach. Lips, crayon brown. If she forgets, it's written on a custom
makeup guide.</LD>
<LD>   "If my makeup is too light or too dark, it doesn't look right
under the lights in the big top," she said. "Recently, my hair was so
curly that under the lights, it made me look like I had a cone head.
So my hair was changed and makeup added, to give me more of a
forehead."</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't matter that this is an equestrian show with plenty of
action. Detail is the name of the game for the producer, Gilles
Ste-Croix, who created the Canadian show of 30 horses and 30
performers.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheval," which means "horse" in French, runs through April 21 at
the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Mace, 30, is from Montreal. She is a former gymnast and stuntwoman
who signed with the show a year ago. "Cheval," patterned in many
respects after Cirque du Soleil, the fanciful French Canadian circus
for which Ste-Croix served as artistic director, is on a 19-city U.S.
tour through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Mace is a 5-foot-2-inch dynamo who barely weighs 110 pounds, but
during performances she takes command of a 1,000-pound-plus horse
named Opus, a Clydesdale mix.</TE>
<TE>   Originally used for dressage, Opus had a steady gait and other
qualities of a draft horse that the show's owners found useful. He
was retrained for his performances in "Cheval."</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, when a human jumps or falls off a horse, the horse
stops," Mace said. "With Opus, he had to learn to keep going, and at
the same speed."</TE>
<TE>   Mace, who's listed in the show as a vaulter, synchronizes her act
to the horse's movements. "It's all about trust," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mace had never worked with horses before joining the show. She
learned to understand arena work and how centrifugal force acts on a
moving platform such as the horse's rump.</TE>
<TE>   And, when working with animals, there are no guarantees. "Once I
was upside-down and some men started to do maintenance on the roof
without telling anyone," she said. "The horse heard them banging
around up above and came unglued."</TE>
<TE>   She escaped injury, but injuries are common when working with such
powerful animals.</TE>
<TE>   Performers with the traveling show live in trailers or nearby
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Burelle, spokeswoman for "Cheval," said local people are
hired to work the stables, the box office, concessions and
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Before each show, assistant designer Marie Claude is busy in one
of the tents, taking care of costumes--a job that requires patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Repair, these costumes always need repair," Claude said. "The
artists, they get new muscles, they gain weight, they lose weight.
Costumes rip."</TE>
<TE>   The costumes are a riot of color: maroons, coppers and oranges
sewn with patches of velvet and leather. With the many costume
changes, repairs must be quick for the next night's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Far from the glamour of the big top, there's a work force the
audience never sees.</TE>
<TE>   For Jenny Ramirez of Santa Ana, the job came with specific
instructions: "Just a reminder," states a note Ramirez keeps in front
of her work station. "Wash the men's white collars by hand with the
Fiesta soap, then place them on top of the refrigerator. Everything
else can be washed with Tide."</TE>
<TE>   Mace said living out of a suitcase suits her. It keeps her
motivated, and with the tour in California, closer to her other
passion: surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "I have two surfboards and a thick wetsuit because in Canada the
water gets really cold," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She took up the sport six years ago during a trip to Costa Rica,
when someone dared her to stand up on a board. "On my first day, I
stood up. I haven't been the same since. That started it all."</TE>
<TE>   Now, she tries to surf every day wherever she is, from the balmy
shores of San Diego to the freezing waters of the Atlantic Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole reason I'm working is to save enough money to someday
buy a house near the ocean," she said.</TE>
<GT></GT>

doesn't look right under the lights," Mace says. She can refer to a
precision guide.</CP>

<HD>Woman Killed in Crash With CHP Car Mourned</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Jessica Ann Mohorko of Oxnard is remembered as a
cheerful, aspiring singer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jessica Ann Mohorko and her boyfriend had just left a high school
ball at a seaside resort in Oxnard and were on their way to meet her
twin sister and her date at a restaurant. But the couples never met
up.</LD>
<LD>   Mohorko, 18, a Hueneme High School senior who was considering a
career in law enforcement, was killed early Saturday when the car in
which she was riding was broadsided by a California Highway Patrol
officer in pursuit of a motorist driving erratically.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, friends and relatives gathered at the Mohorko family's
small south Oxnard home and struggled to cope with the loss of a
young woman described as an aspiring singer, devout Christian and
jokester.</LD>
<TE>   "She was a very happy, very upbeat person," said John Mohorko,
Jessica's grandfather. "This is unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   CHP officials have declined to comment on the cause of the crash,
which occurred shortly after midnight on a busy stretch of Oxnard
Boulevard in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko's father, Edgar Allen Mohorko, senior pastor at Messiah
Foursquare Church in Oxnard and a chaplain for the Oxnard Police
Department, spent Sunday with his wife and family. In the morning,
they went to an arcade for a previously scheduled outing for
Jessica's brother's 12th birthday. In the afternoon, they planned a
funeral.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very difficult because she was such a good person who
cared for so many people," said John Ascencion, a longtime family
friend and fellow church congregant.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Johnson, who met Mohorko in kindergarten at Oxnard's
Hathaway School, said her lifelong friend, who lived around the
corner, was often laughing and joking.</TE>
<TE>   "She was the more dominant twin," said Johnson, 18. "She was just
always up and always happy. And she always looked great, too. I mean,
she never went anywhere without doing her makeup and hair."</TE>
<TE>   At the family's lime-colored home, Mohorko shared a bedroom with
her twin, Jaliece, and another sister, Jade, 19.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, in the family's sunlit living room, a photo of Mohorko
and her boyfriend, Chris Haynes, captain of the high school football
team, sat on the mantel. Tucked among three large flower arrangements
in the corner was another photo showing a smiling Jessica in a Santa
hat.</TE>
<TE>   "She made everybody feel good," said Jazz Wills, a friend and
classmate.</TE>
<TE>   According to her closest friends, Mohorko was a good student whose
passion was singing. Last week, she and Jaliece began recording a CD
of Christian pop tunes.</TE>
<TE>   "She really had the talent and she could have made it as a
singer," said Alfred Leon, another friend.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to recording, Mohorko sang at school pep rallies, once
performing a Mariah Carey song, and she sang regularly at her
father's church.</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko's friends were an eclectic mix--jocks and scholars, the
devoutly religious, the artistic. Church was very important to her,
friends said, along with volunteer work for the homeless. She also
worked part-time at a photo shop.</TE>
<TE>   Late Friday night, Mohorko and Haynes had just left a ballroom at
the Embassy Suites Mandalay Beach Resort and were driving to meet
Jaliece at a nearby Denny's.</TE>
<TE>   Mohorko had dressed for the dance in a black floor-length gown
with spaghetti straps. Her long cocoa hair was curled, styled and
swept up in front.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw her at 10 minutes of 5 that day, and she was getting ready
to go have the pictures taken," said her mother, Marta Mohorko. "She
was wearing her dress and her makeup and she looked beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, as Haynes was turning from Oxnard Boulevard onto
Gonzales Road, his 1994 Nissan Sentra was broadsided by a CHP patrol
car.</TE>
<TE>   Its red warning lights were activated, according to the CHP, but
the agency did not say whether the siren was on.</TE>
<TE>   The impact crushed the passenger side of the Sentra, killing
Mohorko instantly, authorities said. Haynes was treated at a hospital
for a broken arm and released.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Jack Raughton, a 10-year CHP veteran, sustained cuts and
bruises, and his partner and wife, Officer Christina Raughton,
suffered scrapes on her face and arm, and neck pain.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is unclear if any disciplinary or administrative
action will be taken against the officers, Marta Mohorko said she and
her family are angry about what they described as unprofessional
behavior by authorities at the scene. Marta Mohorko said she was
upset that her daughter's body remained in the crushed car for more
than five hours while officers investigated. A brief memorial service
is tentatively planned for Thursday morning at South Coast Fellowship
in Ventura, with burial to follow at Ivy Lawn Cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday or Wednesday, Mohorko's classmates plan to sell teal
balloons--her favorite color--on campus and give the proceeds to her
family.</TE>
<TE>   "We were thinking people could write a message on the balloon to
Jessica and then let it go," said classmate Mandy Castillo.</TE>

<HD>Idea to Double-Deck the 101 Is on the Level</HD>
<DH>Transportation: Caltrans floats the suggestion as a
solution to worsening congestion. But many residents are opposed,
citing concerns about quakes, costs and views.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Intrigued by a different kind of traffic pileup, transportation
officials are reviving the long-dormant idea of double-decking the
101 Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The mere notion, being floated by Caltrans at public meetings from
Calabasas to Hollywood, stops folks in their tracks.</LD>
<LD>   Some are delighted. But many more shudder at the resurrection of a
proposal they believe had been rightfully put to rest.</LD>
<TE>   "After the [Northridge] earthquake, how can you even think of such
a thing?" said Margaret Brownley, a romance novelist in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Said Neil Ignacio, 59, a Burbank salesman: "Who's going to pay for
it?"</TE>
<TE>   Stacking traffic is among a dozen prospective solutions that
Caltrans and other agencies are exploring for 101 gridlock.</TE>
<TE>   Adding a second tier to the freeway first came under serious
consideration in 1988. At the time, Caltrans estimated that an upper
deck from Universal City to Calabasas would cost $910 million and
displace more than 1,000 homes and businesses. The proposal
encountered stiff community opposition and quickly lost steam. A plan
in the early 1990s to build an elevated rail line along the 101 also
died.</TE>
<TE>   The latest 101 study was launched about a year ago. In addition to
the double-decker suggestion, options on the table include widening
the freeway and adding an elevated busway.</TE>
<TE>   "Cool!" said Milly, 23, a Reseda actress who doesn't use her last
name. "They should make the sides strong enough so that if there's an
accident, buses and cars don't fall over the side."</TE>
<TE>   As an enthusiast, she seems to be in a small minority. About 90%
of the residents who have attended the Caltrans meetings oppose the
two-level freeway, said Linda Taira, the department's branch chief in
charge of the $4.5-million study.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans is reintroducing the double-decking idea because it wants
to explore a full range of options, Taira said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the vociferous community opposition she has heard so far,
Taira's personal belief is that the double-decking idea will unlikely
become reality.</TE>
<TE>   But her belief may not reflect that of Caltrans or the other
government agencies involved in this project, she added.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's so hard to say at this point'' what will happen to the 101,
Taira said.</TE>
<TE>   A steering committee will be narrowing down the dozen options in
the next few months, Taira said. The committee includes
representatives from Caltrans, the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, Las Virgenes-Malibu Council of Governments, Southern
California Assn. of Governments, Los Angeles city and county, and the
Federal Highway Administration.</TE>
<TE>   The study is hailed by sponsors as being much more comprehensive
than the 27 that preceded it, dating to 1981. The new one addresses
the 40-mile stretch of the 101 from downtown Los Angeles across the
San Fernando Valley to the Ventura County line.</TE>
<TE>   The study has not put price tags on any of the options. But
because the corridor winds through so many neighborhoods and
commercial areas, double-decking might be cheaper than adding
ground-level lanes, which would require Caltrans to buy more land,
Taira said.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans will collect more feedback at Hollywood meetings this
week. It will narrow the options to two or three in May, and expects
to unveil its top choice in December.</TE>
<TE>   As envisioned now, one second-deck option would have an elevated
rail line with a carpool lane on each side. The second level would be
83 feet wide and rest on posts 10 feet across.</TE>
<TE>   Another option would place a busway on an upper deck 611/2 feet
wide.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be too scared to drive underneath any of those," said
Woodland Hills resident Matthew Halas, 22, who was examining Caltrans
drawings of the proposals.</TE>
<TE>   Those living near the corridor also worry that any elevating or
widening project would destroy homes, pollute neighborhoods, disrupt
businesses and lower property values.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes we're called NIMBYs," said Gerald A. Silver, president
of Homeowners of Encino, who leads a coalition of homeowner groups
fighting the expansion proposals. "But my response is, if anyone
wants a freeway in their backyard, call Caltrans and let them put it
in their backyard."</TE>
<TE>   Others can't imagine looking at a gargantuan elevated structure.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh my God ... it would be an eyesore!" said Abby Sturgeon, 24, an
account executive who lives in Sherman Oaks. "It's gross."</TE>
<TE>   Brownley, the Simi Valley resident, can't shake the image of the
double-decked Nimitz Freeway in Oakland and the two-tiered Bay
Bridge, both of which collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta
earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't think this particular geographic area should have a
double-decker," Brownley said. "It makes me cringe."</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Lane, a 59-year-old Amway distributor who lives in
Northridge, thinks the 101 could be another Harbor Freeway, whose
2.6-mile second tier opened in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "You can get from downtown to South-Central and Long Beach in no
time," Lane said of the Harbor, whose top level is reserved for buses
and carpools. "It's the greatest thing."</TE>

<HD>Sexual Abuse Victims Confront Cardinal</HD>
<DH>Religion: Protesters in Camarillo quietly reproach Mahony
for not doing enough about the problem of molestations by priests.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON and CHRISTINE HANLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time since sexual-abuse allegations began to rock the
Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was confronted by
victims and their supporters outside a Palm Sunday service in Ventura
County.</LD>
<LD>   As Mahony greeted parishioners after helping say a Mass at St.
Mary Magdalen church in Camarillo, a few protesters had short, quiet
conversations with him.</LD>
<LD>   Several said they told Mahony that he had ignored the problem for
too long and had not been forthcoming enough.</LD>
<TE>   Armed with banners and leaflets they gave parishioners, the two
dozen victims and their families mostly stood quietly as Mahony
passed by in and out of the church.</TE>
<TE>   In the leaflets, they called on the archdiocese to release the
names of several priests recently dismissed over sexual abuse of
minors. They also asked that victims be released from settlement
agreements binding them to confidentiality so they can speak out
about their abusers. In addition, they ask parishioners to stop
contributing money until the church is more forthcoming with
information.</TE>
<TE>   "The cardinal needs to release the names of all the perpetrators
so they cannot move on and abuse children elsewhere," Ray Higgins,
whose son was sexually abused in Santa Barbara by two priests, told
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Carrying a sign that said "Break The Silence," Jim Falls said he
hoped his presence might "save a child" from what he endured. Falls,
now 34, said he was molested when he was 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a survivor of abuse," he said. "I've lived with this for
decades and it feels good to be able to confront those who have for
so long ignored our plight."</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese recently dismissed six to 12 priests for sexually
abusing minors, according to church sources. The archdiocese has
refused to provide any details about their identity, location or
number, although Mahony has written in the archdiocesan newspaper
that a "few local priests" had been removed from the ministry for
harming minors.</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Mahony made no public statement to the protesters, did
not address the issue at the service and would not answer questions
from reporters outside.</TE>
<TE>   But in Orange County, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown told those at
Holy Family Cathedral that it was especially important during Easter
week for the Catholic Church to accept responsibility for the
"terrible, terrible crimes" committed by priests against children and
to seek forgiveness for wayward clergymen.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, leading Mass at the service, made his strongest public
remarks to date about the growing sex scandal in a short but direct
homily, characterizing it as a cross that the church and its people
must bear in order to heal.</TE>
<TE>   "We know now of the terrible trauma our church has been
experiencing since the events in Boston earlier this year," Brown
told parishioners.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that, unfortunately, some among us, even members of our
clergy, infinitesimal in numbers, but nevertheless real, have been
perpetrators of terrible, terrible crimes, throughout the country, in
our state, in our own county."</TE>
<TE>   Brown concluded by saying that the church must seek forgiveness
and pray for strength to "carry the cross of suffering that God has
given to us" to "emerge into a new era of Easter a stronger, holier,
more complete church."</TE>
<TE>   Palm Sunday commemorates the day Jesus Christ triumphantly entered
Jerusalem, where worshipers placed palm fronds before him as he
arrived. It marks the first day of Holy Week, the most solemn
observation of the Christian calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Brown said this was the first chance he had to acknowledge the
sexual abuse scandal from the pulpit.</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo, a spokesman for Mahony said the cardinal did not see
the occasion as appropriate to address the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tadberg, spokesman for the cardinal, said that the archdiocese
is cooperating with law enforcement and that individual clergy are
complying with a state law that mandates they report sexual abuse to
police.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, he said, addressed clergy abuse in Friday's issue of the
archdiocese newspaper, Tidings.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony wrote that the church is going through a period of
purification.</TE>
<TE>   The cardinal wrote that some victims have called an archdiocese
clergy abuse hotline.</TE>
<TE>   But as he stood outside the Camarillo church Sunday, Falls said
Mahony is not doing enough.</TE>
<TE>   "We're here to stop Cardinal Mahony protecting child molesters,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "By getting rid of these priests without naming them, he is
saying, 'It's not my problem if they molest another kid,'" he said.</TE>

<HD>Murky View Emerges of E. Europe Mobsters</HD>
<DH>Crime: Kidnap case puts spotlight on groups often lacking
in sophistication.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First there was a trail of ransom demands and wire transfers from
Moscow and the Middle East to New York and Los Angeles, the kind of
path the FBI is expert at following.</LD>
<LD>   Then there was the number of a stolen credit card belonging to one
of five murder victims--faxed from a suspect's home to a store in New
York for $8,600 in video equipment, investigators say.</LD>
<LD>   To law enforcement experts, those were glaring mistakes. Within
three weeks, the FBI began rounding up members of a small group of
suspected kidnappers--East European emigres operating mostly out of
the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<TE>   And last week, the investigation of a botched kidnap-for-ransom
scheme took agents to a murky reservoir in the Sierra foothills,
where the bodies of five murder victims were found.</TE>
<TE>   "Ransoms are normally paid in cash out in a field someplace," said
Larry Langberg, until recently the FBI'S top expert on East European
crime in Los Angeles. The alleged kidnappers "made some errors that
maybe fly in their old country, but don't fly in this country."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to think if it was a really sophisticated group, they
wouldn't have left this trail that was so easy to trace," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But you never know, Langberg added. Like others knowledgeable
about the crime scene in Los Angeles, he learned long ago that it can
be difficult to easily describe the East European crime subculture.</TE>
<TE>   And the strange tale of kidnappings and murders that surfaced last
week after the discovery of five bodies in remote New Melones Lake in
Calaveras County proved his point, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Crime in Los Angeles involving immigrants from Russia and other
East European countries once part of the Soviet bloc is viewed by
most authorities here as more disorganized than organized.</TE>
<TE>   It is largely a collection of small groups, all going their own
way, the experts say. Not at all like the large criminal families
associated with the Cosa Nostra or Mexican and Asian crime
syndicates.</TE>
<TE>   "The term Russian organized crime is a very elusive term," said
Larry Cho, head of the organized crime strike force in the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very, very few true Russian syndicate cases," Cho said.
"It tends to be small groups of people acting without any
coordination from above. And often it involves other East European
groups."</TE>
<TE>   Despite media reports about the "Russian mob," Langberg also
cautioned that there usually is no clear structure to East European
criminal activities in the Los Angeles area.</TE>
<TE>   "In the states, a lot of East European criminals are just street
hoods trying to make a buck," he said. "There's two possibilities in
the case of the victims who were found in the lake."</TE>
<TE>   Those responsible "obviously are more than simple street thugs,
because they have the knowledge of banking transactions," he said.
"But there is an unsophisticated side.</TE>
<TE>   "They could be tied into a syndicate or some sort of organized
crime. Or they could be a relatively low-level group of thugs with
some connections back in Russia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Langberg retired from the FBI two years ago after running the
bureau's Russian Organized Crime Squad in Los Angeles for five years.
He estimates that there are about 300,000 to 500,000 immigrants in
the area from countries that were once part of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   The most common crimes he saw linked to East European groups
involved fraud, Langberg said. During the mid-1990s, he saw several
cases of medical fraud and some federal gasoline tax fraud. Extortion
of businesses was also common.</TE>
<TE>   Thom Mrozek, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles, agreed that the former Soviet bloc crime groups have a
chaotic quality to them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's typically what I call ad hoc crime," he said. "You have a
bunch of knuckleheads together and they decide one day they will do a
credit card. Then it's something else. And something totally
different after that."</TE>
<TE>   The growing problem of Russian crime in U.S. cities has drawn the
most public attention in recent years. As early as 1996, the
California attorney general's office warned that it required special
attention from law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   Such comments have touched off protests over the years from
leaders of the Russian American community in Los Angeles, who have
argued that talk of a Russian Mafia is unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, law enforcement officials say, members of the Russian
underworld here frequently associate with criminals from other East
European countries.</TE>
<TE>   The largest Russian immigrant community in the United States is in
the Brighton Beach area of Brooklyn. The Los Angeles area is the
second largest, with sizable Russian immigrant communities in the
Hollywood and Glendale areas. Those areas also have large communities
of Armenians and other European groups.</TE>
<TE>   "In New York, the Russians will not mix with other groups," said
federal prosecutor Cho. "But here you see Russians with Armenians or
other groups...."</TE>
<TE>   One trait common to the East European groups is that, organized or
not, "the brutality can be pretty dramatic," said Langberg.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one case in West Hollywood where there was a
disturbance call," he said. "When the sheriff's deputies showed up,
the guy comes to the door covered with blood, in the process of
chopping up the people who had upset him for whatever reason."</TE>
<TE>   There are some signs that Eastern European crime groups are
becoming more organized, especially in the New York area and
especially within the growing Russian criminal subculture.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not a lot of evidence now of control of crime here by
people back in Moscow," said Langberg.</TE>
<TE>   "But that could change if Moscow decides it's good for business to
send people over here to organize things," he said.</TE>

<LD>An in-line skater believed to be in his 50s was critically injured
Sunday in Newport Beach when he fell and struck his head on a
concrete path after being pelted by paintballs fired from a nearby
bluff, police said.</LD>
<LD>   The unidentified victim was rushed to Mission Hospital Regional
Medical Center in Mission Viejo, where surgeons operated on him for
life-threatening injuries, said Newport Beach Police Lt. Mike
Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   Police discovered the fallen man about 1:30 p.m. on Backbay Drive
below East Bluff Park, a route that winds around the Upper Newport
Bay Ecological Preserve and has long been favored by roller skaters
and cyclists.</LD>
<TE>   When police arrived, a group of marble-sized paintballs lay on the
ground beside the victim. A witness told police officers that the
victim fell after being struck by pellets fired from the bluffs
above.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, who was not wearing a helmet, cracked his head open
when he hit the ground, Jackson said. As of late Sunday, police were
unsure who was responsible.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure whoever was doing it just thought they were goofing
around," Jackson said, "but look what happened."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen officers spent the afternoon canvassing the neighborhood,
asking if neighbors knew who could have fired the paintballs.</TE>

<HD>Exposing a Hidden Demand for Higher Taxes</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's unlikely anyone filling out state income tax returns about now
is complaining that Sacramento isn't getting enough.</LD>
<LD>   Still, a bill introduced in the state Senate would give
Californians an opportunity to check a new box on their return
labeled "Tax Me More" and sign over a larger portion of their
paycheck to the state treasury.</LD>
<LD>   The tax form would explain: "If you do not believe that the state
of California has collected enough taxes from you, this line enables
you to tax yourself any additional amount you choose to fund state
government."</LD>
<TE>   The bill is the work of conservative state Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks), who introduced it as a legislative broadside at
what he sees as a predilection of Democratic colleagues to raise
taxes whenever they need some spare change.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got a variety of proposals to massively raise taxes, and
it is predicated on the claim that the public is clamoring for tax
increases," McClintock said. "Let's put it to the test. If we have
hordes of people out there who don't feel they pay enough taxes, we
ought to help them."</TE>
<TE>   McClintock, who is the Republican nominee for state controller,
was joined by six other senators in introducing the legislation. Nine
Assembly members are listed as co-authors.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock said he introduced the bill after reading a quote from
Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San Francisco) in the San Francisco
Chronicle indicating that she thought some people would "be happy to
throw back a few bucks to help working families...."</TE>
<TE>   Migden said she was flattered that McClintock paid attention to
her comments, which were made in support of reinstating the state's
vehicle registration fee.</TE>
<TE>   For Hahn, Roast Is Like a Trip to the Dentist</TE>
<TE>   The jabs flew fast and furious Tuesday night at the Beverly Hilton
Hotel, where Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn was roasted by the
city's political establishment.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 1,000 people attended the event, which was a benefit for
the American Diabetes Assn.</TE>
<TE>   But the elected officials and other dignitaries took full
advantage of the opportunity to swing cheerfully at Hahn, who is
engaged in a tough campaign to oust Police Chief Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   "He did get some good news last week," former Assembly Speaker
Robert Hertzberg, who served as master of ceremonies, said of Hahn.
"His approval ratings are higher than the governor's."</TE>
<TE>   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said he wanted to "honor a man
who has a boundless future."</TE>
<TE>   "But enough about [City Atty.] Rocky Delgadillo," he added.</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla said Hahn's tenure has
illustrated a political truth about Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "Tom Bradley proved that he could be mayor of Los Angeles for
decades," he said. "Dick Riordan proved that anybody can be mayor of
L.A. And Jim Hahn has proved that it really doesn't matter who the
mayor is."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn took the evening in stride, laughing and grimacing at times
as the roasters poked fun at him.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad the evening is drawing to a close," he said. The mayor
compared the four-hour event to a recent trip to the dentist.</TE>
<TE>   Finding Real Dirt on Energy Debacle</TE>
<TE>   California investigators hoping to get to the bottom of last
summer's energy debacle are having to dig through a lot of trash to
get there.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer said when members of his energy task force
went to the Portland, Ore., offices of Enron Corp. to enforce a
subpoena for records, they were directed to more than 900 boxes, but
also ended up having to sift through "recycling" boxes.</TE>
<TE>   The latter not only contained documents, but also crusted food
containers, food residue, discarded Kleenex, mail-order catalogs and
personal mail, Lockyer complained.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron has been equally contemptible in failing to turn over
subpoenaed materials from its offices in California and Texas," the
top state prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   No Apparent Hurry for New Ethics Rules</TE>
<TE>   Eight months after the Los Angeles Ethics Commission recommended
new rules limiting the ties of City Council members and lobbyists,
the measure remains stuck in committee with no date set for action.</TE>
<TE>   Council President Alex Padilla said at a Dec. 17 meeting of the
Rules and Elections Committee that he had some questions about the
new rules, and ordered a report by the chief legislative analyst so
the matter could be back in committee for action in 45 days. That was
99 days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ethics Commission Executive Director LeeAnn Pelham said she hopes
the measure will eventually be taken up.</TE>
<TE>   When asked about the matter last week, Padilla said he will check
into the delay.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm cracking down on the CLA to finalize their report," he said.
"They had a draft of the report that they wanted to share with LeeAnn
Pelham before finalizing."</TE>
<TE>   Pelham denied that the Ethics Commission has played any role in
delays.</TE>
<TE>   The new rules would require council members to abstain from votes
involving lobbyists who try to influence them while also serving as
fund-raisers and campaign consultants for the elected officials.</TE>
<TE>   Rhetoric Is at Odds With What's Realistic</TE>
<TE>   Trial lawyer and Thousand Oaks Mayor Ed Masry had his courtroom
personality on last week when, full of ire, he called for the
resignation of Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he owes it to us!" Masry bellowed, his shaggy white hair
flapping and his face reddening.</TE>
<TE>   But his heart didn't seem to be in it. Moments later, when asked
how he intended to pressure Schillo, Masry conceded, "I don't really
think there's any possibility Mr. Schillo's going to resign. I don't
think that's realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Masry wants to kill the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch development at
the county's edge by ordering new study upon study. Schillo won't
sign off on a new traffic study, saying one done a decade ago should
suffice.</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * What a difference two years have made for Rep. Adam Schiff
(D-Burbank). In 2000, Schiff challenged and beat Rep. James Rogan in
a contest that set a new record for spending in a House race, with
$11.5 million spent between the two of them. But redistricting
strengthened the Democratic majority in the district, and so far this
year Schiff has spent less than $500,000 against Republican opponent
Jim Scileppi.</TE>
<TE>   * Normally, winning election to the Los Angeles City Council, the
highest paid in the nation, means a hefty pay raise for those who get
the $139,784 jobs. But Wendy Greuel will take a substantial pay
cut--more than $30,000--to give up her job as an executive with the
entertainment firm DreamWorks SKG and join the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   * As Los Angeles city officials spend a 14th year debating a ban
on billboards, San Francisco voters went ahead this month and
decisively settled the issue. Slightly more than 79% of the voters in
the March 5 election approved a ban on new billboards in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "You are really challenging the assumption that there is no such
thing as bad publicity."</TE>
<TE>   --Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn at a roast for her
brother, Mayor James K. Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Which one is the rock star?: Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton), left, is
the latest member of Congress to be seen with Bono, the hip lead
singer of the Irish rock band U2. Bono, a passionate champion of
Africa, has been making the rounds in Washington, lobbying for debt
relief for Third World nations. He discussed the issue with Royce,
who is chairman of the House Africa Subcommittee.</TE>

<HD>New EPA Official Beats the Odds</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Boss urges him to drop the case. He pursues it
and negotiates sizable emissions reductions by Arizona coal-fired
plant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY POLAKOVIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You have to choose your fights, but cleaning up one particular
coal-fired power plant in the Arizona desert seemed a sure loser,
except to new regional EPA chief Wayne Hector Nastri.</LD>
<LD>   The power plant, in Springerville, Ariz., was one of the biggest
polluters in the Southwest. Nevertheless, the plant's owner, Tucson
Electric Power Co., sought last year to double the plant's generating
capacity while keeping total emissions the same. Current technology
can cut emissions much more than that.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists sued to force a cleanup at the plant and local
regulators were in agreement. But the advantage appeared to be with
the company, given the new industry-friendly mood at the White House
and the recent energy crisis next door in California.</LD>
<TE>   Enter Nastri, 42, who became head of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency's regional office in San Francisco in October just
as the dispute between regulators and the power firm was heating up.</TE>
<TE>   Nastri is a Republican from the party's conservative Orange County
wing who was appointed by EPA chief Christie Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   Nastri was no stranger to environmental issues. Before joining the
EPA, he ran a Newport Beach pollution cleanup consulting firm,
Environmental Mediation Inc. As a boy, he enjoyed rabbit hunting in
the desert, backpacking in the Sierra Nevada and family camping
trips. He started the ecology club at his junior high school in the
early 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, agency veterans thought they had reason to worry.
The Bush administration had halted other enforcement actions against
coal-fired plants around the country. Moreover, the administration
had made clear its intent to weaken a Clean Air Act provision that
requires tougher emission controls at power plants that expand
generating capacity.</TE>
<TE>   Tucson Electric set the stage for a showdown when it sought to add
two new generators while leaving overall emissions unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   The plant was releasing about 18,000 tons of sulfur gases
annually, plus 11,000 tons of nitrogen oxides. The emissions
contribute to ozone and water pollution and helped spread haze across
some of America's most majestic scenery, from the Gila Mountain
Wilderness to Petrified Forest National Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Flagstaff-based Grand Canyon Trust complained to the EPA and
filed a lawsuit in November, alleging chronic violations of the Clean
Air Act. The group said the power plant was operating illegally and
attempting to avoid installation of modern emissions controls.</TE>
<TE>   Besides disputing those claims, the company sought help from the
EPA in Washington. Jeffrey R. Holmstead, whom President Bush had
picked to run the EPA air programs, urged Nastri to let the power
plant expansion proceed without requiring the controls sought by the
environmentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "[Holmstead] was tenacious and adamant," said one EPA official who
asked not to be named. "He said we should back down, we should leave
this alone, just let it go. It was a huge fight."</TE>
<TE>   It was also Nastri's first major test as administrator of the EPA
office that oversees California, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   Nastri's office told Tucson Electric last month that the plant was
operating illegally and that before it could expand, a detailed
review must identify the best cleanup methods and slash emissions as
prescribed in the Clean Air Act.</TE>
<TE>   The energy company objected. It sought help from Arizona's
Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who had crossed swords with federal
regulators in the past over pollution controls. The company hired
Bruce Babbitt, a former Arizona governor and Interior secretary who
recently joined Holmstead's law firm.</TE>
<TE>   Hull convened a meeting two weeks ago in Phoenix, where she wanted
the EPA and Tucson Electric to strike a deal that day.</TE>
<TE>   Nastri and Tucson Electric hammered out a deal that allowed the
plant to double electrical production while slashing total emissions
80% to 90% by 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Total sulfur oxide emissions would be capped at 10,800 tons
annually and nitrogen oxide emissions would be limited to 9,600 tons
per year while 800 more megawatts of power were brought online.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA says the reduction is slightly less than the agency might
have won had it gone to court. But the agreement requires advanced
control equipment.</TE>
<TE>   "The numbers look good," said Rick Moore of the Grand Canyon
Trust. "It's not as good as we think we could have gotten, but this
is an acceptable deal to us."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he faulted Nastri for barring his group from negotiations.
The trust's lawsuit, he noted, triggered EPA's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Arizona and at Tucson Electric Power hailed the
agreement as a model for cleaning the air while avoiding power plant
construction delays.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to be ahead of the curve on energy development to avoid
the problems California had last spring," said Scott Celley,
spokesman for Gov. Hull.</TE>
<TE>   And in EPA's regional office in California, officials say the
agency's leadership survived its first major challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a strong enforcement program," Nastri said. "We thought
we had a really good opportunity to make some significant [emissions]
reductions and we busted our butts on this. It's really good and I'm
proud of it."</TE>

<LD>An Orange County sheriff's sergeant wounded in a Lake Forest gun
battle spent Sunday awaiting surgery to remove a bullet that
ricocheted off his cheek and lodged in his shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Kurt Vasentine, 45, remained in fair condition at a Mission
Viejo hospital with a .380-caliber round just beneath the skin, said
sheriff's spokesman Jim Amormino.</LD>
<LD>   Vasentine was shot once Saturday morning as he grappled with a car
theft suspect in an alley. Surgeons had expected to operate Sunday
but the procedure was postponed until today.</LD>
<TE>   Sheriff's investigators spent Sunday trying to piece together the
alleged involvement of two reputed Santa Ana gang members who were
arrested later Saturday in connection with the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   A stolen Toyota Avalon seen speeding from the crime scene was
spotted by police in Santa Ana Saturday afternoon. After a brief
chase, officers arrested the driver, Miguel Valdivinos, 20. He was
booked Sunday on suspicion of carjacking and lesser crimes.</TE>
<TE>   Valdivinos' 16-year-old brother was also arrested Saturday after
entering a Riverside hospital with a gunshot wound. Deputies allege
that the teen, not named because he is a minor, shot Vasentine and
was wounded by the officer.</TE>

<HD>GOP Candidates Face Uphill Battle for Statewide Offices</HD>
<DH>Politics: Observers say Republicans need a longshot win by
gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon to avoid a Democratic sweep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>From attorney general to state treasurer, Republican candidates are
clear underdogs in every down-ballot contest this fall, a predicament
that reflects the flagging political fortunes of the California GOP
in recent years.</LD>
<LD>   The Republicans' longshot status is the logical consequence of
prior election defeats. The California Republican Party lost all but
two statewide races four years ago, and one of its winners, former
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, later resigned amid a
widening corruption scandal. The other, Secretary of State Bill
Jones, is being forced out due to term limits, leaving Republicans
with no incumbents running for reelection this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The result for Republicans is a perilously thin lineup of
candidates for California's statewide offices this November--a
situation that exposes the GOP to the threat of a shutout at the
hands of Democrats for the first time in more than a century.</LD>
<TE>   For Republicans, the pain of such a lopsided defeat this fall
could sting well into the future. The down-ticket offices have
historically been a breeding ground for future governors, and being
swept out of all those positions would leave Republicans with no
"bench" whatsoever.</TE>
<TE>   Democratic Gov. Gray Davis served as controller and lieutenant
governor before winning the state's highest office in 1998. Former
GOP Gov. George Deukmejian, who served from 1982 to 1990, was elected
to that post after having been attorney general and building a record
there.</TE>
<TE>   With eight months left between this month's primaries and the
November general election--an eternity in politics--countless events
could reshape candidates' fortunes. But for now, many political
experts and consultants say the GOP's best hope of avoiding a shutout
begins and ends at the top of the ticket, with Bill Simon Jr.'s
uphill campaign to unseat Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Even more so than usual, Republicans need a commanding win by
Simon to raise the profiles of other GOP candidates and help carry
them to victory. Simon stunned the state's political establishment by
crushing former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in the Republican
primary.</TE>
<TE>   If Simon runs strong in November, Republicans have a chance to
ride the coattails of the conservative financier and win a number of
statewide positions. But if he does not, as some of the down-ballot
candidates acknowledge, they may lose them all.</TE>
<TE>   "If Davis wins, I will probably lose," state Sen. Richard Ackerman
(R-Irvine), the only Republican who campaigned for attorney general,
recently told The Times.</TE>
<TE>   The last time Democrats held all the statewide offices was
1883-87, according to the California State Archives.</TE>
<TE>   In sharp contrast to the Republicans, Democrats field three
powerful and well-funded incumbents besides Davis: Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer, Treasurer Phil Angelides and Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, all
of whom hold gubernatorial aspirations. And John Garamendi, the
Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner, brings
near-incumbent status, having held the job before Quackenbush.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats already hold both of California's U.S. Senate seats--the
place Republicans found their last governor, Pete Wilson--and most
big-city mayor's offices in the state, including Los Angeles, now
that Democrat James K. Hahn has replaced Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, Republicans canvassing for statewide candidates have
had to look for recruits in the Legislature, where their party is a
minority in both houses and lawmakers thus have few accomplishments
on which to campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating their prospects, several of the Republican
candidates in the down-ballot races are Riordan disciples with
similarly moderate views on social issues that stand apart from the
more conservative Simon. They were counting on Riordan's support
during their campaigns, and his defeat left them adrift.</TE>
<TE>   Now that they must hitch their wagons to Simon, Republicans of all
stripes are making a bid for solidarity from the top of their ticket
on down.</TE>
<TE>   Simon met with other statewide candidates during a dinner in
Sacramento this month, and they agreed to emphasize issues that are
part of Simon's platform, said Simon's communications director, James
Fisfis. Mindful that Davis will probably try to use the wedge issues
of abortion and immigration to portray Simon as a right-wing
extremist, the candidates vowed to stand together and talk about the
subjects on which they agree, such as fiscal conservatism.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Simon met in private with Republican legislators in
the Senate and Assembly--most of whom endorsed either Riordan or
Jones--and emerged with a similar consensus.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it's a new day," a smiling Simon said during a news
conference afterward, dismissing the lawmakers' previous support for
his rivals. "The people have spoken. Now it's time that we unite."</TE>
<TE>   In their newfound embrace of Simon, the GOP candidates are pinning
their hopes on the possibility that like Ronald Reagan nearly four
decades before him--another conservative with little political
experience--Simon will prove stronger than anticipated and bridge the
divide between conservatives and more moderate mainstream voters.
Reagan was elected governor in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   "The most vulnerable Democrat is the one at the top," said
longtime Republican strategist Tony Quinn.</TE>
<TE>   But in a state where Democrats hold a large lead in voter
registration, and independent voters have recently sided strongly
with Democrats, a sweeping Simon win, several political experts said,
appears to be a longshot.</TE>
<TE>   "If for some reason the conservatives realize their dream and
everyone is energized by Simon and we have Reagan II, then perhaps
this will be averted," UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain
said of a Democratic shutout. "I assign almost an infinitesimally low
percentage to that. I just don't see a mandate of conservatism in
this state right now."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to incumbency, the Democratic candidates all appear to
have another important factor in their favor: money.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides and Lockyer both have more than $4 million in their
campaign accounts--about $4 million more in each case than their
Republican rivals, former Public Utilities Commission President P.
Gregory Conlon and state Sen. Ackerman.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Westly, the Democratic nominee for controller, is a former
EBay vice president whose personal fortune has been estimated at more
than $100 million. His opponent, state Sen. Tom McClintock
(R-Thousand Oaks), is considered a maverick within his own party, and
though he is easily the best known of the Republican candidates,
political experts predict he will have a hard time matching Westly in
fund-raising.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Kevin Shelley of San Francisco, who defeated former
19-year incumbent March Fong Eu in the Democratic primary for
secretary of state, has major backing from labor unions, a deep
source of campaign cash. His Republican opponent is former
Victorville Assemblyman Keith Olberg, who has been out of office
since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the nominally nonpartisan race for superintendent of
public instruction, Democratic state Sen. Jack O'Connell of San Luis
Obispo is supported by the California Teachers Assn., one of the
state's biggest campaign contributors. Republicans are rallying
behind Anaheim school board member Katherine H. Smith, who outpolled
the GOP's original choice for the job, Assemblywoman Lynne Leach of
Walnut Creek, and faces O'Connell in a fall runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Ackerman was named vice chairman of the Senate Budget Committee
last year, a position that makes him one of the top Republicans in
the budget process. It is his most prominent political role to date.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Bruce McPherson (R-Santa Cruz), the GOP's nominee for
lieutenant governor, at least gets to chair a committee, Public
Safety. Fellow lawmakers say McPherson, a former newspaper publisher
whose gun-control and pro-choice views make him one of the most
liberal Republicans in the Legislature, got the assignment because
Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) likes him.</TE>
<TE>   Both Ackerman and McPherson endorsed Riordan in the gubernatorial
primary. So did Gary Mendoza, the GOP nominee for insurance
commissioner and a partner at the former mayor's law firm, Riordan &amp;
McKinzie.</TE>
<TE>   After the backlash caused by Proposition 187, the 1994 measure to
limit public services to illegal immigrants that was supported by
former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, GOP leaders sought to recruit
candidates who presented a more inclusive image. But those efforts
have largely failed, lately because many Republican women and Latinos
have found better opportunities with the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   In the future, some experts predict, the GOP may have to turn to
Congress for statewide candidates, although most representatives have
little name identification outside their home districts. Or the party
may need to lean heavily on inexperienced celebrities such as actor
Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has expressed an interest in entering
California politics.</TE>
<TE>   That is, unless Simon can right the Republican ship this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Field Poll had Davis and Simon in a virtual tie. More
important in a state where a growing number of voters decline to
register with a political party, it also showed many independent
voters still have no opinion of Simon, which suggests he has an
opportunity to widen his base of support.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a blank slate to many voters," said Field Poll Director Mark
DiCamillo. "If he can get out of the box now and position himself as
more than the antiabortion conservative Davis will make him out to
be, then things could get very interesting."</TE>
<TE>   But DiCamillo noted, "The Republicans are in an all-or-nothing
situation."</TE>

<HD>Bush Deftly Plays the Taipei-Beijing Card</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSEPH A. BOSCO</AU>
<BD>Joseph A. Bosco teaches a graduate seminar in
China-Taiwan relations at Georgetown University's School of Foreign
Service.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chinese leaders hailed President Bush's visit to Beijing last month
as constructive and positive despite disagreements over
proliferation, human rights and Taiwan. In the weeks since, however,
Beijing has complained of a new "chill" although it gives no
indication of wishing to cancel the upcoming visits of Jiang Zemin
and Hu Jintao.</LD>
<LD>   That willingness to continue doing business with Washington
reflects the Bush administration's steady but quiet success in doing
what foreign policy experts long declared impossible: regularizing
relations with both Taiwan and China at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   Given the Chinese penchant for policy by numbers--"one country,
two systems," "three no's," etc.--they now confront some U.S.
numerology: the two normalizations.</LD>
<TE>   An indication of the changed policy was the attendance of Taiwan
Defense Minister Tang Yiau-ming at an arms sales conference in
Florida in early March. It was the first substantive visit of such a
Taiwanese official since 1979, when President Carter severed
relations with the island and terminated the U.S.-Taiwan defense
pact. More important, the visit enabled Tang to meet on U.S. soil
with such high-ranking officials as Deputy Defense Secretary Paul
Wolfowitz and Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly, contacts
stringently avoided by prior U.S. administrations.</TE>
<TE>   Neither was the visit disguised as a mere "transit stopover," the
term used for last year's pair of three-day stays in New York and
Houston by Taiwan President Chen Shui-bian. Even under that cover,
Chen was allowed to move around in public, meet with U.S. scholars
and attend a major league baseball game, in marked contrast to his
transit in 2000 when the Clinton administration kept him under
virtual house arrest in a Los Angeles hotel.</TE>
<TE>   These manifestations of official respect for representatives of
Taiwan's democracy follow earlier administration moves to bolster
Taiwan's security: the decision to sell sophisticated new weapons
systems and Bush's pledge in April that the U.S. would do "whatever
it took" to defend the island against Chinese aggression.</TE>
<TE>   The latter declaration sent shock waves through the academic and
think-tank communities and among some in Congress because it finally
brushed aside the veil of strategic ambiguity. That antiquated policy
was meant to keep Beijing guessing about the U.S. commitment to
Taiwan but instead invited Chinese threats and adventurism.</TE>
<TE>   Lest critics succeed in muddying his clarified policy by
dismissing it as a slip of the tongue, the president stayed on
message during his trip to Asia in February. He told the Japanese
parliament that "America will remember its commitments to the people
on Taiwan." Two days later in Beijing, a well-prepared Chinese
student asked Bush if he would adhere as faithfully to the three
Sino-U.S. communiques that the People's Republic uses to push its
version of a "one-China" principle. The president deftly invoked
instead the Taiwan Relations Act, the 1979 U.S. law that guarantees
Taiwan's security.</TE>
<TE>   This unflinching fealty to Taiwan reflects the administration's
decision to upgrade the China relationship as well by finally
treating Beijing as a mature, responsible player in world affairs and
expecting it to behave as such. The Bush team has made clear that
threats and rhetorical tantrums will not deter the U.S. from pursuing
its basic national interests in Taiwan or in nonproliferation, human
rights, trade and, after the EP-3 plane incident a year ago, the
United States' right to conduct legitimate surveillance in
international airspace.</TE>
<TE>   And, while Beijing has complained of developments since the Bush
visit, compared with Chinese reactions to lesser "provocations in the
past" its protestations against Bush's no-nonsense approach have been
relatively muted and ritualistic. Chinese leaders may well perceive
that he is according them the businesslike respect an emerging great
power merits. More practically, they recognize how much China has to
gain from a more harmonious relationship with Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Atmospherics aside, however, Beijing has yet to meet the most
important test of responsible international conduct set by the
administration: Chinese sales of dangerous weapons and technology to
unsavory regimes. At some point, China will have to reject that camp
to earn its place as a full member of the civilized world. That is a
normalization that rests in Chinese hands alone.</TE>

<HD>L.A. in Future Perfect Tense</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL BOYARSKY</AU>
<BD>Bill Boyarsky, a former columnist and city editor at
The Times, is a lecturer in political science at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The eagerness of some of our citizens to divide Los Angeles into four
cities shouldn't come as a surprise in a place with so little regard
for its past.</LD>
<LD>   The rich history of Los Angeles, from Indian days to today, is
never invoked in the debate over creating an independent Hollywood
and the as-yet-unnamed San Fernando Valley and harbor cities.
Instead, there are tedious arguments over how to split the cost of
waterworks, streets and other services.</LD>
<LD>   That's because a fresh start, a clean slate, are the real symbols
of L.A. From the poorest immigrant to the newest and flashiest
entrepreneur, people check their pasts at the border.</LD>
<TE>   No Eiffel Tower for us, no grand boulevards, no cable cars all the
way to the stars.</TE>
<TE>   Where I was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, history is
cherished and great families trace their ancestry back to the Gold
Rush. So I have always wondered about the civic amnesia of Angelenos.</TE>
<TE>   It seems to extend everywhere. Store clerks never remember us, no
matter how long we shop there. Or the store and its building might
vanish between visits.</TE>
<TE>   Once, new to L.A., I wrote a story about a San Fernando Valley car
dealer and, in great detail, portrayed him as a secret political
power. Not long after, I ran into a reigning political titan and
Ronald Reagan friend, Henry Salvatori, and his wife, Grace.</TE>
<TE>   "You defamed one of the finest men I know," Salvatori roared.
"Don't be so hard on him, dear," Mrs. Salvatori said. "The young man
hasn't been here long."</TE>
<TE>   Puzzled, I thought to myself, "Nobody else has, either." The
Salvatoris were old-timers by Los Angeles standards: He had moved
here less than 40 years before to start an oil exploration business
and his wife, a Tulsa ballet teacher, came a few years later.</TE>
<TE>   People rise from nowhere, became famous, then infamous and then
forgotten, all very quickly.</TE>
<TE>   A colleague and I attended an elegant political fund-raising
dinner at a Beverly Hills home a few years ago. As we sat in the tent
in the vast backyard, sampling the delicious dinner, we marveled at
the rise of the host, unknown until he made a lot of money and passed
it out to politicians. Not long afterward, he lost the money and his
prominence. Recently, we tried to remember his name. Neither of us
could.</TE>
<TE>   In a society such as this, family and distinguished old school
ties are not as important as money. Gary Winnick grew up in Long
Island and graduated from the C.W. Post campus of Long Island
University. He came to California in the 1970s and prospered,
especially after he founded Global Crossing, which aimed to link the
world with a broadband communications network.</TE>
<TE>   In a mere two decades, Winnick was a multibillionaire with a
lavish Bel-Air estate. And Winnick--as he put it, "a true Long Island
boy, born and bred and very proud of it"--became a power in his new
hometown and the nation. Politicians fawned over a man whose firm
gave millions to candidates and political parties. Then Global
Crossing went bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   But don't write off Winnick. The city of new beginnings is also
the city of second chances.</TE>
<TE>   I was reminded of that a couple of years ago when I was on a
program sponsored by the Milken Institute, founded by Michael Milken.
He became rich by figuring out a way to use junk bonds--highly
speculative securities--to create profitable investment portfolios
and to finance risky start-ups. In 1989, the federal government
charged him with securities violations, including insider trading.
After pleading guilty, he served 22 months in prison and paid $1.1
billion in fines and settlements, including $500 million to settle
lawsuits by private parties.</TE>
<TE>   I sat next to Milken at lunch. I thought a man who spent almost
two years in prison after years of mercilessly unflattering news
coverage would have sought obscurity. Not Milken. He courted
attention from public officials, policy wonks and even the press.
When we talked, his eyes fastened on me with an almost hypnotic
intensity, a Milken quality I had read about. When I explained I
would be leaving early to see my wife off on a business trip, he
nodded approvingly, one family man to another. He was dominating,
full of life and well into his comeback from disgrace--the perfect
Angeleno.</TE>
<TE>   History explains our disdain of history. L.A'.s principal business
has always been land development. That's how many of those who have
run Los Angeles made their fortunes, from the early developers of the
San Fernando Valley to the current most powerful man in town, Eli
Broad. It's a business where the old constantly is replaced by the
new.</TE>
<TE>   In a society with such a philosophy, historians are
obstructionists, whining to save old buildings. The newest hero is
the latest billionaire. That is the essence of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at it that way, it probably won't matter to anyone if Los
Angeles voters approve splitting the city into four parts on the
November ballot. Only the historians will care, with their old maps
of a city founded in 1781 and occupying 465 square miles that extend,
in the words of veteran TV news anchor Jerry Dunphy, from the
mountains to the sea.</TE>

<HD>A Tragic Fire Unveils Saudi Arabia's Misogyny</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRIDA GHITIS</AU>
<BD>Frida Ghitis is a journalist and author. Her latest
book is "The End of Revolution: A Changing World in the Age of Live
Television" (Algora, 2001).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The treatment of women in the Muslim world is part of a dangerous
pattern of abuse of power by religious authorities whose
interpretation of Islam has been embraced widely, and not just by
people like Osama bin Laden. Take, for example, the treatment of
women in Saudi Arabia. This is not just a curious cultural difference
that women are enduring; this is an abuse of human rights.</LD>
<LD>   During my days in Saudi Arabia covering the Gulf War, I had my own
minor encounter with the feared Saudi religious police. Infuriating
as it was, my experience was trivial compared with that of most women
whose lives come into contact with the enforcers from the kingdom's
Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.</LD>
<LD>   The rule of terror by the religious police reached new depths of
horror during this month's deadly fire in the city of Mecca. The fire
erupted in a girls' school in Islam's holiest city. There were 800
students inside when the flames engulfed the building. The gates were
locked, as is usually the case in girls' schools, partly to ensure
that the sexes remain segregated. Witnesses said the ever-present
religious police quickly reached the scene and wasted no time
carrying out their duties.</LD>
<TE>   According to local news reports, when the girls tried to flee the
fire without first making sure they were fully covered with their
scarves and abayas--the black robes women are required to wear in
accordance with Saudi Arabia's interpretation of Islam--religious
police beat many of the girls back toward the burning building. They
also reportedly kept male would-be rescuers from rushing in to pull
students out of the fire because their interpretation of Islam says
men may not approach women.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, 14 girls were killed and scores more were injured in
the fire. Nobody knows how many of them would have escaped but for
the deeds of the religious police.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, when I was in the kingdom, I was visiting a sheep market
with a television crew to record images in advance of Ramadan
ceremonies. Suddenly I felt pain in the back of my leg. I turned to
see a bearded man hitting me with a stick. My transgression consisted
of straying from the men on my crew. As much as authorities had eased
the rules for the visiting press covering the war against Iraq, I
had, literally, gone too far--about 10 feet from the men. No woman
was allowed to walk alone in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Women who live there are not allowed to drive, work, vote or
perform any of the functions that normal human beings can carry out
in today's world. Women are subjected to constant harassment,
beatings and arrests by the religious police. They are second-class
citizens in their own country.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is not something we hear about from Washington,
even as the Bush administration self-righteously proclaims its heroic
liberation of Afghanistan's women.</TE>
<TE>   The United States' silence regarding women in Muslim countries is
a crass display of hypocrisy, the kind of hypocrisy that undermines
U.S. credibility and brings into question its motives as it engages
in battles around the world. Some honesty is in order.</TE>
<TE>   The actions of the religious police in the Mecca school fire
outraged even the people of Saudi Arabia, who are used to the abuses
of religious authorities. This provides an opportunity for Washington
to show it stands for the rights of people, not only for convenient
geopolitical alliances and assured access to oil.</TE>
<TE>   No one is suggesting that the U.S. break relations with Saudi
Arabia or go to war to save the women of Saudi Arabia. But the U.S.
must speak out and pressure Saudi Arabia to ease the grip of the
clerics on women.</TE>

<LD>A lot of new medical studies appear these days, which is good for
human progress, medicine makers, medicine takers and the folks who
print studies. But, frankly, it can be pretty confusing for readers
bombarded with reports appearing to tout incremental progress against
another of the countless afflictions floating around to worry about.
Some of us could swear these afflictions were conquered a while ago,
though we didn't keep that day's paper. But the studies roll out with
warnings that practical application of new findings may be 10 years
away, a long time if you're afflicted, think you might qualify or pay
for newspaper home delivery.</LD>
<LD>   Take a recent study on depression. On one hand it provided the
depressing news that Americans treated for depression soared from 1.7
million to 6.3 million from 1987 to 1997. Even in California that's a
lot of people waking and saying, "Oh, no, not another day." But a
burgeoning population of depressed people is good, the study said,
because it shows we're more open about being down.</LD>
<TE>   Turns out the depressed population on antidepressants is up from
37% of the 1.7 million to 75% of the 6.3 million. That's good for the
makers of Prozac and its chemical cousins. But that's a lot of pills
for the richest, safest, most educated, cabled, automobiled and
well-housed continental democracy in human history. But that might be
good too because the depressed feel better--as long as they take
their medicine, which the study found that many stop, which is not
good. But the study also found fewer depressed people on medicine
going for psychotherapy to address underlying problems. This is
depressing for psychotherapists, although the actual social impact
won't be known for years. So don't get too anxious. But business is
good for primary doctors prescribing medicines for the depressed
instead of steering them into long-term specialist care, which might
or might not be good depending on their memories of Mom.</TE>
<TE>   Now comes a study of 62,000 Norwegians, urging primary doctors to
be careful treating common complaints like nausea because they may
really be symptoms of--oh, no!--depression. It found that 41% with
major nausea complaints had an anxiety disorder; fully 24% were
clinically depressed. So the number of depressed people mistakenly
taking nausea medicine may further inflate the depressed population
that stops taking its antidepressants--and prompt gloomy new studies
on the impact of gloomy studies on depression.</TE>
<TE>   Surveys indicate that perhaps 14 million Americans could benefit
from depression treatment. That's good for the depression business
but nauseating if you think what an editorial writer could do with
this information.</TE>

<HD>Fueling a Green Energy Quest</HD>

<LD>Not so long ago, natural gas was the darling fuel of California's
electric power industry. There was lots of it. It was cheap. And much
cleaner to burn than the fuel oil that then powered most generating
plants. Older plants switched to it.</LD>
<LD>   Now California needs to begin weaning itself from its heavy
reliance on natural gas, which fires roughly half the electric power
generated in the state. The state needs to diversify by developing
more renewable energy sources.</LD>
<LD>   A temporary shortage of natural gas coupled with huge price spikes
was a major cause of the state's energy crisis of 2000-01. Supplies
have rebounded and the price has dropped. But shortages and soaring
prices are certain to return. Energy companies could again hold
California hostage.</LD>
<TE>   The state was once a leader in the renewable energy field,
experimenting with everything from geothermal plants to wind
generators, solar panels to turning organic "biomass" waste into
power. But the energy crisis disrupted California's drive toward
increased use of such alternatives. When the state took over the
purchase of power, what it bought for years to come would be
generated almost exclusively by conventional gas-fired plants.</TE>
<TE>   During 2000 about 8% of all power used in the state--and 10% of
all power produced in the state--came from renewable sources, not
counting hydro power. Twelve percent of what Southern California
Edison distributed here was renewable. But with new technology coming
on line at competitive costs, the potential for renewable energy is
virtually unlimited. Fourteen states already have set goals for
increasing its use, and the U.S. Senate last week took a first step
toward national goals.</TE>
<TE>   California needs to approve state Senate Bill 532, by Byron Sher
(D-Stanford), to set a firm target: that renewable sources supply 20%
of the state's power by 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Sher's bill passed the Senate last year but got bogged down in an
Assembly committee, in part because of opposition from municipal
utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,
which jealously guard their freedom from state regulation. The
municipals probably will be dropped from the bill, but they should
adopt their own 20% goals as a matter of good policy.</TE>
<TE>   A portion of utility rates is already set aside to purchase
renewable power. The new California Power Authority is considering a
$2- billion plan to finance renewable projects that would produce the
equivalent of three large gas-fired power plants. And the Energy
Commission will help. Making a good deal even better is the fact that
renewable sources are virtually pollution-free. In other words,
California could again take the lead in a high-tech industry that
would create thousands of jobs without making the air dirtier.
Encouraging news for a state more accustomed to energy embarrassment.</TE>

<LD>How's this for odd timing in the post-Enron era? At the same moment
the Justice Department is indicting the accounting firm Andersen for
its role in a debacle that surely will cost thousands their
retirements, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
is speaking out against cracking down on the industry that allowed
such corporate abuse.</LD>
<LD>   Nervous investors long for someone to restore the public's faith
that capital markets are free and fair. But SEC Chairman Harvey L.
Pitt told the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday that
Congress should back off from regulating auditors. Pitt does not deny
that the industry has troubles. Appearing Thursday before the Senate
Banking Committee, he acknowledged that Enron had shaken public
confidence in corporate governance and accounting regulation and he
suggested that the 1990s bull market had pushed corporations to fudge
and obscure "potentially adverse results." In other words, "to lie."</LD>
<LD>   Sens. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Jon Corzine (D-N.J.),
members of the Banking Committee, have proposed tough regulations
that include forcing companies to switch auditors every four years.
Pitt, like others in the Bush administration, sees any new regulation
as onerous and says it would only hamper industry. Instead, he wants
to let the SEC and the free market handle all problems.</LD>
<TE>   He is on the right track in arguing for stronger enforcement by
the SEC, more timely disclosure statements and stiffer penalties for
senior corporate officials who provide misleading information. He
also wants to create a private-sector "Public Accountability Board"
to help oversee what little regulation he does embrace. None of this
would cause crooked accountants to lose sleep.</TE>
<TE>   The board that Pitt proposes would not wield subpoena powers.
What's more, Pitt refuses to tackle the most egregious problem,
namely the lavish consulting fees that auditing companies can collect
from the very corporations whose books they are supposed to police.
(About half of the $52 million that Enron paid Andersen in 2000
consisted of such fees.)</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers must decide whether to heed their angry, jittery
constituents or Pitt. We suggest the former. Move ahead with
legislation to rein in the auditing industry, whose work investors
must trust completely if they are to regain full faith in capitalism.
For his part, Pitt could still play a constructive role. A lawyer who
amassed millions representing big accounting firms, he could stop
trying to protect his former employers and worry about protecting his
new client--the public.</TE>

<LD>Madonna Bonds With a Fellow Icon</LD>
<LD>   Could there be a more intriguing couple than Madonna and James
Bond? A musical marriage is in the works between the platinum one and
the super-suave spy, with Madonna in the studio this week working on
the title song she composed for "Die Another Day," the 20th Bond
film.</LD>
<LD>   There's a rich but erratic history for the Bond tunes. Shirley
Bassey had career-defining hits ("Diamonds Are Forever,"
"Goldfinger") and Paul McCartney and Wings tapped into their edgier
side for the smash "Live and Let Die," but most recent Bond songs
have neither shaken nor stirred music fans.</LD>
<TE>   "There's still tremendous attention on who is chosen to do the
Bond songs, but the last big hit, really, was Duran Duran," says
radio and film music consultant Jeff Pollack, referring to "View to a
Kill," a No. 1 hit in 1985. "It has not been an automatic hit, even
for people like Sheryl Crow and Garbage."</TE>
<TE>   That could change with Madonna, who has been enjoying a critical
and commercial renaissance with her recent albums. She is working on
her next collection, and though no release date has been set, the
Bond film release in November will give her a chance to stay in the
ear of pop fans in a major way. She also has some spy film
experience: Her "Beautiful Stranger" for the second "Austin Powers"
movie was a hit and a Grammy winner.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an absolutely perfect vehicle for Madonna and great for
the film," Pollack said. "The music videos, too, are almost like
trailers for the film. It's the best choice for a Bond film in
years."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, but there is one plot twist remaining: "It has to be a good
song, of course," he adds. "That's what really matters."</TE>

<TE>   Williams Gives In to the Dark Side</TE>
<TE>   Will the real Robin Williams please stand up?</TE>
<TE>   Is he the wildly improvising, motor-mouth comic epitomized by his
extraterrestrial character Mork from Ork in the 1970s TV sitcom "Mork
&amp; Mindy"? and the Army DJ in "Good Morning, Vietnam"? Or the man with
teddy bear charm in "Flubber" and "Father's Day"? Or the unorthodox
intellectual in "Dead Poets Society" and "Good Will Hunting," the
latter of which won him an Academy Award for best supporting actor?</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, Williams has been severely criticized for taking
sappy roles in such films as "Patch Adams," "Jakob the Liar," "Jack"
and "What Dreams May Come." As one critic puts it, Williams seems to
play "the Wise Clown meant to show us the way."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Williams is taking a severe departure from his usual comic or
manic persona with three consecutive films that accent the darker
side of his acting talents: "Death to Smoochy," "Insomnia" and "One
Hour Photo."</TE>
<TE>   In the dark comedy "Death to Smoochy," which opens Friday,
Williams plays Randolph Smiley, the costumed star of the
highest-rated kids' show on TV whose life crumbles after a scandal
breaks. Homeless and bent on revenge, he goes after the new star of
kids' TV, named Smoochy. The film is directed by Danny DeVito, who
also co-stars.</TE>
<TE>   In the thriller "Insomnia," which opens in May, Williams plays a
twisted mystery writer; in "One Hour Photo" (tentatively scheduled to
be a summer release), he is a psychotic loner working at the photo
counter at a suburban discount department store.</TE>

<LD>"Blade 2" and vampire slayer Wesley Snipes sucked $33.1 million out
of moviegoers to debut as the top weekend film and help continue a
March box-office boom.</LD>
<LD>   "Ice Age," the animated comedy about prehistoric creatures caught
by a big freeze, was close behind with $31.1 million in its second
weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   In third, the 20th anniversary reissue of "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial" pulled in $15.1 million, the fourth-best weekend
opening for a re-release. The first three "Star Wars" films hold the
top honors, with "Star Wars--Special Edition" scoring $35.9 million
the weekend it opened in January 1997.</LD>
<TE>   "We're very proud of 'E.T.,'" said Nikki Rocco, head of
distribution for Universal. The film needs to take in only $16.2
million more to move ahead of "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom
Menace" and take the No. 3 spot on the list of all-time top-grossing
films.</TE>
<TE>   Together, the top 12 weekend films grossed an estimated $121
million, exceeding the box-office take for the same weekend last year
by nearly 74%. They also narrowly topped the record March take from a
week earlier, generating summer-like returns months before the
customary blockbuster season begins.</TE>
<TE>   "This could be the biggest March weekend ever. Studios are going
to look at March in a new light now," said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Blade 2," which brings Snipes back as the half-man,
half-bloodsucker Marvel comic character who kills vampires, nearly
doubled the debut weekend take of the original 1998 film.</TE>
<TE>   Playing in 2,707 cinemas across the country, "Blade 2" averaged an
impressive $12,228 a theater, and it attracted male and female
audiences equally.</TE>
<TE>   Originally typified by cheap, inferior knockoffs, the sequel has
become a higher art form as studios realize that careful follow-ups
can practically turn into a license to print money.</TE>
<TE>   "The power of the sequel remains," said Russell Schwartz,
president of domestic marketing for New Line Cinema.</TE>
<TE>   He said screenwriter David Goyer is already signed to write "Blade
3."</TE>
<TE>   "Ice Age," which had the best March opening ever with $46.3
million last weekend, showed staying power as it attracted kids,
adults and the dating crowd.</TE>

<LD>Moving out of Bovard Auditorium, which is due for a renovation this
year, the USC Thornton Symphony--with USC Choral Artists, the
assisting Camerata Singers of Long Beach and four USC alumni as vocal
soloists--gave a springtime showcase in Pasadena Civic Auditorium on
Saturday night. The veteran, Romanian-born conductor Sergiu
Comissiona, who has been principal conductor of the USC Symphony for
three years, led the performance of Verdi's Requiem.</LD>
<LD>   As a demonstration of the achievements of the student orchestra
and choral bodies, this was a handsome display. The instrumentalists
had been coached and prepared thoroughly, and they showed remarkable
technical finesse, admirable cohesion and bright resonance.</LD>
<LD>   The chorus--about 125 singers total--sang with musical commitment
and dramatic gusto. At louder dynamic levels, the choral singing was
polished, often clearly enunciated; in the quieter places, it could
become mushy and vague.</LD>
<TE>   Comissiona runs a tight musical ship. His tempos were firm, his
transitions transparent. Yet he did not inspire his forces to dig
deep into the dramatic values in this most operatic of spiritual
works--or one might say, in this most spiritual of operatic works.</TE>
<TE>   He let the terrors of the "Dies Irae" speak for themselves but
held back on the exuberance of the "Sanctus." The joy in that
movement ought to be unbridled, not just enthusiastic.</TE>
<TE>   Despite many satisfying musical moments, the solo quartet proved
mismatched and uncohesive as a unit. Robert MacNeil, the tenor, and
Juliana Gondek, who now calls herself a mezzo-soprano, performed
fervently, if inconsistently. Michele Patzakis, a soubrettish
soprano, was sadly miscast in this most demanding of Verdi roles; as
a result, the final "Libera me" failed to achieve its crucial
climactic conclusion. Andrew Wentzel was the strong-voiced but
unassertive bass soloist.</TE>

<HD>Style Redeems Regina Klenjoski's 'Original Sin'</HD>

<AU>JENNIFER FISHER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stylish is the word that comes to mind when it comes to choreographer
Regina Klenjoski's production of "Original Sin," which was actually a
seven-part essay on the famous Seven Deadly Sins. On Friday night at
the James R. Armstrong Theatre in Torrance, excellent dancing and
design elements strongly supported a piece that otherwise depended
largely on familiar movement themes and one-note concepts for its
evocation of sin.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the "seven deadly" sections unfolded in an exaggerated,
almost sketch-comedy style, complete with a kind of punch line.
"Gluttony," which took place around a wonderfully baroque-modern
table (one of the stunning sets by Shanan Brown), featured preening,
prancing servants and masters, and lots of grabbing and licking of
gold platters, culminating in a comic cannibalizing of the servants
when food ran out. In "Greed," blue plastic balls were coveted,
amassed and fought over like gold, until a golden ball was spotted
and seemed to start the process over again.</LD>
<TE>   Other segments also tended to center on the first movement
qualities you might associate with the given sin, as if they came
from workshops on the theme but were never developed further.
Klenjoski often created interesting lifts and pictorial moments--the
duet in "Sloth" and parts of "Lust" and "Envy" come to mind--but
there was a powerful amount of heaving and hankering going on and on.
Indulgence and evil, in dance terms, seemed always to involve
rippling arms, slinky writhing, sensuous petting, caressing and
leering--lots and lots of menacing leering.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Fitchett's heavily synthesized score boldly underlined the
few moods that prevailed over nearly two hours, without intermission,
using lots of reiterated spooky percussion, eerie, drawn-out notes
and some fuzzy rock guitar riffs for evil atmosphere. Mime Don McLeod
appeared before each section to reiterate "Pride," for instance
(carrying a mirror), or "Anger" (irate gesturing).</TE>
<TE>   Brown's sets and costumes (by Denise Lichter) consistently
established mood well and offered originality at every turn, even as
the choreographic concepts played out less interestingly.</TE>
<TE>   The Regina Klenjoski Dance Company's excellent dancers, in
addition to Klenjoski herself, were Jeffrey Bulkley, Albertossy
Espinoza, Marissa Labog, Cathy Manturuk, Iris Stanley and Milva
Rinaldelli.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Guys, if you think this is "reality" television, you must be
dreaming.</LD>
<LD>   In the latest twist on the unscripted genre, "Survivor" meets
"Fantasy Island" as a single man searches for his soul mate among 25
knockout women on "The Bachelor," premiering at 9 tonight on ABC.</LD>
<LD>   If all goes according to Cupid's plan (or at least the network's),
over the course of six episodes the bachelor will pare the field to
15 women, then eight, four and, ultimately, to the woman who wins his
heart.</LD>
<TE>   Will he choose the doctor, the NBA cheerleader, the power tool
sales rep or one of the others? Will he propose, and will she accept?</TE>
<TE>   Host Chris Harrison treats the contest with borderline reverence.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no ordinary relationship show," he says. "This is about
something real, something permanent--you know, the whole
'till-death-do-us-part' thing."</TE>
<TE>   The producers appear to have taken pains to avoid repeating the
"Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire?" fiasco, when the "winner"
decided that a cold fish with seven figures is still a cold fish, and
the union quickly unraveled.</TE>
<TE>   This time the catch is Alex, a 31-year-old management consultant
with an Ivy League degree and senatorial good looks, who seems
genuinely friendly and humble.</TE>
<TE>   In tonight's show, Alex hosts a cocktail party at a seaside Malibu
estate, mingling with the women who share his desire for true love
(and a chance to be on TV).</TE>
<TE>   After the soiree, he offers a red rose to the 15 women he would
like to know better, and those who accept it will go to round 2,
moving into the mansion as the courtship and competition intensify.</TE>
<TE>   The cheese factor is undeniable, but "The Bachelor" makes a
connection with its audience beyond the vicarious thrill.</TE>
<TE>   The faces may be glamorous, but the quest for love and acceptance
is universal.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of tonight's episode, one of the stunned rejects nearly
breaks down. "I'm a good person," she says.</TE>
<TE>   And at that moment, who could watch without knowing how she feels?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "The Bachelor" can be seen at 9 tonight on ABC. The network has
rated it TV-PG (may be inappropriate for young children).</TE>

<HD>Burnished Sounds From Leipzig Quartet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD S. GINELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judging from its first appearance on the Da Camera Society of Mount
St. Mary's College's series at the Doheny Mansion on Friday night,
the Leipzig String Quartet is well worth getting to know.</LD>
<LD>   With a fine collective pedigree--three of the four members were
once principals in the superb Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra--this
quartet's blend is defined by the warm, burnished,
dark-hardwood-colored inner voices of the second violin and viola.
It's a heavy sound, yet not immobile, for they keep the tempos moving
briskly and they execute immaculately.</LD>
<LD>   The Leipzig appears to be a staunch friend of contemporary
music--its repertoire list is loaded with interesting 20th century
works--but the foursome doesn't treat the core classics casually.
They opened with a strong performance of Haydn's String Quartet, Opus
20, No. 4, leading to a finale bursting with dash and momentum
despite the immense weight of their tone. Beethoven's vast String
Quartet No. 15 was marked not so much by spiritual elevation as a
bracing sweep of nervous energy, extending even into the massive slow
movement.</LD>
<TE>   Mendelssohn's String Quartet, Opus 80, is worth dwelling upon
because this was the Leipzig-based composer's greatest quartet, yet
we hardly ever hear it played live. Written only months before his
death as a reaction to the passing of his beloved sister Fanny, the
piece is agitated, despairing, even angry, upsetting the stereotype
of Mendelssohn as a prim, proper optimist.</TE>
<TE>   The dark Leipzig timbre was well-suited for this music, and the
quartet could dig deeply into its most virulent passages without
flying out of control.</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to another townsman, the quartet closed with J.S. Bach's
"The Day Is Gone, the Sun Is Setting."</TE>

<HD>Signs of Political and Artistic Emergence</HD>
<DH>Sounding powerful and pristine, Los Tigres del Norte become
poster boys for Mexican achievement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Tigres del Norte, the world's premier norteno band, made an
entrance worthy of rock stars on Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports
Arena. One by one, the five Mexican musicians magically appeared
through the floor of a raised and terraced stage lined with bright
lights, apparently lifted by invisible elevators.</LD>
<LD>   Such flashy effects may be common in today's pop scene. But it had
a special, symbolic meaning for the many immigrants from Mexico and
Central America in the audience of nearly 12,000.</LD>
<LD>   It's as if the band members, immigrants themselves who came to
California illegally more than 30 years ago, had ascended from a
dark, unseen underworld into the glorious light.</LD>
<TE>   If it were up to the Tigres, now legal residents, a new generation
of undocumented workers would follow them out of the shadows into the
light of legal residence. Their concert, sponsored by labor and
community groups, was part of a drive for a new immigration amnesty.</TE>
<TE>   And if good behavior at long concerts counted as part of the INS
test, these fans should have been handed green cards on the way out.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands stood stoically for hours on the arena's concrete floor,
through three other acts and a few stiff, videotaped statements from
foreign dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the taped greetings included one from Mexico's
president, Vicente Fox, the target of a biting Tigres critique,
"Cronica de un Cambio" (A Chronicle of Change), for allegedly
unfulfilled promises of reform.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomatically, the song was not included in the band's briskly
paced set, which didn't start until almost half past midnight. Their
sturdiest fans were still standing during a generous encore two hours
later, with some couples still dancing shuffle-footed polkas, cheek
to cheek for La Causa to the very end.</TE>
<TE>   Artistically, Los Tigres are a first-class act.</TE>
<TE>   Dressed in elegantly tailored western suits, the four brothers
(with a cousin on drums) constantly circle each other with stealthy
steps in a catlike choreography, occasionally switching accordions,
guitars and a sax. Their keenly harmonized vocals sounded especially
powerful and pristine.</TE>
<TE>   The headliners' dignified demeanor contrasted sharply with
preceding acts: the brassy Banda Machos, who hopped around
haphazardly in outlandish cowboy-cum-space-cadet costumes, and
curvaceous pop singer Ana Barbara, who made the evening's most
suggestive political pitch with a sassy hand on the hip, a pelvic
thrust and a "long live Latin American power."</TE>
<TE>   In politics, as in pop music, you use every asset you've got.</TE>

<HD>Metheny Sets Strings Humming</HD>
<DH>The guitarist and his ensemble play with group cohesion and
individual flair as they perform in support of a new album.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pat Metheny didn't hold anything back Saturday night at the Universal
Amphitheatre. Offering a near-capacity crowd a three-hour program
(without intermission), he managed to support his new album,
"Speaking of Now," toss in some favorites from past recordings and
provide showcases for each of the artists in the current six-man
version of the Pat Metheny Group.</LD>
<LD>   Not many musicians have the history and the repertoire to support
such an outing. But Metheny, who has performed with everyone from
Ornette Coleman to David Bowie, has also led his own ensembles for
decades, scoring an unprecedented seven Grammy Awards for seven
consecutive albums. That's a substantial base of recorded material
from which to operate, and Metheny has enhanced his appeal by
affording his audiences plenty of opportunities to hear his groups in
live performance, typically averaging nearly 200 shows a year since
1974.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the length of the program, it unfolded smoothly via
colorful shifts of emphasis. Because the Metheny group--longtime
associates Lyle Mays on piano and Steve Rodby on bass, newcomers
Cuong Vu on trumpet, Richard Bona on percussion, bass, guitar and
vocals, and Antonio Sanchez on drums--is the same unit that recorded
"Speaking of Now," the songs from the album were particularly well
done. Having now had the opportunity to work through the numbers
night after night in live interaction, the band delivered the
material with an inventiveness that was a level up from the already
fine performances on the CD.</TE>
<TE>   Metheny alternated full ensemble pieces with a series of differing
instrumental combinations--guitar and drums, guitar and keyboards,
etc.--as well as substantial opportunities for each of the players to
step into the solo spotlight.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those individual efforts were especially impressive:
Metheny's remarkable ability to play a diverse array of guitars, from
acoustic to electric to his amazing 42-string Pikasso, perceptively
discovering the unique qualities of each; Bona's exquisite vocals,
especially in a number in which he accompanied himself on the mbira
(thumb piano); Vu's use of electronic repetition devices to expand
his solo trumpeting into huge orchestral sounds; several rousing drum
solos from Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Mays, always an important factor, added a few fine solos, as did
Rodby, but both played more vital roles in creating an empathetic
musical foundation.</TE>
<TE>   That foundation, combined with Metheny's great versatility and the
important contributions of the group's new members, resulted in a
stirring evening of music--convincing testimony to the fact that
there are adventure and audience appeal in jazz that reach well
beyond the classic styles of the '40s and '50s.</TE>

<HD>A 'Believer' in the Right to a Point of View</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARVIN HIER</AU>
<BD>Rabbi Marvin Hier is the founder and dean of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center and the Museum of Tolerance .</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a recent article about "The Believer," a movie about a Jewish man
who becomes a neo-Nazi skinhead ("A Question of Identity for the Man
Behind 'The Believer,'" by John Clark, March 15), writer-director
Henry Bean expressed regret at having screened the film for Simon
Wiesenthal Center staff. "I think we were stupid in going to the
Wiesenthal Center without really knowing who they were ... ," he
said. "I didn't know that [Wiesenthal head] Marvin Hier had been to
the Republican Convention last summer. I didn't understand how
politically conservative they were."</LD>
<LD>   I have some news for Bean. First, I wish we were as influential as
he claims and that we held sway over all the powerful Hollywood
studios. But that is simply not true.</LD>
<LD>   More to the point, I have never seen his film nor have I given a
single interview either praising or criticizing it.</LD>
<TE>   As with any film, people have different points of view about "The
Believer." Within my own family there was disagreement. My wife,
Marlene, found "The Believer" offensive, while my son, Rabbi Ari
Hier, thought it could be used as a discussion piece for his class. I
am no stranger to films. As the creator of Moriah Films, the
documentary division of the Wiesenthal Center, which has produced
five films to date and won two Academy Awards, I can appreciate that
every director and producer wants his or her films to be
well-received. But sometimes the public feels differently than we do
and we have to be mature enough to accept their criticism and to
learn to live with it.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, rather than accept that reality, Bean used the interview to
hurl McCarthy-like invectives, charging me with the astonishing crime
(hold on to your seats) of having attended the Republican National
Convention. Mea culpa! Mea culpa! I confess. I confess that
then-presidential candidate George W. Bush, following his visit to
the Museum of Tolerance, invited me to speak about the diversity
training programs of the museum and I gladly accepted his invitation.</TE>
<TE>   Astonishingly, Bean does not charge me with the crime of having
also attended the Democratic National Convention, a charge of which I
am also guilty. (I even attended a party in honor of Ted Kennedy at
the home of Arnold Schwarzenegger.) As a matter of fact, I have been
an equal offender in these matters since the very inception of the
Wiesenthal Center in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I abhor labels. I believe that human beings are not
robots and consequently dare not limit their thought processes along
linear lines. Therefore, there are times that I am more
conservatively inclined and other times when I am more liberal. If
the issue is terrorists, I am all for confronting them head-on
without any reservation. If that makes me a conservative, so be it.
On the other hand, if in reaching out to people who are different
from us, something we do every day at the Museum of Tolerance,
qualifies me as a liberal, then pin that label on me as well.</TE>
<TE>   For Bean to place the blame on his failure to get a theatrical
release for his film "The Believer" on the Simon Wiesenthal Center or
on my "conservatism" is blatantly dishonest. Bean is well aware that
he is the one who asked some staff members of the center to screen
the film. Nobody at the center initiated a call to any studio in an
attempt to bad-mouth it. When asked by a representative of Paramount
Classics what he thought of the film, Rabbi Abraham Cooper expressed
his own personal view that the film did not work for him. For that,
Bean tried to demonize both the Simon Wiesenthal Center and me.</TE>
<TE>   What would Bean say to the New York Times critic who said of his
film that it "fulminates with inchoate thoughts and proceeds with
more energy than coherence"? Will he charge her as well with the
astonishing crime of conservatism? Or will he wait to confirm which
national conventions this critic has attended?</TE>

from its recent album, "Start Static," Sugarcult was an energetic
whirlwind of hooks and harmonies. The band's songs are about
frustration and love lost, but the band's tight instrumentation and
mischievous demeanor made for an ebullient, fast-paced set.</LD>
<LD>   The group's cover of the Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated"--during
which the band was joined by a member of fellow Warped Tour alums
Good Charlotte--demonstrated the camaraderie between this network of
bands, and started a "guest player" trend that continued throughout
the evening.</LD>
<TE>   Spiky-haired and tattooed, Mest didn't fare as well, even when it
was joined by Unwritten Law's Scott Russo (Mest singer Tony Lovato
later returned the favor). The group's formula of caustic ditties and
bratty banter offered nothing to set it apart from other bands.</TE>
<TE>   The most seasoned on the bill, Unwritten Law was also the most
diverse sonically. It's been around for nearly a decade, and
experience has obviously given the band the confidence to experiment.
Cuts off the current album, "Elva," meshed punk, metal, ska and even
balladry into an aggressive yet atmospheric assortment of anthems.</TE>
<TE>   Russo is a strong and charismatic frontman, but the band's biggest
strength is its forceful rhythm section, which kept things driving
and persistent even when it went the emo/melodic route.</TE>

<HD>'Hip Factory' Ventures Behind Orange Curtain in Search of
Cool</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The words "Orange County" and "hip" have been paired so rarely,
except as an oxymoron, that even those who recognize the region's
impact on music, fashion and extreme sports in recent years will be
jolted to hear the county described as "possibly the hippest spot on
the planet" in the VH1 news special "Orange County: American Hip
Factory."</LD>
<LD>   Nevertheless, the one-hour show, premiering tonight, makes a
persuasive case that the area once known outside its borders only as
the birthplace of Richard Nixon and Disneyland has become a powerful
influence on pop culture throughout the nation and even the world.</LD>
<LD>   It begins as a chronicle of the Orange County music scene,
examining the area where such multimillion-selling bands as the
Offspring, No Doubt and Sugar Ray emerged in the 1990s.</LD>
<TE>   Producer Lucas Troub and writer Mike Goudreau located pretty much
all the right players in tracing the punk scene to its beginnings in
the late 1970s through interviews and performance footage of
pioneering bands including Social Distortion, TSOL, the Crowd, the
Vandals and the Adolescents. (Among the other interviewees are Irvine
Mayor Larry Agran, UCLA professor of urban planning Ed Soja, ESPN
exec and X Games creator Ron Semiao and journalist Mike Boehm, who
covered the Orange County music scene for The Times from 1988 to
1999.)</TE>
<TE>   The program adroitly captures the irony of a seething underground
spawned in master-planned communities that pride themselves on
architectural and social conformity aimed at sustaining property
values. "People plan these communities, but who could plan for the
punk-rock movement?" asks Vandals founding member Joe Escalante. "We
were running around going, 'You didn't plan for this, did you?'"</TE>
<TE>   While none of those seminal bands found mass commercial success,
they did inspire such future stars as Offspring singer Bryan "Dexter"
Holland, No Doubt's Gwen Stefani and Sugar Ray's Mark McGrath to
start bands of their own, bands that did hit the big time after
Nirvana showed at the outset of the '90s that aggressive music with
dark themes could sell millions.</TE>
<TE>   "American Hip Factory" then expands its scope by exploring the
interconnection between music, fashion and extreme sports in Orange
County, noting that many of the kids who were bouncing off one
another in the slam pits at punk shows every night were avid
skateboarders or surfers during the day. That gave rise to the
fashion world's answer to garage bands: young entrepreneurs who
started making clothes in their bedrooms and garages and creating
multimillion-dollar companies, among them Volcom, Billabong USA,
Quiksilver and Hurley.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if marketers would say that Orange County is the
coolest place in America right now," says John Fine of Advertising
Age magazine, "but whether they say it or not, it's the area they are
most desperately trying to associate their products with."</TE>
<TE>   The evolution of the punk counterculture into a commercial force,
naturally, rankles some of its forefathers.</TE>
<TE>   "The sad part," says TSOL singer Jack Grisham, one of the most
colorful provocateurs the scene has produced, "is that they took a
look and turned it into a uniform; they took a song and turned it
into a Pepsi commercial, and they took a movement and turned it into
an advertising campaign. And for that, yes, I'm bitter."</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County: American Hip Factory" is consistently entertaining
and illuminating. Scrupulously balanced it's not--there are no
interviews with any of the government officials or civic leaders who
battled O.C.'s early punks.</TE>
<TE>   Also, in exploring the crushing effects of social Disneyfication
on young people, the show unintentionally Disneyfies the result by
ignoring the high cost of nonconformity paid by the many punk
musicians and fans who landed in prison, died of drug overdoses or
drank themselves to death in pursuit of anarchy in O.C.</TE>
<TE>   But this is VH1, not "Nightline," and, all in all, the show does
an admirable job of dispelling stereotypes and pointing up
contradictions, concluding that when it comes to explaining Orange
County, "It's still not an easy place to figure out."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County: American Hip Factory" premieres tonight at 10 on
VH1 and repeats April 12 at 2 p.m.</TE>

<HD>Students Put the Future of Dance in Perspective</HD>
<DH>Dancers from Southland studios and in-school programs step
lively in a local talent showcase.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As teenagers arrived in shifts for technical rehearsals on Saturday
afternoon, the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood suddenly looked like a high
school auditorium or the set of a film that might be titled "Center
Stage 90028," focusing on a brand-new talent show for young dancers
from a dozen Southland studios and in-school dance programs.</LD>
<LD>   In a movie, however, there would be competition, awards, conflict
and heartbreak. Not at Ivar High: "New Perspectives: High School
Dance Invitational" simply offered a showcase of local excellence in
a junior version of the "Spectrum: Dance in L.A." series produced for
the last four years by Deborah Brockus, choreographer and director of
Brockus Project Dance Company.</LD>
<LD>   Brockus was everywhere Saturday: checking computerized lighting
cues, hanging posters on lobby walls, dealing with a CD player that
ate the disc intended to accompany students from the Debbie Allen
Dance Academy and encouraging performers to stay and watch the other
groups for the sake of their artistic growth. When she paused, it was
usually to peer at a dangerously cloudy sky and voice the hope that
an imminent rainstorm might begin after 11 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   "New Perspectives" was being funded by the night's ticket sales,
she said, "and I'm doing a lot of praying." In Hollywood, of course,
prayers are always answered, so the performance was nearly sold out,
the rains never came, the audience screamed approval and Brockus
began planning a sequel.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, any event focused on young artists represents an
investment in the future, but this one gained distinction by offering
its 12- to 21-year-old participants experience in and exposure to
concert dance: choreography by such icons as Marius Petipa and Alvin
Ailey as well as local young firebrands such as Robert Gilliam and
Stephanie Gilliland.</TE>
<TE>   Commercial dance wasn't exactly excluded from the 18-part
performance, but the best new pieces had a sense of adventure that
took the evening way beyond predictable show-bizzy routines.</TE>
<TE>   Gilliland's triumphant "Oval Loops" enlisted 10 dancers from the
Idyllwild Arts Academy in a high-velocity, hyperathletic and often
potentially bruising showpiece that tested the women's balletic
balances, the men's gymnastic prowess and everyone's ability to
body-surf across the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Saturday, Idyllwild company members told The Times they
felt overly sheltered in their Riverside County community and that
performing in "New Perspectives" offered them a chance to "get off
the mountain," in the words of dancer Andrew Cowan. And Meagan Pulfer
of the Ballet Etudes ensemble at the Huntington Academy of Dance in
Orange County spoke of her limited stage opportunities at home and
how facing an audience in this kind of event "is totally different
than just dancing at your studio."</TE>
<TE>   Others had different reasons for participating. Choreographer Pat
Taylor, for instance, teaches at the Crossroads School in Santa
Monica and saw the event as a way of raising the profile of dance on
campus at a time when the art is growing from a satellite of the
drama department toward academic independence. Crossroads dancer
Kauan Gracie added another motive: "We don't want always to be pushed
aside by athletics."</TE>
<TE>   Gilliam said that "New Perspectives" allowed him to workshop
choreographic ideas that he might eventually develop further with
professional dancers. However, his brilliantly original "X-Am Stress"
turned out to be the only piece on the program that used student
dancers to depict everyday student experience. Putting seven female
dancers from South Torrance High School at school desks, he used
convulsive group motion and rock music to express the frustration and
even fury underneath classroom behavior.</TE>
<TE>   It'll surprise no one in the dance world that excerpts from
Ailey's classic "Revelations" brought the house down--even with
"Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel" needlessly expanded from a trio to a
quintet. However, the urgent, loving performance by the Allen Academy
in Culver City would have been impressive even in lesser repertory.</TE>
<TE>   Current Ailey star Matthew Rushing also contributed one of the
program's highlights: the stark, end-of-love duet from his "Mone,"
performed by dancers from his former home, the Los Angeles County
High School of the Arts. But nobody outdanced L.A.'s irrepressible
Lula Washington Youth Dance Ensemble, who are not merely experienced
performers but dancing ambassadors as well. "I tell my kids to
communicate," said choreographer Tamica Washington (Lula's daughter).
"Get to know somebody new."</TE>
<TE>   Washington emphasized how important it can be for young dancers to
see lots of different styles, and even though traditional world dance
idioms were absent on Saturday, "New Perspectives" delivered. Jazz
dance vixens warmed up alongside demure ballerinas.</TE>
<TE>   Companies struggling to establish themselves (City Ballet of Los
Angeles) interacted with those looking for wider recognition (the
Orange County High School of the Arts). Besides those previously
listed, other participating groups included the Malibu Ballet and
Performing Arts Society, Retter's Academy of Dance in Agoura Hills
and the Rozann-Zimmermann Ballet Center in Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Brockus kept smiling, convinced that the future of
dance in Los Angeles is secure--as long as the rain doesn't fall, the
CD player does its job and somebody lines up at the box office
besides the dancers' blood relatives.</TE>

<DH>An Ambrose Bierce tale becomes a haunting musical question
in the new 'The Difficulty of Crossing a Field.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Swed</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>One summer morning in 1854, Mr. Williamson was sitting with his wife
and child on the verandah of their plantation in Selma, Ala.
Remembering that he had forgotten to tell his overseer something
about horses he had just bought from a neighbor, the planter got up,
threw down his cigar and plucked a flower as he walked over a gravel
path toward a field. Crossing the pasture, he disappeared. Poof! Just
like that, into thin air.</LD>
<LD>   That is about all there is to "The Difficulty of Crossing a
Field," a short story by Ambrose Bierce. The neighbor's son saw Mr.
Williamson vanish, but the neighbor--preoccupied with one of his
coach horses that had stumbled--didn't. Mrs. Williamson, we're told
in an aside, went mad as a result of the disappearance. Sam, a black
boy, was spooked. A magistrate determined that Mr. Williamson must be
dead and distributed his estate.</LD>
<LD>   This curious, insubstantial tale, written more than a century ago,
would have an astonishing resonance. In 1913, Bierce, a cranky San
Francisco newspaper columnist and author of "The Devil's Dictionary,"
took a trip to Mexico and was never heard from again. And now, "The
Difficulty of Crossing a Field" has become a curious but substantial
and shrewd opera.</LD>
<TE>   What is curious is not only the subject matter but also the
circumstances of the opera's creation, an unusual collaboration that
overcomes difficulties of crossing various domains. The producer is a
regional theater company, San Francisco's American Conservatory
Theater, which developed the project with composer David Lang (a
founder of Bang on a Can in New York); the New York experimental
playwright Mac Wellman; the Bay Area's Kronos Quartet; and
international opera star Julia Migenes. Remarkably, these unlikely
collaborators, all major figures in their separate fields, worked for
two years on the 75-minute opera, even though it was only given five
performances over the weekend in a 250-seat alternative space, the
Theater Artaud in the Mission district.</TE>
<TE>   Broadening Bierce's deadpan description of disappearance, Wellman
turned to another Bierce story, "The Moonlit Road," the inspiration
for the classic Japanese film "Rashomon." He subtitled his libretto
"A New Opera in Seven Tellings." The event is always the same, but
its effect on different characters is not.</TE>
<TE>   In inventive, wonderful language, with touches of Gertrude Stein,
Wellman begins to show us that perhaps the most real thing about Mr.
Williamson was his disappearance. It is not what exists or doesn't
exist that matters, but what we make of it.</TE>
<TE>   Was Mr. Williamson's last leisurely amble in the field a great
wonder, creation in reverse? Was it the work of the devil? Was it a
legal question to be resolved? Or is trying to find meaning in the
event meaningless? "What is the point ... ," a character called the
Williamson Girl sings again and again in an exorbitant aria. The
opera--which was staged on a simple set in an unfussy and effective
manner by ACT artistic director Carey Perloff (who initiated the
project)--is arrestingly fluid theater. At first, the period setting
seemed alarming, with representations of slaves that hearken back to
racist drama. But ultimately that only enhanced the fact that nothing
in this opera is what it seems.</TE>
<TE>   Lang's score for the Kronos moves slowly and atmospherically,
setting the stage for drama as well as reflecting it, with individual
instruments acting like additional characters in the drama. Near the
end of the work is a duet for Mrs. Williamson (Migenes) and a solo
violin (David Harrington). She sits on the roof and refuses to come
down until her husband returns. Her mind won't work as it should as
she goes over and over the disappearance, singing the same simple
three-note pattern, or a slight variation of it, a cappella.
Eventually the violin joins her, as if it is the missing man. It
plays in unison with her, accompanies her, echoes her, and finally
goes on alone, leaving her behind. There will be no resolution.</TE>
<TE>   This is but one of many exceptional moments in the work. Scenes
with the magistrate, the neighbor and the overseer are compelling
spoken drama. A small ensemble of slaves echoes different situations
with the perspicacity of a Greek chorus. The principal singers, Anika
Noni Rose (Virginia Creeper), Jacob Ming-Trent (Boy Sam) and Lianne
Marie Dobbs (the Williamson Girl) come from musical theater, not
opera, and they were captivating. Migenes may not have proved
credible in opera or operetta in her most recent appearances with Los
Angeles Opera, but clearly in L.A. she has been singing the wrong
things. Here she proved a spellbinding presence and singer.</TE>
<TE>   "The Difficulty of Crossing a Field" is a major contribution to
American musical theater. It is extraordinary to think that this
opera, which gets to the heart of the consequences of someone
suddenly vanishing from the face of the Earth, was conceived long
before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. Mr. Williamson did not
disappear without a trace; he changed those who couldn't get over the
episode. Likewise, this astonishing work, seen by only 1,250 people,
must not be allowed to vanish into thin air. I know I can't get it
out of my head.</TE>

<LD>When it comes to making "original" movies, Animal Planet apparently
has no plans to go poaching in HBO and Showtime territory.</LD>
<LD>   Leaving the edgy stuff to others, the animal channel launches its
Movie Week tonight with a warm and fuzzy updating of "Gentle Ben" (5
p.m., repeating at 7 and 9 p.m.), the 1960s TV series about a boy who
bonds with a friendly bear.</LD>
<LD>   What did you expect, "Cujo's Revenge"?</LD>
<TE>   When young Mark (Reiley McClendon) visits his forest ranger uncle,
Jack (Dean Cain), for a vacation at Heartbreak Bay, the trip turns
into an adventure. After learning of his parents' disappearance in a
plane crash, the heartsick Mark happens upon Ben the bear in an old
mine hole and saves him. But when coldhearted rancher Fog Benson
(Corbin Bernsen) suspects Ben of attacking his sheep and puts a
bounty on the bear, Mark must embark on a perilous journey to rescue
his pal again.</TE>
<TE>   Former TV Superman Cain makes a likable everyman, a nervous
bachelor who reluctantly becomes a surrogate father and rises to the
occasion. Bernsen, the slick Arnold Becker on "L.A. Law," is always
convincing in a conniving role.</TE>
<TE>   "Gentle Ben" won't fool anybody with its predictable plot, but
it's hard to argue with its benevolent message: Can't we get along
with other species?</TE>
<TE>   That theme continues Tuesday as Animal Planet airs the 1998 film
"Running Wild," starring Gregory Harrison as a single dad who moves
with his kids to Zimbabwe to become warden for an elephant
population. Naturally, the family learns that people are not always
what they seem--and can be more dangerous than animals in the wild.</TE>
<TE>   Animal Planet's Movie Week continues with "The Retrievers" on
Wednesday, "Bear With Me" on Thursday and more repeats of "Gentle
Ben" on Friday.</TE>

<LD>Re "Priest Scandal Could Set History in Motion," Commentary, March
21: James Pinkerton's understanding of the current crisis within the
Catholic Church, and indeed of the church itself, is so limited that
I will find it hard to take him seriously on other issues in the
future. That the church will suddenly change many of the doctrines
that it has defended through fire and blood for 2,000 years because a
vast minority of its priests have committed the sin and crime of
pedophilia is just plain silly.</LD>
<LD>   Those in the Catholic Church in America who wish to enjoy all of
the "reforms" that Pinkerton has predicted for it can easily enjoy
them today at their local Episcopal church, where some of the
ministers have sadly abandoned Christianity altogether.</LD>
<LD>   John Hearn</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pinkerton suggests that there will be major changes in the
American Catholic Church because of the scandal of pedophilia. He
errs, however, in his concept of how the church is organized. He
states that the American churches, schools and other institutions are
run from Rome. The bishop of each diocese has charge of the material
and financial matters in his diocese. It is the bishop who decides to
build or close schools, for example. In general, the pope and the
Vatican get involved only in questions of faith and morals.</TE>
<TE>   The real revolution, and it has started, will be when all bishops
accept the findings of psychology and other sciences and begin to
apply them intelligently to the people they serve.</TE>

<LD>Now that Congress has passed campaign finance reform it should outlaw

<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) is not Winston Churchill and campaign
finance reform is not World War II, but McCain has earned the title
of statesman. McCain's accomplishment in cultivating this successful
bipartisan reform measure and his courageous defiance in the face of
his own party's stubborn criticism are reminiscent of the great
Churchill's cross-party coalition government, which his own party
viewed as a defilement of the Conservative "nest" rather than an
achievement in national unity in May 1940.</TE>
<TE>   McCain's efforts will now force President Bush to sign this
reform, which he has called "unilateral disarmament," and then let's
all watch as conservative hypocrite Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)
takes it to court (March 22).</TE>

<LD>Re "'Insufficient Evidence' Ends Whitewater Case," March 21: I'm sure
I'm not the only one who was amazed, shocked and disgusted at your
placement of former President Clinton's exoneration in the Whitewater
case. After years of selling millions of papers with headlines
touting the lies and innuendoes on all these "Clintongates," which
any intelligent American knew was so much Republican sewage-spin run
amok, you'd think you would have the class, if not the conscience, to
run the truth that $70 million was wasted on an innocent man
somewhere a bit more visible than Page 16. Whitewater was front-page
news when it was lies; funny where you decide to put it when the
truth comes out.</LD>
<LD>   If any good comes from this horrific journalistic slight, it is
that maybe now the jackbooted parade of right-wing reactionaries
screaming "liberal press" will shut up.</LD>

<HD>Verdict in Mauling Case Won't Solve the Problem</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Couple Guilty in Fatal Dog Mauling," March 22: I'm stunned by the
verdict. Marjorie Knoller is now a murderer and deserves to be locked
up, possibly for life, because she should have known her pets were
dangerous? I thought we locked people up to protect society. If she
were to have been acquitted, somehow, I don't think going out and
getting a brand-new puppy would have been the first thing on her
mind. If we are to sincerely believe the jurors made the right
decision, I only hope that every parent who has a child who kills
someone is also locked up for 15 years to life. After all, the only
determining factor is that the parent should have known his or her
kid was dangerous.</LD>
<LD>   Since that will never happen, how could this not smack of being a
vindictive, punishing prosecution? The jurors from Los Angeles never
cease to amaze me. I hope everyone is sleeping well over this one.</LD>

<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kudos to jurors in the dog mauling case against Knoller and Robert
Noel; their guilty verdict has struck a blow for common sense and
personal responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most astonishing in the defense's bizarre case was the
claim that Knoller and Noel didn't know their dogs were dangerous
because officialdom hadn't so notified them. If I watched my teenage
son pour gasoline on a neighbor's car and light it on fire, I
wouldn't require a phone call from Children's Services to recognize
that his behavior was unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine the precedent this verdict could set. Perhaps someday we,
as a society, will assume responsibility for our own actions, as well
as our pets'.</TE>
<TE>   Lila Campuzano</TE>
<TE>   Canyon Country</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dog expert Matthew Margolis is correct in his conclusion that it
is "not likely" that the guilty verdicts in the dog mauling trial
will "solve the problem of death or injury by dog in the future," as
long as we rely on the small percentage of irresponsible dog owners
for any remedial action (Commentary, March 22). Irresponsible owners
of aggressive dogs cannot be trusted to manage these time bombs, so
it is up to the community to impose controls for our own protection.</TE>
<TE>   Now is the time for strong legislation with real teeth in it, so
to speak, to restrict ownership of aggressive breeds to those without
criminal backgrounds who complete mandatory training and
certification and who have adequate facilities, resources and
insurance. And penalties for violation should be tough enough to
ensure that it is the violators, not members of the innocent public,
who face the consequences of irresponsible ownership of aggressive
breeds.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Dunn</TE>
<TE>   Oceanside</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The recent dog mauling case makes it imperative for the state
Legislature to consider outlawing the keeping or breeding of certain
dogs. Pit bulls and Presa Canarios are being bred together for the
purpose of sport fighting. The more vicious of the animals live
longer and are therefore allowed to breed.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that each generation of fighting dogs gets more
vicious and unpredictable. Where does it end? As it stands now, if
you go out walking in any urban area you have to carry pepper spray
and a heavy walking stick, just to be on the safe side.</TE>
<TE>   Something has to be done.</TE>
<TE>   Carl W. Goss</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The overlooked guilty party is the breeder. Even an attack dog can
and should be trained to stop on the command of the owner. My
grandfather's German shepherd, a watchdog for his two stores, was so
gentle that he taught me to walk, my little hand on his collar. The
dog could be trusted absolutely, even with our frequent guests. This
verdict should remind every buyer of a purebred dog to carefully
check the animal's ancestry. Inbreeding by unscrupulous breeders
leads to inferior dogs that have lost the natural instincts on which
the dog/human relationship is based.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Calling In Bad Teen Drivers," March 19: Just as parents are
concerned about their own teenagers' driving habits, everyone should
be concerned that all drivers drive well.</LD>
<LD>   My friends started a Web site, http://RoadwatchUSA.com, where
people can anonymously report a driver's bumper sticker number and
give that person, his or her parents or other interested parties
(like insurance companies, the legal system, etc.) useful feedback
about his or her driving. Their herculean effort was met with only a
lukewarm response.</LD>
<LD>   This "scarlet letter" of a bumper sticker would really help
highlight the people other drivers should be careful of while out on
the road. Appropriate vehicles to label include anyone with a medical
problem that might affect their driving, people with traffic
convictions whom the traffic judge deems should be monitored and new
drivers during their break-in period.</LD>
<TE>   Until a driver can demonstrate driving responsibly rather than
hurtling a 2,000-pound blunt object down the road, such a bumper
sticker could be a useful requirement. Remember, driving is neither a
freedom nor a right, just a privilege with responsibility that the
driver must take very seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Julius Woythaler</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Concerned parents actually care about their child's driving? As a
social worker in Los Angeles, I am repeatedly disappointed by parents
of clients who do not know their children's peer groups, or at times
even whereabouts, let alone care about their driving habits. I can
only hope that more parents will take Bill Durney's lead and become
what the title dictates: parent.</TE>
<TE>   I have only one question. Can parents start making their teens
wear those signs on their person at all times? I would love to know
how to reach the parents of the kids in my neighborhood whom I see
littering, cursing, using drugs and vandalizing public property. What
is that number?</TE>

<HD>Bush Policy Vows More Than Marriage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Henry Briggs' March 6 letter implies that the Bush administration
views marriage as the be-all and end-all solution to the woes of
poverty. This is far from the truth. We believe in a multifaceted
approach to helping people achieve economic independence and be good
parents. One component of our approach is to make it easier for those
who choose marriage to have access to services that will allow them
to determine if they are ready for marriage and, if so, to sustain
healthy relationships and practice responsible parenting.</LD>
<LD>   We would never advocate marriage at all costs, especially between
people who are abusive to each other, immature or otherwise unready
to face the challenges of marriage. Nor would we penalize anyone for
not getting married. Our 2003 budget proposal includes $300 million
to fund research to explore what kinds of programs are effective in
helping people form healthy families. We are trying to enrich the
knowledge base about successful marriage programs so that all states
have the most current information and people who are contemplating
marriage or are in the midst of a troubled marriage can get the best
help.</LD>
<LD>   The ultimate beneficiaries of this policy are America's children.
It is their future that informs all of our positions.</LD>

<LD>Re "Stars, Stripes &amp; Gas Guzzlers," editorial, March 18: Instead of
bemoaning the fact that millions of people vote with their wallets
and choose to drive pickup trucks and SUVs, perhaps you should use
your resources and list all senators and all vehicles registered to
them and to their families. I suspect that in many, if not most,
cases, the senators want us to do as they say, not as they do.</LD>

<HD>With 30 Performers and 120 Thundering Hoofs, Life's a
Circus</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Key is precision for riders, horses and crew
alike while mounting 'Cheval' in Orange County.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seated before a mirror illuminated by dozens of lights, the hands of
"Cheval" performer Caroline Mace are a blur as they grab lipstick
pencil, then blush, then eye makeup.</LD>
<LD>   After nearly 200 shows, Mace knows the routine. Cheeks, medium
peach. Lips, crayon brown. If she forgets, it's written on a custom
makeup guide.</LD>
<LD>   "If my makeup is too light or too dark, it doesn't look right
under the lights in the big top," she said. "Recently, my hair was so
curly that under the lights, it made me look like I had a cone head.
So my hair was changed and makeup added, to give me more of a
forehead."</LD>
<TE>   It doesn't matter that this is an equestrian show with plenty of
action. Detail is the name of the game for the producer, Gilles
Ste-Croix, who created the Canadian show of 30 horses and 30
performers.</TE>
<TE>   "Cheval," which means "horse" in French, runs through April 21 at
the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa Mesa.</TE>
<TE>   Mace, 30, is from Montreal. She is a former gymnast and stuntwoman
who signed with the show a year ago. "Cheval," patterned in many
respects after Cirque du Soleil, the fanciful French Canadian circus
for which Ste-Croix served as artistic director, is on a 19-city U.S.
tour through 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Mace is a 5-foot-2-inch dynamo who barely weighs 110 pounds, but
during performances she takes command of a 1,000-pound-plus horse
named Opus, a Clydesdale mix.</TE>
<TE>   Originally used for dressage, Opus had a steady gait and other
qualities of a draft horse that the show's owners found useful. He
was retrained for his performances in "Cheval."</TE>
<TE>   "Usually, when a human jumps or falls off a horse, the horse
stops," Mace said. "With Opus, he had to learn to keep going, and at
the same speed."</TE>
<TE>   Mace, who's listed in the show as a vaulter, synchronizes her act
to the horse's movements. "It's all about trust," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mace had never worked with horses before joining the show. She
quickly learned to understand arena work and how centrifugal force
act on a moving platform such as the horse's rump.</TE>
<TE>   And, when working with animals, there are no guarantees. "Once I
was upside-down and some men started to do maintenance on the roof
without telling anyone," she said. "The horse heard them banging
around up above and came unglued."</TE>
<TE>   She escaped injury that time, but injuries are common when working
with such powerful animals.</TE>
<TE>   Performers with the traveling show live in trailers or nearby
apartments.</TE>
<TE>   Christine Burelle, spokeswoman for "Cheval," said local people are
hired to work the stables, the box office, concessions and
maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   Before each show, assistant designer Marie Claude is busy in one
of the tents, taking care of costumes--a job that requires patience.</TE>
<TE>   "Repair, these costumes always need repair," Claude said. "The
artists, they get new muscles, they gain weight, they lose weight.
Costumes rip."</TE>
<TE>   The costumes are a riot of color: maroons, coppers and oranges
sewn with patches of velvet and leather. With the many costume
changes, repairs must be quick for the next night's performance.</TE>
<TE>   Far from the glamour of the big top, there's a work force the
audience never sees.</TE>
<TE>   For Jenny Ramirez of Santa Ana, the job came with specific
instructions: "Just a reminder," states a note Ramirez keeps in front
of her work station. "Wash the men's white collars by hand with the
Fiesta soap, then place them on top of the refrigerator. Everything
else can be washed with Tide."</TE>
<TE>   Mace said living out of a suitcase suits her. It keeps her
motivated, and with the tour in California, closer to her other
passion: surfing.</TE>
<TE>   "I have two surfboards and a thick wetsuit because in Canada the
water gets really cold," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She took up the sport six years ago during a trip to Costa Rica,
where someone dared her to stand up on a board. "On my first day, I
stood up. I haven't been the same since. That started it all."</TE>
<TE>   Now, she tries to surf every day wherever she is, from the balmy
shores of San Diego to the freezing waters of the Atlantic Coast.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole reason I'm working is to save enough money to someday
buy a house near the ocean," she said.</TE>

<HD>Eileen Farrell, 82; Crossover Soprano Succeeded in Opera,
Pop</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON THURBER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eileen Farrell, one of the few dramatic sopranos in American music to
forge important careers in both opera and popular music, has died.
She was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Farrell died Saturday at a nursing home in Park Ridge, N.J. The
cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   A self-effacing woman who married a New York City police detective
and for much of her life lived in a house on Staten Island, Farrell
once said she "would have made a lousy diva." She preferred home and
family to the conflicting pressures of her career. Colleagues said
she wanted to make music with people she respected and backed away
from the pressure of career building. Nevertheless, she was a fixture
on radio and television and in concert halls and recording studios
for several decades.</LD>
<TE>   The daughter of former vaudeville performers, Farrell was born in
Willimantic, Conn. She began taking art courses after graduating from
high school, but soon quit in favor of music. She moved to New York
City and began intensive vocal training with Merle Alcock, a former
Metropolitan Opera contralto, and later noted opera coach Eleanor
McLellan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, she auditioned for the "Major Bowes Original Amateur
Hour," a popular radio program of the day, but was told that she
didn't have the talent required.</TE>
<TE>   Disappointed but not deterred, Farrell, then 20, was soon signed
by CBS and made a member of the network's radio choruses and
ensembles. After performing well in a network program of Stephen
Foster melodies, she was given her own radio show, "Eileen Farrell
Sings," in which she performed everything from operatic arias to
American popular favorites.</TE>
<TE>   And although radio was the medium of the day, her career took an
important turn in 1947-48 when she made her first extensive U.S.
concert tour as a recitalist. A year later she made a well-received
tour of South America.</TE>
<TE>   After a recital appearance in Carnegie Hall in October 1950, she
was called one of the most important concert stars since the end of
World War II. She was still in her 20s. That same year, she first
appeared on American television, making her debut on "The Milton
Berle Show."</TE>
<TE>   She also began working as a soloist with important orchestras,
including the New York Philharmonic conducted by Leonard Bernstein.
In the 1950-51 season, she made 61 appearances with the Philharmonic,
a record number of performances at the time.</TE>
<TE>   Through the '50s, she appeared with great conductors including
Arturo Toscanini, who chose her to solo in a performance of
Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 ("Choral") broadcast over NBC.</TE>
<TE>   She dubbed the soundtrack for the Oscar-winning 1955 film,
"Interrupted Melody," which chronicles the life of Australian soprano
Marjorie Lawrence, who was struck down by polio at the height of her
career. Although Farrell's performance was not in the film's credits,
audiences quickly demanded to know the identity of the voice.</TE>
<TE>   Farrell had been singing for 15 years before she made her first
featured appearance in a complete operatic work. And although it was
a concert version, not a staged performance of Cherubini's "Medea" by
the American Operatic Society in New York's Town Hall in 1955, she
received lavish critical praise.</TE>
<TE>   In her autobiography, "Can't Help Singing: The Life of Eileen
Farrell," written with Brian Kellow, she says she didn't start
singing opera until mid-career because "the stage direction,
lighting, costumes and cues all sounded like too much trouble--and I
didn't think I had the figure for the opera stage."</TE>
<TE>   But after her Town Hall success, she turned to an operatic
performance in a full production with a small company in Tampa, Fla.
In 1956, she made her first appearance with a major company, the San
Francisco Opera.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, she debuted with the Metropolitan Opera in
Gluck's "Alceste." In 1962, she opened the Met season as Maddalena in
Giordano's "Andrea Chenier," with Robert Merrill. But Farrell was not
popular with the Met's general manager, Rudolf Bing.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers felt that Bing's problem with Farrell had more to
do with her exposure on popular mediums and her diverse musical
interests than with her actual singing ability.</TE>
<TE>   "Eileen Farrell, a great powerhouse of a soprano, was also a real
American, a brave singer who helped break down the snobbish barriers
between high and low when doing so could ruin an operatic career,"
said Times music critic Mark Swed.</TE>
<TE>   In five seasons with the Met, she sang six roles in 45
performances. Her performances were generally well received, but her
contract was not renewed when the Met moved to Lincoln Center in
1966.</TE>
<TE>   By then, she was well established in a broad spectrum of
venues--radio, television, recordings and concerts--and had been
making good money as one of the first cross-over artists in the
American music business.</TE>
<TE>   Her initial success in pop music came somewhat by accident.</TE>
<TE>   After performing Verdi at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1959,
Farrell was asked to fill in for Louis Armstrong when the great jazz
artist was felled with pneumonia before a television performance. She
sang some ballads and blues numbers with Armstrong's band and became
something of an overnight pop star.</TE>
<TE>   Her first pop album, "I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues," was one
of the first crossover albums and made the pop music charts. She
continued making well-received albums of standards from the Great
American Songbook by such composers as Harold Arlen, Alec Wilder and
Johnny Mercer over the next 35 years.</TE>
<TE>   Legendary soprano Beverly Sills observed that Farrell succeeded in
pop because she understood the idiom better than most opera singers.
"Opera is a very strict art," Sills told the New York Times some
years ago, "and to sing popular music in the same disciplined manner
makes it sound stuffy. For Eileen, pop music is another art form
entirely. It works for her not only because she uses a whole
different technique, but because she loves the music and is having
the time of her life doing it."</TE>
<TE>   Farrell, who later taught at Indiana University, set her own
priorities as she charted her career.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just an ordinary person, a married lady with children, and
I sang," she told the Associated Press in an interview. "Maybe I
could have done more singing if I'd taken off time from my family,
but I wouldn't have enjoyed my family. I had some wonderful times.
I'm very thankful."</TE>
<TE>   Her husband died in 1986. She is survived by her children, Robert
and Kathleen, and a brother.</TE>

<HD>They'd Like Registry to Be History</HD>
<DH>Heritage: Santa Ana won't delist vintage house, to owners'
dismay. Family wants to preserve it without help.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY HICKS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two-story Santa Ana house with the white picket fence and the
lavish king palms dotting the front yard has been in the Scott family
for 54 years.</LD>
<LD>   Built in 1911 and once owned by one of the city's pioneer
families, the house on North Broadway is considered a key property on
the city's historic registry.</LD>
<LD>   But the fact that the family home had landed on the city's
registry was unknown to the Scott family until they tried to get a
new roof. And now, three years later, they have learned another
lesson: There's little chance of getting off the list.</LD>
<TE>   "They've taken our property away from us, is what they've done,"
said James Scott of Paradise, Calif., one of three brothers who now
owns the house. Although some cities ask owners if they would like
their property listed on an historic registry, Santa Ana does not.</TE>
<TE>   City officials survey properties with historic value and send
notices to the owners. If the owners object, they can make their case
before the city's Historic Resources Commission. The commission--and
ultimately the City Council--decides the homes' fate.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Scott brothers, the commission and the council
last week rejected their request to pull the house from the registry,
meaning the brothers must submit plans for major home improvements to
a committee. That group decides if the desired alterations are in
line with standards for preserving the historic integrity of the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only way we have to preserve our dwindling number of
historic homes," said Councilwoman Lisa Bist, who led the council's
5-0 vote against the Scott brothers.</TE>
<TE>   "You may be great owners, but what happens when you sell the
property to someone else?"</TE>
<TE>   The Scotts' parents, now deceased, bought the house in 1948. Their
father planted the king palms. Once residential, the 1300 block of
Broadway where the house is located now has a mix of uses. The Scott
property is sandwiched between a law office and a church. The
brothers rent out the home, but want to keep it in the family.</TE>
<TE>   The house was cited by the city in the 1980s as an historic
property, both for cultural and architectural reasons. It was one of
the early Craftsman houses, and its first owner, James Weisman, was
one of the city's leading businessmen. Since the Historic Resources
Commission was created five years ago, more than 250 properties have
been listed on its registry. The brothers' property was among a
handful given the status of "key" historic properties, making it even
more unlikely that officials would take it off the registry.</TE>
<TE>   City officials concede the Scotts have some grounds for complaint.</TE>
<TE>   The notice telling the brothers that their house had been added to
the list was inadvertently sent to a property they no longer own and
was never forwarded.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers discovered the historic designation three years ago
when Ferris Scott, who lives in Laguna Beach, asked for a city permit
for a new roof for the home. He was told to submit samples of roofing
material to a city preservation committee.</TE>
<TE>   That's when the brothers began fighting to have their house taken
off the list.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Ann Kings, chairwoman of the Historic Resources Commission,
said she is sympathetic to the Scotts. "We didn't handle that very
well," she said. "When the Scotts brought their objection to us, we
didn't really have a process in place for handling their complaint.
They've sort of become our guinea pigs."</TE>
<TE>   Only one other property owner has objected to being on the city's
registry, and that was a church. Its request was approved.</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Beach gives homeowners a choice, as do other cities. In
Laguna Beach, more than half those invited to be on its registry
readily agreed. Most cities--Santa Ana included--offer the owners of
these designated homes some tax breaks, low-interest loans and other
incentives.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, only two requests to de-register were made in
Laguna Beach. Those were granted, said John Montgomery, a city
community development planner, on condition the owners returned any
fees that had been waived because of their historic registry status.</TE>
<TE>   In Fullerton, property owners are not forced onto the registry.
But Bob Linnell, a city planner, said the city has had difficulty
convincing many homeowners to agree to have their homes put on the
list. There are 170 properties designated as historic, but fewer than
half of the owners have agreed to registry status, Linnell said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a perception among many of them that their property
values will go down," Linnell said. "We're convinced just the
opposite is true."</TE>
<TE>   In Anaheim, residents are not given a choice. More than 1,100
homes are registered as part of an historic "colony district" inside
the city's original borders. But Phyllis Mueller, the city's
neighborhood development coordinator, said not only have there been
no official complaints, residents are enthusiastic about
participating. "They have block parties and help each other with
their homes," she said. "They see it as a status symbol, one that
adds value to their property."</TE>
<TE>   In a few instances, she said, her office has had to suggest to
homeowners that they were proposing the wrong kind of building
material for upgrading their property.</TE>
<TE>   But the neighborhood office's policy is "advise and educate." It
doesn't force anything on a resident, though it does make its views
known to city officials who have final say on property alterations.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller pointed out that preservationists have a powerful ally on
their side--California's courts.</TE>
<TE>   In a case decided last year, the state Supreme Court barred Sierra
Madre from removing 29 properties from a list of historic properties
through a ballot measure. That case, Mueller said, will make it less
likely that cities will be sympathetic to homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers agree with the preservationists that the home they
own is historic; they are adamant about preserving it. They simply
don't like a committee telling them how to do it.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes against the fundamental American rights of the property
owner," said Al Scott, who lives in Palm Springs.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the Big Brother approach."</TE>
<TE>   But Kings of the Historic Resources Commission said the Scotts may
come to recognize the value of the registry.</TE>
<TE>   "We lost a lot of homes along Broadway before we began this
registry process," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "To ever lose that house, where the Scotts were raised, that would
be a loss to all of us."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Betty J. Korfhage, 76, who for years made the garland of roses for
the Kentucky Derby winner, died Friday of cancer in Louisville, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   Korfhage was a fourth-generation owner of the Kingsley Walker
Florist shop that crafted the derby garland for more than 50 years.</LD>
<LD>   Churchill Downs first commissioned Kingsley Walker Florist in 1932
to produce the garland, awarded to Burgoo King that year.</LD>
<TE>   Korfhage took over crafting the roses in 1974 when her mother,
Grace Walker, retired.</TE>
<TE>   Korfhage was the great-granddaughter of the Rev. Francis Walker,
who founded his floral business in Madison, Ind., in 1869. The
company was one of the oldest family operations in Louisville before
it was sold in 1984 when Betty Korfhage retired.</TE>

<HD>W. Scholl, 81; Designer of Faddish Dr. Scholl's Sandal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Scholl, who made foot care fashionable during the 1960s and
'70s with a contoured wood sandal designed to exercise the muscles,
has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Scholl died March 15 from a rare form of pneumonia at a hospice in
Douglas on the Isle of Man, an island off the northwest coast of
England, said his wife, Susan.</LD>
<LD>   His "Original Exercise Sandal"--known as Dr. Scholl's, the name of
his family's foot-care company--was popular for nearly two decades,
worn by millions of women worldwide.</LD>
<TE>   An orthopedic specialist, Scholl brought a simple wood sandal from
Germany in the late 1950s, carved it to fit the foot, added a leather
strap across the toes, and sold it in the United States with the
slogan: "Looking good and doing you good."</TE>
<TE>   The sandal--still being produced and sold--was designed to
exercise the feet and legs, toning muscles and ostensibly preventing
podiatric ailments. The touted health benefits, the sassy clip-clop
sound, and the simplicity of the style charmed the hippie generation.</TE>
<TE>   "The miniskirt was in and the sandal just appealed to them," Susan
Scholl said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in London on Sept. 24, 1920, Scholl was the third son of
Frank Scholl, an American of German descent.</TE>
<TE>   He majored in modern languages at Cambridge University. Traveling
in America at the outset of World War II, Scholl was unable to get
back to Britain, so he joined the U.S. Army. He used his language
skills as an intelligence officer, interrogating German and Japanese
prisoners of war.</TE>
<TE>   He then returned to the family shoe business begun by his uncle,
an American physician who began selling podiatrists' equipment in
1906.</TE>
<TE>   William Scholl took Dr. Scholl's public in 1971, and it became a
brand of Schering-Plough Health Care Products in 1979. He became
president of Schering-Plough's international consumer products
division and worked for the company until his retirement in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   In his retirement years, he ran the Dr. Scholl Foundation, a
charitable body that has given about $200 million to various causes.</TE>
<TE>   He also maintained an active physical lifestyle, learning to
windsurf as he turned 65 and skiing well into his 70s.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife and their daughter, Lucy Jane; and by
the five children from his first marriage, Michael, Paul, Peter, Tony
and Mary.</TE>

<HD>Talent Pool Worries Silicon Valley Businesses</HD>
<DH>Technology: Fewer young people in the area say they are
planning to take the jobs that will be open, a survey shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN ALEXANDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>PALO ALTO.</DL>
<LD>PALO ALTO--High school senior Max Butin watched the technology bubble
burst from his after-school job at a pizza parlor in Silicon Valley.
Suddenly, he noticed, nobody was ordering toppings.</LD>
<LD>   Then his mother, a recruiter for high-tech companies, found
herself out of work, and the sputtering economy hit home. But Butin,
18, said that the whirlwind cycle of boom and bust that marked his
teenage years has not deterred him from wanting to be an automotive
design engineer.</LD>
<LD>   He gathered on a recent afternoon with other committed technology
students in the robotics lab of Palo Alto Senior High School, where
they meet after class to build robots for a national competition in
Florida.</LD>
<TE>   Now that the hype is gone, "Only the people who are really
interested in it do it," Butin said. "I've always been interested in
engineering."</TE>
<TE>   Home-Grown Talent Needed</TE>
<TE>   Businesses in Silicon Valley view the situation with concern.
Their future prosperity depends to a strong degree on developing a
larger pool of home-grown technical talent, and a recent study shows
that not nearly enough young people in the area say they are
interested in going into technical jobs to meet the expected demands
of the region's labor market.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the layoffs started to mount in Silicon Valley,
two-thirds of students here said they did not plan to pursue
technology or computer-related careers, according to a regional
survey of 2,500 students in grades eight and 11 published this month
by the Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network and the consulting firm
A.T. Kearney. In the survey, conducted in late 2000, 39% of students
polled said high-tech careers are uninteresting, and 25%
characterized the jobs as intimidating.</TE>
<TE>   Girls Even Less Interested</TE>
<TE>   Girls' interest in high-tech jobs was even less. Only 23% of
females said they wanted to pursue such careers, while 42% of boys
expressed interest in technology jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "About two years ago, almost every kid you talked to wanted to be
a computer engineer of one kind or another," recalls Nina Denton, a
career guidance counselor at Carlmont High School in Belmont, which
is about halfway between San Francisco and Palo Alto. "Now there's a
much wider variety of interests."</TE>
<TE>   For businesses, students' attitude toward technology is
troubling--and costly.</TE>
<TE>   According to the study, the so-called "work force gap" made up
almost 40% of the technology sector's labor demand during the late
1990s. The gap measures unfilled positions, workers who were actively
recruited from outside the Bay Area, and employees who commute to
their jobs from outside Silicon Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the economic downturn, the survey claims that the
workforce gap amounts to 25% of the labor market demand.</TE>
<TE>   Recruiting high-tech workers from outside the area costs Silicon
Valley businesses an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion annually in
hiring expenses, decreased productivity, delays, lost sales, salary
premiums and turnover costs, according to the study. During the boom,
these costs were estimated as high as $6 billion to $7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's critical that we have enough technologists who are highly
trained, who can come in and understand our business. Even our legal
department needs to be able to understand technology," said Dierdre
Hanford, senior vice president of business and market development for
Synopsys, a 3,000-person company based in Mountain View that makes
design automation products used to create microchips and electronics
systems.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't just keep displacing people and importing talent from
elsewhere," said Hanford, who was an advisor on the study.</TE>
<TE>   Educators worry as well that a lack of interest in high-technology
is but one symptom of a greater problem in math and science learning,
particularly among minority and lower-income students.</TE>
<TE>   The survey found that Latino students were less likely to have
access to computers at home, and were less aware of high-tech careers
than their counterparts from other racial groups. Although 61% of
Latino students said they had some understanding of two or more
high-technology jobs, the numbers were 76% among white students, 79%
among Asian students, and 80% among African Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Aceves, superintendent of the Franklin-McKinley School
District in the predominantly minority neighborhoods of East San
Jose, said a great many of the students in his district are recent
arrivals from other countries. "A lot of their parents are not well
educated. Getting them to picture themselves in those roles is not
easy," said Aceves, who also contributed to the study.</TE>
<TE>   "My first concern is I want the kids to be proficient in math
because those are the keys to the kingdom. If you can't get through
algebra and into higher math, you're not going to get through the
university system," Aceves said.</TE>
<TE>   At Palo Alto High's robotics lab, the technology bubble's bursting
has had a tangible impact. The club's chief sponsor, Compaq
Computer Corp., was only able to offer the group 20% of the financial
support it had given in previous years. The club turned to individual
donors to try to make up the shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Tracy Becker, a 17-year-old senior who plans to study
electrical engineering in college, said she doesn't care that
technology has lost some of its glamour. "I guess going into
technology seems riskier to me than it used to, but if that was
something I wanted to do, it wouldn't stop me. As long as you have
skills you will be in demand," she said.</TE>

<HD>School Fight Blocks Reuse of Tustin Base</HD>
<DH>Development: The Navy approved the city's plan for the
closed Marine facility, but a deal with Santa Ana Unified must be
worked out next.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A nagging impasse over construction of schools on the closed Tustin
Marine base continues to block a redevelopment plan approved last
month by the Navy.</LD>
<LD>   The sticking point is whether the Santa Ana Unified School
District will build on 22 acres of base land offered by Tustin, or
whether the district will fall back on a state law signed by Gov.
Gray Davis that requires it to receive 100 acres before Tustin can
develop the land.</LD>
<LD>   Both sides accused the other of foot-dragging last week, even as a
settlement proposal was faxed to Washington for reaction from the
Navy, which owns the property but eventually will give most of it to
Tustin.</LD>
<TE>   "We have reached a snag on issues on the table, [but] we're still
discussing,"' Tustin City Manager William A. Huston said. "We're at
that point to make a decision. If we've got to litigate for the next
five years, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Huston said the city will wait 30 more days to see if a deal can
be sealed, then will let the debate shift to state and federal
courts.</TE>
<TE>   The schools' attorney, Edmond M. Connor, said the district has
"given up as much as we're going to give up." About 160 acres of the
base lies within the district's boundaries.</TE>
<TE>   "If people were motivated to get it done, I see this happening
really quick," Connor said of a deal, which both sides have wrangled
over for a year.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing has happened quickly at the Tustin helicopter base since
it was targeted for closure in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Unified and Rancho Santiago Community College District
in Santa Ana were among five school districts for which land was
earmarked in a 1994 redevelopment plan. That plan was shelved by the
city and replaced with a new one that gave land to the Tustin and
Irvine school districts, as well as to the South Orange County
Community College District. City officials argued that they couldn't
pay for improvements needed on the base if they turned over so many
acres to Santa Ana--land envisioned for a commercial center.</TE>
<TE>   What followed was eight years of fighting among the parties,
including two state lawsuits, two federal lawsuits and the state
legislation, which blocks Tustin from developing the land unless a
deal with Santa Ana Unified is reached.</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Santiago settled its differences with Tustin this month and
will get 15 acres. The Santa Ana Unified board voted last week to
begin a process that could lead to condemnation of its state-ordered
100 acres. Under that scenario, the district would have to buy the
property for fair-market value.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Navy officials issued an ultimatum to Tustin to reach
agreement with the districts or see the federal government sell the
base to developers. Navy officials flew to Orange County; after three
days of talks, they approved giving most of the base to Tustin,
regardless of the impasse with Santa Ana. The Navy will keep 240
acres to sell, with the proceeds to help cover the estimated
$1-billion cost of closing the Tustin base and the El Toro Marine
Corps Air Station.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining holdup with Tustin centers on what happens if soil
contamination prevents Santa Ana Unified from building on the 22
acres offered. Tustin would also give the district $38 million to buy
property in Santa Ana for a high school, but it would not be enough
to buy a high school and another school site if the base land can't
be used.</TE>
<TE>   So far, neither side knows whether the acreage is suitable for a
school site, which must meet stringent rules enforced by the state
Department of Toxic Substances Control. The 22 acres, on base land
that lies outside the district's boundaries, could be contaminated,
district officials have said. The land within district boundaries has
already been certified as free of contamination.</TE>
<TE>   The school district wants guarantees that if it cannot build on
the smaller parcel, it will get either land elsewhere--a longshot,
because no other property on the base is available--or more cash.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for Tustin and Santa Ana Unified will be in state court
April 4 to address a lawsuit filed by Tustin. The city wants a judge
to bless its approval of a homeless housing project to be operated by
the Orange County Rescue Mission. Huston said the project is exempted
from the state law aiding Santa Ana and can be developed without
delay.</TE>
<TE>   A May 22 hearing is scheduled for the state suit filed by Santa
Ana Unified over Tustin's failure to turn over the land authorized by
the Legislature. A status conference will be held June 3 on the third
suit--federal litigation filed by Santa Ana Unified charging that
Tustin's plan violates the civil rights of minority students. There
is no hearing set for the other federal lawsuit filed by Tustin,
which challenges the state's authority to intervene in how base land
is distributed.</TE>
<TE>   "[Tustin's] boat is moving in closer to the rock," Connor said of
the impending court cases. "If that's what they want to do, that's
fine."</TE>

<LD>Ventura activist Alice McGrath, who served on the legal defense
committee in the infamous Sleepy Lagoon trial in Los Angeles, will
speak at 2 p.m. Saturday at the Oxnard Public Library.</LD>
<LD>   McGrath, who was executive secretary of the defense committee,
will discuss her involvement in the case that gained notoriety as one
of the most racist in California history.</LD>
<LD>   In the 1943 case, an all-white jury convicted 17 Latino youths in
the beating death of a young Mexican national. The convictions were
later overturned by a judge, who cited a lack of evidence and found
that the defendants were denied full access to attorneys.</LD>
<TE>   McGrath continues to work to obtain legal counsel for the poor and
still heads Nicaraguan relief efforts.</TE>

<HD>Moorpark Wins State Academic Title</HD>
<DH>Decathlon: Ventura County school beats defending
titleholder El Camino Real of Woodland Hills. Next: national
competition to be held in Phoenix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a competition that eventually came down to two Southern California
powerhouses, Moorpark High School of Ventura County defeated
defending national champion El Camino Real High School of Woodland
Hills at the California Academic Decathlon on Sunday in Modesto.</LD>
<LD>   The winner was announced after two days of competition among 51
schools.</LD>
<LD>   Moorpark will now go to the U.S. Academic Decathlon, held in
Phoenix next month.</LD>
<TE>   "Even if we didn't win, this all would have been worth it," said
Moorpark's Andy Song. "This is the icing on the cake."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark coach Larry Jones has represented Ventura County at the
state competition seven years, and has won twice. The last victory
was in 1999, when his team won its first and only national title.
This year, his son, Nathaniel Jones, is on the team.</TE>
<TE>   "This [win] is much sweeter," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   While Moorpark students cheered, competitors from El Camino
displayed the strain of months of intense study.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting with heads bowed, some held hands, while others prayed.</TE>
<TE>   "I did the best I could," said Ketti Augusztiny, El Camino's
leading scorer. "It's the most the team could do. [Moorpark] is the
better team."</TE>
<TE>   Coaches Melinda Owen and Chris Cerone led El Camino to the
national title last year in Alaska.</TE>
<TE>   They said the second place finish Sunday took nothing away from
the school's legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really hard to go twice in a row," Owen said. "Moorpark is a
great team with a great coach."</TE>
<TE>   Moorpark scored 48,603.3 points to El Camino's 47,730. Third place
went to Edison of Fresno County.</TE>
<TE>   The remainder of the top 10 high schools: North Hollywood,
Palisades Charter, Marina of Huntington Beach, Los Angeles, Bishop
Alemany, Casa Grande of Sonoma County, and Hemet of Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Grande will also go to the national competition because it
won the Division II title for smaller schools.</TE>
<TE>   The decathlon's ending ceremony came amid controversy over the
quality of testing material provided by the U.S. Academic Decathlon,
the association that holds the events and provides the questions.</TE>
<TE>   Petition Calls for Higher Standards for Questions</TE>
<TE>   A petition signed by Moorpark's Jones and a number of coaches
called for higher standards and criticized the USAD for its
"incompetent ability to put together accurate and fair competition
tests."</TE>
<TE>   Among the other schools whose coaches signed the petition were El
Camino, North Hollywood, Edison, Garfield, Venice and Casa Grande.</TE>
<TE>   First-year California Academic Decathlon Executive Director Marvin
Cobb would not comment on the petition.</TE>
<TE>   He also faced criticism for a faulty essay question. "When you
have hundreds of questions being written by dozens of educators ...
not every question is going to be perfect," Cobb said.</TE>

<HD>Clerics Take 2 Approaches to Clergy Scandal</HD>
<DH>Religion: Orange County's Bishop Brown tackles the
molestation issue from the pulpit. L.A.'s Cardinal Mahony makes no
statement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE HANLEY and RICHARD WINTON</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a candid Palm Sunday sermon, Bishop of Orange Tod D. Brown said it
is especially important during Easter week for the Catholic Church to
accept responsibility for "terrible, terrible crimes" committed by
priests against children and to seek forgiveness for wayward
clergymen.</LD>
<LD>   While Brown's remarks at an Orange County church struck a chord
that was resonating at Catholic churches across the country, Cardinal
Roger M. Mahony chose not to tackle the issue during a Mass in
Ventura County and afterward was confronted by banner-waving
protesters who told him he had ignored the problem for too long and
had not been forthcoming enough.</LD>
<LD>   Brown, in a short but direct homily at Holy Family Cathedral in
Orange, made his strongest public comments to date, characterizing
the scandal as a cross the church and its people must bear in order
to heal.</LD>
<TE>   Brown said his sermon gave him the first chance to acknowledge the
sexual abuse scandal from the pulpit, ask for prayers and to explain
that the Catholic Church must move through "this period of passion,
pain and suffering."</TE>
<TE>   "We know now of the terrible trauma our church has been
experiencing since the events in Boston earlier this year," Brown
told parishioners. "We know ... that 2.8 million children in this
country, our country, the United States, have suffered some kind of
emotional, psychological, physical and or sexual abuse each year.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that, unfortunately, some among us, even members of our
clergy, infinitesimal in numbers, but nevertheless real, have been
perpetrators of terrible, terrible crimes, throughout the country, in
our state, in our own county," the bishop said.</TE>
<TE>   The church must seek forgiveness and pray for strength to "carry
the cross of suffering that God has given to us" to "emerge into a
new era of Easter a stronger, holier, more complete church," Brown
concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Palm Sunday commemorates the day Jesus triumphantly entered
Jerusalem, where worshipers placed palms before him. It marks the
first day of Holy Week, the most solemn observation of the Christian
calendar.</TE>
<TE>   Clergy across the country Sunday addressed the growing scandal
that has overshadowed the six-week observance of Lent, which retraces
the story of Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.</TE>
<TE>   "There's always trouble in the world, there's always evil," the
Rev. Fergus Healey told parishioners at St. Anthony Shrine in Boston,
the city where the scandal emerged earlier this year. "But we should
face our current situation with a sense of hope, because evil's not
supposed to have the last say."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, on the other hand, did not tackle the issue during
services at St. Mary Magdalen Parish in Camarillo. A spokesman for
the Los Angeles diocese said the cardinal did not see the occasion as
appropriate for addressing the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony also made no public statements to about two dozen
protesters who came with banners and leaflets, asking the archdiocese
to release the names of several recently ousted priests.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Dioceses of Orange and Los Angeles faced
scandal long before the Boston Archdiocese disclosed in January that
a priest who allegedly molested more than 130 boys had been
transferred from parish to parish.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the two dioceses paid $5.2 million to resolve a lawsuit
alleging that Msgr. Michael "Father Hollywood" Harris, a prominent
Orange County priest, had molested a student. A zero-tolerance policy
adopted as part of that settlement has since resulted in the
dismissal of two more priests in Orange County, and several in Los
Angeles. In the most recent Orange County case, Brown drew praise and
criticism for taking a number of rare steps, including allowing the
priest, Michael Pecharich, to say goodbye to his Rancho Santa
Margarita parishioners at a final Mass.</TE>
<TE>   After services at Holy Family on Sunday, parishioners thanked
Brown for being so open about the sex scandal during his sermon.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our voice, our conscience, of the diocese," said
parishioner Charles Drees. "What he's feeling is what we're feeling.
It's so powerful."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony was not so popular. Protesters gave St. Mary Magdalen
parishioners leaflets asking them to pray for the victims and to stop
contributing money until the church is more forthcoming. The
archdiocese recently dismissed between six and 12 priests, according
to church sources, but has refused to release their names.</TE>
<TE>   "The cardinal needs to release the names of all the perpetrators
so they cannot move on and abuse children elsewhere," said Ray
Higgins, whose says his son was sexually abused in Santa Barbara by
two priests.</TE>

<LD>The footprints of Gable and Bogart and Monroe at Grauman's Chinese
Theatre have long seemed sad fossil records of an era when
celebrities actually outnumbered tattoo artists on Hollywood
Boulevard. On Sunday, the movie stars finally returned to the famous
thoroughfare as an army marching along a red carpet that stretched
from curb to curb, and, surprising many, they didn't kick up as much
dust as expected.</LD>
<LD>   The Academy Awards returned to Hollywood for the first time since
1960, and the security, traffic and other logistical nightmares
expected from shoehorning the 74th annual event into a dense business
district were, for the most part, more than manageable. In the end,
those challenges were like the drizzle that briefly threatened the
arriving stars: ominous to consider but an afterthought by the time
the curtain went up.</LD>
<LD>   The marriage of Hollywood the city and Hollywood the industry
provided an interesting juxtaposition throughout the day. Tattooed
youngsters with leather jackets shared sidewalks with primping
Beverly Hills wives, and glowering motor cops cruised past florists
scrambling to set up bouquets of roses, lilies and (appropriately)
stargazers at the foot of the red carpet. Limos holding Tom Cruise
and Julia Roberts cruised within a stone's throw of the Hollywood Wax
Museum, typically the only place on Hollywood Boulevard a tourist has
a chance to see them.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike the staid setting of the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion or the
low-glamour sheen of the Shrine Auditorium, the new Oscar home, the
Kodak Theatre at Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue, offers
swanky digs inside, and for those all-important exterior shots, the
Hollywood sign and plenty of history within the frame. The building
opened in November and was crafted with the Oscars in mind as its
defining tenant. The reviews of it as architecture and music hall
have been mixed, but the cross streets felt like home to those who
made it past the velvet rope.</TE>
<TE>   "Oscar finally has a home, and this looks like a good one," said a
beaming Ernest Borgnine on his way into the theater. "I think it's
wonderful that it's here. I won my Oscar [as best actor for 1955's
'Marty'] up the street at the Pantages, and it's nice to be back over
here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Closures Leave Some Shop Owners Surly</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the first edition of the Oscars at the Kodak
Theatre was seamless. Merchants remained frustrated and surly over
the street closures that have stifled their business for much of the
past week.</TE>
<TE>   "They have killed us, just killed us," said David Cohen, from the
doorway of his electronics and gift shop across the street. "They
have closed the streets, they have closed the sidewalks. No tour
buses. I usually sell $2,000 cameras, but today, with no foot
traffic, I'm trying to sell Cokes."</TE>
<TE>   The closure of Hollywood Boulevard from Orange Drive east to
Highland Avenue since Tuesday created major headaches for local
residents, and with the cordoned-off area expanding each day, there
were forecasts of white-knuckle traffic jams on Sunday. But, perhaps
because many residents were scared away, the traffic was heavy but
not event-threatening.</TE>
<TE>   The tight restrictions also bruised the feelings of thousands of
tourists and locals who converged on the area to see celebrities
despite days of warnings from officials that television would offer
the best view. That frustration was heightened by the conflicting
orders given throughout the day by police and security personnel who
were learning on the job how the new venue would fit the high-profile
occasion.</TE>
<TE>   "I have been sent in 10 different directions and yelled at,"
snapped Heidi Harlan, who drove in from Riverside solely for
stargazing. "This is ridiculous." Harlan was among 1,500 fans who
waited in long midmorning lines to pass through metal detectors on
Highland Avenue and then clogged up the sidewalk next to the Kodak
entrance, only to be hustled out an hour later. The grumpy crowd was
told the sidewalk was only for passing customers of the stores on the
street and that loitering would not be allowed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated Residents Question Project</TE>
<TE>   There was also a percolating frustration among many locals that
the money and glitz promised by the new tenant at Hollywood &amp;
Highland were not worth the inconvenience, and like the renovated
Times Square in New York, offered a neutered and disconcerting
corporate creation. "They only do protection for all these people;
they won't do it for the residents," said Heidi Beck, who opted to
watch her children play at a nearby park instead. "It always just
caters to the people with money. We don't get anything for our
inconvenience. It just benefits the industry, which keeps getting
richer."</TE>
<TE>   Other residents shrugged, smiled and said their neighborhood was
ready for its close-up even if the spotlight caused some squinting.
Merchants such as Reg Gharibia withheld judgment and gritted their
teeth as they watched business sag. Gharibia's ice cream parlor was
empty most of the morning, and although business picked up as crowds
clogged the east corners of Hollywood and Highland, the awards show
has been more hassle than sizzle for area commerce, he said.</TE>
<TE>   There was one good result, he said. Typically, he sees dejected
tourists from the Midwest trudge in, buy a rocky road cone and ask:
Where are the movie stars?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reconnecting With Oscar History</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always so odd to see stars or their beloved Oscars on
Hollywood Boulevard. The Roosevelt Hotel, a block west of the Kodak
Theatre, was the site of the first edition of the awards show in 1929
(a ticket cost $5 that year and included dinner; this year the ducats
were $350 each), and the Pantages Theatre, a few blocks east, was the
last Hollywood home. "Ben-Hur" was best picture when Oscar said
goodbye to Hollywood in March 1960, and a number of industry veterans
said the return to the industry's namesake city was a cause for
celebration.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's terrorist threat clearly informed plans for the show,
although, in typical Hollywood fashion, steps were taken to cover the
machinery with special effects. A large, ornate tent, for instance,
was set up on the L-shaped, red-carpeted entrance line; inside, metal
detectors and security specialists could check out the audience
headed inside the theater without the indelicate image of, say,
Russell Crowe submitting to a pat-down in front of thousands of
cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Several blocks away, LAPD officers checked out car trunks and,
with mirrors affixed to rods, inspected the undersides of Jaguars and
BMWs for suspicious signs. To the surprise of many, the process moved
fairly briskly. Police said traffic was lighter than expected and, as
the ceremony drew to a close, they had reported no incidents.</TE>
<TE>   But the traffic did move slowly enough for pedestrians to peer
into the luxury cars for the ever-coveted star sighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Say 'Hi, movie star,'" local resident Linda Choy told her
2-year-old, Sunny, as they waved at the darkened windows of a passing
car. Sunny seemed fine with that fleeting celebrity encounter, but
for many of the people who trekked to the housewarming for Oscar, the
Hollywood Boulevard experience was just as frustrating as it has been
for tourists who for years stroll along looking for the famous.</TE>
<TE>   Corrine Marr, 22, walked away from the limos and movie stars with
a sour look on her face. "We give up. We'd rather just see it on TV.
I mean, Roger Ebert was the biggest star we saw."</TE>

<HD>'Beautiful' Historic Night</HD>
<DH>Academy Awards: The color barrier is broken as two African
Americans win top acting honors. 'Mind' snares best picture and
director.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS and SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a beautiful night for "A Beautiful Mind," but a groundbreaking
night for African American performers. Denzel Washington and Halle
Berry made Oscar history Sunday by winning best actor and best
actress at the 74th Academy Awards at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood--the event's new home.</LD>
<LD>   The acting victories virtually eclipsed the winner for best
picture, the haunting but factually selective biographical drama "A
Beautiful Mind." The drama about schizophrenic mathematical genius
and Nobel laureate John Forbes Nash Jr. also collected awards for
supporting actress Jennifer Connelly, adapted screenplay and
director, Ron Howard.</LD>
<LD>   But it was Washington and Berry, beaming and, in Berry's case,
sobbing, who gave the record length four-hour-23-minute telecast on
ABC its most dramatic moments.</LD>
<TE>   It is the first time in 74 years that two African Americans won
Hollywood's highest award for acting, and Berry became the first
African American to win for best actress.Three years ago, she won an
Emmy for her portrayal of Dorothy Dandridge, the first African
American actress to receive an Oscar nomination in the actress
category, nearly a half-century ago.</TE>
<TE>   The 33-year-old actress, a former beauty queen, deglamorized
herself for her role in "Monster's Ball" as a dispirited waitress and
mother who falls in love with a white prison guard who she doesn't
know has helped put her husband to death in the electric chair.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, my God," Berry said, her mouth agape, almost unable to
comprehend the moment as tears streamed down her cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sorry," she said in halting gasps, as she clasped the gold
statuette. "This moment is so much bigger than me. This moment is for
Dorothy Dandridge, Lena Horne, Diahann Carroll. It's for the women
who stand beside me, Jada Pinkett, Angela Bassett, Vivica Fox, and
the nameless, faceless women of color who now stand a chance tonight
because the door has been opened. I thank the academy for choosing me
to be the vessel ...."</TE>
<TE>   In "Training Day," Washington turned away from the personable,
often-heroic characters he has portrayed. His menacing and thoroughly
corrupt undercover narcotics cop cruises the mean streets of L.A. in
the course of one day with his new charge, played by supporting actor
nominee Ethan Hawke.</TE>
<TE>   In a passing of the torch, Sidney Poitier, the first black
performer to win best actor for his role in 1963's "Lilies of the
Field," applauded from the audience as Washington became the first
minority actor to win the category in 38 years. Earlier in the
evening, Poitier received an honorary Oscar for his five-decade
career.</TE>
<TE>   "God is good," the 47-year-old Washington said. "God is great from
the bottom of my heart." Then acknowledging Poitier, Washington
added: "For 40 years, I've been chasing Sidney and what do they do?
They give it to him the same night." After the laughter died, the
actor said, "I'll always be following him. There's nothing I'd rather
do." Washington was named best supporting actor in 1989 for "Glory."</TE>
<TE>   Poitier brought tears to many eyes and drew a prolonged standing
ovation. The 75-year-old star of such films as "In the Heat of the
Night" from 1967 and "The Defiant Ones" from 1958 was the first actor
of color to become a major film star.</TE>
<TE>   "I accept this award in memory of all the African American actors
who went before me in the difficult years and on whose shoulders I
was privileged to stand to see where I might go," Poitier said in a
poignant acceptance speech, in which he thanked a litany of writers
and directors, living and dead, who gave him screen roles and whose
art made the world "better for their effort."</TE>
<TE>   The epic fantasy "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring," tied "A Beautiful Mind" with four wins, including makeup,
cinematography, visual effects and score.</TE>
<TE>   Director Howard, who audiences remember growing up on television
as Opie on "The Andy Griffith Show" and teenager Richie Cunningham in
"Happy Days," won his first Oscar, for best director for "A Beautiful
Mind." In the waning days of the Oscar campaign, the film was the
subject of a not-so-subtle whisper campaign attacking the filmmakers
for omitting suggestions that Nash was homosexual and had made
anti-Semitic statements. Although Howard had won a Directors Guild of
America award for his 1995 space thriller "Apollo 13," he was shut
out of the nominations at the Academy Awards that year.</TE>
<TE>   Former child star Connelly won for her role as Alicia Nash, John
Nash's strong-willed wife and the emotional glue that kept their
marriage together during the darkest hours of his mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in love, that there is nothing more important,"
Connelly said, reading from a prepared statement. With the real Nash
and his wife looking on from the audience, she added: "Alicia Nash is
a true champion of love, so thank you for your example."</TE>
<TE>   British character actor Jim Broadbent received best supporting
actor for his role in "Iris" as the loving, caring husband of the
late Alzheimer's-stricken writer Iris Murdoch.</TE>
<TE>   One of the evening's biggest surprises was the unexpected
appearance of writer, director and actor Woody Allen, a New Yorker
who although he has won three Oscars, has never shown up in person to
accept the awards. In years past, when the Academy Awards were held
on Monday nights, he could be found playing jazz clarinet at
Michael's Pub in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Allen was there to introduce a short film by Nora Ephron of clips
from such New York movies as "Manhattan," "On the Town" and "On the
Waterfront."</TE>
<TE>   The 66-year-old Allen, looking nervous, reverted to his stand-up
comedy roots, remarking at the standing ovation he received: "That
makes up for the strip search." His appearance was to encourage
Hollywood filmmakers to consider setting movies in Manhattan because
the Sept. 11 attacks had delivered an economic blow to the city's
film business.</TE>
<TE>   Backstage, Allen explained that he agreed to come to L.A. because
"the motion picture academy wanted to make a very nice gesture of
support to honor films made in New York City over the years."</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to do something for New York, and the opportunity was
presented to me on a silver platter," he added. "We've had such a
tough time of it. There was no way I could resist it." Normally, he
said, he's simply not a "big awards person" and doesn't feel
comfortable with any kind of artistic competition."</TE>
<TE>   Allen's remarks were one of several times the program referred to
the aftermath of Sept. 11. Indeed, Hollywood is coming off one of its
most worrisome years in decades, after strike threats, terrorism
fears and a seeming paucity of Oscar-caliber films.</TE>
<TE>   The evening began on a serious tone with actor Tom Cruise taking
center stage to remark on the effect movies had on his life, from
Stanley Kubrick's "2001: A Space Odyssey" through "Jaws." Then
alluding to the role of entertainment after Sept. 11, Cruise asked:
"Should we celebrate the joy and magic the movies bring? Dare I say
it? More than ever."</TE>
<TE>   Cooing "Come and get me boys," Oscar-winning actress and host
Whoopi Goldberg made a grand entrance from the rafters on a swing a
la Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rouge" She wore a gaudy
feathered-and-sequined get-up with an extravagantly designed top hat
and tights as she took the stage and, in a breathy voice, said, "Good
evening, darlings, I'm the original 'Sexy Beast,'" referring to the
Ben Kingsley gangster thriller.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg's monologue set the tone for an often-ribald, acerbic
evening when the dreadlocked comedian addressed Will Smith, his wife,
Jada Pinkett-Smith, and British actress Dame Maggie Smith, sitting
together in the front row, as "the Smith family."</TE>
<TE>   The evening's writing awards went to Akiva Goldsman for adapted
screenplay for "A Beautiful Mind" and Julian Fellowes for original
screenplay for "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   "No Man's Land," a war satire from Bosnia-Herzegovina was named
best foreign language film.</TE>
<TE>   In a historical footnote, the first Oscar for animated feature
film went to "Shrek," the DreamWorks anti-fable about an ugly green
ogre who, accompanied by a wisecracking donkey, goes in search of a
princess.</TE>
<TE>   Barbra Streisand gave her "The Way We Were" leading man, Robert
Redford, the evening's other honorary Oscar, for his 40-year acting
and directing career and his two decades at the helm of the Sundance
Film Institute, where he has been a leading advocate for independent
cinema.</TE>
<TE>   A relieved and thrilled composer Randy Newman quipped, "I don't
want your pity" after he won his first Oscar on his 16th try. He won
for best song for the bouncy "If I Didn't Have You" from "Monsters,
Inc." He thanked the academy's music branch "for giving me so many
chances to be humiliated."</TE>

<LD>It's like those Office Depot commercials, the ones where people such
as Debbie Allen and Bill Parcells pop up to dispense advice in their
fields of expertise.</LD>
<LD>   When Gil de Ferran drives around the track, he hears the voices of
Roger Penske and Rick Mears in his headset. Penske's racing team has
won the Indianapolis 500 11 times, four of them with Mears driving.
Of all the guys driving around the California Speedway on Sunday,
only de Ferran had two of the nine racing legends whose faces adorn
an infield wall talking in his ear.</LD>
<LD>   Think these guys know what they're doing?</LD>
<TE>   As de Ferran said: "If Roger and Rick told me turn left and hit
the wall because that's the best option, I would do that because
that's the confidence I have in them."</TE>
<TE>   At speeds over 215 mph, drivers don't have time to be looking over
their shoulders.</TE>
<TE>   Mears is the spotter. From his perch high above the track, he lets
de Ferran know when cars are trying to pass him and what side they're
coming from.</TE>
<TE>   "Primarily from a safety standpoint, he's crucial," de Ferran
said. "His presence is a must, really. These cars, with the tires the
size they are and the car the way that it is, you simply can't see.
It's a huge blind spot. You can move up on somebody, somebody can
move up on me and cause a very huge accident."</TE>
<TE>   Mears keeps a close watch on de Ferran's car as it zooms around
the oval, moving his eyes only to glance around the track for any
accidents.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to scan," Mears said. "You're working with the driver.
Anytime I see somebody sneaking up on him, I'll say, 'Watch right,
he's looking right, he's looking right. He's looking left. Looking
inside, looking outside. Still there still there, still outside. Or
still inside.'</TE>
<TE>   "In the meantime, while you're watching him, you've got to scan
the track to make sure you don't see something else taking place. It
keeps you fairly busy."</TE>
<TE>   It also keeps Mears close to the sport. When he ended one of the
most successful driving careers in history in 1992, Penske asked him
to stick around.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't walk away from the whole thing," Mears said. "This is
a family [Team Penske] I've been with since '78. All of this keeps
you involved."</TE>
<TE>   There's another benefit: "It's the best seat in the house."</TE>
<TE>   Standing on aluminum risers above California Speedway's main suite
and press box complex, he gazed from what he called one of the best
vantage points on the Indy Racing League circuit. He had to look over
and around some television cameras when de Ferran entered Turn 1, but
that was about it.</TE>
<TE>   Mears doesn't use too many words.</TE>
<TE>   He can go several laps saying nothing more than "Outside, outside,
outside ... clear."</TE>
<TE>   His longest discourse of the day: "One more car, then there's a
little opening."</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a man who wastes breath," said de Ferran, who has been
working with Mears since 2000. "He just talks when it's important."</TE>
<TE>   Penske's the talker. He's watching over two racers--de Ferran and
Helio Castroneves--and is in regular contact with both. He gives them
updates on how far ahead or behind they are from the nearest racer.
He'll relate the speed of their last lap and how it relates to the
lead car. He tells them when to come in for a pit stop and advises on
strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Penske and de Ferran spent part of Sunday's Yamaha Indy 400
debating whether to use fifth or sixth gear.</TE>
<TE>   "You had your best lap in sixth," Penske said, ending the
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Penske uses a steady stream of encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   "Nice and smooth."</TE>
<TE>   "We're doing fine."</TE>
<TE>   "We're in good shape."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the drivers are more realistic. When the top four cars
pulled away from de Ferran midway through the race, Penske said:
"Keep hanging on. You're doing good."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm losing them, Roger," de Ferran said as he slipped behind.
"I'm losing them."</TE>
<TE>   De Ferran's No. 6 car just didn't have enough speed to keep up
with the top guys. Not even after Penske's decision to make a
fuel-only pit stop without changing tires put de Ferran in the lead
after a caution with 31 laps remaining.</TE>
<TE>   He finished 6.5269 seconds behind the winner, Sam Hornish Jr.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get too frustrated," de Ferran said. "We had a
competitive race. We weren't as fast and came home fourth."</TE>
<TE>   It might diminish the role of the spotter to note that Hornish's
radio malfunctioned earlier in the race and he had to go the
old-fashioned way, with signs and hand signals and no one to warn him
of approaching cars.</TE>
<TE>   As a former driver, Mears doesn't mind giving most of the credit
to the guys behind the wheel.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Salmon, Erstad on Rebound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEMPE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Go to your favorite newsstand, pick up one of the many baseball
preview magazines, flip to the section about the Angels and
inevitably these words will appear: "Tim Salmon and Darin Erstad must
rebound."</LD>
<LD>   Indeed they must, if the Angels are to have any chance to win this
season. And the spring training returns are positive: Salmon is
hitting .385 and Erstad .362, with both players ranking among league
leaders in slugging percentage. In 16 spring games, Erstad has scored
14 runs; Salmon has driven in 17.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon underwent shoulder and foot surgery before last season,
then missed part of spring training because of a groin injury. He
posted career lows last season in batting average (.227) and runs
batted in (49).</LD>
<TE>   "Even though I was going out there getting my butt kicked every
night, in my heart of hearts I knew I wasn't right," he said. "I knew
it would be nice to feel strong again."</TE>
<TE>   Erstad's average dropped from .355 to .258 last season, and he
struck out a career-high 113 times, after a winter knee injury
corrupted his swing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot easier to balance at the plate," he said. "It's easier
to get my body to respond to what I want it to do. That makes all the
difference in the world. You're able to be confident. You can plant
your front foot instead of that thing spinning out of there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When the Angels unilaterally renewed the contracts of Ramon Ortiz
and Jarrod Washburn three weeks ago, General Manager Bill Stoneman
said he would "keep the door open" to discussing long-term deals with
the pitchers. The Angels and the agent for Ortiz, Pat Roache, agreed
Friday to a contract that Ortiz said guarantees him a minimum of
$7.25 million over three years.</TE>
<TE>   No such deal appears imminent for Washburn, the Angels' opening
day starter. Since the renewal date, Washburn said, the Angels have
discussed the issue only once with his agent, Scott Boras, and have
not made a formal contract offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I'm looking forward to arbitration next year," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said his position has not changed but indicated he would
be unlikely to negotiate beyond opening day. Boras did not return a
call seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Longtime Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina, whose broken finger
derailed his attempt to make a comeback with the Boston Red Sox, told
the Boston Globe that Red Sox fans aren't the only ones bemoaning a
supposed curse upon their franchise. "There is a curse of the Angels
too," DiSarcina said. "Our thing is there must be Indian gods buried
under our field. There are bones there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Glaus hit his sixth spring home run, tops in the American
League, and Salmon, Brad Fullmer and Scott Spiezio also homered in a
13-3 rout of the San Francisco Giants on Sunday.... The Angels would
love to pick up a right-handed hitter to replace the injured Shawn
Wooten, but they're more likely to use the waiver wire than trade one
of their top pitching prospects for a proven hitter. "We're not going
to overreact," Stoneman said.... In Wooten's absence, Benji Gil is
expected to play some first base against left-handers. "We'd be a lot
worse off if we didn't have a guy like Benji Gil," Stoneman said.
Gil's averages against lefties: .294 last year, .246 career.... The
Angels optioned shortstop Alfredo Amezaga to triple-A Salt Lake.</TE>

<HD>Rivera May Find Work in Texas</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ruben Rivera is getting another chance, this time with the Texas
Rangers.</LD>
<LD>   Ranger General Manager John Hart said Sunday the team will
evaluate Rivera for 10 days before determining whether to offer the
troubled outfielder a minor league contract.</LD>
<LD>   Rivera, 28, was released by the New York Yankees on March 11 after
stealing a bat and glove from teammate Derek Jeter's locker and
selling the items to a memorabilia dealer. Rivera was in Texas' minor
league camp Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   The Cleveland Indians last week decided against pursuing a deal
with Rivera, after he met with their team psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Ranger Manager Jerry Narron finally made it official. Rookie
third baseman Hank Blalock has won the starting job.</TE>
<TE>   "He'll be on the field April 1," Narron said. "I believe Hank came
in here from the first day and believed that he was going to be the
opening day third baseman."</TE>
<TE>   Blalock, who has never played above the double-A level, unseated
incumbent starter Mike Lamb.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Kansas City Royals assigned right-hander Bryan Rekar and
left-hander Brian DeHart to triple-A Omaha.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Chuck Knoblauch returned to camp after being gone a
week because of the death of his father.</TE>

<HD>Vargas Scores Big at Rally</HD>
<DH>Boxing: An estimated 3,500 to 4,000 cheer him and special
guest Chavez and jeer De La Hoya on Olvera Street event to hype
fight.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It won't be worth a single point on the judges' scorecards, but
Fernando Vargas made big points with the local Mexican-American
community Sunday afternoon by staging a huge rally on Olvera Street
to hype his May 4 welterweight title fight against Oscar De La Hoya.</LD>
<LD>   A crowd estimated by a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman at
between 3,500 and 4,000 came with their banners, their posters and
their cameras to the Pueblo de L.A. Plaza. There were cheers for
Vargas, jeers for De La Hoya, and even a few tears from an
uncharacteristically humble Vargas at the appearance of his boyhood
hero, Julio Cesar Chavez.</LD>
<LD>   Even De La Hoya was there. Sort of.</LD>
<TE>   While the World Boxing Council 154-pound champion declined to join
the rally, Vargas' handlers had a cardboard cutout of De La Hoya
placed in a chair next to Vargas as a target for their mockery.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to De La Hoya as "chicken-hearted," Gary Shaw, Vargas'
promoter, said, "by Oscar not being here, [it means] he has already
started to run."</TE>
<TE>   There were references throughout the rally about Vargas being a
true Mexican--a recurring theme in his campaign against De La
Hoya--the inference being that De La Hoya is somehow less than a true
Mexican. Nothing new in that approach. Muhammad Ali used it three
decades ago, inferring he was somehow more of a true black man than
Joe Frazier.</TE>
<TE>   That was no truer than Vargas' mantra is today. Both Vargas and De
La Hoya, who will finally meet in the ring at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay
Events Center, are both Mexican-Americans and Southern Californians.
De La Hoya is from East Los Angeles, Vargas from Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud to be a Mexican," Vargas said. "This is where you come
from. These are your people. You should want to be here."</TE>
<TE>   There is a method to Vargas' message. By proclaiming himself a
true Mexican warrior while chiding De La Hoya for hitting and running
in the ring, a style De La Hoya employed in the closing rounds of his
1999 fight against Felix Trinidad, Vargas is hoping to shame De La
Hoya into standing toe to toe and slugging it out.</TE>
<TE>   That would figure to be Vargas' only chance for victory against
the faster De La Hoya.</TE>
<TE>   But on Sunday, Vargas said he didn't see a slugfest as his best
option.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where I get in trouble, when I go out there and think I'm
a he-man," said Vargas, "when I think I've got to get a knockout
every time."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to a news conference in January where an emotional
Vargas shoved De La Hoya, starting a near brawl, Vargas was under
control Sunday, his usual braggadocio tempered, his approach more
about pride in his heritage than anger at his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   But Vargas lost it when Chavez, universally regarded as the
greatest fighter Mexico has produced, was introduced on the stage.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember cheering for him as a kid," Vargas said. "It gives me
goose bumps that he is here. I'm speechless."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has agreed to do more than merely share a stage with
Vargas. He has offered to spend a month with the fighter at his Big
Bear training headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   "Chavez is Chavez," Vargas said. "He knows a lot and I can learn a
lot, whatever he wants to teach me. I am amazed he is here."</TE>
<TE>   Said Chavez, who lost twice to De La Hoya: "I don't have anything
against Oscar personally. I recognize he's also a great fighter, but
it's going to be a tougher fight than he thinks ... [Vargas] is young
and has a great future. I see a lot of fire in him. I'm going to
dedicate a couple of months to be with him by his side."</TE>
<TE>   It was Vargas' stage Sunday, his spotlight, his moment.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether that will be the case on May 4th,
however, when the cardboard cutout will be replaced by flesh and
blood.</TE>

<LD>Corey Maggette practiced with his teammates Sunday and said, "I'm
ready to go. I'm waiting to get the OK." He has been sidelined since
Feb. 22 because of dislocated bones in his right hand. While he sat
out, he underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee.</LD>
<LD>   "The wrist is not 100%," said Maggette, who was filling in for the
injured Lamar Odom as the starting small forward. "The knee is not an
issue. I'm jumping higher and better than I did before."</LD>
<LD>   Coach Alvin Gentry did not rule out removing Maggette from the
injured list today and playing him tonight against San Antonio.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not out of the question, put it that way," Gentry said,
smiling broadly. "He wants to play. He's dying to play."</TE>
<TE>   There's little question the Clippers, who are 21/2 games out of a
playoff spot, could use a spark from Maggette. He is perhaps their
best defensive player and, certainly, their toughest-minded.</TE>
<TE>   He freely acknowledged, however, that punching the scorer's table
in anger during a loss Feb. 21 against the Orlando Magic and injuring
his hand wasn't the least bit helpful to the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't mad at myself," he said. "It was an opportunity to get
my knee straight. Everybody gets injuries--maybe not as stupid as
mine--but everybody comes back."</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Heavenly World Series"</LD>
<LD>   Author: Frank O'Rourke</LD>
<TE>   Publisher: Carroll &amp; Graf</TE>
<TE>   Price: $25</TE>
<TE>   Frank O'Rourke was more than a lover of baseball. The versatile
author, whose writings spanned five decades, was also a historian and
storyteller of a game once known for its unbridled innocence.</TE>
<TE>   In his new collection of fictional short stories, "The Heavenly
World Series," arranged in part by novelist Darryl Brock and
O'Rourke's widow, Edith Carlson, O'Rourke shares his deep knowledge
and love of baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "The stories in this new collection ... bring baseball history
alive," Brock writes in the book's introduction, "from
turn-of-the-century cow-pasture games to the small-town fever of the
'30s, and on to the major leagues of the '40s and '50s."</TE>
<TE>   O'Rourke, a former sandlot player and manager who died in 1989
after producing more than 100 short stories and 60 books, was a
master of mixing fiction and real-life historical events and people
into a seamless baseball universe.</TE>
<TE>   One of O'Rourke's few challenges in recounting baseball's past is
the fact that he must adhere to its modernization--such as players'
salaries bellowing faster than their egos.</TE>
<TE>   O'Rourke hits this low curve ball by always hinting that the game
is bigger than its participants.</TE>
<TE>   At the conclusion of "Flashing Spikes," for example, we see how
baseball's purity prevails when a self-centered, up-and-coming star
sees the error of his ways, but only after learning one of baseball's
many lessons from a member of the old Black Sox.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Tracy Taking It Down to Wire</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JUPITER, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The season opener is eight days away, the Dodgers still haven't named
starters at shortstop, center field and in the fifth rotation spot,
and some players are getting a little restless.</LD>
<LD>   "Eyes are still wide open," outfielder Marquis Grissom said.
"You're not comfortable when there are moves to be made in the last
couple of days before you break camp.... You've got to put nine guys
out there and let them play. Then those guys can build some
chemistry, and the other guys can adjust to their roles."</LD>
<LD>   Manager Jim Tracy said he will have some answers today. "It's
getting to be the time to make a few announcements so guys can get
prepared," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Some decisions are apparent: Cesar Izturis seems to be a lock to
win the shortstop job, but the Dodgers are leaning toward keeping
2001 shortstop Alex Cora, who has shown improvement at the plate and
in the field this spring, as a utility infielder. Odalis Perez is
likely the fifth starter, and rotation candidate Omar Daal is
expected to open the season in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The decision in center field, where four candidates are competing,
can be inferred: The Dodgers are aggressively trying to trade Tom
Goodwin and are soliciting offers for McKay Christensen, a good
indication Dave Roberts and Grissom will make the team and probably
platoon in center.</TE>
<TE>   According to a baseball source, Cleveland, Baltimore and
Pittsburgh have expressed interest in Goodwin, whom the Dodgers have
been trying to trade all winter. Goodwin is guaranteed $3.75 million,
and the Dodgers are willing to pay a significant amount of that to
deal him.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have had several feelers for Christensen, who was
considered the favorite in center entering camp but may have played
his way off the team with several fielding and baserunning mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   Christensen is out of minor league options and would have to clear
waivers to be sent to triple-A Las Vegas. The Dodgers don't want to
lose the former first-round pick without compensation, so they would
prefer to trade him before the season starts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dodger right-hander Andy Ashby took another significant step in
his recovery from elbow surgery Sunday, giving up one unearned run on
four hits in five innings of a 1-1, 10-inning exhibition tie with St.
Louis. Ashby struck out one, walked none and threw 70 pitches.</TE>
<TE>   If Ashby doesn't experience any setbacks and is able to increase
his pitch count to 90 or so in his next start Friday or Saturday, he
will likely open the season with the Dodgers as the No. 4 starter.</TE>
<TE>   "What's weird is I haven't felt anything in my elbow, which is
great," Ashby said. "My location was good [Sunday], I mixed it up and
made some pitches when I had to. The main thing now is to focus on
mechanics and making good pitches."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Matt Herges' name came up in winter trade rumors, so the Dodgers
weren't shocked when he was dealt to Montreal Saturday, but several
players were saddened to see the popular set-up man go.</TE>
<TE>   "You feel bad for Matt because he gave everything to this
organization and was a model citizen for the Dodgers," first baseman
Eric Karros said. "It's one of the tough parts of the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes out of nowhere, and you're not prepared for it. It
doesn't matter how much money you make or how many years you've
played, it's still a shock, a feeling that you had the rug pulled out
from underneath you."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hard-throwing right-hander Eric Gagne may eventually develop into
the Dodger closer, but he will not be rushed into that role at the
start of the season. Tracy reiterated Sunday he will open with a
closer-by-committee system, using Gagne, Paul Quantrill, Giovanni
Carrara and possibly Jesse Orosco in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to look at matchups, pitcher vs. hitter statistics,"
Tracy said. "It doesn't matter if it's the fifth or sixth or ninth
inning. I may go with gut feelings and the pulse of the game. Gagne
may evolve [as the closer] but it will take place gradually."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Guillermo Mota, one of the players acquired in the Herges
trade, struck out two of three batters in a scoreless seventh inning
Sunday, and his fastball was clocked between 95 and 98 mph....
Left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii, who hasn't pitched in a game since
allowing six runs on six hits, including three homers, to the New
York Yankees on March 16, will start a minor league exhibition
today.... The Dodgers reassigned utility infielder Jeff Branson and
pitcher Rickey Bones to minor league camp, reducing their roster to
31 players.</TE>

<KH>Chris Dufresne SECOND THOUGHTS</KH>
<HD>This Regional Should Be Called the Frozen Four</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>News, notes, buzzer beaters, loud horns, barometric readings and NCAA
wind-chill factors while thinking how terrific it is upstate New York
should receive a thorough dusting of snow just in time for the
holidays (Easter).</LD>
<LD>   News item: NCAA holds East Regional in Syracuse.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: Dear diary: Nearly did not make it to Friday's
second-round games staged on polar icecap. Held over in Chicago on
Thursday after white-out storm cancels flight into Syracuse. Many
thanks to Admiral Byrd for landing us safely in time for Friday
games. Have seen more falling snow in two days here than 23 at recent
Salt Lake City Winter Olympics.</LD>
<TE>   High temperature Friday was 23 degrees. Folks here call it
"lake-effect" snow. Supposed to taper off sometime around July 4.
Yesterday stopped to admire ice sculpture outside Carrier Dome. Soon
realized it was a Maryland guard, frozen in his tracks on his way to
practice. Was thinking they should rename arena "Carrier Nome."</TE>
<TE>   Used to think John Wooden was best basketball coach of all time.
Now convinced it is Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim. Any guy who can get
to two national title games recruiting players to an ice rink is tops
in my book.</TE>
<TE>   Brilliant move for NCAA to stage a regional during "Black Ice"
season.</TE>
<TE>   Thinking: if frostbite is prerequisite for landing future NCAA
bids, look for proposals next year from Billings, Mont., Anchorage,
Alaska, and Bangor, Maine.</TE>
<TE>   Funny thing happened during Friday's second regional semifinal
game. Public address man announced time for Sunday's regional final
had been set for 5:10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Crowd booed so loudly I thought Tonya Harding had just walked in.</TE>
<TE>   Fans booing a start time? Word was folks were outraged at having
to venture out of their homes at night.</TE>
<TE>   Only in Syracuse. Only in spring.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Steve Lavin leads UCLA to another Sweet 16 appearance.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: It's not easy being Lavin. To paraphrase those
sound-bite, Hollywood-driven analogies he likes to feed the national
press:</TE>
<TE>   It's like Groundhog Day, Mutiny on the Bounty, Dial M for Murder.
It's the theater of the absurd. It's like Lazarus, pulling rabbits
out of a hat. It's like The Fugitive and I'm the one-armed man. It's
like the Brady Bunch and I'm Jan. It's The Caine Mutiny and I'm
Bogart. It's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, it's the Comeback Kid,
the Cincinnati Kid, it's Jason Kidd, it's Jason in Friday the 13th.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, for those of us who watch this yo-yo drama play out
every winter and spring at the Westwood Playhouse, it's always going
to be "Same Time Next Year."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Oklahoma guard Hollis Price sticks negative newspaper
article in his shoe to inspire him against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Steve Lavin, recently listed at 6 feet 7 in the
UCLA program, has also taken to stuffing negative news clips in his
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   News item: ESPN's Dick Vitale says after Indiana upsets Duke that
Hoosier Coach Mike Davis has done a "solid" job replacing Bob Knight.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Solid? Counting Saturday's win over Kent State,
Davis has won twice as many NCAA tournament games this year, four,
than Knight has chalked up in his last seven tournaments. Knight was
2-6 in his last six years at Indiana and is 0-1 at Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Solid? Never has a compliment rung so hollow, and been so
revealing, especially emanating from the mouth of the hyperbolic
Vitale, a man who thinks everyone and everything in college hoops is
"super-duper-diaper dandy."</TE>
<TE>   Vitale was clearly in a tough journalistic spot. He made the
comments in the emotional and immediate aftermath of Indiana's
dramatic one-point victory over Duke. Not only had Davis and Indiana
upended Vitale's favorite team, any praiseworthy statements about
Indiana would have to be made in the context of Knight, another
hallowed figure.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, Davis complained about what it's been like
following Knight: "The ghost will never go away," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' point was that a lot of people, on and off camera, don't
want to give up the ghost.</TE>
<TE>   To his credit, on a later edition, upon reflection, Vitale
upgraded Davis' performance from "solid" to "fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   For sure, what Davis has done this year has been at least as
"solid" as what Knight accomplished at Texas Tech.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Federal indictment alleges former Michigan booster Ed
Martin gave more than $600,000 to former Wolverine basketball
players.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: If convicted, some legal experts think Martin
could receive a sentence of Fab Five-to-10 in the local penitentiary.</TE>
<TE>   News item: As academic institution, Michigan fancies itself as
"Harvard of the Midwest."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: No word yet whether school is considering a new
motto, "Gomorrah of the Great Lakes."</TE>
<TE>   News item: According to reports, 24 of the 65 schools in NCAA
tournament have zero graduation rate for players dating back to
freshman class of 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Terrific. And all this time during the tournament
I've been doing what I've been told by NCAA officials and addressing
all the players as "student-athletes."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Missouri loses to Oklahoma in West Regional final.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I thought down the stretch it looked flat,
listless and lacking continuity and texture. Missouri? No, Coach Quin
Snyder's hair.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Penn State football Coach Joe Paterno suspends player
five games after DUI charge.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Paterno told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, "I don't
want to be ruthless, but I don't want to be toothless." Paterno isn't
just blowing smoke. At age 75, dental hygiene is a legitimate
concern.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Salt Lake City Olympics savior Mitt Romney announces
he'll run for governor of Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Wow, have to say this completely caught me off
guard. I thought for certain Romney would retreat from the public eye
after the Games and lead a quiet life of introspection and
contemplation. Using the Olympics as a springboard to political
office? Nope, sorry, didn't see that one coming.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Impede Stars' Progress</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Dallas, battling for playoff spot in West,
outshoots Anaheim, 28-13, but loses, 2-1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Once the Mighty Ducks got the lead, goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere
knew his work was cut out for him.</LD>
<LD>   Giguere made 27 saves to lift the Mighty Ducks to a 2-1 victory
over Dallas on Sunday, snapping the Stars' six-game unbeaten streak.</LD>
<LD>   Dallas is in an eight-team scrap for the final five playoff spots
in the West, while the Ducks are out of the playoff race.</LD>
<TE>   "They're desperate right now, fighting for a playoff spot, so we
knew they were going to come at us hard, especially at the end,"
Giguere said.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Rucchin scored a second-period power-play goal after a
fortunate carom off the boards and Dan Bylsma scored with 14:43 left
as the Ducks earned their second straight road victory over the Stars
after going 2-16-1-0 on Dallas ice.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars were prepared for a low-scoring game. The Ducks have two
goals or less in each of their last six games, four on the trip that
ended on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Anaheim's done this throughout the road trip," Dallas interim
Coach Rick Wilson said. "It's no accident that it's tough to score on
them."</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Muller scored on a deflection with 7:55 left for Dallas,
which saw its 3-0-3 run end, despite a 28-13 advantage in shots on
goal. The Ducks' 13 shots were a season low by a Star opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The Stars' best opportunity to tie the game came with 1:15
remaining when a shot by Mike Modano hit the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   Rucchin collected his sixth goal to give the Ducks a 1-0 lead at
7:02 of the second. Paul Kariya's pass into the Dallas zone took a
wild hop off the end boards and landed in front of the net on the
stick of Rucchin, who beat Star goaltender Ed Belfour.</TE>
<TE>   "It was unlucky on Dallas' part," Rucchin said. "You hate to see a
goal like that be a difference in a hockey game but we'll take it."</TE>
<TE>   Bylsma converted Matt Cullen's pass in the third period for his
eighth goal to make it 2-0.</TE>

<HD>Last Call for Atlanta</HD>
<DH>East Regional: Maryland relies on experience to lead it
past Connecticut, 90-82.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SYRACUSE, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Connecticut had everything it needed to upset Maryland on Sunday
except the one thing you can't bottle, borrow or teach: experience.</LD>
<LD>   As the game wound down, and throats became dry, and the pace
quickened, Maryland's wily board of directors took control and did
what it took to earn a 90-82 victory before a crowd of 29,252 at the
Carrier Dome.</LD>
<LD>   The victory, not sealed and delivered until guard Steve Blake made
his only basket of the game, a three-pointer with 25 seconds left to
double the lead to six, earned for the Terrapins the East Regional
title and a trip to next week's Final Four in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Maryland will face Kansas in a national semifinal game.</TE>
<TE>   Things could have broken differently here. Connecticut, playing
with only one senior, might have easily stolen this game. Huskies'
Coach Jim Calhoun thought he had a chance up to the final few
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we were going to Atlanta," Calhoun said. "And then he
[Blake] hit that shot."</TE>
<TE>   Led by Caron Butler's game-high 32-points, Connecticut kept
pushing and pushing and pushing and actually found itself with a
three-point lead with 4:53 left.</TE>
<TE>   But then Maryland's veterans' committee took over.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Juan Dixon answered with a three-point shot to tie the
score and then made two free throws to put Maryland back on top.</TE>
<TE>   "He does throw daggers," Calhoun would say of Dixon. "His shots
hurt more."</TE>
<TE>   Connecticut tied the score one last time, with 2:32 left, on Tony
Robertson's reverse lay-up, but then it was time for another senior
moment, as Maryland forward Lonny Baxter scored four consecutive
points, two on a basket, two on free throws.</TE>
<TE>   "We just know how to win," Baxter said.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland led, 83-80, heading into a timeout with 35 seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Terrapin Coach Gary Williams started drawing up a play in the
huddle when Blake interrupted.</TE>
<TE>   "When he was explaining it, I said, 'I'm going to take the shot,'"
Blake said. "I said it just like that. He said, 'Well, yeah, you can
take it if you're open.'"</TE>
<TE>   Blake is only a junior but has more miles on him than some rental
cars. He plays Duke's Jason Williams two or three times a year.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it was funny that a guy who had missed his only two shot
attempts would demand the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "Blake, that's the type of player he is, " Baxter would say. "He
wanted it."</TE>
<TE>   Blake got it.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the end of the game, in all essence," Calhoun said.</TE>
<TE>   Then, after a foul, Blake made two free throws with 16 seconds to
extend the lead to eight.</TE>
<TE>   Blake was held scoreless for 39 minutes and 35 seconds, then
scored the five points his team needed most.</TE>
<TE>   In the game that mattered most, the one that launched Maryland to
its second consecutive Final Four, Baxter had 29 points and Dixon had
27. Baxter and Dixon scored 16 of their team's final 23 points.</TE>
<TE>   Baxter was named the East Regional's most outstanding player, but
it could have easily been Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   "They carried us on their backs," Maryland junior guard Drew
Nicholas said. "That's what senior leadership is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The game was closer than the score. There were 24 lead changes.
The largest margin either team enjoyed was eight, accomplished on
Blake's second free throw with 16 second remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We just ground out the win," Williams said. "There had to be a
way to win that game and we found it."</TE>
<TE>   The discovery did not come easily. Maryland was up seven at the
half but that lead vanished when Butler made a three-pointer to give
Connecticut a 54-53 lead with 13:11 left.</TE>
<TE>   Butler, a sophomore forward, was held to six points in the first
half mostly because of foul trouble. He played only 13 minutes and
sat out the last 5:15 after picking up his second foul.</TE>
<TE>   Butler was a different man in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "My team was in a situation where they needed me," Butler said. "I
had to come in to lead the team. I tried my best to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Butler's 26 second-half points were not enough. His second-half
effort did pull Maryland out of the zone it had used in the first
half to stop Connecticut's guards, Ben Gordon and Taliek Brown, from
slashing to the basket.</TE>
<TE>   For Maryland, the mission now is to avenge last year's national
semifinal defeat to Duke and claim the school's first national title.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year we were close to winning the title," Dixon said. "This
is me and Lonny's last year going through this. We're going to do
whatever it takes to win."</TE>

<HD>For This Victory, He'll Earn Perks</HD>
<DH>Golf: 35-year-old becomes first to earn his first Tour
victory at Players Championship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla.</DL>
<LD>Not many people knew about Craig Perks. No one will forget the
theatrical finish Sunday that brought him an unlikely victory at the
Players Championship and a trip to the Masters.</LD>
<LD>   In a roller-coaster round expected out of a newcomer to such a
pressure-packed stage, Perks completed a day of high drama with an
eagle-birdie-par finish to become the first player to earn his first
victory at the event regarded as golf's fifth major.</LD>
<LD>   "You're unbelievable," defending champion Tiger Woods told him at
the trophy presentation. "Absolutely unbelievable"</LD>
<TE>   The 35-year-old from New Zealand closed with an even-par 72, a
score that doesn't even begin to reflect his wild adventures on a
firm, punishing TPC at Sawgrass course.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the easiest 72 I ever shot in my life," Perks joked
after his two-shot win over Stephen Ames.</TE>
<TE>   He made only two pars over his final 14 holes, none after No. 10.</TE>
<TE>   Perks easily could have seen his chances disappear when his
approach from 199 yards on the par-five 16th came perilously close to
the edge of the water. It hung up in the thick collar of rough just
right of the green.</TE>
<TE>   With his feet pressed close to the wooden frameboards, he holed
the pitch from 21 feet for eagle to take a one-stroke lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm an aggressive player," he said. "I wasn't going to back away
from that flag."</TE>
<TE>   He handled the next test with ease, finding land on the
island-green 17th and holing a 28-foot birdie putt for a two-stroke
lead over Ames, who had closed with a five-under 67 about three hours
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Breathing room? Forget it.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of playing it safe off the 18th tee, Perks hit a driver
over the rough and behind the trees. He punched out to the fairway,
then went over the green.</TE>
<TE>   Needing to get up and down to avoid a playoff, Perks pitched in
from 29 feet. He raised his wedge as it trickled into the cup, then
slammed his cap into the grass to celebrate.</TE>
<TE>   Perks, who finished at eight-under 280, became the first player
since Hal Sutton in 1983 to win the Players Championship in his first
try. No one in the 28-year history of the tournament had ever made it
his first victory.</TE>
<TE>   Perks and Carl Paulson both asked themselves Saturday night, "Why
not us?"</TE>
<TE>   The question after another day of drama and disaster was, "How did
that happen?"</TE>
<TE>   The stunning finish came after Perks missed a two-foot par putt on
the 15th hole that dropped him out of a share of the lead. He showed
amazing resiliency and no quit, the traits that belong to winners of
the Players Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Perks won $1,080,000, the richest prize on the PGA Tour, but
that's not all. He earned a three-year invitation to the Masters and
an exemption into all the major championships this year.</TE>
<TE>   Paulson, the 54-hole leader by one shot over Perks, bogeyed four
consecutive holes on the front nine and closed with a 77 to finish at
284, along with Sergio Garcia (71), Scott Hoch (72), Billy Andrade
(72) and Jeff Sluman (74).</TE>
<TE>   Woods failed to become the first repeat winner in the Players
Championship.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't make a birdie until the 10th hole and finished with a
74, the first time he has been over par in the final round since the
Nissan Open two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Given the swirling winds and brown patches on the dry, firm
greens, Woods had a feeling that six or seven under par might be
enough.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wasn't able to get off to a good, solid start today and
post some birdies," he said. "I made my share of mistakes."</TE>

<KH>Mark Heisler ON THE NBA</KH>
<HD>Again, Lakers Have Answers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Fear this.</LD>
<LD>   Springtime for Phil Jackson in Mayberry. The townspeople picking
up their pitchforks and cowbells and heading to Arco Arena to see
their Kings play the hated Lakers in Games 1, 2, 5 and (shudder) 7 of
the West finals.</LD>
<LD>   At this point, although he steadfastly denies it--what, him
worry?--we suspect Jackson awakens, screaming, "No! Not there!
Anywhere but there!"</LD>
<TE>   Happily for Phil's eardrums, if not his peace of mind, his
twice-defending champions, who had been chilling for months, actually
took Sunday's game seriously and finally played like it, escaping
with a 97-96 victory that was more significant than its razor-thin
edge.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lead the season series, 2-1, with the last game in
Staples Center. Just as important, they learned something:</TE>
<TE>   They're still the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you guys need this one after last week?" someone asked Kobe
Bryant, coolest of the cool, afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "A little bit," said Bryant, grinning his little grin. "Show we
still got it."</TE>
<TE>   Yes, despite everything they say, they worry.</TE>
<TE>   It is the Lakers' oft-stated position they're the best, no one can
beat them but them, etc. Jackson was playing along, projecting serene
confidence, but may have become a tad concerned last week in Texas,
when they got their backsides shot up by assorted Mavericks and
Spurs.</TE>
<TE>   "Shaq [O'Neal] totally feels when playoff times comes.... and he
has more time to get ready.... it's going to be much more difficult
for teams to beat us," said Jackson before Sunday's game.</TE>
<TE>   "And it's hard to convince these guys otherwise because they've
been through it and they have an understanding that's deep within
them of what they can do. However, as a coach, I can't let them rest
on that at all."</TE>
<TE>   This was clearly no time to be resting on anything for anyone.
Home-court advantage hung in the balance. With it, the Kings would
even scare guys as cool as the Lakers; without it, the Kings would
still just be the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the Kings argue that point. As Chris Webber noted a week
ago, without home-court, they had "no shot."</TE>
<TE>   Then the Kings also had to prove they could beat the Lakers on
their home court, another problem.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last two seasons, counting playoff, the Kings, the
mightiest homers in the Western World, were 65-10 against everyone
else here, 1-4 against the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Oops: Make that 1-5.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings were ready, winning three in a row while the Lakers were
getting kicked around the Lone Star State.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday while the Kings finished off the Nuggets, their fans
started chanting, "Beat L.A.!"</TE>
<TE>   The Kings are, in fact, tougher, even deeper, but that still
doesn't mean they're better than the Lakers, and they would have to
play better than they played Sunday to reconfigure any balance of
power.</TE>
<TE>   Webber started the game in stirring fashion, stealing O'Neal's
opening tip, taking it in for a pretty reverse layup, going on to
score 14 points with five rebounds in the first quarter, as the Kings
went up by as many as eight points.</TE>
<TE>   Then he shot four for 18 the rest of the way.</TE>
<TE>   With Peja Stojakovic out, it was remarkable the Kings were able to
stay as close as they did. With 1:19 left, they were tied and O'Neal
was on the bench with six fouls.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the home team, the Lakers had the ball. The
Kings didn't get it back until Bryant had driven left from the top of
the key, hurtled down the lane, turned his body at the hoop to avoid
the oncoming traffic and laid the ball in backward.</TE>
<TE>   Then Bryant knocked in a 17-footer the next time down for a 97-94
lead, which would be enough, underlining another reality that seemed
to dim last week when players like Adrian Griffin and Bruce Bowen
were given credit for shutting an unusually-passive Kobe down: The
Lakers are still a two-superstar team.</TE>
<TE>   "How can the game be bigger for them?" Webber said afterward.
"They got two championships. Nothing's bigger than a championship
game so this was nothing to them....</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought they were gonna come in here and play their game.
When you've got two championships, you cannot panic, not worry, you
know? They've been through it before so....</TE>
<TE>   "I don't fall into all that, 'The Lakers are playing bad and Shaq
is this and that.' I think they're a hell of a team and we've still
got to beat them in a series to take that ring from them....</TE>
<TE>   "They're a great team. What more can I say? They're a great team.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny. If we had won this game, a lot of different questions
would have been asked."</TE>
<TE>   They had their chance. Getting the ball with 5.2 seconds left,
they ran a play that went into Webber on the baseline, who went up
from 10 feet and missed again.</TE>
<TE>   So today everyone is asking the same old questions: Who is out
there that can stand up to the Lakers when they're serious?</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, from now on, the Lakers will be serious because
they know nothing is automatic, nothing is for sure, won't you guys?</TE>
<TE>   Guys?</TE>

<HD>Drysdale Completes the Double Play</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer's two wins provided by Sarafan in New
Orleans and Bella Bellucci at Santa Anita.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A trainer who's busy on three fronts, Neil Drysdale won two stakes
Sunday, the richest the $700,000 Explosive Bid Handicap at the Fair
Grounds in New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   Sarafan's narrow win over favored Beat Hollow in Louisiana came
after Drysdale, who remained at Santa Anita, saddled Bella Bellucci,
at 4-5, for a half-length win in the $80,925 Santa Paula Stakes.</LD>
<LD>   Bella Bellucci, running for the first time since a third-place
finish in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Belmont Park five
months ago, gives Drysdale a solid contender for the Kentucky Oaks,
the race for 3-year-old fillies that will be run at Churchill Downs
on May 3, the day before the Kentucky Derby.</LD>
<TE>   Drysdale might also be represented in the Derby, the race he won
with Fusaichi Pegasus in 2000. Fusaichi Pegasus was Japanese-owned,
and on Wednesday at Aqueduct Drysdale will run Sunday Break,
Japanese-owned and bred in Japan, in an allowance race that could set
the colt up for the Wood Memorial on April 13. Fusaichi Pegasus won
the Wood in his final Derby prep.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday Break, winner of his last two races at Santa Anita, has yet
to run in a stake.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs another race before he moves up to (graded)
competition," Drysdale said. "If he runs well Wednesday, he'll come
back in the Wood."</TE>
<TE>   Gary Stevens will ride Sunday Break on Wednesday, when he faces
five rivals at 11/8 miles. The field also includes two horses trained
by Todd Pletcher, one of them Smoked Em, who was moved up from third
to second after a disqualification in the Whirlaway Stakes at
Aqueduct on Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Drysdale sent Sarafan to the Fair Grounds after the 5-year-old
gelding lost by a neck to Decarchy in the Jimmy Kilroe Handicap at
Santa Anita three weeks ago. Sunday's grass win, by a neck over Beat
Hollow, was Sarafan's first since last August and ended his six-race
losing streak. Even The Score, at 70-1, finished third in the
Explosive Bid, 21/2 lengths behind Beat Hollow. Northcote Road was
fourth. Hap, the second choice in the betting, was eighth and
California shippers Designed For Luck and Suances were 11th and 12th,
respectively, in the 14-horse field.</TE>
<TE>   Sarafan, ridden by Corey Nakatani, ran 11/8 miles on a firm course
in 1:484/5 and paid $19.40 for $2. The winner overtook Beat Hollow in
the last sixteenth of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "When I brought my horse to the outside at the eighth pole, he
kicked on," Nakatani said. "He was pretty impressive."</TE>
<TE>   During his losing streak, Sarafan had rung up two seconds and one
third, losing by less than a length in those three races.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been unlucky," Drysdale said. "He's lost some races that
maybe he should have won."</TE>
<TE>   At Santa Anita, Mike Smith rode Bella Bellucci in her win and
returned to register another stakes victory with Hugh Hefner in the
$139,125 Crystal Water Handicap. Hugh Hefner, trained by Marty Jones,
paid $16.20 in only his second start since finishing eighth in last
June's Belmont Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Hugh Hefner held off Spinelessjellyfish by a nose, with Native
Desert, the 2-1 favorite, finishing third.</TE>

<LD>The racing was suspenseful, the pace was fast, the passing was often,
the weather was chilly and the crowd was missing.</LD>
<LD>   That about sums up Sunday's Yamaha Indy 400, the inaugural Indy
Racing League race at California Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Hornish Jr., in talking about the race earlier in the week,
said, "On this track, it will come down to who's leading coming off
the fourth turn of the final lap."</LD>
<TE>   Which is precisely how it happened.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish, after taking the white flag with a lap to go in the
200-mile race, lost the lead to Jaques Lazier going through the
second turn, then took it back in a 200-mph side-by-side duel through
the fourth turn. The two were so close--Lazier on the inside, Hornish
on the outside--they brushed wheels a hundred yards from the finish.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew the only way to get a run [at Lazier] was from behind,
because he was hugging the white line," Hornish said. "I kept my foot
in it and I tried to go as fast as I could through the checkered
flag."</TE>
<TE>   The margin of victory for Hornish's yellow Pennzoil Panther was
0.0281 seconds--a few feet--over Lazier's blue Menard in a duel of
Chevrolet-powered Dallaras.</TE>
<TE>   It was 22-year-old Hornish's second victory in three races this
year in defense of his IRL championship. He also won the opening race
at Homestead, Fla., and finished third behind the Marlboro Penske
tandem of Helio Castroneves and Gil de Ferran a week ago in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   "Congratulations to Sam, he ran a good race," said Lazier, who
lives nearby in Alta Loma. "We touched on the last lap.... There is a
lot of side-by-side racing. The track is unbelievable. It's
nerve-wracking when cars start sliding next to each other."</TE>
<TE>   Hornish was surprised when he heard that the cars touched.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't really know we bumped. I'm glad it wasn't any more
exciting than what it was. It's always good to be able to run next to
Jaques. I know he's not going to do anything crazy, and I try not to
either."</TE>
<TE>   The dramatic final-lap passes ended the day much as it began, cars
passing and repassing in a high-speed chase around the two-mile
D-shaped oval.</TE>
<TE>   It had an IRL-record 39 lead changes among eight drivers--and that
only counts changes at the start-finish line. Hornish led for 73
laps, the most of any driver.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fastest race in IRL history, 179.345 mph, bettering the
175.276 mph set by Scott Goodyear, also in a Panther team car, at
Texas in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The winning margin was the second closest ever, Hornish having
edged Scott Sharp by 0.0188 at Texas in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish's victory increased his points lead over Castroneves, 141
to 115, with de Ferran next at 112. The Panther team also collected
$121,500 for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Laurent Redon of France was third, the highest-finishing
Infiniti-powered driver. He was more than six seconds behind the
leaders and just ahead of Penske's de Ferran and Castroneves and
Brazilian Felipe Giaffone in a blanket finish.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a long day, but luckily it was a long day because we come
back from the end," Redon said in broken English. "I think I pass a
really good time, especially at the end. It's always good when you
have a good car, because you can overtake people, instead somebody
overtake you.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really happy because we all new, I'm new on ovals, I'm new in
this series, and the team [Conquest Racing] is also new. I'm pretty
happy by today, yes."</TE>
<TE>   Former motocross champion Jeff Ward thrilled the sparse gathering
of an estimated 15,000 on the first lap when he got a hole-shot in
his Chip Ganassi G Force, racing from sixth to first by the time the
27-car field reached the third turn.</TE>
<TE>   Hornish took command the next time around and was never worse than
fifth the remaining 398 miles. For much of the race, his main
competition came from Eddie Cheever Jr. and his South African
protege, Tomas Scheckter, in a pair of Infiniti-powered cars.</TE>
<TE>   Both went out with sour engines, although Scheckter's demise was
more spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   He was running with the leaders on Lap 164 when he slowed and was
hit from the rear by Hideki Noda, sending both cars spinning into the
outer retaining wall. Neither driver was injured. It was the only
accident of the day.</TE>
<TE>   The day was even more disappointing for Cheever, the pole-sitter.
He was chasing Lazier, just ahead of Hornish, with only 10 laps
remaining when a plume of blue smoke erupted from the rear of his car
and his day was over.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I could have run Jaques down," said the 1998 Indy 500
winner. "I had Jaques, and then I didn't, and then I did. We kept
going back and forth. Hornish wasn't even in contention because he
was in our dirty air. I'm disappointed. I broke an engine with 18
miles to go."</TE>
<TE>   Cheever led for 33 laps, Scheckter for 28. Scheckter had the
fastest lap, 222.559 mph, on Lap 79, when he was chasing Castroneves
and Hornish. That was faster than Cheever's pole-winning 221.411.</TE>
<TE>   For a few laps late in the race, it appeared that the Lazier
brothers, Jaques and Buddy, might battle to the end as they were
racing side by side behind Cheever and Hornish. Buddy, the 1996
Indianapolis 500 winner, started 26th and the effort of getting close
to the front took its toll on the car and he faded to seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "This is last year's car, and it doesn't have the new aero update
kit," said Lazier, who crashed in Sunday morning practice and had to
start in his backup car. "I did everything I could on the restarts to
get myself up front, but after a while, the guys would just drive by
me on the outside."</TE>
<TE>   Disappointing were the Penske cars, which finished 1-2 last week
at Phoenix and 2-3 behind Hornish at Homestead. Although they
finished fourth and fifth, it never seemed as if they were in the
hunt.</TE>
<TE>   Said de Ferran: "The car was fantastic all day, we just didn't
have quite enough speed. I did everything I could on the restarts and
tried to stay in touch with the leaders, which worked out pretty well
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Castroneves: "It was fun out there today, there was a lot of
close racing. We had some trouble on our second pit stop, which put
us down a lap.</TE>
<TE>   "We worked hard for the rest of the race to catch up to the
leaders and I was able to get back on the lead lap. I tried my best
to get to the front, but unfortunately we just didn't have the speed
to win the race."</TE>
<TE>   John Menard, one of the IRL's staunchest supporters since Tony
George broke away from CART in 1996, was elated over the performance
of his driver, Jaques Lazier, and the IRL overall.</TE>
<TE>   On Lazier: "We were picking up a little push at the end and
Hornish wasn't. Every lap, Hornish was a little stronger, and we were
a little weaker."</TE>
<TE>   On the IRL: "You've got a lot of very good racers in this series
right now. Hemelgarn [Buddy Lazier], the Cheevers [Cheever and
Scheckter] are right there with the two guys out in front today.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows how close the competition is."</TE>

<HD>Hornish, Lazier Put U.S. Drivers on IRL Podium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the reasons Tony George formed the Indy Racing League was to
showcase American drivers, and with Sam Hornish Jr. and Jaques Lazier
finishing first and second Sunday in the Yamaha Indy 400 at
California Speedway, it was the best showing on the podium this
season by American drivers. There were 18 Americans in the field of
27, but foreign drivers took four of the top six positions.</LD>
<LD>   Through three races, foreign drivers have dominated, accounting
for five of the possible nine podium positions. Among top four
finishers, foreign drivers have had seven of 12. Among the top five,
it has been nine of 15. And among the top six it has been 11 of 18.</LD>
<LD>   "This is America, and anyone can prosper in the U.S.," said team
owner Ron Hemelgarn, whose driver, Buddy Lazier, finished seventh in
his backup car.</LD>
<TE>   "This league has a tremendous number of American drivers. It's
hard for the Americans to raise the dollars [for sponsorship] because
our sports marketing is fragmented with 15 different sports, and in
other countries, maybe there's just racing and soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fortunate because Buddy's a paid driver. He doesn't bring
money, he brings talent."</TE>
<TE>   Lazier started 26th because of a Sunday practice accident that
destroyed the primary car. His backup was last year's car, and he ran
it without the 2002 aero kit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doug Goad passed for the lead with 19 minutes remaining in the
shortened two-hour Grand-Am Cup Street Stock Series to give the
Powell Motorsports Corvette the Grand Sport I and overall victory on
the 2.8-mile, 21-turn road course.</TE>
<TE>   Goad, of Farmington Hills, Mich., and Devon Powell of Port Perry,
Canada, finished six seconds ahead of two Speedsource Porsches in the
61-lap event, their decisive pass coming on Lap 50. Paul Mears Jr.
and David Haskell, and Sylvain Tremblay and John Sturm, were second
and third in Porsche 993s. The race was scheduled for three hours,
but shortened because of weather.</TE>
<TE>   Terry Borcheller and Forest Barber, driving a BMW M3 for Bell
Motorsports, were 13th overall but won the GS II class when the two
cars racing for the lead crashed into each other. A Mustang driven by
Snipes Ford Motorsports' Charles Snipes tried to pass Max Q
Motorsports' Nick Longhi in a Mustang Cobra R with three laps
remaining, but initiated contact that dropped the Max Q car to sixth
in class and the Snipes car to seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Van Sicklen and San Pedro's Bob Endicott won the Sports
Touring I class and were 18th overall in an Acura Integra R. William
Fenton and Bob Beede, in an Acura Integra LS, were first in ST II and
33rd overall in the 54-car field.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robby Gordon could be announced any day as a driver in the
Indianapolis 500 for IRL team owner John Menard.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a strong possibility that's going to happen," said
Menard, who had Gordon drive for him in 1999 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   It is expected that backing will come from Gordon's Winston Cup
sponsor, Cingular.</TE>
<TE>   Team Rahal came to the speedway to race an IRL car for the first
time in preparation for the Indy 500. Jimmy Vasser qualified 16th and
finished ninth in his Chevrolet Dallara.</TE>
<TE>   "We learned about some areas that we are quite deficient," Vasser
said. "But it is better to learn that situation here than at Indy. It
was definitely a successful fact-finding tour for us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Robbie Buhl, who qualified fourth Saturday but crashed during his
cool-down lap, is expected to be released from Loma Linda University
Medical Center today. He suffered a concussion and was replaced by
Memo Gidley, who drove the backup car for the 30-minute practice
session before taking the green flag.</TE>
<TE>   Gidley, recognized as a super-sub in the rival Championship Auto
Racing Teams series, started 27th and finished 21st, 16 laps behind
the winner.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to hop into a car in even a perfect situation, and
even tougher to adapt during a race," Gidley said. "We didn't have
many laps in the car ... but we took the checkered [flag], which was
important for the team."</TE>
<TE>   Hideki Noda ran into the back of Tomas Scheckter on Lap 164 in the
race's only crash. Scheckter was fine but Noda was transported by
ambulance to Loma Linda after complaining of back pain, then
released.</TE>

<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>With 10 games remaining in the regular season, the Kings are in good
position heading down the stretch. But after Sunday's 4-0 loss at
Phoenix, they know they can't afford any slippage.</LD>
<LD>   "The schedule we're playing is ridiculous," defenseman Mathieu
Schneider said. "It's just a free fall right now and a lot of it is
how you get caught in the schedule.</LD>
<LD>   "We've been on both ends of it now. On certain nights, we've
caught teams tired and other nights, we've been tired. The key for us
now is to bounce back. We've talked about not losing two in a row and
we're looking ahead to Tuesday [at Vancouver]. This one is already
behind us."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For King center Eric Belanger, it's a case of one more week. After
being sidelined more than two months because of a wrist injury that
required surgery Jan. 29, he had hoped to return to the lineup for
the Kings' current four-game trip.</TE>
<TE>   Belanger was left behind in Los Angeles because his wrist did not
respond well after a brief workout Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't experience a setback. It just showed that my wrist is
not strong enough yet," said Belanger, who had one of the league's
best faceoff winning percentages at 58.33% before his injury.</TE>
<TE>   "It's best for me not to take any chances right now with the way
the team has been playing. I don't want to be at 85% when I come
back."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Forward Ian Laperriere returned to Los Angeles following Sunday's
game to be with his wife, Magali, who is scheduled to have a planned
C-section delivery this week. King Coach Andy Murray said it's
questionable whether Laperriere will be back with the team for
Tuesday's game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Veteran left wing Kelly Buchberger, who has been on injured
reserve since March 10 and has not played in seven games, is
traveling with the team and could be activated before the Kings
return home.</TE>

<HD>Coyotes Cool Off Red-Hot Kings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: Burke makes 25 saves and Phoenix stops L.A.'s
six-game winning streak with a 4-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LONNIE WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>The Kings may own San Jose but when it comes to the Phoenix Coyotes,
it's a different story.</LD>
<LD>   One day after defeating the Sharks for the fourth consecutive time
this season, the high-flying Kings were brought back down to earth on
Sunday by the Coyotes, who ended Los Angeles' six-game winning streak
with a 4-0 victory in front of 14,511 at America West Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Phoenix forwards Michal Handzus, Brian Savage, Shane Doan and
Daymond Langkow each scored a goal but it was goaltender Sean Burke's
25 saves that led the Coyotes, who finished the regular season
unbeaten against the Kings at 2-0-3. Of the five meetings between the
teams this season, Sunday's game was the first not to go into
overtime.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't help the Kings that their league-leading power play had
an off night. The Kings failed to score in five man-advantage
situations, while the Coyotes scored one power-play goal in eight
attempts.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a great game for us, that's all. It was bound to
happen," King winger Adam Deadmarsh said.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't know what it is. We've definitely struggled against
[Phoenix] this year."</TE>
<TE>   Because the Kings have one less victory than San Jose, they
dropped into second place in the Pacific Division with 85 points. The
Coyotes, with their eighth win in a row at home, moved ahead of
Dallas and into a tie with St. Louis for sixth place in the Western
Conference with 82 points.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings, who had not lost a game in almost three weeks, started
off flat, and it cost them.</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix scored two goals in the first period against King
goaltender Felix Potvin, who was replaced by Jamie Storr at the start
of the second. Potvin, who has played in 98 of 108 games since being
acquired by the Kings last year, didn't play badly but did give up
two goals on 10 shots.</TE>
<TE>   Handzus scored the Coyotes' opening goal 5 minutes 48 seconds into
the game. Veteran winger Brad May got the play going when he hit the
right post from the left circle, and moments later, Handzus jumped on
a loose puck and scored his 14th goal. The Coyotes' second goal came
on a power play. With the Kings short-handed, thanks to a slashing
penalty on Adam Mair, Phoenix found the net again on a perfectly
executed goal by Savage off a Daniel Briere assist 9:36 into the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   "We were weak in the first period," King defenseman Philippe
Boucher said. "We should have come out a lot stronger because we know
they come out strong at home all of the time.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no excuse for the first 20 minutes we played. We should
know that you have to play a full 60 to win games. The way the
standings are, anyone from first place to last can beat you if you
don't play a full game."</TE>
<TE>   With his team down, 2-0, King Coach Andy Murray decided to give
Storr his first action since Feb. 27.</TE>
<TE>   "It was more of an attempt to shake our team up as much as
anything," Murray said. "I thought it had the desired effect. We came
out hard in the second period and had multiple chances to get back
into the game."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for the Kings, their chances came up empty against
Burke, who recorded his fifth shutout of the season and 31st of his
career.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big win for us," said Burke, who was also helped when
shots by Cliff Ronning and Bryan Smolinski deflected off either the
crossbar or a post. "We had to come in and earn everything we got."</TE>
<TE>   Said Phoenix Coach Bob Francis: "Burke takes a lot of things
personally. He was great for us tonight."</TE>
<TE>   Phoenix was able to maintain a two-goal edge in a scoreless second
period and then took a 3-0 lead on Doan's goal 5:20 into the third.
Doan scored his 16th of the season when he beat Storr with a
deflection off a Briere slap shot from the blue line.</TE>
<TE>   Langkow finished the scoring with an empty-net goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we were as mentally sharp as we wanted," said
Murray. "We had the right intentions to do certain things but we just
didn't execute.</TE>
<TE>   "They took advantage of a team that had played the day before."</TE>

<HD>Series Have Serious Flaws</HD>
<DH>Commentary: As crowds dwindle, the IRL and CART's
miscalculation becomes more obvious.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Indy Racing League, the outfit that puts on the Indianapolis 500,
made its West Coast debut with a crackling good race Sunday at
California Speedway in Fontana.</LD>
<LD>   Sam Hornish Jr., the defending series champion, caught Jaques
Lazier coming off the fourth turn on the last lap--their cars even
brushed tires--and won the Yamaha 400.</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of people were thrilled.</LD>
<TE>   "The Yamaha 400?" went the prerace irreverence? "Does that mean
there's a Yamaha for each of the fans?"</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, was nowhere near accurate. There probably were,
oh, 15,000 or so people on hand for the race, not counting, drivers,
pit crews, track workers and media folks. At a facility where, next
month, a NASCAR Winston Cup stock car race will attract a sellout
crowd of more than 92,000.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of sellout crowds, one of 180,000 took in the Winston Cup
race Sunday at the half-mile bullring in Bristol, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   CART, the outfit that doesn't put on the Indy 500, even though its
drivers pilot similar open-wheel cars, has been racing at California
Speedway since 1997 and, although it has never experienced the kind
of non-crowd the IRL drew Sunday, it also has never come close to
selling out.</TE>
<TE>   CART's showcase California race--indeed, it's the jewel of the
entire series--is the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach, which will be
back again in mid-April. Because it's a street race, with people
coming and going, there probably never has been an accurate crowd
estimate. It was a given, though, that the figures went up every
year.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, the estimates were down. And there were visible gaps
in the bleachers where there never were gaps before.</TE>
<TE>   So, what does all this tell us?</TE>
<TE>   In a day and age when auto racing, stock car style, has never been
hotter--NASCAR's popularity rivals the NFL's--open-wheel racing,
which many consider a far purer version of the speed sport, is
becoming a harder sell, practically by the minute.</TE>
<TE>   Can you imagine another major sporting event in Southern
California drawing only 16% of capacity? You'd think more than 15,000
would show up by accident for a big-time race.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't used to be this way. In a simpler day, when there was only
one group sanctioning and promoting Indy car racing, it was a
thriving fruit on the sporting tree.</TE>
<TE>   Then Tony George, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway,
took issue with the way CART was running things and started his own
group, the IRL. That was in the mid-'90s, and there hasn't been a
minute's peace ever since.</TE>
<TE>   George said the IRL would be run on American ovals, would provide
an avenue to Indy for young American drivers--foreign drivers
constituted a third of the field Sunday--and would be cost conscious.
He also, in effect, legislated CART drivers out of the Indy 500.</TE>
<TE>   CART said it would continue to run street and road courses, as
well as ovals, in this country and others, that it made no difference
where its drivers came from, and who needed the Indy 500 anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Now, it seems, everybody miscalculated.</TE>
<TE>   With the exception of the Indianapolis 500, the IRL remains, for
the most part, a struggling series--as witness Sunday's race here.
True, the race was a late addition to California Speedway's schedule
and the IRL has no history here. Still, it has been around for half a
dozen years and any semi-knowledgeable racing fan is aware of it.</TE>
<TE>   And CART, for all of its bluster, has become a series in search of
a focus. It's best-selling races are the ones it puts on overseas, to
the dismay of its sponsors, who want to sell their products to the
U.S. public, and think the Indy 500 is a great place to do that.</TE>
<TE>   So now, it also seems, everybody needs everybody else.</TE>
<TE>   After several years, George rescinded the rule that kept CART
teams out of the 500 and they, at great expense, considering the vast
difference in engines, have been filtering back the last several
years. CART, in rules revisions for next season, will have cars very
similar to the IRL's, so that there can be driver interchange. The
gap, apparently, is narrowing.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, they are very distinct operations.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Roger Penske, one of CART's founding fathers, announced
that his team, at the urging of sponsoring Marlboro, would be moving
to the IRL. His team won't be the last.</TE>
<TE>   But CART certainly isn't going to quit, so the beat goes on.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a tremendous product [in open-wheel racing] but we
haven't been able to communicate that properly," Penske said before
Sunday's race. "There's been so much strife [in recent years], we've
never been able to talk about it. We haven't been able to get people
to focus [on the racing].</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, there are two open-wheel series and it's a simple fact
of life that we need one.... We've got to have a consistent series
and we've got to have just one."</TE>
<TE>   Yup, and soon. Trouble is, no one has figured out how to do that.
Somebody had better. Before everybody who used to care goes on to
something else.</TE>
<TE>   Or has that already happened?</TE>

<HD>Fisher's Number Comes Up</HD>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In their most critical regular-season game so far, Phil Jackson
played Derek Fisher at point guard for 38 minutes on Sunday, and
Fisher had 16 points, four assists and one turnover.</LD>
<LD>   The starting point guard, Lindsey Hunter, played three
minutes--the first three--and spent the rest of the game, a 97-96
victory over the Sacramento Kings, on the bench, his purple warmup
zipped to his chin.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd hate to be predictable," Jackson said.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, the soft-spoken Hunter, whose shot has eluded him in
recent weeks, said he has felt a little off.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need to get some balance back in my step," he said.
"That's all I worry about, how I feel, if I'm feeling quick and
alive. But, I'm healthy enough to be playing."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, as Hunter has groped for his game, Fisher has
become decisive.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things both Lindsey and I can bring," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Considering Rick Adelman once was depicted as Adolf Hitler in a
Jackson shoot-'em-up flick, primarily because of the hair and
mustache combo at the time, there's no surprise he has become the
Official Jackson Contrarian.</TE>
<TE>   If Jackson believed Sunday's game was critical to the Pacific
Division race, which he said last week, then it could not possibly
be.</TE>
<TE>   "Really, well," Adelman said. "He obviously knows a lot more than
everybody else, me included.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Phil's just talking. But, what amazes me is people keep
listening and taking him seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Then, eventually, Adelman got around to making Jackson's point,
which he must have hated.</TE>
<TE>   "For the division," he concluded, "it's a big game."</TE>
<TE>   * The Kings had been 26-0 when leading after the first quarter at
Arco Arena. They led, 30-27, on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Lakers Are in Good Hands</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Bryant takes over after O'Neal fouls out
and scores eight of team's final 10 points to lead L.A. past
Sacramento, 97-96.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Self-image being what it is in the NBA, and the regular season being
what it is to the Lakers, it often takes a special circumstance for
the unordinary, and that is where Kobe Bryant dropped off his game on
Sunday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   At the junction of playing it out and playing for something, at
the moment Phil Jackson surrendered the Laker psyches to whatever it
was those 12 men desired, Bryant was devastating, and the Lakers were
just good enough to beat the Sacramento Kings, 97-96, at Arco Arena.
Bryant scored eight of their final 10 points, the last four after
Shaquille O'Neal had fouled out, and Chris Webber missed a shot just
before the buzzer.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, Bryant, who scored 29 points, said he favored what the
victory here, where the Kings had been 32-3, confirmed for a league
that might have started to wonder.</LD>
<TE>   "When the playoffs start, the title has to come through L.A.,"
Bryant said. "I don't care what your record is."</TE>
<TE>   Found in some parts to be vulnerable, particularly at the end of a
week that saw the twice-defending NBA champions lose in Dallas and
San Antonio and win without soul against Detroit, the Lakers moved
within a half-game of the Kings in the Pacific Division. They have 13
games to play, the last against the Kings in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a big game," Bryant said. "Phil had talked to us about
getting home-court advantage, and this being a crucial game if we
wanted to make that happen."</TE>
<TE>   So, on go those races, seemingly of only occasional interest to
the Lakers, with the Kings not yet together enough or healthy enough
or high-tech enough to leave behind the Lakers, the Mavericks or
Spurs. They played Sunday without forward Peja Stojakovic, their
second-leading scorer.</TE>
<TE>   At the very end, a good seven-tenths of a second after it should
have been the very end but who's counting, Webber crashed to his
knees, shortly after his short jumper crashed into the rim as time
expired.</TE>
<TE>   From 93-93 with 1:19 left, Bryant had scored on a darting,
twisting layup and a 16-foot fade-away jumper, and the Kings had
scored on a free throw by Christie and a short jump hook by Webber.</TE>
<TE>   When Rick Fox's long jump-shot attempt was blocked by Vlade Divac,
there were 5.2 seconds remaining and a 97-96 Laker lead.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had called a timeout with 13.5 seconds on the game
clock and nine seconds on the shot clock. Upon the Divac block, the
shot-clock buzzer sounded and the game clock stalled with 5.2 seconds
left, not 4.5.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere, the Kings gained seven-tenths of a second.</TE>
<TE>   "That math," Jackson said, "just baffles me."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings directed the ball to Webber, their All-Star and famously
courted former free agent who seconds before had drawn them to within
a point, and he dug in against Robert Horry.</TE>
<TE>   Though he had 14 points and five rebounds in the first quarter,
Webber had missed 13 of his previous 17 field-goal attempts as he
leaned against Horry, turned to the baseline, and flipped a potential
game-winner toward the basket.</TE>
<TE>   "When guys spin," Horry said, "I try to get up under them so they
have to think about it.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that kind of messed him up. He wasn't expecting to be
that low."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Horry said, "Webber had a good look and we were very
fortunate he missed it."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Webber found himself with a difficult angle, and his shot
struck the rim nearest to him, then bounded to the other side. The
final buzzer sounded as the rebound fell.</TE>
<TE>   "That was never in doubt, that game," Jackson said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his foul trouble, O'Neal had 21 points and seven rebounds
and left without speaking to the media, which is becoming a habit.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher played 38 minutes--healthy starter Lindsey Hunter
played just three--and scored 16 points, including a 20-foot jumper
from the corner that gave the Lakers a 93-92 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the first quarter, after Divac and Scot Pollard had fallen
near the basket, O'Neal asked referee Tim Donaghy to make them stand
up to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Make them play," he said. "Don't let them flop the whole game."</TE>
<TE>   Donaghy nodded but did O'Neal no favors. O'Neal was assessed his
third foul five minutes into the second quarter and played only 16
first-half minutes. He had effective stretches in the second half,
but at the end watched from the bench, leaving Bryant, mostly.</TE>

<HD>Finally, Diaz Gets a Title</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUCSON</DL>
<LD>Laura Diaz knew she had the game and the poise to win. She just
didn't have the trophies to prove it.</LD>
<LD>   That changed Sunday, when Diaz, only a month into her fourth
season on the LPGA Tour, beat Hall of Famer Juli Inkster by a stroke
in the Welch's-Circle K Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Diaz made a three-foot birdie putt on the last hole to cap a
four-under-par 68 and win her first professional title with an
18-under-par 270. Inkster, the 1999 champion, led after the second
and third rounds, but shot a closing 71.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's great," Diaz said. "But I won against 143 other
people, and I won against the golf course. You know, 144 players teed
it up at the beginning of the week, and I took the least number of
strokes."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz finished second four times and had eight other top 10
finishes last year--good enough to win $751,466 and place ninth on
the money list--all without a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as it's been talked about--all of my seconds, no
victories yet--I'm relieved," she said. "The question, 'When are you
going to get a victory?' I got a victory. The question is over."</TE>
<TE>   Inkster followed birdies on Nos. 3 and 10 with bogeys on Nos. 4
and 11, and squandered a birdie at the sixth when she had a bogey on
No. 8. The trend cost her the win.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Park matched the lowest round of the tournament with a 64
and tied Kelly Robbins, who shot 67, for third place at 273.</TE>
<TE>   Karrie Webb, with a 67, and amateur Lorena Ochoa of the University
of Arizona who has won her last six college tournaments, shot 68 to
finish four shots off the lead.</TE>
<TE>   The five-player group at 275 included Annika Sorenstam, the
two-time defending champion, and 1988 Tucson winner Laura Davies.</TE>

<DH>Midwest Regional: Kansas runs past Oregon, 104-86, to earn
another trip to Final Four.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE PUCIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Now this is a Kansas team John Wooden can get behind. These Jayhawks
don't mistake activity for accomplishment.</LD>
<LD>   The Jayhawks ran and ran Sunday against Oregon. Roy Williams'
teams always run. But these Jayhawks also rebounded relentlessly and
left bruises, physical and psychological. They played bumper-car
defense. No Jayhawk was afraid to take a dent or leave one.</LD>
<LD>   And for the third time under Williams, and the first time since
1993, Kansas is going to the Final Four. The No. 1-seeded Jayhawks
beat No. 2-seeded Oregon, 104-86, in the finals of the NCAA Midwest
Regional. Kansas, looking for its first national title since 1988 and
its first under Williams, will play Maryland in the national
semifinals Saturday in Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   Recent Kansas teams have always loved the fast break, excelled at
the pretty layups and thrived on making open jump shots. But when the
tournament came and officials' whistles sounded less often and games
slogged into torturous half-court battles, the Jayhawks would always
smash into a team either bigger, stronger or meaner. While the
Jayhawks would be running around and shooting jump shots, some
Illinois or Texas El Paso would push their way to layups and rebounds
and wins.</TE>
<TE>   But in this Kansas team, Williams has developed a group whose
frantic activity is matched with a strong blend of athleticism and
aggressiveness. These aren't the lanky Jayhawks who are the pushees
when NCAA push play comes to shove. These Jayhawks run and shoot and
jump, and they also crash and bump and pummel.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas (33-3) outrebounded Oregon, 63-34. Drew Gooden (20) and
Nick Collison (15) combined outrebounded the Ducks. This was the
first team to reach 100 points in an NCAA regional final since UCLA
in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "We were a little bigger and more mobile inside," Williams said.
This was an understatement. Collison, a 6-foot-9, 250-pound junior,
and Gooden, a 6-10, 230-pound junior, were mobile enough to take
turns stifling Oregon's 6-7 Luke Jackson, holding Jackson to 10
points and forcing Jackson into four-of-16 shooting. And then they
were strong enough to score big--Collison had 25 points with his 15
rebounds and Gooden had 18 points to go with his 20 rebounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough," Oregon forward Robert Johnson said, "because if
you blocked out one, the other would come out of nowhere. Collison
and Gooden were a great one-two punch and we couldn't fend them off."</TE>
<TE>   Twice the Ducks (26-9) made a run at Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   The Jayhawks had opened a 40-28 lead with 5:39 left in the first
half. Less than three minutes later, Oregon tied the score with the
help of three-point baskets by Luke Ridnour and Freddie Jones (32
points) and three turnovers by Kansas. But the Jayhawks scored eight
of the final 10 points of the half. Collison turned an offensive
rebound into a reverse layup for the final basket with 3.6 seconds
left and the Jayhawks led, 48-42.</TE>
<TE>   Midway through the second half, Kansas led, 73-59, and seemed on
the verge of busting the game open when Oregon had one, last frantic
push. Anthony Lever, a senior backup guard, scored three
three-pointers, Jones converted a layup off a turnover and suddenly
the Kansas lead was down to five, 77-72, with 8:05 left.</TE>
<TE>   But by the time the Ducks scored again, Kansas was ahead, 87-72,
and six of those 10 points came after the Jayhawks had grabbed an
offensive rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Ducks couldn't run anymore. The Jayhawks didn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   Gooden walked into the postgame news conference barefoot. "I've
got my shoes off," he said, "because my feet are hurtin' me. My dogs
are hurtin' man. It was a fun game to play in, a really fun game. It
hurt my feet but it was a fun game."</TE>
<TE>   "Kansas was relentless today," Oregon Coach Ernie Kent said. "I
told my players Kansas had two future NBA players [Gooden and
Collison] in the paint and that was going to be the key, how we
handled the inside game. It was frustrating. Their system outlasted
our system.</TE>
<TE>   "And I think, if Kansas plays the way it did today, that Kansas
has a great chance to win this thing. I'll be one of the guys rooting
for Roy in Atlanta."</TE>
<TE>   The only time the Kansas players quit grinning was when the topic
of Williams' failure to win a national title was brought up.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of doubters out there about Coach Williams,"
Gooden said. "Coach has taken a lot of heat about not reaching
certain goals. Coach Williams is a great coach. You can't take
anything away from Coach Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "Just stop giving him heat for not winning the championship.
That's not the only thing that matters."</TE>
<TE>   Especially not on this day. What mattered was running and
rebounding, pushing and shoving, scoring and winning and laughing and
moving on to Atlanta.</TE>

<HD>It Isn't Easy, but Busch Gets His First Victory</HD>
<DH>Motor racing: Gamble in the pits pays off and he wins
contentious Winston Cup race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BRISTOL, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Kurt Busch gambled on pit strategy and bumped Jimmy Spencer out of
his way Sunday to win the first race of his career in an event that
ended with tempers flaring and another pit road confrontation at
Bristol Motor Speedway.</LD>
<LD>   Busch opted not to follow leader Dale Earnhardt Jr. into the pits
following the 13th caution of the NASCAR Winston Cup Food City 500,
inheriting the lead with 85 laps to go.</LD>
<LD>   He briefly gave it up to Spencer, then knocked him out of the way
to take it back and go unchallenged the rest of the way to give Roush
Racing its second win of the season.</LD>
<TE>   "There's nothing better than the first one," said Busch, who got
out of his car at the finish line, grabbed the checkered flag from an
official and carried it around the track on his victory lap.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer finished second, Ricky Rudd was third and was followed by
Earnhardt Jr. and Bobby Labonte.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Kenseth, who gave Roush its first victory this year, was
sixth. Rookie Jimmie Johnson finished seventh, Jerry Nadeau--his
Hendrick Motorsports teammate--was eighth. Rusty Wallace and Kevin
Harvick rounded out the top 10.</TE>
<TE>   It was a typical Bristol race, with bumping and banging around the
.533-mile bullring beginning as soon as the green flag fell. It led
to 14 cautions and the usual post-race confrontations.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt Jr. and Robby Gordon banged each other several times on
the track and it boiled over on pit road after the race.</TE>
<TE>   Earnhardt made contact with Gordon as he grazed by him after the
cars had come off the track and Gordon responded by spinning him out.</TE>
<TE>   It was similar to this race a year ago, when Tony Stewart put Jeff
Gordon into a retaliatory spin on pit road following the event.
Stewart drew a $10,000 fine and a long stint on probation for the
act.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer and Busch traded their own verbal barbs in their post-race
comments with Spencer objecting to the way the 23-year-old Busch
moved him out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   Busch, using a similar pit strategy to the one Elliott Sadler
followed to win here a year ago, went 157 laps on his final set of
tires.</TE>
<TE>   That gave him the lead on the restart, and Spencer moved in on
Busch's bumper and muscled his way into the lead coming off Turn 4 on
Lap 444.</TE>
<TE>   But in Turn 2 of the next lap, Busch fought back and bumped his
way back into the lead. Spencer nearly lost control of his car on the
contact, but saved it, although he lost a lot of ground in his bid to
challenge for the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Busch was holding on to his lead until Hermie Sadler slid into the
Turn 4 wall on Lap 478 to bring out the final yellow. That allowed
Spencer to get up on Busch's rear bumper, but he never could catch
him.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, injured in a wreck last week at Darlington, was unable to
complete the race and had to turn his car over to relief driver Todd
Bodine.</TE>
<TE>   Suffering from a sore back and driving while wearing a device
designed to relieve the pain, Stewart led for 74 laps and was running
in third when he began to tire.</TE>
<TE>   His crew tried to coax him to stay in the car, encouraging him to
drink fluids under a long caution and focus on finishing the final
140 laps.</TE>
<TE>   But he spun his car out shortly after the race went back to green
and radioed in that he couldn't go on. Bodine got in, came out in
21st place, and managed a 15th place finish in the Pontiac.</TE>

<HD>Wallace Is Chairman of the Boards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The secret is out about one of the league's best defensive players.</LD>
<LD>   Ben Wallace set an NBA season high with 28 rebounds, scored 13
points and blocked six shots as the Detroit Pistons beat the Boston
Celtics, 109-101, Sunday at Auburn Hills, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   "This was definitely his coming-out party," said Joe Dumars, the
Pistons' president and former star shooting guard. "People saw what
he's been doing for us for two years."</LD>
<TE>   Each time Wallace grabbed a rebound, a white T-shirt with a red
'R' was handed out to fans in the fourth row behind the scorers'
table.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to wrap those T-shirts all around the arena," Wallace
said with a grin. "But I think they were running out, so I slowed
down."</TE>
<TE>   The Pistons are showing no signs of slowing down the momentum they
picked up two months ago. They have won 22 of 30 games, and five of
six.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Stackhouse had 30 points, eight assists and eight rebounds
and Cliff Robinson had 20 points and seven assists for the Pistons,
who kept their 31/2-game lead over Milwaukee in the Central Division
and stayed close to New Jersey for the best record in the Eastern
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Pierce scored 35 points and Antoine Walker had 28 for Boston,
which has lost four of five.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 110, Orlando 85--The Bucks shot 62.3% through three
quarters to build the lead to as much as 27 at Milwaukee. The Magic
played without the injured Tracy McGrady and two other top scorers,
then lost Troy Hudson in the third quarter after he took a hard
spill.</TE>
<TE>   Glenn Robinson had 25 points and 10 rebounds to help the Bucks end
a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady, the NBA's fourth-leading scorer, sat out the game after
back spasms forced him out of Friday's game against Charlotte. The
Magic already was without Mike Miller (sprained ankle) and Grant Hill
(ankle surgery), who has been sidelined most of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 92, Washington 91--Michael Jordan committed a costly
turnover and missed a potential game-winning jumper at the buzzer at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Davis stole the ball from Jordan and made a layup to give
Toronto a 92-91 lead with 15.7 seconds left. Jordan, guarded by
Jerome Williams down the stretch, missed an 18-foot jumper as time
ran out, sealing the victory for the Raptors.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, playing his third game since returning from knee surgery,
had 14 points in 23 minutes off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 99, Indiana 84--Jamal Mashburn matched a season high
with 36 points and Baron Davis added 21 points and 11 assists at
Indianapolis to help the Hornets move past the Pacers in the Eastern
Conference playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte moved into sole possession of seventh place in the
conference with the victory, which extended its winning streak to
six, the longest in the East.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 90, New York 82--The 76ers won their first game since
learning that star guard Allen Iverson would be out four to six weeks
because of a broken bone in his left hand.</TE>
<TE>   The Knicks used three three-point baskets by Latrell Sprewell
during an 18-9 run to close within three with 1:13 left at
Philadelphia. But the 76ers scored seven straight points, capped by
Speedy Claxton's three-point play, to seal the win.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 116, Atlanta 102--Jason Kidd made two consecutive
three-pointers to ignite a late run that carried the Nets to a
franchise-record 10th straight home victory.</TE>
<TE>   The victory, which put the Nets on the verge of clinching a
playoff berth, came with a price. Kenyon Martin picked up yet another
flagrant foul for elbowing Shareef Abdur-Rahim in the face with 9:06
left. It gives him eight flagrant-foul related points, which means he
will be suspended for the next two games.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 116, Golden State 114--Kenny Thomas scored a career-high
31 points and Steve Francis had 24 at Oakland as the Rockets ended
their four-game losing streak and extended the Warriors' streak to 10
games.</TE>

<HD>Capriati Has Problems, but Manages to Win</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One game from defeat, top-ranked Jennifer Capriati overcame an
erratic serve and rallied Sunday to defeat Anastasia Myskina, 3-6,
7-5, 6-2, in the third round of the Nasdaq-100 Open at Key Biscayne,
Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Capriati lost more than half of the points when she served,
double-faulting 10 times and holding serve only six of 14 games.</LD>
<LD>   But Myskina, seeded 32nd, also struggled to hold. She served for
the match at 5-4 in the second set but lost the next three games and
the set, and after Myskina took a 2-1 lead in the final set, Capriati
finally found her form and won the final five games.</LD>
<TE>   Three other seeded women had a much easier time.</TE>
<TE>   No. 2 Venus Williams was leading Mariana Diaz-Oliva, 6-2, 1-0,
when the Argentine retired because of a strained lower back. No. 3
Martina Hingis lost only five points in the opening set and routed
Tatiana Poutchek, 6-0, 6-1, in 41 minutes. No. 8 Serena Williams
needed only 46 minutes to beat Katarina Srebotnik, 6-1, 6-0.</TE>
<TE>   No. 7 Jelena Dokic, who has won only two matches since straining
her right thigh in early February, lost to Anne Kremer, 6-3, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   In men's play, No. 9 Andre Agassi beat Augustin Calleri, 6-3, 6-2,
but there were three upsets. No. 2 Juan Carlos Ferrero lost to Adrian
Voinea, 7-6 (6), 1-6, 6-2; No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov lost to 1998
champion Marcelo Rios, 6-4, 7-6 (4) and No. 7 Sebastien Grosjean was
beaten by Gaston Gaudio, 7-6 (7), 4-6, 6-1.</TE>
<TE>   Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson, seeded eighth, beat
Guillermo Coria, 6-1, 6-4, and will play Agassi on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi, who turns 32 next month, was the oldest player to reach
the third round, but as the tournament begins its second week, he may
be the man to beat.</TE>
<TE>   Fully healed from a wrist injury that forced him to sit out the
Australian Open, the four-time Key Biscayne champion looked sharp in
his first two matches.</TE>
<TE>   Winter Sports</TE>
<TE>   Magdalena Forsberg completed biathlon's World Cup Grand Slam for
the second year in a row despite finishing eighth in her farewell
race, a 12.5-kilometer mass start at Oslo.</TE>
<TE>   The 34-year-old Swede, who is retiring as the winningest biathlete
ever, added the mass-start championship to the overall, sprint and
pursuit titles she won after a disappointing Winter Olympics last
month.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to stop one day," Forsberg said. "It was a perfect place
to end my career. But I felt sad in the morning and tears came into
my eyes when I dressed before the race."</TE>
<TE>   Raphael Poiree of France won the men's race and clinched the World
Cup overall title.</TE>
<TE>   Poiree, married to Norwegian star Liv Grete Poiree, skied with
French and Norwegian flags down the final straightaway and crossed
the line 17.9 seconds ahead of Germany's Sven Fischer.</TE>
<TE>   Frode Andresen of Norway finished third, 26.5 seconds back, after
missing five targets.</TE>
<TE>   Poiree, who had two misses, has three consecutive mass-start wins
at the world championship level. He was unbeaten in mass-start races
on the World Cup circuit.</TE>
<TE>   College Hockey</TE>
<TE>   Jim Abbott scored twice, including the game-winner with 2:39 left,
as New Hampshire beat Cornell, 4-3, at Worcester, Mass., to earn a
trip to the NCAA Frozen Four.</TE>
<TE>   New Hampshire (30-6-3) will play in the national semifinals at St.
Paul, Minn., on April 4 against Maine (25-10-7), which beat Boston
University, 4-3. Michigan will play Minnesota in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Colin Hemingway also had a pair of goals and Matt Carney stopped
15 shots as the Wildcats, the top-ranked team in the nation, won
their 10th consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   New Hampshire has not appeared in the Frozen Four since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Tricia Guest scored a tiebreaking goal with 4:56 left and
Minnesota Duluth beat Brown, 3-2, at Durham, N.H, to win its second
consecutive NCAA women's hockey title.</TE>
<TE>   Guest, a sophomore, skated in alone, shot between the legs of a
defender and scored between the pads of Pam Dreyer.</TE>
<TE>   Kristy Zamora of Brown (25-8-2), the tournament most valuable
player, scored her second goal with six minutes left in the second
period to tie the score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   The goal was Zamora's 35th of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota Duluth (24-6-4), a third-year program that lost only one
senior from last year's national championship team, reached the final
by beating Niagara, 3-2, in a semifinal Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Chris George, Chris Kenady and John Lilley each scored
third-period goals to help the Ice Dogs defeat the Colorado Gold
Kings, 4-2, at Long Beach Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Montana fired men's basketball Coach Don Holst, even though he
took the Grizzlies to the NCAA tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Dougherty, an assistant coach at Kansas, is expected to be
introduced today as Texas Christian's men's basketball coach,
replacing the retired Billy Tubbs.</TE>

<LD>Mike Comrie scored his 30th goal of the season and Tommy Salo stopped
22 shots, and the Edmonton Oilers beat the Vancouver Canucks, 2-0,
Sunday night at Vancouver, Canada.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Smyth also scored for the Oilers, who won their season-best
fifth game in a row and moved into a tie with Dallas for eighth place
in the Western Conference.</LD>
<LD>   The loss was Vancouver's second in a row after five consecutive
victories and left the Canucks three points behind the Stars and
Oilers.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas has played two fewer games than Vancouver and Edmonton.</TE>
<TE>   Comrie opened the scoring 8:38 into the first period when he
banged home a rebound from the side of an empty net just as the first
penalty in a two-man Edmonton power play expired.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Washington 2--Randy Robitaille had a goal and two
assists to help the Penguins get their first home-ice victory in
regulation time since Jan. 23, when they defeated Tampa Bay, 5-1.</TE>
<TE>   They had four overtime victories, six losses and a tie since then.</TE>
<TE>   Robitaille had one of three second-period goals that put the game
away and helped the Penguins go 2-0-2 against the Capitals this
season.</TE>
<TE>   An in-season waiver wire pickup from the Kings, Robitaille has
nine points in his last five games.</TE>
<TE>   Jaromir Jagr's turnover led to a 2-on-1 against Olaf Kolzig at
11:55 and Robitaille slammed in Ville Niemenin's pass to put
Pittsburgh ahead, 4-1.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo 3, Ottawa 2--Eric Rasmussen scored 1:27 into overtime at
Ottawa.</TE>
<TE>   Sabre defenseman Brian Campbell scored with 3:05 left in
regulation to tie the score and Rasmussen put a rebound of Maxim
Afinogenov's shot past Patrick Lalime to raise Buffalo's overtime
record to 4-1-9.</TE>
<TE>   J.P. Dumont also scored for the Sabres, who are tied with the New
York Rangers for 10th place in the Eastern Conference with 70 points.</TE>
<TE>   Buffalo is within three points of Montreal for the eighth and
final playoff spot in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Tampa Bay 3--Bill Guerin scored a breakaway goal with
24.5 seconds left in overtime at Tampa, Fla., enabling the Bruins to
win their fifth consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have a four-point lead over Philadelphia for the best
record in the Eastern Conference. Boston has played three more games
than the Flyers.</TE>
<TE>   Vaclav Prospal had two goals for Tampa Bay, which had a franchise
record-tying seven-game unbeaten streak end.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 4, St. Louis 3--Eric Daze scored his second goal of the
game on a power play with 1:18 left in overtime at Chicago to lead
the Blackhawks.</TE>
<TE>   Daze, positioned at the edge of the crease, scored on a backhand
rebound of a shot by Alex Zhamnov to end the Blackhawks' six-game
winless streak.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finally, four.</LD>
<LD>   The teams that will meet in Atlanta to play for the NCAA title are
neither the four most folks expected nor some outlandish group of
mid-major miracles.</LD>
<LD>   Just four great basketball programs, two that have won
before--Indiana and Kansas--and two others trying to win their first
NCAA title: Maryland and Oklahoma.</LD>
<TE>   Who will be the one on April 1?</TE>
<TE>   Kansas--the only team other than Duke to be ranked No. 1 this
season--deserves the role of favorite. The Jayhawks are a team that
has summoned the word "relentless" again and again.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Knight used it after watching Kansas blow out his Texas Tech
team, and Oregon Coach Ernie Kent uttered it after Sunday's 104-86
loss in the Midwest Regional final--a game in which the Jayhawks
outrebounded the Ducks by an astounding 63-34 margin.</TE>
<TE>   Even Drew Gooden, whose 20-rebound performance was complemented by
Nick Collison's 25-point, 15-rebound game, said it: "We were
relentless out there on the backboards."</TE>
<TE>   But Maryland sometimes seems to have an even more ferocious
collection of talent, and the Terrapins, too, are relentless. They
learned their lesson after last year's Final Four, when Duke came
from 22 points behind to eliminate them in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Duke has gone home to Durham, but Juan Dixon, Steve Blake, Lonny
Baxter and Chris Wilcox will play as if the Blue Devils are on their
heels until the buzzer sounds. (Unlike, we might add, the Blue Devils
themselves, who dissolved into a scattershot group that did little
more than throw up panicky three-pointers as Indiana closed in on its
way to the upset.)</TE>
<TE>   Pause, however, and consider this important bit of information:
Oklahoma, seemingly an afterthought, has beaten both Kansas and
Maryland this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners defeated the Terrapins by 16 in December in Norman,
Okla.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, it was a meaningless December road game, but it served notice
that the Sooners have an inside-outside game with power forward Aaron
McGhee and supremely strong-willed guard Hollis Price that can
counter Baxter and Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners also beat Kansas, lurking in the Big 12 while the
Jayhawks swept through the conference with a 16-0 record, then
unveiling a blueprint of how to beat Kansas in the Big 12 title game.
The lessons: Refuse to run, and clamp down with tough, physical
defense. It was a victory far more thorough than the final nine-point
margin.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's quite possible that the Big 12, which proved its
superiority among conferences with its tournament performance, will
have two teams in the championship game, a replay of the 1988 game
between the Jayhawks and Sooners.</TE>
<TE>   That year, the Kansas team led by Danny Manning that came to be
known as Danny and the Miracles beat an Oklahoma team coached by
Billy Tubbs, a running, pressing team led by Mookie Blaylock, Harvey
Grant and Stacey King that was the image of relentlessness in its
day.</TE>
<TE>   Tubbs is long gone, and this Final Four brings an opportunity for
a new era of coaches. None is newer than Mike Davis, trying to shirk
the shadow of Bob Knight at Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Indiana fans hang on every update on the ankle of
red-haired guard Tom Coverdale--or simply "Cov" as he is known in
Hoosierland.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, he is questionable for Saturday against Oklahoma.
Unofficially?</TE>
<TE>   "Tom is playing. Next question," guard A.J. Moye said. "If you did
an autopsy, this kid probably has titanium running through his
veins."</TE>
<TE>   Don't be fooled by the feel-good story in Bloomington, however:
Indiana teams that reach the Final Four are supposed to win.</TE>
<TE>   Five of seven have, with Knight's 1973 and '92 teams the only
exceptions. (He won titles in '76, '81 and '87, and Branch McCracken
won in 1940 and '53.)</TE>
<TE>   Incredibly, despite Indiana's great run, a loss in the semifinals
won't seem good enough.</TE>
<TE>   Nor will it be for Kansas, where Roy Williams has inherited the
mantle once worn by Dean Smith, his mentor at North Carolina: Can't
Win the Big One.</TE>
<TE>   Smith reached six Final Fours before he won his first title, in
1982. He ended his career with two titles in 11 trips.</TE>
<TE>   Williams has been twice, in 1991 and '93, losing to Duke in the
title game the first time and to North Carolina in the semifinals.
(His real burden has been losing before reaching the Final Four.)</TE>
<TE>   But with no schools from his native state in Atlanta, maybe this
time Williams will win and add to Kansas' collection of two titles.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma has yet to win one in three trips to the Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   Kelvin Sampson, like Davis, is making his first trip--a notable
passage for minority coaches. Since John Thompson broke the barrier
with Georgetown in 1982, there has never been more than one minority
coach in the Final Four. (Davis is African American, and Sampson is
Native American.)</TE>
<TE>   Neither Williams nor the newcomers can match Maryland's Gary
Williams for the doggedness of his demons, however.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Williams, even more than Roy Williams, is reminiscent of Lute
Olson before Arizona finally won in 1997 and Jim Calhoun before
Connecticut won in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   As much as Olson and Calhoun said their careers would be
fulfilling if they never won--Smith faced that question, too--the
truth seemed to be that until they won they were always agitated by
something, and after they won they were changed, calmed, more
complete.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Williams, with that decisive victory over Duke in the second
meeting this season in his pocket and the Blue Devils out of the way,
just might be able to bring his alma mater its first title, one year
after taking Maryland to its first Final Four.</TE>

<HD>Diamond Bar Rebuilds Fast With Freshmen</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Kevin Na left Diamond Bar High and turned professional following
his junior year, Coach Tony McCabe figured this would be a rebuilding
year for his team. A couple of freshmen, however, have changed his
thinking. Eugene Choi and Daniel Cho have filled in nicely for Na,
the No.1 junior player in the nation at one point last year.</LD>
<LD>   Choi and Cho each have been medalist in matches this season and
they join a lineup that already included seniors Eddie Hsu and Eric
Chang. The Brahmas shot 183 in the first Sierra League match and hold
a seven-stroke lead over defending champion Damien.</LD>
<LD>   "We have high hopes this year," McCabe said. "We miss Kevin, but
the freshmen have been performing better than I hoped and we have a
team that's 10 players deep. All 10 of them can break 80."</LD>
<TE>   Diamond Bar won the 40-team Riverside M.L. King tournament Friday
at Quail Ranch, defeating Riverside Poly, ranked No. 2 by The Times
at the time, by three strokes. It was a three-man tournament, but
Diamond Bar entered two teams and the second team finished seventh.
The top five scorers for Diamond Bar totaled 375.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the guys that we've gotten to the level that we wanted,
but now the trick is staying here," McCabe said. "Shooting 375 is
good here and we could probably get through the regional with that,
but we need to improve if we want to make it past that."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Diamond Bar finished third in the Eastern Divisional,
one stroke away from a spot in the Southern Section finals. In 2000,
with Na on the team, the Brahmas finished third in the Eastern
Regional behind Serra League powers Anaheim Servite and Santa
Margarita. The Serra League is no longer in the Eastern Division.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe is looking forward to an April 3 match against top-ranked
San Marcos, a team that regularly shoots in the 360s, has shot under
par as a team in a match this year and has set the standard for golf
this season. McCabe believes his team can compete, but wonders who
might be favored if he still had Na.</TE>
<TE>   "We're good now but if we still had Kevin, we'd be San Marc-ian."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   M.L. King is off to an impressive 5-0 start in its first year with
a varsity team, especially considering that two of the team's top
three players are freshmen girls.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Smith, who won the Southern Section girls' individual
championship last fall, and Sommer Scholl, an accomplished player on
the junior circuit, are averaging 40 and 41, respectively. King did
not have a girls' team this season, so Scholl and Smith are allowed
to play on the boys' team. They join top player Will Farish, a
senior, to give King a solid lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolves are averaging a respectable 207, have broken 200 twice
this season and set a school record by shooting 191 last week. Smith
was medalist in that match with a one-under 35.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Early-season lineup juggling has led to inconsistent results for
some of the top Southland teams.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Margarita had two matches scheduled for the same day last
week. The A team went to La Costa Canyon and the B team played the
second half of a match against Irvine Woodbridge. Both Santa
Margarita teams lost, even though the Eagles held a nine-stroke lead
going into the second half of the Woodbridge match.</TE>
<TE>   La Mirada also has been shuffling its lineup and has shot over 200
twice without its top players, but the Matadores have managed to
remain unbeaten.</TE>

<HD>Duke Has Revenge on Its Mind</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four months after losing at home to South Carolina, Duke will face
the Gamecocks again tonight (tip-off 4 p.m. PDT) in the East Regional
final at Raleigh, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   Top-seeded Duke (30-3) has won 27 of 28 since that loss, including
a school-record 21 in a row. The Blue Devils are looking to return to
the Final Four for the first time since reaching the national
championship game in 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The Duke players say they haven't forgotten the way South
Carolina's players danced on Coach K Court after their 87-81 overtime
victory on Nov. 25.</LD>
<TE>   "That was really hard for us," Duke's Vicki Krapohl said. "The way
they carried themselves off the court and holding their hands up like
they were No. 1. It's definitely a motivation."</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big game for us," the Gamecocks' Jocelyn Penn said.
"I'm really surprised they were upset that we danced--but, hey, we
had just won. What were we supposed to do?"</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina is 25-6, a season after going 11-17.</TE>
<TE>   In the other regional finals:</TE>
<TE>   * Old Dominion (28-5) will play undefeated, No. 1-ranked
Connecticut (36-0) in the Mideast Regional at Milwaukee (tip-off 4:30
p.m.). Connecticut, which has won 36 in a row, beat Old Dominion,
84-70, in December.</TE>
<TE>   * Oklahoma (30-3) meets Colorado (24-9) in the West Regional at
Boise, Idaho (tip-off 6:30 p.m.)--the winner becoming the first Big
12 team to reach the women's Final Four.</TE>
<TE>   * Vanderbilt (30-6) and Tennessee (28-4)--conference and
intrastate rivals separated by 180 miles--meet in the Midwest
Regional at Ames, Iowa (tip-off 6:30 p.m.).</TE>

<HD>Delays in a Long-Awaited Return</HD>
<DH>Asia: Security wrinkles have complicated ex-Afghan ruler Mohammad
Zaher Shah's homecoming.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>They're patching a rocket hole in the pool house roof, planting
flowers in the garden and assembling furniture kits flown in from the
United Arab Emirates. Behind a security wall, newly raised to 10 feet and
topped with coils of barbed wire, Afghans are readying a house almost fit
for a king.</LD>
<LD>   What's missing from this picture? If Afghanistan's deposed monarch is
on his way home to this war-battered country, you would think that his
six-bedroom residence might be swarming with security guards. But not
yet.</LD>
<LD>   Belated qualms over who will protect 87-year-old Mohammad Zaher Shah,
considered a key figure in the country's hoped-for transition to
democratic rule, have forced a politically awkward delay of his
long-awaited return from exile in Italy. He had been due to arrive here
Tuesday aboard an Italian air force jet after nearly 29 years in exile.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration urged Italy to postpone the trip so that U.S.
military officers could train a special force of Afghans deemed loyal to
the former monarch rather than leave his protection to the Afghan
Interior Ministry, whose leaders have opposed Zaher Shah in the past, a
senior U.S. official said.</TE>
<TE>   At the administration's request, the official said, Italy also agreed
to deploy some of its peacekeeping troops to protect the elder statesman
here until the special Afghan force is ready. Italian authorities say the
revised security plan will delay the homecoming by at least three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The sudden change, which became known Saturday, irritated and
embarrassed the leaders of Afghanistan's Western-backed interim
government. They said they had no say in the matter and grumbled
privately about outside meddling.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan is trying to recover from 23 years of mayhem, including a
decade of Soviet occupation and the entrenchment of Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist network during the Taliban regime that fell to U.S.-led
forces last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Zaher Shah, whose tranquil 40-year reign ended in a 1973 palace coup,
has been invited by the new rulers to preside over a loya jirga. That
traditional assembly is to meet in June to chart a two-year transition to
constitutional rule, but any further delay in Zaher Shah's arrival could
undermine preparations for that event, Afghan officials say.</TE>
<TE>Fears That Afghans Will Doubt the King</TE>
<TE>   "This delay will create doubts among Afghan people and damage their
trust," said Zalmai Rassoul, Zaher Shah's secretary, who was fidgeting
with yellow worry beads while trying to plan the ex-king's homecoming.
"People are starting to believe that he is not serious about coming to
Afghanistan."</TE>
<TE>   Rassoul said he had worked closely with Interior Minister Younis
Qanooni and had been satisfied with plans by Qanooni's police to take
over the former king's security from Italian officials upon his arrival
here.</TE>
<TE>   "Total security does not exist anywhere, and it cannot be done in
Afghanistan," Rassoul said. "But if I had thought the security was not
satisfactory [for the former king], I would have told him not to come."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., however, overruled Rassoul. The Americans are wary of
Qanooni, whose ethnic Tajik faction resisted a special role for the
former king, an ethnic Pushtun. Qanooni's police force, they say, is a
clumsy amalgam of Taliban-era cops and anti-Taliban militiamen of the
Northern Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Plans for Zaher Shah's security were deemed "not entirely
satisfactory," the senior U.S. official said. Now, it has been decided
that the former king will get the same kind of bodyguards as are assigned
to the interim government's leader, Hamid Karzai, who is also Pushtun.
The guards will be trained by Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Until the guards are prepared, Italian military police in Kabul's
4,600-member British-led international peacekeeping force will protect
Zaher Shah--just as Italian police have been doing at the ex-king's villa
outside Rome since 1973.</TE>
<TE>   "The Italians have done a good job," said an official of another
Western government. "He's still alive."</TE>
<TE>   American and other Western officials would not speak on the record, in
part because of the sensitivity involved in telling Afghans how to
protect their own leaders. Italian officials, once persuaded to delay the
homecoming, took responsibility for the decision and put forward their
own justification: They had received threats against Zaher Shah's life,
including one to shoot down the Italian plane that was to bring him to
Afghanistan. Afghan officials found it difficult to argue in public about
that.</TE>
<TE>   As word of the postponement spread in Kabul, many of the capital's
residents said they were hopeful that the deposed king would show up soon
and that his presence would do much to bind the nation's wounds.</TE>
<TE>Time Now Left to Clean Swimming Pool</TE>
<TE>   Officials noted a bright side to the delay: They will have time to
finish cleaning his swimming pool, install electrical wiring and plan his
public appearances. Refurbishing continued apace Sunday at his two-story
Bauhaus-style residence--guarded by two Afghan police officers--and his
royal ancestors' tomb on a hilltop across town. Both sustained heavy
rocket damage during decades of fighting.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe he comes; maybe he doesn't. Maybe he's scared; maybe he's
sick," shrugged Mohammed Akbar, 29. Akbar's Gul Shan Photo Studio
displays a popular new calendar bearing a 1960s photo of the king and one
of Ahmed Shah Masoud, the legendary Northern Alliance commander who was
slain last year. "Maybe it's better if the king doesn't come. He might
have a heart attack when he sees all this destruction."</TE>
<TE>   But others were more eager to have the king back. "Every leader after
the king did his best to destroy Afghanistan," said Mohammed Sardar, 47,
who was part of a big crowd visiting the royal tomb Sunday. "They ended
the monarchy, but I'm sure he's coming back. The date should not matter.
This is his land, and he wants to come tell us to stop fighting each
other."</TE>

<HD>Koreas to Resume High-Level Negotiations</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: A ministerial meeting is set for next month in North's
capital. Analysts see compelling reasons for both sides to restart their
dialogue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA DEMICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL
</DL>
<LD>Breaking the ice after a long stalemate plunged relations to their
lowest level in two years, South and North Korea announced today that
high-level negotiations would resume early next month.</LD>
<LD>   The ministerial level talks--the first since November--are expected to
take place the first week of April in the North Korean capital,
Pyongyang. It is hoped that they will lead to more reunions of
long-separated families.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement that talks would resume was widely predicted because
it is generally believed that both sides badly need to show signs of
progress--though for quite different reasons.</LD>
<TE>   The last round of talks at North Korea's scenic Mt. Kumgang ended
abruptly with mutual recriminations and finger-pointing. After President
Bush characterized North Korea as part of an "axis of evil" in January,
tensions on the Korean peninsula rose to a height not seen since South
Korean President Kim Dae Jung's landmark visit to Pyongyang in June 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to prevent a crisis that could develop on the Korean
peninsula," South Korean presidential advisor Lim Dong Wong said today in
an interview with the official news agency. Lim, a former unification
minister who has long been Kim's point man for North Korea, is expected
to lead the delegation next month to Pyongyang.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been talks of a security crisis developing in 2003. . . .
To continue our efforts for recovery of the economy, stabilization is
necessary. We need to avoid tension."</TE>
<TE>   South Korean presidential spokeswoman Park Sun Sook said in a
statement read on national television that "we expect the talks to lay
the groundwork for a resumption of stalled relations between South and
North Korea." There were also reports that the South Koreans expect their
envoy to meet personally with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il.</TE>
<TE>   Radio Pyongyang said today that the parties will discuss "the grave
issues confronting the people and other matters of common interest."</TE>
<TE>   In a mutual show of goodwill, North Korea is also expected to send the
president of its legislature, Kim Yong Nam, and some athletes to attend
opening ceremonies of the World Cup soccer games that are being jointly
hosted by South Korea and Japan starting May 31. In return, South Korea
is expected to send an envoy, perhaps soccer chairman Chung Mong Joon, to
attend a festival North Korea is hosting this spring marking the 90th
birthday of North Korea's late founder, Kim Il Sung, and the 60th
birthday of his son, the current leader.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the publicly chilly atmosphere of the past few months, South
and North Korean envoys have been meeting discreetly at Mt. Kumgang and
elsewhere in an attempt to restart the dialogue that is ultimately aimed
at ending 50 years of animosity dating back to the 1950-1953 Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's Kim wants to prove that the "sunshine" policy for which
he won a Nobel peace prize is indeed a success. Presidential elections
are scheduled here in December, and although Kim is a lame duck, he wants
to boost the electoral prospects of his political allies. He also wants
North Korean leader Kim to pay a return visit to Seoul, something that
was agreed upon during the June 2000 summit.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea, plagued by years of famine and increasingly estranged
from the United States, desperately needs hard currency from tourists and
foreign investors. The Arirang festival, as the birthday celebration is
being called, is widely viewed as a fund-raising vehicle. North Korea
hopes to bring tens of thousands of tourists in for the festival
beginning April 29 and is selling tickets that cost as much as $300.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a barter deal," said Jean-Jacques Grauhar of the European
Chamber of Commerce in Seoul. "Both sides were in a hurry to come up with
a compromise before the World Cup and the Arirang games. It is not so
often that both sides are eager to meet, but this was a time it was in
their mutual interest."</TE>
<TE>   South Korean political scientist Suh Dong Man at Sangji University
said, "North Korea's main intention is to earn money, but this could
result in something very positive. The atmosphere between North and South
Korea has been very cool, and this could be a turning point."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jo-Anne Prokopowicz said,
"The U.S. government supports and welcomes continued dialogue between
North and South Korea."</TE>
<TE>   In the unpredictable manner of Korean relations, there is still a
possibility that the agreement for a meeting will fall apart. In
September, the two Koreas agreed to another round of family reunions, but
the deal collapsed. No family reunions have been held since February
2001. The South Korean news agency reported last month that about 12% of
the 117,576 South Korean applicants on a waiting list to participate in
reunions have died.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Snyder, the Seoul representative for the Asia Society, said he
was encouraged that South Korea and North Korea were taking the
initiative to get their dialogue going again without waiting for the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The most important thing is that it shows there is still impetus for
inter-Korean interaction and that President Bush's comments have not
hindered the potential for the two Koreas to work together."</TE>

<HD>Bush Talks Trade in El Salvador, Lauds Democratic Progress</HD>
<DH>Latin America: President pushes free markets but doesn't bring
plans. White House says trip is meant to show support for the region.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN SALVADOR
</DL>
<LD>President Bush ended his four-day Latin America visit Sunday in
much the same way he began it, touting democracy and free trade as he
made a final stop in El Salvador. But he also lashed back at Democrats
who had criticized his trip as an effort to pander to Latinos back home,
calling the attack "petty politics."</LD>
<LD>   At a joint news conference with Salvadoran President Francisco Flores
after their private meeting here, Bush said that he has long been
committed to free trade and that promoting it was a central mission of
his visits to Monterrey, Mexico; Lima, Peru; and the Salvadoran capital.</LD>
<LD>   "When I first got elected, I said the best foreign policy for the
United States is to have a prosperous, peaceful and free neighborhood. .
. . And my long-standing interest in . . . Mexico and Central America is
well known," Bush said.</LD>
<TE>   "And sometimes in Washington, D.C., people cannot get rid of old
habits, which is petty politics."</TE>
<TE>   As he did at his earlier stops, the president lauded his host nation's
progress toward democracy and free markets, calling El Salvador "one of
the really great stories of economic and political transformation of our
time."</TE>
<TE>   This nation of 6.2 million, which suffered through four decades of
repressive military rule until the 1970s, is rebuilding itself after a
12-year civil war that ended in 1992. The fighting claimed tens of
thousands of lives, with both sides accused of serious human rights
violations.</TE>
<TE>   Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security advisor, said Bush
wanted to stop in El Salvador to "celebrate a region that, I think, 10,
15 years ago nobody would have given a chance to be living at peace, to
be democratic, to have presidents who are interested in pressing the free
market."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also wanted to come to promote what Rice called "the next phase"
in U.S.-Central American relations: an agreement that would not only
foster trade between the U.S. and the nations of this region but also
break down trade barriers among the Central American countries.</TE>
<TE>   "We often forget that one of the problems for developing countries is
that they tend to have high trade barriers between countries, as well as
trying to enter the markets of developed countries," Rice said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bush strongly touted free trade at each stop, the president
came bearing few tangible plans. He has been unable to get the Senate to
renew the Andean Trade Preference Act, which exempts a number of Andean
products from U.S. tariffs; it expired in December.</TE>
<TE>   The president supports a similar measure for Central America, but
progress has been slow on that front as well. Bush envisions the Andean
trade act and a similar Central American measure as building blocks for a
hemispheric free-trade bloc.</TE>
<TE>   On immigration, another key issue for Latin American governments, Bush
had hoped the Senate would have passed a bill by now to make it easier
for certain illegal immigrants already in the U.S. to obtain visas. But
that measure, too, is stalled.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the president announced an array of initiatives that require
little, if any, new funding commitments, such as a return of U.S. Peace
Corps volunteers to Peru after a 27-year hiatus. In Mexico, he and
President Vicente Fox announced a mutual commitment to encourage business
investments in rural Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said Sunday that disbursing
dollars was never Bush's intention for the trip. Rather, he said, the
president's aim was to show U.S. support for Latin America--one of Bush's
top priorities before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   "The purpose of this trip is to show a unified nation with unified
policies in an atmosphere of hope and optimism," Fleischer told reporters
aboard Air Force One as it flew from Lima to San Salvador.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanied by First Lady Laura Bush, the president was accorded a
red-carpet, 21-gun-salute welcoming ceremony at Comalapa International
Airport here. He then talked with Flores. The two leaders last met in
Washington, just two months after Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   After their news conference, Bush and Flores were joined for lunch by
the leaders of Belize, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Honduras and
Panama.</TE>
<TE>   As the top officials met, thousands of peasants, union workers and
students marched peacefully elsewhere in the capital to protest the
proposed free trade between Central America and the U.S. as an
exploitation of cheap labor.</TE>
<TE>   "I see a free-trade agreement as a fight between a trussed-up donkey
and a free lion," said Margarita Posada, one of the march organizers.
"They come to offer us roads, modern airports and ports just to transport
goods to big multinational companies."</TE>
<TE>   Before Bush arrived in El Salvador on Sunday, Secretary of State Colin
L. Powell told reporters that during the president's stop in Peru,
officials from both nations discussed plans to resume interdiction
flights against drug smugglers over Peru.</TE>
<TE>   The CIA-backed program was stopped a year ago after an American
missionary and her infant daughter were killed when a Peruvian military
jet shot down the plane they were in. Their single-engine aircraft was
mistakenly identified as a possible drug-smuggling plane.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to restart these air interdiction flights, let there be no
doubt about that," Powell said aboard Air Force One while en route from
Lima to San Salvador. Although Powell did not cite a specific date, he
said, "I don't expect this to linger too much longer."</TE>
<TE>   On the final day of his Latin America visit, Bush appeared
upbeat--notwithstanding sharp criticism from Democrats over the weekend
that the trip was a cynical ploy to woo Latino voters back home.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, speaking for Democrats in their weekly radio address,
former California Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa called Bush's
trip "part of an orchestrated strategy to curry favor with Latino
voters."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said he was "disappointed" by Villaraigosa's remarks.</TE>

<HD>Gorillas Draw Tourists Back to Rwanda</HD>
<DH>Africa: Treks to the mountain home of rare primates had dried up
after one was slain and eaten by militiamen.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VOLCANO NATIONAL PARK, Rwanda
</DL>
<LD>Hans-Dieter Steinbach, the German ambassador to Rwanda, celebrated
his 50th birthday last week with Guhonda and 10 other rare mountain
gorillas in the silverback's group.</LD>
<LD>   A month ago, Steinbach would have considered his trek up the Virunga
range ill-advised, but the European Union recently lifted a travel
advisory discouraging its citizens from visiting the park. The EU issued
the warning in May after members of the Interahamwe Hutu militia--which
helped plan the 1994 slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate
Hutus--infiltrated the park, killed a mountain gorilla and ate its meat.</LD>
<LD>   With the park no longer off limits to Europeans, tourists are slowly
trickling back to Rwanda, one of the few places in Africa where mountain
gorillas live.</LD>
<TE>   Tourism officials say they are using the gorillas' presence to show
that Rwanda is more than the scene of horrific genocide. Marketing
officials are being dispatched to Berlin, London and New York to tell
people that it is safe again to enter the forest where primatologist Dian
Fossey researched her book "Gorillas in the Mist."</TE>
<TE>   Rwandans are counting on the gorillas to help earn much-needed hard
currency for their country, where 90% of people survive on subsistence
farming.</TE>
<TE>   "We call the gorillas our ambassadors," said Gatana Wa Biso, a
spokesman for Rwanda's national parks.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. State Department, though, has yet to lift its travel warning
for the park, fearing that Americans could be attacked by roving gangs of
armed Hutu militiamen. Still, scores of U.S. citizens visited the
gorillas last year, outnumbering any other nationality, including
Rwandans.</TE>
<TE>   In its gorilla campaign, Rwanda is targeting intrepid
travelers--people who believe these animals are a bridge to humankind's
past and who are willing to pay a park fee of $250 a day to gawk at them.
The fee includes security. Visitors are escorted by naturalists and
fresh-faced soldiers toting worn AK-47 assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Steinbach and a group of seven other visitors walked past
fields of potatoes and pyrethrum--a natural insecticide--into the
unfenced forest. March is in the season of short rains in Rwanda, and on
that day, the steep, uneven trail was soft enough to swallow visitors'
shoes. For nearly an hour, the group made its way through climbing vines,
patches of stinging nettles and thickets of dense bamboo to get to the
gorillas' nest.</TE>
<TE>   The gorillas appeared unfazed by the outsiders. Ryango, a 19-year-old
silverback, chewed on a clump of bamboo. Kampanga, a 2-year-old, rode on
her mother's back.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Guhonda, the silverback who has a reputation for aggressive
behavior, made his appearance, stomping over tall vegetation. Guhonda is
the Kinyarwanda name for the thumping sound he makes when he stands up
and beats his chest, as if to say, "I'm the king of the jungle!"</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Guhonda, who weighs about 550 pounds, beat up and
chased away the silverback that controlled this group. Not long after, he
nearly killed the park's veterinarian. The attack occurred when a guide
became scared and ran off after Guhonda came to check on an infant in his
group.</TE>
<TE>   Guhonda attacked veterinarian Antoine Mudakikwa, the nearest human in
sight, sinking his 2-inch-long incisors into his leg and ripping through
his muscles. For 15 minutes, Mudakikwa faked death as Guhonda stood over
him.</TE>
<TE>   But the attack, according to Mudakikwa, created a special bond between
man and beast and made Guhonda the veterinarian's favorite primate.</TE>
<TE>   "Now he beats his chest every time he sees me," Mudakikwa said.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Guhonda beat his chest and charged, only to veer away from
the visitors at the last moment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite armed conflict in the last decade, the number of mountain
gorillas has slowly increased--thanks to local and international
conservationists who promote ecotourism. Researchers estimate that about
360 gorillas now live in the Virunga range, which straddles Rwanda,
Uganda and Congo--up from 324 in 1989, when the last full census was
taken.</TE>
<TE>   Humans remain the biggest threat to the gorillas. A few have been
killed in recent years by rebels in Rwanda and Congo, according to
Mudakikwa.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Innocent Kagango, a 29-year-old rebel, deserted the
Interahamwe militia and surrendered to Rwandan soldiers after some of his
comrades killed a silverback and ate its meat for food.</TE>
<TE>   I asked them, "How could you dare to kill and eat those peaceful old
men of the mountain? They look almost like human beings," he said. "I
thought these people can easily eat me, and that is why I began my plot
to desert."</TE>
<TE>   Wa Biso and other Rwandan officials acknowledge that they face a
challenge in convincing tourists that they'll be safe from rebels in the
forest.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other challenges. This impoverished Central African
nation has few hotels to accommodate tourists. Many visitors spend the
night in Uganda. Others sleep in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, and make
the 90-minute mountainous drive here to see the gorillas.</TE>
<TE>   The Rwandan government is urging local and foreign entrepreneurs to
build hotels in Ruhengeri, the town nearest the park.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbach, the German ambassador, said the gorillas could be marketed
alongside Rwanda's scenic Lake Kivu and other resorts.</TE>
<TE>   After trekking down the hill in pouring rain, Steinbach was wet and
muddy but his two cameras were laden with pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll always remember this birthday," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you do it again?" a visitor asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but in the dry season."</TE>

<HD>Bad Knee Forces Pope to Sit Out Palm Sunday Mass</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Plagued by knee pain, Pope John Paul II took the exceptional step
of ceding his place at the altar during Palm Sunday Mass, the latest sign
of the health problems that are exacting a toll on the pontiff.</LD>
<LD>   To the surprise of tens of thousands at St. Peter's Square, John Paul
did not celebrate the Mass. Instead, he sat in an armchair near the altar
on the steps of St. Peter's Basilica, letting an Italian cardinal take
his place.</LD>
<LD>   The pope, 81, read the homily and several prayers during the nearly 2
1/2-hour celebration, but the substitution spared him a long spell
standing behind the altar.</LD>

<HD>Mideast Parties Are at a Crossroads</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Israel, the Palestinians and the U.S. are faced with
tough decisions in the quest for peace. And the stakes have rarely been
higher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>It's crunch time in the Middle East. In the next few days and
weeks, each of the major players in the Arab-Israeli conflict must make
difficult decisions that will determine whether peace is actually
possible.</LD>
<LD>   Three new variables in the Middle East equation--a pivotal Arab League
summit this week to debate a new peace plan, the stunning increase in
bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians, and U.S. hopes to foment a
regime change in Iraq--are coming together to force the key parties to
wrestle with tough choices.</LD>
<LD>   Since the breakthrough Oslo accords in 1993, the stakes have rarely
been greater, because the regional dynamics are changing so rapidly and
the alternatives--including full-blown war and the long-term Israeli
reoccupation of Palestinian land--are so stark, U.S. officials and
regional experts say.</LD>
<TE>   "We're certainly on a steep downward path. Never have I seen anger and
a sense of grievance so deeply embedded among both Palestinians and
Israelis," said Dennis B. Ross, former U.S. special envoy to the Middle
East for the Clinton and first Bush administrations. "Both sides now
believe that force is the only thing the other side understands."</TE>
<TE>   But to generate new movement toward an enduring cease-fire and peace
talks, analysts warn, each side will have to pick the tougher or more
controversial of its options.</TE>
<TE>   Appearing Sunday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Vice President Dick Cheney
said the current crossroads of an "enormously complex set of problems and
issues that are all sort of interrelated" provided both "a sense of
opportunity and danger."</TE>
<TE>   For the United States, the decision centers on broad strategy: Is its
goal to manage the crisis in a way that will diminish or eliminate the
violence? Or is it committed to a full-court diplomatic press that leads
Israelis and Arabs toward a final settlement--an effort requiring
high-level engagement and unprecedented pressure but one that would also
clear the slate to deal with other issues?</TE>
<TE>   "The dilemma for the United States is deciding whether its management
of the peace process is an interim step that is necessary to be able to
deal with Iraq, or whether it is a priority that stands on its own," said
Shibley Telhami, holder of the Anwar Sadat chair in peace and development
at the University of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-2001, the Bush administration concluded that no peace agreement
was likely as long as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian
Authority President Yasser Arafat were both in power. At least one side
would have to change its leadership before serious negotiations could get
back on track, U.S. officials said. Meanwhile, State Department officials
would try to mediate a reduction in the violence.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until now, the administration had concluded that the peace process
was not ripe for resolution, and the best they could do was manage it in
a way that allowed the United States to go ahead and deal with Iraq,"
Telhami said.</TE>
<TE>   But the daily killings on both sides, which are beginning to resemble
the opening stage of a conventional war, have proved that this is no
longer an effective strategy, analysts and an increasing number of U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The growing momentum behind President Bush's commitment to confront
Iraq has added to the pressure to be more aggressive. Despite
administration claims that there is no link between the Arab-Israeli
crisis and any possible U.S.-Iraq showdown, U.S. intelligence analysts
warn that President Saddam Hussein is likely to respond to any U.S.
military action by firing missiles at Israel to lure Arabs to his side.
That could convert Iraq into a regionwide crisis--intertwined with the
Arab-Israeli conflict--that could complicate the U.S. goal of a regime
change in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Deeper involvement, however, carries serious risks of deeper
frustration--and even failure.</TE>
<TE>   "If the United States elevates the mediation to the level of the vice
president and puts its name behind ideas that have a chance of not being
accepted, and then fails, then there are far fewer alternatives," Telhami
said.</TE>
<TE>   For the Arab world, the big decision involves a sweeping principle: At
the Arab League summit beginning Wednesday in Beirut, the 22 members are
scheduled to vote on whether to adopt or adapt a Saudi proposal offering
full recognition of Israel in exchange for Israeli withdrawal from all
lands occupied since the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   The idea is not new, but the timing and the formalization of the
proposal could well put the parties back on the track of peace, U.S.
officials say. Adding specifics, as some Arab nations propose, could
dilute the plan or bog down the effort, however.</TE>
<TE>   The Saudi proposal, if taken literally, would call for the return of
more land than Israel has ever been willing to consider. Ross warned that
it would amount to a "straitjacket" if some Arabs insist that the idea
preclude any flexibility in mediating less than the 1967 borders.</TE>
<TE>   The White House is urging the Arabs to deal with the Saudi
vision--which lacks specifics on such thorny issues as the status of
Jerusalem and the right of Palestinian refugees to return--as a principle
and to not tack on conditions.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney warned Sunday against "hanging a lot of bells and whistles" on
the Saudi idea. "The more detail you add, the more people have an
opportunity to find something they disagree with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And some Arab states may hold out, the vice president conceded. "I
would not expect that necessarily everyone in the Arab world will sign
up" because of the stipulation of full normalization of relations, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Arafat and Sharon both must make tactical decisions about
stepping back from confrontation--moves that will be far more complicated
because of recent shifts in the balance of power on the ground and the
reaction among their own constituents.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian leadership feels it has an edge over Israel for the
first time, due to the impact of suicide attacks on Israelis and the
growing fury in the Arab world over Israel's airstrikes, its reoccupation
of land and its assassinations of militants.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Palestinians think they have more to gain by continuing the
uprising until there's a real, acceptable political solution on the
horizon," said Robert Malley, a Clinton administration National Security
Council staff member who was involved in the peace process.</TE>
<TE>   Added Ross, "There's one area of asymmetry that is worrisome: On the
Israeli side, there's a growing desire to be done with all this, but on
the Palestinian side, there's a sense that things are breaking their
way."</TE>
<TE>   Although Arafat has pledged to rein in the violence, following through
could be personally and politically costly--and difficult, U.S. officials
concede.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon faces a similar dilemma. With his core support coming from the
Israeli right wing and settlers, who do not want any concessions on the
occupied territories, he will have to decide how to respond to the Arab
League offer--and even whether to let Arafat go to the summit. The
Israeli leader asked to be allowed to attend the summit but was rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon could preempt the debate by refusing to let Arafat leave the
West Bank, a move that could sabotage the Saudi overture, Arab leaders
warn.</TE>
<TE>   At a more basic level, however, the bloodletting is showing Sharon's
strategy of harsh military reprisals to be ineffective. "Sharon is under
increasing pressure, as his current posture has never left Israelis less
secure," Ross said. "He's got to find some pathway that offers more
promise than the one he's on."</TE>

<HD>In the Political Party Ring, It's Fearless Frodo vs. Pathetic Piggy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not as tangible an asset as money or good poll numbers. But
for a political party, confidence--in its message, its ideas, even its
mission--is usually a critical ingredient of success in an election year.
Right now, the confidence gap may be the biggest difference between the
parties. Just over seven months before the midterm elections, Republicans
are swaggering. Democrats look lost.</LD>
<LD>   Republican candidates for the House and Senate already appear to have
settled on the central messages they'll trumpet in this fall's campaigns:
Defend President Bush's tax cut; endorse his call for big spending
increases on defense and homeland security; and, above all, link
themselves to Bush's popularity, particularly the public support for his
handling of the terrorist threat.</LD>
<LD>   Republican Lamar Alexander probably previewed things to come when he
crammed all of those themes into a single ad last week, just days after
announcing his bid for an open Senate seat in Tennessee. Only a few years
ago, Alexander, a former Tennessee governor, was running against Bush for
the 2000 GOP presidential nomination and belittling Bush's "compassionate
conservatism" as "weasel words."</LD>
<TE>   But in his first Senate ad, Alexander talked more about Bush than
himself: "This is a dangerous time," Alexander declares. "I want to help
the president win the war and strengthen our country." Alexander couldn't
have bound himself more closely to Bush with handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats don't have nearly as much direction. In theory, they have
settled on a two-part election-year strategy: embrace Bush on the war and
challenge him on domestic issues. The party is following the first half
of that prescription. But when it comes to drawing domestic contrasts
with Bush, Democrats are faltering.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to think of a single issue where Senate Democrats have
put Bush on the defensive. The Enron investigations haven't landed more
than glancing blows on the administration. Bush might be vulnerable to
charges he isn't doing enough to protect worker pensions after Enron, but
it's uncertain Democrats have the votes to pass the party's principal
retirement security initiative, a plan from Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Democratic leaders wanted to use the ongoing energy debate
to sharpen lines between a Bush plan emphasizing new drilling and their
preference for conservation. But that hope faded when the party's main
idea for reducing energy consumption--a big increase in fuel economy
standards for cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles--was trampled under
a stampede of Democratic defections in a Senate vote this month. Now, the
energy bill has become a kind of legislative tar pit that's denied
Democrats the opportunity to create a clear distinction with Bush.</TE>
<TE>   All this, though, was just a warm-up for the budget Senate Democrats
released last week. The budget resolution this year is mostly a symbolic
document; it's an opportunity for the parties to express their
priorities. And on that front, the plan from Senate Budget Committee
Chairman Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) was oddly appropriate: it was almost
incoherent, which may accurately reflect the current state of thinking
among congressional Democrats.</TE>
<TE>   Like a doughnut, or a bikini, the Conrad plan is defined mostly by
what isn't there. It lacks a serious effort to balance the federal
government's books without using taxes collected for Social
Security--something both parties pledged to do as recently as the 2000
presidential election (remember the lockbox?). All year, Democrats have
understandably condemned Bush for proposing a budget that just over the
next five years would divert $1.05 trillion in Social Security surpluses
to run the rest of government and pay for his tax cut. But Conrad's plan
anticipates the diversion of $990 billion in Social Security money over
that period, unless a future Congress acts to stem the red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad offers some ideas with teeth, like dropping all the additional
tax cuts Bush proposed this year. But mostly the plan avoids real
choices. Conrad makes his numbers add up only by projecting that Congress
will repeal all of last year's $1.3-trillion tax cut when it expires
after 2010, an implausible prospect. But the plan makes no effort to
scale back the tax cut in the meantime. Instead, it says that, if the
government remains in the red next year, Congress should devise a plan to
balance the budget by 2008 without using Social Security money. There's
an election-year rallying cry: Let the next Congress find a way to clean
up the budget mess by the end of the next presidential term.</TE>
<TE>   The Conrad budget was twisted into incoherence by its refusal to urge
that Bush's tax cut be trimmed now to pay for the war and other domestic
priorities (like a Medicare prescription drug plan). That omission partly
reflects the Democratic reluctance to challenge Bush on any issue while
his job approval rating is so high. But the bigger problem may be
practical: Conrad and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) know
that they couldn't win a vote on downsizing the tax cut because too many
Democratic senators from the red states Bush carried wouldn't support
them. The same thing happened in the fuel economy vote. It will likely
happen again if the leadership decides to move a plan to toughen gun
control laws. Even Conrad's cautious budget might fail on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   In all, the last few months suggest that the red state Democrats are
almost paralyzed by fear that they will be attacked from the right or
portrayed as obstacles to Bush. That anxiety has stripped Senate
Democratic leaders of a reliable majority and radically diminished their
ability to use the Senate to sharpen contrasts with the GOP and shape the
climate for the midterm election.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional Republicans have clearly decided they have enough
confidence in Bush's agenda to face the midterm election arm-in-arm with
the president. Vulnerable Democrats have just as clearly signaled they
intend to succeed, or fail, on their own. Republicans seem to be taking
their cues from the blood-brother fellowship in "The Lord of the Rings."
For Democrats, the operative text these days looks to be the "Lord of the
Flies."</TE>

sister, Samantha, in a home on the city's West Side. Their 7-year-old
sister, Erica, died at Cook County Hospital on Saturday night, according
to the Cook County medical examiner's office.</LD>
<LD>   The medical examiner's office identified the two victims of Saturday's
fire as Miquen Roussell, a 5-year-old girl, and Darrion Walker, a
6-year-old boy. The cause of death had not been determined.</LD>
<TE>   A third child was in critical condition at Christ Children's Hospital,
said Dennis Gault, a Fire Department spokesman.</TE>

<LD>The popular painkiller Vioxx has been linked to five cases of a
nonbacterial type of meningitis, a possible side effect that, although
rare, is serious, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports.</LD>

<HD>Winds Swell Blaze Into an Inferno</HD>
<DH>Disaster: Many residents of a New Mexico development barely had
time to evacuate before fire razed 28 homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE CART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RUIDOSO, N.M.
</DL>
<LD>Even in a region numbingly accustomed to wildfires and rapid
evacuations, this one swept in with awful suddenness and incinerated 28
homes with wind-whipped speed.</LD>
<LD>   For most residents of these piney mountains in southern New Mexico, it
was another bright Saturday. Two modest fires were burning in adjacent
forests, but in the newly built subdivisions known as Kokopelli, canny
locals were not overly concerned.</LD>
<LD>   "A friend called to say there was fire coming our way, but we thought
she was panicking," Sue Ludwig said. "My husband and I got up on the roof
to take a look down the valley. I saw clouds of black smoke and then
flames coming toward us. We knew it was time to get . . . outof Dodge."</LD>
<TE>   By Sunday, the Ludwigs were among the hundreds of area residents who
were dining courtesy of the Red Cross and sleeping on strangers' couches,
taken in by down-mountain neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   It was a third, smaller fire that sneaked up on residents--its
apparent cause stupefying to many here, given their acute sensitivity to
the potential devastation. Gov. Gary Johnson said Sunday the fire was
sparked when a local homeowner dumped what he believed were harmless
fireplace ashes into his backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Sunday that the 800-acre blaze was 60% contained and
more than 150 homes had been evacuated. No injuries were reported, and
residents are expected to be able to return home today.</TE>
<TE>   Here, a short drive from the picturesque Valley of Fires, people are
used to the ferocious ways of wildfires. Residents were evacuated two
years ago during the devastating Cree Fire. They watched last summer as
the West was engulfed in the worst fire season on record.</TE>
<TE>   They drill, they pack bags with precious keepsakes, and they work to
maintain a fire perimeter around their homes. Still, Saturday's blaze
raced up a hill almost before anyone knew it.</TE>
<TE>   However small it began, the fire was rapidly fanned by 60 mph winds.
Propelled by the hot and gusting winds, the flames blew quickly into four
subdivisions.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Brown was napping on her couch Saturday, hung over after
coming home late Friday after celebrating her daughter's 21st birthday. A
friend called to say evacuations were ordered. Brown tried to open her
front door, but the force of the wind prevented her. It already was
peeling the siding off her house.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Brown had been evacuated three other times, in her cloudy
mind, all she could think of was getting out of her pajamas and taking a
bath.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have no common sense at times like that," Brown said Sunday,
her feet still tucked into fuzzy black house slippers. "I know all about
packing a bag and saving pictures. I didn't. My daughter and I got in the
car and got out. I was so worried that my neighbors weren't home--they
have a car in the house and a dog tied up. But we couldn't get to them.
It's just devastating to drive through all that."</TE>
<TE>   The fire's caprice was evident by Sunday morning. A perfectly
preserved home stood next to a charred lot. To some witnesses, the fire
seemed to dance violently up and down pine trees. In many places,
homeowners' diligence paid off; brush clearing and even ditch digging
saved many homes in the middle of the conflagration.</TE>
<TE>   The subdivisions are populated with a mix of retirees, Texans with
second homes and hardscrabble full-time residents. Locals appeared to be
hardest hit.</TE>
<TE>   Ludwig, who lives in an upscale development of million-dollar-plus
homes, watched the fire's path as she fled.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen anything move so fast," she said. "I was trying to
get to a friend's house to get their dogs. I was driving along and,
suddenly, a house just exploded. I just had to get out."</TE>
<TE>   Like most evacuees, the Ludwigs are staying with local residents who
showed up the Red Cross office Saturday offering help. Ludwig gestured
around the table--a modest dinner hosted at the local country club, with
two earnest guitarists playing country songs--and pointed out her new
housemates. The three couples were staying at a house whose owners were
out of town and had called authorities offering it to evacuees.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, we're all getting along just fine," Ludwig said. "We have five
dogs and two cats. They're getting along too. . . . It's pretty wonderful
that people are doing this. It's what this community is about."</TE>
<TE>   In a hotel across town, Judy and Richard Shuffleton were likewise
praising the town. The Shuffletons retired here 1 1/2 years ago and
lovingly built their home, finishing the last addition Saturday. The
carpet was to be laid today.</TE>
<TE>   The only thing left of their home is ash.</TE>
<TE>   "We will rebuild, oh yes," she said. "We love it here. Our view is
lovely. The people are nice--the whole town is behind you. We're meeting
with our insurance adjuster Monday."</TE>

<HD>Bill Would Boost Md. Wiretaps</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maryland lawmakers are preparing to pass anti-terrorism legislation
today that would dramatically expand the ability of police to tap phones
and eavesdrop on the e-mail and Internet activity of suspected
criminals--part of a deluge of terror-busting measures under
consideration in nearly every state.</LD>
<LD>   The Maryland bill, like those in dozens of other states, has inspired
a heated clash between civil libertarians and those who believe that some
rights must be compromised to prevent another attack on U.S. soil.</LD>
<LD>   Each time that conflict surfaced last week, as Maryland delegates met
in committee to craft the legislation, concerns about security ultimately
outweighed fears about the potential for police abuse.</LD>
<TE>   "I realize that this bill basically says you can tap someone's phone
for jaywalking, and normally I would say, 'No way,' " said Del. Dana Lee
Dembrow (D-Montgomery). "But after what happened on Sept. 11 . . . ."</TE>
<TE>   Although some of the 1,200 anti-terrorism measures being contemplated
by state legislatures this year have involved such benign security
methods as requiring fencing around reservoirs, others will substantially
broaden the scope of police rights to probe into private lives.</TE>
<TE>   "State legislatures are in the process of recalibrating the
appropriate balance between liberty and security in the post-Sept. 11th
world," said Michael Mello, a Vermont Law School professor who recently
testified on an anti-terrorism bill before the state Legislature.</TE>
<TE>   Most of what is occurring, Mello said, involves a localized
repackaging of federal anti-terrorism laws, passed by Congress in October
as the USA Patriot Act.</TE>
<TE>   Like the Patriot Act, proposals in Maryland permit law enforcement
officials to get court orders to retrieve records of e-mails and other
electronic communications, not just telephone records.</TE>
<TE>   Maryland's proposal would expand the ability of police to tap phones
by allowing investigators to plant a listening device indefinitely, not
just for 30 days. It would, for the first time, permit use of a "roving
wiretap" to record a suspect's conversations on multiple phones with a
single warrant.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would tighten airport security and widen the purview of state
transit police to cover more areas around harbors and airports. It would
define terrorism as a specific crime for the first time and attach to it
severe penalties.</TE>

<HD>Anger Over Sex Abuse Emerges on Holy Day</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Allegations against priests cloud Palm Sunday at Roman
Catholic churches.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH GETLIN</AU>
<AU>FAYE FIORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Church officials and parishioners from coast to coast spoke out
angrily Sunday against the growing scandal over sexual abuse by priests,
as American Catholics gathered for services observing the most solemn
week on the Christian calendar.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks of staunchly defending the Roman Catholic Church, and in
some cases declining to comment on the volatile issue, many clergy used
the themes of Palm Sunday--faith, suffering and redemption--to try to
rekindle public trust in their handling of the damaging allegations.</LD>
<LD>   In his homily, New York Cardinal Edward Egan sought to dampen
increasing criticism over his policy of reporting abuse allegations to
police only when church officials believe such action is warranted.
Speaking before a crowded sanctuary at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Egan said
he was taking steps for "this evil to be stamped out" by urging church
members to report abuse to authorities.</LD>
<TE>   "It is a time of great suffering for the church," Egan said. "The cry
that comes from all of our hearts is that we never want to even think
that such a horror may be visited upon any of our young people, their
parents or loved ones."</TE>
<TE>   Many parishioners welcomed the comments by Egan, whose archdiocese
includes about 2.4 million Catholics in New York, but criticized him for
not wavering from his policy. Others spoke uneasily about allegations
that Egan, while he was a bishop in Bridgeport, Conn., had allowed
priests suspected of abuse to continue working with the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm glad he's speaking out, but it doesn't go far enough," said Julie
Bennett, a New York parishioner, as she left the cathedral. "The church
has to play a more active role if it suspects that children are being
abused. It can't just keep things quiet."</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, parishioners gave a standing ovation to Father Percival
L. D'Silva, at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, when he called
for the resignation of Boston Cardinal Bernard Law. D'Silva, who made his
comments during a lengthy Palm Sunday sermon, is one of the most
prominent Catholic officials to demand such action in the archdiocese
where the national scandal over sexual abuse came to light.</TE>
<TE>   Law has been criticized for his handling of the case involving John
Geoghan, who has been accused of molesting more than 130 people during
more than 30 years as a Massachusetts priest. As evidence grew against
Geoghan, Law and others did not dismiss him but instead shifted him from
parish to parish. Since the stories about Geoghan became public, the
Boston Archdiocese has turned over the names of more than 80 other
priests suspected of sexual abuse over the last 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   As evening Mass began, D'Silva, a small man with a salt-and-pepper
beard who has been a priest for 38 years, took a moment in the rectory
sitting room to discuss his call for Law's resignation.</TE>
<TE>   He said Washington Cardinal Theodore McCarrick had distributed a
statement for parish priests to read Sunday, reiterating the church's
guidelines against such crimes and vowing support for the families. After
reading those remarks, D'Silva went a step further, a move he had not
discussed even with his pastor. He spoke without notes, which he
considers an impediment when addressing his congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm mad, angry, depressed, frustrated. I feel betrayed," he said in
an interview. "It has hurt everybody. It has hurt me too.</TE>
<TE>   "Listen, I love the church," he continued. "I told the people this
will pass. A Christian is a fighter. He or she might fall down, but they
will get up again. . . . This is a moment to take a good hard look into
our lives."</TE>
<TE>   D'Silva said he decided to speak out because "the law has been
broken." Asked whether he feared repercussions from a church hierarchy
that does not always countenance outspokenness, the 65-year-old priest
replied: "The truth will set me free."</TE>
<TE>   Some parishioners applauded his comments. "There is no excuse over the
past 20 years for a priest [accused of sex abuse] to be reassigned," said
Carolyn Lynch, 44, a former prosecutor who handled sex abuse cases and
works part time at the National Cathedral in Washington. "Father D'Silva
is very well respected and I think it was a pretty brave thing for him to
do."</TE>
<TE>   While Law did not address the issue in his Sunday homily, Father
Raymond Mann, speaking to parishioners at St. Anthony Shrine in Boston,
said, "Not much can shock us in today's world, but in the past weeks
we've seen things, heard things and read things that we would never have
dreamed of."</TE>
<TE>   It was an uneasy Sunday, as Catholics continued their six-week
celebration of Lent, which encompasses the story of Jesus Christ's
crucifixion and resurrection. Even as they deplored the growing number of
abuse allegations, many prominent church officials insisted that the
charges focus on a relatively small number of priests and that the
actions of a few should not be permitted to besmirch the reputation of
the entire Roman Catholic faith.</TE>
<TE>   Church defenders note, for example, that dozens of priests have been
suspended or forced to quit their posts, out of an estimated 47,000
priests nationwide. Still, the scandal has clearly taken a toll on public
opinion, as media reports surface every day.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's New York Daily News found that 89% of those Catholics polled
believe the church should report all abuse allegations immediately. The
survey also found that 53% disapprove of Egan's leadership on the issue,
and 68% criticized the church's overall response to the problem. Only 8%,
however, said they had personal knowledge of sexually abusive behavior by
priests. The poll, by Blum &amp; Weprin Associates, included 502 Catholics in
all five of the city's boroughs.</TE>
<TE>   "For American Catholics, this Lent has surely been an emptying and
humbling experience," said Denver Archbishop Charles Caput in a letter

<HD>Binge Drinking at College Campuses Persists, Study Says</HD>
<DH>Health: Efforts to discourage the practice have had little effect.
It is becoming more prevalent at women's schools.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STUART SILVERSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite increased efforts to curb binge drinking on U.S. college
campuses, the percentage of students who indulge in the practice remains
nearly unchanged at 44.4%, a 2001 survey shows.</LD>
<LD>   But college drinking patterns are changing, according to the study by
researchers at Harvard University's School of Public Health. For example,
binge drinking has fallen among fraternity and sorority house residents
but has risen on women's college campuses.</LD>
<LD>   "The drinking style on campus is still one of excess," said Henry
Wechsler, the principal investigator for the survey and director of
college alcohol studies at Harvard. "It's a stubborn, deeply entrenched
behavior."</LD>
<TE>   The survey defined binge drinkers as men who had five or more drinks,
and women who had four or more drinks, at least once in the two weeks
before the survey. Frequent binge drinkers were those who consumed those
amounts at least three times in the previous two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Wechsler, who has surveyed on-campus binge drinking four times since
1993, called on colleges, universities and communities to take aggressive
steps to limit students' access to alcohol. The efforts so far largely
have involved educational programs or advertising designed to motivate
students to change their drinking habits, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Decreasing the availability of alcohol to underage drinkers, limiting
the heavy marketing and promotion of alcoholic beverages to college
students . . . and raising the price of alcohol may be ways to impact
this serious problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the new survey, binge drinking among students at women's
colleges has risen steadily from 24.5% in 1993 to 32.1% last year.
Wechsler was at a loss to explain the increase, but noted that students
at women's schools still report lower rates of binge drinking than women
at coed schools.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, binge drinking declined among students living in
fraternity and sorority houses from 83.4% in 1993 to 75.4% in 2001. Even
so, Wechsler said, fraternity and sorority houses remain a bastion of
binge drinking.</TE>
<TE>   The survey showed other seemingly contradictory trends. For instance,
the percentage of students who say they abstain from drinking has risen
from 16.4% to 19.3% over the eight years that the survey has been
conducted. At the same time, the share of students who are frequent binge
drinkers has risen from 19.7% to 22.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the percentage of college binge drinkers has hovered around
44% since 1993 despite reported declines in high school binge drinking
and a rise in students living in so-called substance-free dormitories.</TE>
<TE>   The survey, taken from February through April, was based on the
replies of more than 10,000 full-time undergraduate students at 119
four-year U.S. colleges.</TE>
<TE>   Although some college officials have questioned whether consuming four
or five drinks should be considered binge drinking, Wechsler defended
that standard. He said that level of consumption is linked to a wide
variety of drinking-related problems, including involvement in vandalism
and fighting, as well as drunken driving, unprotected sex and sexual
assaults.</TE>

<HD>Coffee-Hypertension Link Insignificant, Study Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO
</DL>
<LD>Reporting on a study that spanned three decades, researchers said
Sunday that drinking an average of two cups of coffee per day is not
likely to play a significant role in causing high blood pressure.</LD>
<LD>   "Over many years of follow-up, coffee drinking is associated with
small increases in blood pressure but appears to play a small role in the
development of hypertension," said the report from Johns Hopkins
University.</LD>
<LD>   The findings were based on a look at more than 1,000 white males who
graduated from medical school at the Baltimore institution from 1948 to
1964. Of those studied, 87% were coffee drinkers; the median amount of
coffee consumed was two cups per day.</LD>
<TE>   Their coffee intake was checked an average of 11 times over 33 years
to determine if any increases in blood pressure associated with coffee
consumption translated into hypertension.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of the study said a link between drinking coffee and an
increase in blood pressure has been postulated for at least 60 years, but
no studies have been conducted to prove a cause-and-effect link.</TE>
<TE>   "Long-term coffee drinking did not substantially increase the risk of
hypertension," concluded the report appearing in the Archives of Internal
Medicine, published by the American Medical Assn.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Two Senate Republicans pledged to seek $500 million more in federal
money to fight AIDS overseas.</LD>
<LD>   Sens. Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Bill Frist of Tennessee said
Sunday that they want to add the money to the Bush administration's
spending request to pay for the war on terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The increase would be earmarked to make treatment available for every
HIV-positive pregnant woman, said Helms, ranking member on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee.</LD>
<TE>   "There is no reason why we cannot eliminate . . . mother-to-child
transmission of AIDS--just as polio was . . . 40 years ago," Helms said
in a Sunday editorial in the Washington Post.</TE>
<TE>   Helms was especially concerned about the AIDS epidemic in Africa,
citing estimates that more than 2 million pregnant women in sub-Saharan
Africa have HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly one-third of those women will pass the virus to their babies,
he said.</TE>
<TE>   The senators pushed a similar proposal two years ago that called for
$600 million for AIDS prevention and treatment, and the care of AIDS
orphans in developing countries.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, Helms has clashed with gay activists over statements he
made blaming the spread of the disease on homosexuals.</TE>

<HD>Police Detect Drugs in Ex-D.C. Mayor's Car</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>U.S. Park Police, using a preliminary field test, found apparent
traces of marijuana and cocaine in former District of Columbia Mayor
Marion Barry's car while he was parked in a remote part of southwest
Washington, authorities said this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   No arrest was made in the incident, which began about 9 p.m. Thursday
as Barry sat in a Jaguar, which he told police was his. The amounts of
drugs allegedly detected in a police field test were described as too
small to support a prosecution.</LD>
<LD>   Barry's attorney, Fred Cooke Jr., said Saturday night that Barry
"denies being in the possession of any illegal drugs."</LD>
<TE>   He said Barry--who could not be reached for comment--consented to the
search because "he didn't have anything to hide." Cooke said that, in
Barry's view, the search confirmed that nothing illegal was found.</TE>
<TE>   Cooke also said that many things yield a positive result in the field
test for drugs, which is why it is generally only a precursor to
laboratory testing. For example, residue picked up on shoes could adhere
to the floor of a car, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Barry, 66, was convicted of a misdemeanor count of cocaine possession
after being arrested in 1990 in a downtown Washington hotel. He
subsequently has said on many occasions that he is drug- and
alcohol-free, and he recently announced that he would seek to return to
public life by running for an at-large council seat this year.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Scott Fear, a Park Police spokesman, said the Thursday encounter
began when an officer responded to a call about a suspicious vehicle in a
no-parking zone.</TE>
<TE>   After the officer walked toward the parked car, he saw that the
occupant appeared to be "ingesting something," Fear said.</TE>
<TE>   The officer noticed a "powdery substance" under Barry's nose,
according to Fear's account. A supervisor was notified, and police asked
that a dog trained to detect drugs be brought to the scene.</TE>
<TE>   He said that the dog "alerted," or "hit positive," on something in the
car, indicating that it had probably detected illicit materials.</TE>
<TE>   A field test was done on the interior of the car, and it indicated
positive for "residues" of marijuana and cocaine, Fear said.</TE>
<TE>   The exact amount of suspect materials was not specified. But Fear said
it was deemed so small that police did not make an arrest.</TE>
<TE>   No test was made of the powder reportedly observed under Barry's nose,
Fear said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that the procedures followed by police in the incident would
have been used in an encounter with any other person.</TE>
<TE>   In announcing March 6 that he planned to run for the D.C. Council,
Barry said he hoped to return to "my calling" of public office.</TE>

<HD>In S. Dakota, a Hot Seat for Senate</HD>
<DH>Politics: Big names and TV ads flood the sparse state seeking the
key to congressional control.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SIOUX FALLS, S.D.
</DL>
<LD>States don't get much more barren or remote than South Dakota.
Cattle outnumber people. Its capital is so isolated that no interstate
highway goes there.</LD>
<LD>   Yet sleepy South Dakota finds itself thrust squarely onto the front
lines of this year's clash for control of the Senate. Indeed, as both
national parties marshal forces here, the state's Senate race has emerged
as perhaps the fiercest battle in the 2002 campaign.</LD>
<LD>   Some analysts predict more money will be spent per vote in South
Dakota than on any Senate campaign ever. And with election day still more
than seven months away, many voters already are combat weary.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to be a long year," said Harley Christensen, a retiree in
the farm community of Viborg.</TE>
<TE>   The designated political gladiators are Sen. Tim Johnson, the Democrat
seeking reelection, and Rep. John R. Thune, the Republican trying to
unseat him.</TE>
<TE>   But the combatants are being egged on by the nation's top leaders:
President Bush, who recruited Thune to run, and Senate Majority Leader
Tom Daschle, the state's senior senator, who has made reelection of his
Democratic colleague a priority.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are as vast as the state's sprawling farmland. The outcome
could determine not only which party controls the Senate but also what
Congress does with Bush's agenda and whether Daschle remains majority
leader.</TE>
<TE>   All of this has brought big names to small towns. Bush's chief
political advisor, Karl Rove, and several other top administration
officials have stumped for Thune. Daschle is practically Johnson's
running mate--a view crystallized when Mary Niedringhaus, a local
supporter, introduced Johnson at a recent campaign event: "We can win
with Tom and Tim!"</TE>
<TE>   The contest also offers one of the last glimpses of a campaign finance
system that ends after 2002 as a result of the reform bill that cleared
Congress last week. The measure, which Bush has pledged to sign,
abolishes "soft money": unlimited donations to national parties. These
funds have helped finance the early, intensive ad war here.</TE>
<TE>   But South Dakota provides a lesson in the limits of the impending
campaign law.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the advertising that has clogged the airwaves here--and
irritated voters--would not be prohibited. The ads crackling across
television sets have been paid for not just by the parties but also by
outside interest groups. Such ads would be limited, but not ended, by the
campaign finance measure.</TE>
<TE>   There still would be no limit to what TV stations can charge for ads
and, more important, what campaigns can spend. Higher levels of so-called
"hard money" donations could be collected, and there would be no public
financing of campaigns.</TE>
<TE>   Although the national stakes in South Dakota are sky high, the local
dynamics are remarkably parochial. South Dakotans seem to want their
candidates to talk more about preserving meatpacking plants and
controlling prairie dogs than about political ideology. And they don't
need ads to be introduced to the candidates, whom many know on a
first-name basis.</TE>
<TE>   One risk to both sides is that if the disparity between local concerns
and national themes is too great, voters will feel alienated from the
whole process. The deluge of advertising, most of which has focused on
national issues, has already caused at least a few South Dakotans to tune
out.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife says she is never going to vote again," said Phil Olsen, a
retired construction worker from Centerville.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to her local newspaper, Barbara J. Peterson of Sioux Falls
wrote: "Since the Winter Olympics are over, one of my friends has decided
to put her television in a closet until after election day."</TE>
<TE>   Politics is personal in South Dakota because the electorate is so
small. With a population of only 750,000, South Dakota has 33.2 million
fewer residents than California--spread over 75,952 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   One reason the political air war is raging is that it is so cheap to
advertise here. Running an ad statewide for a week costs about $80,000 in
South Dakota; in Los Angeles, it costs about $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate battle has national import because Democrats control the
chamber by only one seat. If the Senate flips Republican--and the GOP
retains its House majority--it would be far easier for Bush to guide his
agenda through Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle also would be demoted to Senate minority leader--and lose a
big chunk of the power that has positioned him as a possible presidential
candidate in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans see Johnson, a freshman, as a top target because this
heavily Republican state elected him in 1996 with only 51% of the vote.
And Thune is a strong challenger; as the state's sole House member, he is
well known statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson is trying to focus voters on one key question: Who can deliver
for South Dakota? He touts his position on the money-dispensing
Appropriations Committee, and his ads spotlight constituent service and
the project funding he has brought home.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of clout counts for a lot in a state such as South Dakota,
where people fear their interests will be swamped in Washington by
California and other more populous states. Politics in such a small state
is also about personality, and even Johnson supporters concede that Thune
is helped by his lanky good looks and smooth style.</TE>
<TE>   "Thune has the Reagan image," said Tom Lemonds, a Johnson supporter
from Brandon.</TE>
<TE>   Thune is trying to portray Johnson as out of touch with the state. GOP
ads criticize the incumbent for opposing Bush's recent economic stimulus
plan and the administration's missile defense plan.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats respond that Johnson was one of 12 Democrats in the Senate
to support Bush's big tax cut last year. And when his credentials as a
supporter of the military are questioned, they note that his son is in
the armed forces in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates agree on one thing: They don't think their race should
be viewed as a proxy war between Daschle and Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to Tim Johnson and John Thune, and our ability to
reflect the interests and values of the state," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Thune, however, might not even be running for the Senate if not for
Bush. He had been expected to run for governor but Bush urged him to take
on the Senate race instead, wooing him over dinner at the White House
last year.</TE>
<TE>   After Thune agreed, Rove came here for a fund-raiser. Others who have
trekked to the state for him include Commerce Secretary Don Evans and
Education Secretary Rod Paige. Thune expects Bush himself to visit at
least once before election day, and he emphasizes the importance of
having a South Dakotan in the Senate who is on the president's good side.</TE>
<TE>   "The ability of the president to advance his agenda is going to depend
on his having a Congress willing to work with him and not against him,"
Thune told supporters at a recent luncheon in Vermillion, Johnson's
hometown.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, meanwhile, makes much of his ties to Daschle. The two joined
forces for a four-day campaign tour last month. Johnson argues that
together they give the state clout in Congress it has never had.</TE>
<TE>   "With Tom as majority leader and my seat on the Appropriations
Committee, it gives us an opportunity to do some things we were never
able to do before," Johnson told a crowd at a pancake breakfast in
Brandon.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans are trying to turn Johnson's association with Daschle
into a liability. They see Daschle's new role as Bush's No. 1 Democratic
opponent as potentially perilous in a state where the president is hugely
popular.</TE>
<TE>   Daschle is not up for reelection until 2004, but he has been targeted
in some of the ubiquitous television ads. One was financed by the
conservative Club for Growth, whose president, Steve Moore, acknowledged
that part of his aim is to inflict collateral damage on Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "The best way to hurt Tom Daschle politically this year is to help
elect John Thune," Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear that this tactic will work, because Daschle remains
immensely popular back home. Thune is careful to avoid criticizing him,
and his ads underscore his ability to work with Daschle.</TE>
<TE>   With many voters irritated by the ad barrage, Thune has urged Johnson
to accept a ban on advertising by outside groups. The idea foundered, in
part, on Johnson's insistence that the ban also apply to ads against
Daschle.</TE>
<TE>   Thune has asked outside groups who support him to refrain from
advertising on his behalf. But few think the request will be honored.</TE>
<TE>   Said Moore, "There's no way you are going to stop outside money from
coming into that state."</TE>
<TE>   Even if the much-touted campaign finance bill were in effect today,
analysts say, the scene in South Dakota might not look much different.
Aside from the efforts of outside interest groups, many of the current
ads are paid for by the candidates and would be unaffected by the
measure's ban on soft money donations to the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the law's ban on ads by outside interests 30 days before a
primary and 60 days before the general election would have no effect at
this stage of the South Dakota race. And the law may enhance rather than
inhibit the role of groups such as Club for Growth: People who might have
given soft money to the political parties may give instead to such
groups.</TE>
<TE>   "If there is a supply of soft dollars, [groups] are going to find a
way to spend it," said Moore. "This bill doesn't plug that leak."</TE>

<HD>Mideast Truce Effort Bruised</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: With little progress to show, security officials and
Zinni are to meet again today. Sharon threatens to prevent Arafat from
attending Arab summit.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>U.S. efforts to broker a Mideast cease-fire ahead of a key Arab
summit suffered multiple blows Sunday as the latest round of negotiations
failed to produce an agreement to halt 18 months of bloodshed.</LD>
<LD>   Vice President Dick Cheney said he has no plans to return to the
region for talks with Yasser Arafat, and Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon threatened to prevent the Palestinian Authority president from
traveling to the Arab League summit in Beirut this week.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, violence continued Sunday, as two groups of Palestinian
gunmen apparently infiltrated Israel from Jordan. By midnight, Israeli
forces had killed nine Palestinians, and Palestinian gunmen had killed
two Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   Sunday night's meeting of Israeli and Palestinian security officials
with U.S. special envoy Anthony C. Zinni as referee had been seen as a
make-or-break attempt to reach a cease-fire declaration. It was the
fourth meeting in less than a week. The two sides reportedly remained far
apart but agreed to study a "bridging proposal" presented by Zinni that
was meant to narrow differences.</TE>
<TE>   If Zinni's cease-fire efforts collapse completely, the consequences
could be dire. Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, chief of staff of the Israeli army,
told an interviewer this month that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will
drag on "for months or longer."</TE>
<TE>   Participants in Sunday's meeting, including Arafat's security chief
for the Gaza Strip and the head of Israel's domestic security service,
emerged from the 3 1/2-hour session near Tel Aviv with nothing to
announce. Officials said another meeting was scheduled for today.</TE>
<TE>   Both Cheney and Sharon said a truce had to be in place before they
would make what they saw as concessions to Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon said Arafat's ability to travel to the Beirut summit will
depend on whether he can force Palestinian militants to refrain from
attacking Israelis. Sharon, speaking in a weekly Cabinet session, added
that he has seen no signs of that yet.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials have asked Sharon to let Arafat go to the meeting,
where the 22 members of the Arab League are expected to debate the
outlines of a peace plan sponsored by Saudi Arabia that has stirred
considerable interest among diplomats desperate to contain the
blood-soaked Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Arafat "will not leave Ramallah as long as he does not act against the
terror," Sharon told his Cabinet. Ramallah is in the West Bank and is
where Arafat has been virtually trapped by Israeli forces for nearly four
months.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon has also said that if he lets Arafat go to Beirut, he may not
allow him to return to the West Bank, especially if violence continues at
home and Arafat uses the summit to stir up anti-Israeli sentiment. In
Sunday's Cabinet session, Sharon disputed comments from his defense
minister, who said violence actually has declined. The minister, Binyamin
Ben-Eliezer, and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres are among those who argue
that Arafat should be allowed to travel to Beirut.</TE>
<TE>   A final decision will be made Tuesday or Wednesday, at the very last
minute, aides to Sharon said.</TE>
<TE>   "Israel wants to dictate its conditions to us, but they should know
very well that this blackmail will not have any effect on our political
decisions," Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney, meanwhile, said in Washington that he has "no immediate plans"
to see Arafat. The vice president, touring the Middle East earlier this
month, had held out the possibility of meeting Arafat in Egypt as a
reward to the Palestinians for executing a cease-fire agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Although Cheney did not rule out a future trip, he said it was
particularly "unlikely" that he would fly to the region before
Wednesday's opening of the Arab League summit.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, conditions on the ground have not warranted my going forward
with the meeting," Cheney said on NBC's "Meet the Press," referring to
Arafat's failure to clamp down on Palestinian militants or meet other
U.S. terms.</TE>
<TE>   It would take an eleventh-hour breakthrough by Zinni, a retired Marine
Corps general, for the White House to rethink its position about sending
Cheney back, U.S. officials added Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said Sunday that the United States
had informed Arafat on Friday that a meeting was not going to happen in
"the next several days," a further indication that no such breakthrough
is expected.</TE>
<TE>   Zinni has been working toward implementation of a truce accord
negotiated last year by CIA Director George J. Tenet but never enacted.
Israelis and Palestinians disagree over who should do what and when, and
how long each phase should take. Zinni offered a compromise Sunday night,
one participant said.</TE>
<TE>   "We were given an American compromise document," Mohammed Dahlan, the
ranking security chief in the Gaza Strip, told reporters after the
meeting. "We will study it and give our response to it in a meeting that
will be held Monday. The Israelis were also given that same document."</TE>
<TE>   In Sunday's Cabinet meeting, Sharon said Arafat had made no effort to
stop violence that has raged unabated. But Ben-Eliezer disagreed, noting
that the violence has ebbed slightly. In addition, Arafat has been
meeting with leaders of numerous Palestinian factions since Thursday to
tell them to curtail armed operations, according to participants.</TE>
<TE>   Whether it has lessened or not, violence continued Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said Jordanian authorities detected a group of
Palestinian gunmen attempting to cross into Israel. The Jordanians shot
and killed two, but the others breached a fence and entered Israel.
Troopers from Israel's elite Egoz unit tracked their footprints across
the Galilee region and found the men resting under a eucalyptus tree.</TE>
<TE>   "One of them noticed us, so we opened fire," said 1st Lt. Shani Hajbi,
"and in the first round of fire, they were all killed."</TE>
<TE>   The gunmen were armed with Kalashnikovs, the army said, adding that
they were probably going to attack a kibbutz on the eastern shores of the
Sea of Galilee. Thousands of Israelis are flocking to the Galilee region
for Passover vacation, which began this week. The kibbutz that
authorities believed was the target was evacuated, and field trips
throughout the verdant region were canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Hours later, the army reported an infiltration around a settlement in
the Jordan Valley that had come under attack in February.</TE>
<TE>   Early Sunday, a 23-year-old Jewish settler traveling from her home to
a settlement where she taught kindergarten was killed by fire from a
passing car. The gunman fired on the armored bus in which Esther Kleinman
was riding. The bullet apparently pierced a vulnerable portion of the
windshield and struck her.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli soldiers scouring Palestinian villages in the area in search
of suspects killed a Palestinian police officer. Later, in the Gaza
Strip, Israeli soldiers shot and killed a Palestinian farmer because he
got too close to a road used by settlers; the man was not armed. After
nightfall, Israeli soldiers also shot dead three Palestinian gunmen who
the army said were trying to penetrate a settlement in Gaza. They were
later identified by Palestinians as members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs
Brigade, a militia linked to Arafat's Fatah movement.</TE>
<TE>   And after 10 p.m., an Israeli driving near a settlement in the Hebron
area of the West Bank south of Jerusalem was killed by a sniper.</TE>

<HD>Sex Abuse by Clerics--a Crisis of Many Faiths</HD>
<DH>Religion: While sexual misconduct has rocked denominations far and
wide, some acted much faster than others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wave of clergy sex scandals now engulfing the Roman Catholic
Church has battered other denominations as well, producing an uneven
record of response that ranges from the Episcopal Church's aggressive and
detailed policies to the Southern Baptist Convention's widespread lack of
written standards.</LD>
<LD>   In the last decade, clergy sexual misconduct has been exposed in
virtually every faith tradition. National studies have shown no
differences in its frequency by denomination, region, theology or
institutional structure.</LD>
<LD>   Mainline Protestant denominations have generally taken the earliest
and most aggressive measures against clergy abuse and fundamentalist
churches the least, according to Gary Schoener, a Minneapolis
psychotherapist who has handled more than 2,000 cases of clergy sexual
abuse over the past 10 years. Rabbis began working on their policies more
recently.</LD>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic response has varied dramatically, in part because
each of the 195 American dioceses operates independently. One of the
first to take action was the Seattle Archdiocese, which in the early
1980s began exposing the problems and commissioning training materials.
By contrast, as recently as January, church officials in Boston were
accused of having routinely assigned as many as 80 priests suspected of
molesting minors to different churches. It was the Boston cases that
sparked the current national furor over priestly sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In faith after faith, the problem of clergy misconduct was exposed
during the past 10 to 15 years because victims began stepping forward,
plaintiffs began winning large awards and insurers began demanding
policies to prevent abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Victims found their voices, and when they couldn't find justice in
the church, they looked for alternatives in the legal system and started
to sue," said Elizabeth Stellas, an expert on clergy misconduct who
helped pioneer programs on it with the inter-religious Center for the
Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Among Protestants, the landmark case involved a woman who accused the
Episcopal Diocese and the presiding bishop in Colorado of covering up the
sexual misconduct of her priest. When the jury found the church liable
and ordered church leaders to pay her $1.2 million in 1991, "that changed
the Protestant game completely," Schoener said, "because it opened the
door for higher-ups to be responsible."</TE>
<TE>   Until then, he said, it had been thought nearly impossible to win
awards against Protestant regional and national bodies. That's because,
unlike the Catholic Church hierarchy, in which priests are assigned by
diocesan officials, most Protestant congregations, with the exception of
Methodists, hire their own pastors. Higher officials had been able to
argue that they were not liable for bad hiring decisions, and individual
congregations that were responsible often lacked the deep pockets to
warrant major judgments.</TE>
<TE>Insurers Influence Episcopal Response</TE>
<TE>   After the Colorado case, however, national Episcopal Church officials
were told by their insurers to develop policies on misconduct by
1993--and to complete initial training throughout the dioceses in a year,
according to the Rev. Beverly Factor, sexual misconduct officer for the
Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The training, which includes guidelines, videos and discussion on such
topics as who are abusers and how to maintain boundaries, is required for
all priests, along with staff and laity who work with youth.</TE>
<TE>   "Church insurance gave us that extra nudge and said we had to do
something because they wouldn't be able to sustain [these awards],"
Factor said.</TE>
<TE>   The Episcopal Church has what many experts regard as some of the
finest policies--and aggressive enforcement of them--among religious
institutions. One striking characteristic is openness. Diocesan officials
both inform the affected congregation of a priest's misconduct and list
the names of priests suspended or deposed in their annual yearbook. By
contrast, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has acknowledged
the dismissals of several priests for sexual abuse, but declines to
identify them or even say how many were involved.</TE>
<TE>Bishop's Reaction Was Swift, Decisive</TE>
<TE>   In the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, recently retired Bishop
Frederick H. Borsch said he recalled two cases of clergy abuse involving
minors during his tenure, which began in 1988 and ended in December.</TE>
<TE>   In one 1994 case involving a Palmdale priest and two teenage victims,
Borsch wrote a letter to the affected congregants informing them of the
problems within days of the priest's arrest, and eventually revoked his
ordination in orders known as deposition. Diocesan officials made both
documents available to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   National policies have also been adopted by most other mainline
Protestant denominations, including the Methodists, Presbyterians and
Lutherans. In Northern California, the United Methodist Church has asked
one its experts, Karen McClintock, to offer workshops on sexual
misconduct for clergy and laity this summer. The sessions are to be given
at 14 locations and delivered in 17 languages.</TE>
<TE>   McClintock and others argue that traditions that ordain women and
place them in positions of leadership have been more aggressive in
confronting the problems.</TE>
<TE>   "The movement of women into positions of leadership, and the general
change of culture that brought, has reshaped our thinking," agreed Rabbi
Sanford Ragins of Leo Baeck Temple in Los Angeles, who served as chairman
of the Reform rabbinate's ethics and appeals committee for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Ragins said the Central Conference of American Rabbis began addressing
the issue in the last five years, in part as a reaction to media reports
of six-figure legal judgments against the Episcopal and Catholic churches
for clergy misconduct cases. In 1998, the conference issued detailed new
guidelines on how to report, respond to, investigate and adjudicate
allegations of sexual misconduct. Suspension or expulsion of rabbis must
be reported in the conference newsletter, and offenders are barred from
using the rabbinical placement service to look for new jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Ragins, who headed the committee when Hebrew Union College president
Sheldon Zimmerman was ousted for sexual misconduct in 2000, said one or
two allegations surface a year. He said he never handled a case involving
misconduct with minors.</TE>
<TE>   The Conservative movement is currently working on policies, and the
Orthodox movement has been recently rocked by a case involving Baruch
Lanner, a nationally known youth official who was indicted last year in
New Jersey on charges of sexually abusing teens. The case was first
reported by the New York-based Jewish Week newspaper in stories that
detailed allegations by scores of teens of sexual, physical and
psychological torment. It has forced the resignation of the Orthodox
Union's top official and led to the development of new policies.</TE>
<TE>   At least one Jewish researcher says that sexual misconduct is still
routinely covered up by rabbis. Charlotte Rolnick Schwab, a New York
psychotherapist and author of a forthcoming book on rabbis and sex abuse,
said she has received hundreds of complaints from women across all
movements and still sees rabbis denying them publicly. Congregations
themselves sometimes exacerbate the problems, she said.</TE>
<TE>   In one recent case involving a Florida rabbi convicted of using the
Internet to find boys and sexually abuse them, congregant support
prompted the judge to sentence him to six years in prison instead of the
maximum 60 years, Schwab said. "It's outrageous."</TE>
<TE>   Similar charges have been leveled against the Southern Baptist
Convention, the largest of the Baptist bodies in the United States. Dee
Ann Miller, a victim's advocate and author of books about the topic, said
she had received complaints from victims in 30 states, half of them
involving minors. She said church officials have not been responsive.</TE>
<TE>   When she first told church officials about her own sexual assault by a
Southern Baptist missionary in Africa several years ago, Miller said, she
was told by two leaders that it was at least partly her fault.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1993 survey by the Journal of Pastoral Care, 14% of Southern
Baptist ministers surveyed said they had engaged in inappropriate sexual
behavior, 70% said they knew a minister who had and 80% said they lacked
written guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist ethics committee, said
the convention's churches are fully autonomous and probably did not adopt
written policies because it was obvious that sexual misconduct was wrong.
He said training about sexual misconduct is conducted at Southern Baptist
seminaries, which produce about half of the convention's clergy, and that
the cases he knows about led to swift removal or resignation of the
guilty party.</TE>
<TE>   "Most Baptist ministers know sexual misconduct is a career-ending
move," he said.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Living by New Rules</HD>
<DH>With attacks increasing and hitting closer to home, more residents
of the Jewish state are thinking twice before performing even routine
activities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PETAH TIKVA, Israel
</DL>
<LD>The rabbi at Irit Rahamim's wedding offered a special prayer.
Standing under the marriage canopy, he thanked God for allowing Rahamim
to live to see this day of celebration.</LD>
<LD>   Not 48 hours earlier, Rahamim and her friends were pinned under a
restaurant table as a Palestinian sprayed her bachelorette party with
bullets. Three people were killed before a police officer shot the gunman
dead.</LD>
<LD>   But life goes on.</LD>
<TE>   With extra security hired for the lavish affair, Rahamim, a dancer,
and Liron Bassis, a soccer star, were married while a who's who of
athletes, models and Israel's nouveaux riches sipped champagne, nibbled
stuffed mushrooms and watched an elaborate fireworks display at the Royal
Garden Banquet Hall.</TE>
<TE>   For Israelis trapped in some of the bloodiest days of their nation's
history, the routines of daily existence have become fraught with
uncertainty and risk. Many insist on putting on a brave face. Focusing on
routine is the way they preserve their sanity. So is remembering their
duty to survive and sustain the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Defiance, not surrender.</TE>
<TE>   Among a growing number, however, despair has replaced bravado.
Confronted by attacks that multiply, move closer and target the innocent
at their most unsuspecting moments, these Israelis are changing their
very way of life. They stay at home more, restrict their children, shun
public transportation, operate with fear.</TE>
<TE>   Existing in Israel has always been a contest between maintaining
normality and protecting oneself. The struggle has rarely been as
stressful as it is now.</TE>
<TE>   In a poll this month, 68% of respondents said they had reduced their
visits to crowded public places; 78% expressed fear that a family member
would be hurt in a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Kindergartens have armed guards. Jerusalem streets and coffeehouses
that once bustled are virtually deserted. The demand for guns in an
already well-armed society is up 75%. Same for tranquilizers.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in its 83-year history, the Israeli Scouts, the
largest secular youth group in the country, has canceled its annual
Passover hiking trips.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian militants in recent weeks have targeted the core rituals
of Jewish life--weddings, bar and bat mitzvahs--and attacked elite
neighborhoods and cafes that once seemed immune. A suicide bombing this
month at Cafe Moment, a trendy hangout in Jerusalem across the street
from the prime minister's official residence, was an especially
debilitating blow.</TE>
<TE>   Each new outburst of violence means adjustments. In a society already
obsessed with cellular telephones, family members check on one another
several times a day. Jittery waitresses at several Jerusalem cafes told
one newspaper that they have the speed dials on their cell phones
programmed with their mothers' numbers, so that they can call instantly
if something happens.</TE>
<TE>   In at least one cafe, the management has designated a safe room where
the staff can hide from a suicide bomber.</TE>
<TE>   Especially in Jerusalem, where most terrorist attacks have occurred,
Israelis think twice before going out at night, attending public events,
even buying groceries. It used to be the norm to allow children to get to
and from school on their own. That has changed.</TE>
<TE>   Donna Shalev, a classicist who lectures at Jerusalem's Hebrew
University, has reprogrammed every minute of her day to make sure that
her daughter, Ariela, is safe and to be able to finish chores that now
take more time.</TE>
<TE>   She takes her daughter to school, lingering every day just to be
certain. Then she catches a taxi to work and rushes back to the school in
the afternoon to fetch Ariela. No more buses. A good chunk of Shalev's
budget goes to cab fare.</TE>
<TE>   Shopping and recreation also are a challenge. You can't just go out.
You have to think about where to go and what route to take.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is a big production now," Shalev said. "It's hard enough
getting a 9-year-old off to school every morning. Now there's a lot more
planning, a lot of energy wasted. Everything takes longer."</TE>
<TE>   Trying to decide where to buy shoes the other day, Shalev ruled out a
downtown store near Jaffa Street, the site of half a dozen gun and bomb
attacks this year, then she eliminated the Talpiot area of strip malls
because bombs have gone off twice there. She rejected the big malls--too
obviously potential targets. Finally, she chose German Colony, a yuppie,
relatively unscathed section of town, and bought her shoes. Two days
later, an aspiring suicide bomber walked into one of German Colony's most
popular restaurants. He was thwarted by an alert waiter.</TE>
<TE>   Shalev, who was born in the United States and has lived in Israel for
17 years, said she and many other parents in Ariela's experimental school
refused to send their children on a recent field trip, rejecting the
principal's assurances that it would be safe.</TE>
<TE>   "The principal believes life should go on as normal. But at what
price? I'm not willing to pay that price," Shalev said. "I have to feel
I'm in control. I know I'm not, but I have to try."</TE>
<TE>   One mother of two put it this way: "My friends and I have the same
conversation 10 times a day. Where can we take our kids? Where is it
safe? The poor things haven't been to a mall or a park in ages. I won't
let mine go to story time unless there's a guard there."</TE>
<TE>   Schools, for their part, have canceled recesses so that students
aren't congregated in exposed playgrounds. Class hours have been
staggered at some schools so that large numbers of pupils aren't arriving
or leaving at the same time. At kindergartens, which are not
automatically entitled to city-provided guards because of their small
size, parents have been raising money to hire protection.</TE>
<TE>   One thing Shalev has not given up on, in what is a big risk in today's
climate: coffee shops. She stops off at the same Aroma coffee bar twice a
day, after dropping off Ariela and on the way to pick her up. The cafe is
on a congested downtown corner, near the school.</TE>
<TE>   After the March 9 attack at the Cafe Moment and the earlier, thwarted
attack in German Colony, numerous coffee bars felt threatened. At Aroma,
normally one of the most crowded spots in Jerusalem's cafe scene, the
managers had folded all the tables and chairs and switched to take-out
only.</TE>
<TE>   "If we let everybody sit here, there's more chance of something
happening," duty manager Hamid Rumman said, although he acknowledged that
most customers objected to the move.</TE>
<TE>   "You're letting terror win," they said. A week or so later, Aroma put
the tables out again.</TE>
<TE>   Malls and large supermarkets have had armed guards for a long time.
Now even the corner market is likely to be guarded. When people do go
out, they eye one another more nervously. Any Arabs are likely to receive
extra inspection.</TE>
<TE>   Moshe Rosenblum, chairman of the Israeli Malls Assn., said the number
of people going to shopping centers has dropped drastically, even though
security is tight. In the days after the Cafe Moment bombing, attendance
fell 50%, the largest decline yet, he said. Shoppers on those days were
people who had specific things to buy: They entered, purchased and left.</TE>
<TE>   Rafi Ozalbo is a driver for the national bus company. Like many in his
seen-it-all generation, he talks a tough game.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our country, and we cannot be afraid," he said. "Terrorism
can happen anywhere."</TE>
<TE>   But the more he talks, the more he reveals his unease. His route takes
him around the northwestern port city of Haifa. In December, a suicide
bomber boarded a bus in Haifa and blew himself up, killing 15 people.</TE>
<TE>   "I have an eye on everybody these days," Ozalbo said. "If someone
suspicious is at a stop, or someone I don't know, I don't stop the bus. I
won't let him on."</TE>
<TE>   Airlines have reported brisker than usual sales for the upcoming
Passover holidays, when students and many workers get at least a week of
vacation. More people apparently want to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Michal Kafra, who covers society for the newspaper Maariv, says
Israelis who try to maintain a semblance of normality are losing the
battle to inescapable reality. She calls the schizophrenic impulses
Israel's "split screen," alluding to a night not long ago when local
television split its screen to show the latest suicide bombing on one
side and a championship soccer match on the other.</TE>
<TE>   "We've divided the screen of our reality pretty easily, when half the
screen is blood and the other half the good life," she wrote. Now, "the
dividing line has disappeared. Our entire life depends on terrorist
attacks, all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Irit Rahamim said she never considered canceling her wedding after a
gunman burst into the Tel Aviv seafood restaurant where she and her
friends were having the bachelorette party. In those terrifying moments,
she called her fiance and said goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   The couple took special precautions for the wedding, however. Rahamim
had her bridal gown blessed against the evil eye. Bassis, the groom, laid
on the security: Men with Secret Service-style wires coming out of their
ears mingled with the guests. Guards searched women's evening bags at the
entrance, and men were asked to check their weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Carmit Nuna, Rahamim's best friend and a fellow dancer, came to the
wedding to perform as part of the entertainment. She too had survived the
shooting that night in Tel Aviv: She heard the pop of the first shot,
then someone pulled her to the floor. Moments later, the glass behind
where her head had been shattered into bits.</TE>
<TE>   Nuna said she was determined "to go on." But she was afraid.</TE>
<TE>   "I've stayed at home ever since it happened," she said. "I can't go
out. Every time I hear something, I think it's a gun."</TE>
<TE>   A self-described party animal, Nuna was sticking to the sidelines at
this party.</TE>
<TE>   Rahamim was determined to be happy.</TE>
<TE>   "God performed a great miracle for me by saving me and allowing me to
stand under the huppah," or wedding canopy, she said. "I feel sorry for
those killed and wounded, but I must rise up and go ahead with my
wedding, because God gave this to me."</TE>
